as he climbed the somewhat unsteady rollup stairs and ducked his head to get through the door of leaseaire laa boeing captain alex macilhenny who was fiftytwo ruddyfaced had a full head of just starting to gray red hair and was getting just a little jowly had sort of a premonition that something was wrongor that something bad was about to happenbut he wasnt prepared for the darkskinned man standing inside the fuselage against the far wall the man was holding an uzi submachine gun in both hands and it was aimed at macilhennys stomach oh shit macilhenny stopped and held both hands up palm outward at shoulder level get out of the door captain the man ordered gesturing with the uzis muzzle that he wanted macilhenny to enter the flight deck thats not an american accent or brit either and this guys skin is dark not black what is he portuguese maybe oh come on portuguese dont steal airplanes this guy is some kind of an arab the man holding the uzi was dressed almost exactly like macilhenny in dark trousers black shoes and an opencollared white shirt with epaulets there were wings pinned above one breast pocket and the epaulets held the fourgoldstripe shoulder boards of a captain he even had clipped to his other breast pocket the local transient air crew identification tag issued to flight crews who had passed through customs and would be around the airport for twentyfour hours or more macilhenny started to turn to go into the cockpit backwards the man ordered and stand there macilhenny complied we dont want anyone to see you with your hands up do we the man asked almost conversationally macilhenny nodded but didnt say anything something like this i suppose was bound to happen the thing to do is keep my cool do exactly what they tell me to do and nothing stupid your aircraft has been requisitioned the man said by the jihad legion what the hell is the jihad legion what does it matter some nutcake raghead arab outfit englishspeaking and clever enough to get dressed up in a pilots uniform is about to grab this airplane has grabbed this airplane and me macilhenny nodded didnt say anything for a moment but then took a chance i understand but if youre a someone behind him grabbed his hair and pulled his head back he started to strugglea reflex actionbut then saw out of the corner of his eye what looked like a fishfilleting knife then felt it against his adams apple and forced himself not to move jesus christ you will speak only with permission and you will seek that permission by raising your hand as a child does in school you understand macilhenny tried to nod but the way his head was being pulled back and with the knife at his throat he doubted the movement he was able to make was very visible he thought a moment and then raised his right hand slightly higher you may speak the man with the uzi said since you are a pilot why do you need me he asked the first answer should be selfevident so that you cannot report the requisitioning of your aircraft immediately additionally we would prefer that when the authorities start looking for the aircraft they first start looking for you and not us does that answer your question macilhenny nodded as well as he could and said yes sir what the hell are they going to do with this airplane are they going to fly it into the american embassy here with me in it in angola that doesnt make much sense its a small embassy and most people have never heard of angola much less know where it is whats within range south africa of course its about fifteen hundred miles to johannesburg and a little more to capetown wheres our embassy in south africa as you surmised i am a pilot qualified to fly this model boeing the man said as is the officer behind you therefore you are convenient for this operation but not essential at any suspicion that you are not doing exactly as you are told or are attempting in any way to interfere with this operation you will be eliminated do you understand macilhenny nodded again as well as he could and said yes sir the man said something in a foreign language that macilhenny did not understand the hand grasping his hair opened and he could hold his head erect you may lower your hands the man said and then conversationally added you seemed to be taking a long time in your preflight walkaround what was that all about macilhenny despite the heat felt a sudden chill and realized that he had been sweating profusely why not with an uzi pointing at your stomach and a knife against your throat what did you expect his mouth was dry and he had to gather saliva and wet his lips before he tried to speak i came here to make a test flight macilhenny began this aircraft has not flown in over a year i made what i call the macilhenny final test is that not the business of mechanics i am a mechanic you are a mechanic the man asked dubiously yes sir i hold both air frame and engine licenses i supervised getting this aircraft ready to fly signed off on the repairs and i was making the macilhenny test what test is that its not required its just something i do the airplane has been sitting here for more than twentyfour hours with a full load of fuel at takeoff weight youll understand i take a final look around if anything was leaking i would have seen it found out where it was coming from and fixed it before i tried to fly it the man with the uzi considered that and nodded it is unusual for a captain to also be a mechanic is it not yes sir i suppose it is and did you find anything wrong on this final test no sir i did not and what were you going to do next if your final test found nothing wrong ive arranged for a copilot sir as soon as he got here i was going to run up the engines a final time and then make a test flight your copilot is here the man said you may look into the passenger compartment macilhenny didnt move look into the fuselage captain the man with the uzi said sternly and something hard was rammed into the small of macilhennys back he winced with the pain that wasnt a knife and it certainly wasnt a hand maybe the other guys got an uzi too a gun anyway macilhenny stepped past the bulkhead and looked into the passenger compartment all but the first three rows of seats had been removed from the passenger compartment macilhenny had no idea when or why but when la had left philadelphia on a sixtyday cashupfront dry charter it had been in a full alleconomyclass passenger configurationthe way it had come from continental airlineswith seats for people leaseaire had been told it was to be used to haul people on everythingincluded excursions from scandinavia to the coast of spain and morocco macilhenny knew all this because he was leaseaires vice president for maintenance and flight operations the title sounded more grandioseon purposethan the size of the corporation really justified leaseaire had only two other officers the president and chief executive officer was macilhennys brotherinlaw terry halloran and the secretarytreasurer was maryelizabeth macilhenny halloran terrys wife and macilhennys sister leaseaire was in the used aircraft business dealing in aircraft the major airlines wanted to get rid of for any number of reasons most often because they were near the end of their operational life la for example had hauled passengers for continental for twentytwo years when leaseaire acquired an airplanetheir fleet had never exceeded four aircraft at one time they now owned two this and a lockheed theyd just bought from northwestthey stripped off the airline paint job reregistered it and painted on the new registration numbers then the aircraft was offered for sale if they couldnt find someone to buy it at a decent profit the plane was offered for charterwet with fuel and crew and leaseaire took care of routine maintenance or dry the lessee provided the crew and fuel and paid for routine maintenanceuntil it came close to either an annual or thousandhour inspection both of which were very expensive then the airplane was parked again at philadelphia and offered for sale at a really bargainbasement price if they couldnt sell it then it made a final flight to a small airfield in the arizona desert where it was cannibalized of salable parts leaseaire had been in business five years la was their twentyfirst airplane sometimes they made a ton of money on an airplane and sometimes they took a hell of a bath it seemed to vice president macilhenny they were going to take a hell of a bath on this one surf amp sun holidays ltd had telephoned ten days before their sixtyday charter contract was over asking for another thirty days check to follow immediately the check didnt come a cable did four days later saying la had had to make a precautionary landing at luanda angola where an inspection had revealed mechanical failures beyond those which they were obliged to repair under the original contract and further that inasmuch as the failures had occurred before the first contract had run its course surf amp sun holidays would not of course enter into an extension of the original charter contract in other words your airplane broke down in luanda angola sorry about that but its your problem not ours when terry who handled the business end of leaseaire had tried to call surf amp sun holidays ltd at their corporate headquarters in glasgow scotland to discuss the matter he was told the line was no longer in service on his first trip to luanda macilhenny had stopped in glasgow to deal with them personally there had been sheets of brown butcher paper covering the plateglass storefront windows of surf amp sun holidays ltds corporate headquarters with for rent lettered on them in magic marker in luanda he had quickly found what had failed on la control system hydraulics it was a safety of flight problem which meant macilhenny could not hire a local to sit in the right seat while he made a onetime flight to bring it home he had also found that most of the seats were missing partsfrom seats to hydraulicswere often readily available on the used parts market if you had the money leaseaire was experiencing a temporary cashflow problem terry had wanted to go after the surf amp sun bastards for stealing the seats and abandoning the aircraft make them at least make the repairs so macilhenny could go get the sonofabitch and bring it home macilhennys sister had sided with her husband the cashflow problem had lasted a lot longer than anyone expected and the price or the needed parts was a lot higher than macilhenny anticipated so thirteen months passed before he and four crates of parts finally managed to get back to luanda and he could put the sonofabitch together again as he took the few steps from the cockpit door to the passenger compartment macilhenny had an almost pleasant thought if these guys steal this airplane we can probably collect on the insurance and then he saw the local pilot who had come on board la expecting to pick up a quick five hundred dollars sitting in the right seat for an hour or so while macilhenny took the plane on a test hop he was sitting in the thirdnow lastrow right aisle seat his hands were in his lap tightly bound together with threeinchwide yellow plastic tape his ankles were similarly bound and there was tape over his eyes we will release him captain the first man with the uzi said when presuming you have cooperated we release you im going to do whatever you want me to do sir macilhenny said why dont we get going the man with the uzi said he stepped out of the aisle to permit macilhenny to walk past him macilhenny went into the cockpit and for the first time could see the second man i guess theres only two of them i didnt see anybody else back there the man now sitting in the copilots seat looked very much like the first man with the uzi and he was also wearing an opencollared white shirt with air crew shoulder boards the right ones too with the three stripes of a first officer formerly copilot the copilot gestured for macilhenny to take the pilots seat as he slipped into it macilhenny saw that the copilot had the checklist in his hand and that there were charts on the sort of shelf above the instrument panel macilhenny couldnt see enough of them to have any idea what they were and i cant even make a guess where were going macilhenny strapped himself into the seat and then feeling just a little foolish raised his right hand you have a question captain the man with the uzi asked am i going to fly or is this gentleman youll fly the man with the uzi said he will serve as copilot and you can think of me as your check pilot it was obvious he thought he was being amusing the man with the uzi unfolded the jump seat in the aisle into position sat down fastened his shoulder harness and rested the uzi on the back of macilhennys seat its muzzle about two inches from macilhennys ear the man in the copilots seat handed macilhenny the checklist a plasticcovered card about four inches wide and ten inches long macilhenny took it nodded his understanding and began to read from it gear lever and lights macilhenny read down and checked the copilot responded brakes macilhenny read parked the copilot responded circuit breakers check emergency lights armed there were thirtyfour items on the before start checklist macilhenny read each of them when he read number seat belt and no smoking signs the copilot chuckled before responding on when macilhenny read number voice recorder the copilot chuckled again and said i dont think were going to need that and when macilhenny read number radar and transponder the copilot responded were certainly not going to need that and the man with the uzi at macilhennys ear chuckled when macilhenny read number rudder and aileron trim the copilot responded zero and the man with the uzi said fire it up captain macilhenny reached for the left engine engine start button and a moment later the whine and vibration of the turbine began ask ground control for permission to taxi to the maintenance area the man with the uzi ordered macilhenny nodded and said luanda ground control la on the parking pad near the threshold of the main runway request permission to taxi to the maintenance hangar luanda ground control responded twenty seconds later la you are cleared to taxi on four south turn right on four south right three report on arrival at the maintenance area ground control la understands four south to four south right three affirmative macilhenny looked over his shoulder at the man with the uzi who nodded macilhenny released the brakes and reached for the throttle quadrant la began to move turn onto the threshold the man with the uzi said thirty seconds later line it up with the runway and immediately commence your takeoff roll without asking for clearance macilhenny asked without asking for clearance the man with the uzi said not pleasantly and brushed macilhennys neck below his ear with the muzzle of the uzi as macilhenny taxied the to the threshold of the main northsouth runway he looked out the side window of the cockpit and then pointed out the window theres an aircraft on final he said an ilyushin it was an ilyushin ii called the candid it was a large fourengine heavylift military transport roughly equivalent to the lockheed c the man with the uzi pressed the muzzle of the uzi against macilhennys neck as he leaned around him to look out the window at the approaching aircraft line up with the runway captain he ordered and the moment he touches down begin your takeoff roll line up now or after he touches down now the man with the uzi said and jabbed macilhenny with the muzzle of the uzi macilhenny released the brakes and nudged the throttles la ground control the radio went off the voice sounded alarmed the man with the uzi jerked macilhennys headset from his head macilhenny lined up with the runway and stopped a moment later the ilyushin flashed over so close that the moved it touched down about halfway down the runway the uzi muzzle prodded macilhenny under the ear he understood the message released the brakes and shoved the throttles forward my options right now are to pull the gear which will mean i will have my brains blown all over the cockpit a full twenty seconds before the gear retracts or i can do what im told and maybe just maybe stay alive will you call out the airspeed please macilhenny asked politely eighty the copilot said a moment later unless that ilyushin gets his tail off the runway im going to clip it ninety oneten onetwenty rotate macilhenny said and pulled back on the yoke what you will do now captain the man with the uzi said is level off at twofive hundred feet on this course thats going to eat a lot of fuel macilhenny said yes i know what i want to do is fall off their radar the lower we fly the sooner that will happen macilhenny nodded his understanding five minutes later the man with the uzi ordered maintaining this flight level steer zerotwozero zerotwozero macilhenny repeated and began a gentle turn to that heading that will take me over the exbelgian congo i wonder what that means ten minutes after that the man with the uzi said ascend to flight level twofive thousand and turn to zeroonefive course zeroonefive macilhenny repeated beginning climb to flight level twofive thousand now very good captain the man with the uzi said not quite two hours after they left luanda the man with the uzi said begin a thousandfeetaminute descent on our present heading captain macilhenny nodded his understanding adjusted the trim retarded the throttles and then said we are in a thousandfeetaminute descent may i ask where we are going we are going to take on fuel at an airfield not far from kisangani he said once known as stanleyville kisangani has a radar and i want to get under it so level off at twentyfive hundred feet yes sir macilhenny checked his fuel his tanks were a little under half full kisangani is in the northeast congo not far from the border of sudan we could have made it to khartoum almost anywhere in sudan with available fuel sudan has a reputation for loose borders and for not liking americans so why didnt we go there if we keep on this northeasterly flight path well overfly sudan and on this heading whats next is egypt saudi arabia and israel the americans are all over saudi arabia and israel with awac aircraft theyre sure to see this one for that matter its surprising that there hasnt been a fighter or three or four fighters off my wingtip already you cant just steal an airplane and fly it a thousand miles without somebody finding you where the hell are we going leaseaire had been flying at twentyfive hundred feet at four hundred knots for about fifteen minutes when the copilot adjusted the radio frequency to and then called somebody somebody called back with no headset macilhenny of course had no idea what anybody said but a moment after his brief radio conversation the copilot punched in a frequency on the radio direction finder and then pointed to the cathode display change to that heading macilhenny asked politely correct the man with the uzi said we should be no more than miles from our refuel point twenty minutes later macilhenny saw almost directly ahead a brown scar on the vast blanket of green congolese jungle beneath him the copilot got on the radio again held a brief conversation with someone and then turned to macilhenny the winds are negligible he said if you want to you can make a direct approach how much runway do we have fiftyeight hundred feet the copilot said dont worry this will not be the first to land here macilhenny brought the in at the end of the runway he could see some buildings but they seemed deserted and he didnt see any people or vehicles or other signs of life he touched down smoothly and slowed the aircraft down to taxi speed with a third of the runway still in front of him continue to the end of the runway captain the man with the uzi said macilhenny taxied as slowly as he could without arousing the suspicion of his copilot or the man with the uzi he saw no other signs of life or occupancy except what could be recent truck tire marks in the mud on the side of the macadam runway turn it around captain and put the brakes on but dont shut it down until we have a look at the refueling facilities yes sir macilhenny said and complied now here were going to need your expert advice the man with the uzi said will you come with me please yes sir macilhenny said he unfastened his shoulder harness got out of his seat and saw that the man with the uzi had put the jump seat back in the stored position and was waiting for him to precede him out of the cockpit and into the fuselage in the back please captain the man with the uzi said gesturing with the weapon macilhenny walked into the passenger compartment the local pilot was still sitting taped into one of the seats macilhenny glanced down at him as he walked past it looked as if something had been spilled in his lap spilled hell he pissed his pants at the rear of the passenger compartment the man with the uzi ordered open the door please captain macilhenny wrestled with the door the first thing he noticed was that warm tropical air seemed to pour into the airplane then someone grabbed his hair again and pulled his head backward then he felt himself being pushed out of the door and falling twenty feet to the ground he landed hard on his shoulder and in the last conscious moment of his life saw blood from his cut throat pumping out onto the macadam he was dead before the local pilot was marchedstill blindfolded with yellow tapeto the door and disposed of in a similar fashion then the rear door of leaseaire was closed and the airplane taxied to the other end of the runway where a tanker truck appeared and began to refuel it two quatro de fevereiro aeroporto internacional luanda angola may quite by accident h richard miller jr a thirtysixyearold sixfoottwo pound very black native of philadelphia pennsylvania was not only there when what he was shortly afterward to report as the unauthorized departure of a boeing aircraft registered to the leaseaire corporation of philadelphia pa took place but he actually saw it happen miller an army major was diplomatically accredited to the republic of angola as the assistant military attache he was in fact and of course covertly the luanda station chief of the central intelligence agency but with the exception that his diplomatic carnet gave him access to the airports dutyfree shop neither his official nor covert status had anything to do with his being present at the airport when the aircraft was stolen he had gone out to the airporton what he thought of as his selfgranted weekly restandrecuperation leaveto buy a bottle of boss cologne and have first a martini and then a late lunch in the airports quite good restaurant since this was in the nature of an informationgathering mission he would pay for the meal from his discretionary operating funds when he went into the restaurant he chose a table next to one of the plateglass windows they offered a panoramic view of the runways and just about everything at the airport but the building he was in he laid his digital camera on the table so that it wouldnt be either stolen or forgotten when he left and where he could quickly pick it up and take a shot at anything of potential interest without drawing too muchhopefully noattention to him a waiter quickly appeared and miller ordered a gin martini then he took a long look at what he could see of the airport parked far across the field on a parking pad not far from the threshold of the main northsouth runway he saw that what he thought of as his airplane a boeing was still parked where it had been last week and for the past fourteen months he thought of it as his airplane because when hed noticed it fourteen months ago hed taken snapshots of it and checked it out without even making an official inquiry he went on the internet and learned that it was registered to the leaseaire corporation of philadelphia from a source at the airfieldan air traffic controller who was the monthly recipient of a crisp onehundreddollar bill from millers discretionary operating fundshe had learned that the had made a discretionary landing at luanda while en route somewhere else miller was a pilot an army aviatornot currently on flight status because hed busted a flight physical which was why he had wound up temporarily assigned to the cia and sent to luandaand he understood that a discretionary landing was one a wise pilot made when red lights lit up on the control panel before it became necessary to make an emergency landing miller had begun to feel sorry for the airplane as he sometimes felt sorry for himself a grounded bird and a grounded bird man stuck in picturesque luanda angola by circumstances beyond their control when they both would much rather have been in philadelphia where he had grown up where his parents lived and where one could be reasonably sure that out of a thousand goodlooking women did not have aids which could not be said of luanda angola still unofficiallyalthough after a month he had reported to langley in paragraph unrelated data of his weekly report that the plane seemed to be stuck in luandahe had learned that leaseaire was a small outfit that bought old airliners at distress prices la came from continental that it then leased them wet or dry and that la had been dryleased to a scottish company called surf amp sun holidays ltd just to play it safe hed asked the assistant cia station chief in london whom he knew to find out what he could about surf amp sun in two days he learned that it was a rinkydink outfit that had gone bellyup shortly after leaving irate irishmen stranded in rabat morocco that seemed to explain everything and nothing was suspicious and so every time during the fourteen months that miller took his r ampr and saw the onceproud old bird sitting across the field he had grown more convinced that it would never fly again he was therefore more than a little surprised whenpeering over the rim of a second martini just as good as the firsthe saw la moving he thought in quick order as he carefully set the martini glass on the table first that he had been mistaken and next that if it was moving it was being towed by a tug to where repairor cannibalizationcould begin when he looked again he saw the airplane was indeed moving and under its own power how the hell did they start it up you cant let an airplane sit on a runway for fourteen months and then just get in it and push the engine start buttons obviously somebodys been working on it but when when was the last time i was here last wednesday well thats a week thats enough time the turned off the taxiway and moved toward the threshold of the runway there was a congo air ilyushin transport on final miller knew there were two daily flights between brazzaville congo and luanda miller had two unkind thoughts prescription for aerial disaster an exrussian air force fighter jockey flying a wornout ilyushin maintained by congo air ladies and gentlemen this is your captain speaking please remain seated on the floor and try to restrain all chickens goats and other livestock until the aircraft has come to a complete stop at the airway and thank you for flying congo air we hope that the next time you have to go from nowhere to nowhere youll fly with us again and then he had another thought when he saw that the was on the threshold lined up with the runway hey charley the way youre supposed to do that is wait until the guy on final goes over you and then you move to the threshold otherwise if he lands a little short he lands on you the ilyushin passed no more than fifty feet over the tail of the and then touched down before the ilyushin reached the first turnoff from the runway the began its takeoff roll hey charley what are you going to do if he doesnt get out of your way what do we have here two exrussian fighter jockeys the rear stabilizer of the ilyushin had not completely cleared the runway when the approaching takeoff velocity flashed past it and then lifted off well im glad youre back in the air old girl i wonder what kind of a nitwit was flying the miller picked up his martini raised it to the now nearly out of sight and then turned his attention to the menu thirty minutes later after a very nicely broiled filet of what the menu called sea trout and two cups of really firstclass kenyan coffee he paid the bill with an american express card collected the bags containing the newspapers magazines paperbacks and the goodies hed bought in the dutyfree shop and started walking across the terminal to get his car what i should do is go home get on the ski machine to get the gin out of my system and then spend a half hour at least on the knee but being an honest man he knew that what he was probably going to do was go home hang up the nice clothes and take a little nap on impulse however passing a pay telephone he stepped into the booth fed it coins and punched in a number that was not available to the general public torre someone said after answering on the first ring having the unlisted number of the control tower and if he was lucky the right guy to answer its phone was what the monthly dispersal of the crisp hundreddollar bill bought antonio por favor e seu irmao miller said a moment later antonio took the phone to speak to his brother and obviously excited said i cant talk right now something has come up whats come up we think someone has stolen an airplane a how did you know antonio you have to take a piss please i cannot yes you can you sonofabitch i hand you a hundreddollar bill each and every month and you know what i expect of you trust me antonio you have diarrhea ill be waiting in the mens room three office of the ambassador embassy of the united states of america rua houari boumedienne luanda angola may thank you for seeing me mr ambassador on such short notice miller said to the united states ambassador and then turned to the defense attache an air force lieutenant colonel and you sir for meeting me here so quickly the ambassador was a fellow african american from washington dc miller didnt dislike him but he did not hold him in high regard miller thought the ambassador had worked his way up through the state department to what would probably be the pinnacle of his diplomatic career by keeping his nose clean and closely following the two basic rules for success in the foreign service of the united states dont make waves and never make a decision today that can be put off until next week or better next month the defense attache was caucasian which miller attributed to a momentary shortage of what used to be called black or negro officers of suitable rank when the defense attache post came open according to applicable regulations miller was subordinate to both to the ambassador because he was the senior us government officer in angola and to the defense attache because he was a lieutenant colonel and miller a major and also because the defense attache is supposed to control the military army and naval attaches but in practice it didnt work quite that way millers assistant military attache status was the cover for his being the resident spook and both knew it and when he was as he thought of it on the job he not only didnt have to tell the defense attache what he was doing but was under orders not to unless the defense attache had a bona fide need to know the ambassador was miller had quickly learned more than a little afraid of him for two reasons one being that miller had come out of special forces like most career diplomats the ambassador believed that special forces peopleespecially highly decorated ones like millerwere practitioners of the kill em all and let god sort it out school of diplomacy and consequently lived in fear that miller was very likely to do something outrageous which would embarrass the embassy the state department the united states government and of course him more important than that probably was a photograph miller had hung not ostentatiously but very visibly in the corridor of his apartment leading to the bathroom once a month miller was expected to have a cocktail party for his fellow diplomats anyone who needed to visit the facilities could not miss seeing the photograph it showed two smiling african american officers in vietnamera uniforms one was a colonel wearing a name tag identifying him as miller he had his arm around a young major from whose jacket hung an obviously just awarded bronze star his name tag read powell both officers had gone on to higher rank millers father had retired as a major general the major had retired with four stars and had been the secretary of state it was not unreasonable miller thought to suspect the ambassador feared that miller had influence in the highest corridors of power and might in fact be sending backchannel outofschool reports on his performance to secretary powell who was stillaccording to forbes magazineone of the ten most influential men in the united states that was nonsense of course miller knew powell well enough to know that a large ax would fall on his neck wielded by powell himself if he made a habit of sending back channels to powell or anyone in his circle but he did nothing to assuage the ambassadors worries you said this was important major miller the ambassador said no sir with respect making a decision like that is not for someone of my pay grade what i said was that i thought you and colonel porter might consider this important thats why i thought i should bring this to your attention as soon as possible sir what is it dick colonel porter asked it would seem sir that someone has stolen an airplane from quatro de fevereiro really the ambassador asked what kind of an airplane dick colonel porter asked a sir the one thats been sitting out there for fourteen months how the hell did they do that colonel porter asked you cant just get in an airplane that hasnt moved for fourteen months and fire it up i dont know how they did it sir only that they did they just taxied from where it had been parked to the northsouth and took off without clearance and disappeared youre the expert colonel the ambassador said would an aircraft like that have the range to fly to the united states why am i not surprised that the world trade towers have popped into the ambassadors head miller thought no sir i dont think that it would colonel porter replied and then added not without taking on fuel somewhere and even if it did that its tanks would be just about empty by the time it got to the us he turned to miller youre sure about this dick yes sir i have a source at the airport he told me that the plane ignored both abort takeoff and then return to airfield immediately orders after it was in the air where was it headed east sir when it fell off the radar we dont know if terrorists are involved in this do we the ambassador asked no sir colonel porter said we dont know that for sure certainly but we certainly cant discount that possibility its possible sir that it was just stolen miller said what would anyone do with a stolen airliner the ambassador asked perhaps cannibalize it for parts sir colonel porter said take parts from it yes sir they call that cannibalizing why do i think our african ambassador is uncomfortable with that word yes sir well miller you were absolutely right in bringing this up to me the ambassador said wed better start notifying people yes sir colonel porter and major miller said almost in unison miller youre obviously going to notify your people i thought it would be best to check with you before i did so mr ambassador but not knowing where the hell you might be or when you could find time for me in your busy schedule and suspecting you might say before we do anything i think we should carefully consider the situation i filed it to langley as a flash satellite burst before i came here i think we should immediately make this situation known to washington the ambassador said my god an immediate decision will wonders never cease yes sir porter and miller said in chorus and it might be a good idea if you were both to get copies of your messages to me as soon as you can the ambassador said theyll be useful to me when i prepare my report to the state department translation i will say nothing in my report that you didnt say in yours that way if theres a fuckup i can point my finger at you its not really an ambassadors responsibility to develop information like this himself he has to rely on those who have that kind of responsibility yes sir they said in chorus ten minutes later another flash satellite burst from miller went out from the antenna on the embassy roof it was identical to millers first message except for the last sentence which said transmitted at direction of ambassador when he walked out of the radio room miller thought that by now his messageit had been a flash the highest priorityhad reached the desk of his boss the cias regional director for southwest africa in langley miller then went to his office plugged the highspeed cable into his personal laptop computer and typing rapidly sent an email message to two friends haloweb net beachaggieaol com a boeing registered to leaseaire inc philadelphia penna which made a discretionary landing here fourteen months ago and had been sitting here since was apparently stolen by parties unknown at today more when i have it dick sending such a message violated a long list of security restrictions and major miller was fully aware that it did on the other hand whoever had grabbed the knew they had grabbed it so what was the secret furthermore the backchannel message was a headsupunofficial of courseto people who would possibly even likely become involved in whatever the government ultimately decided to do about the stolen airplane this especially applied to halo the screen name made reference to the number of high altitude low opening parachute jumps the addressee had madewho

connection with the missing airplane the orders would come from central command while his satburst message had reached washington in literally a matter of seconds it might not reach either fort bragg or macdill for hoursor daysuntil the message had been evaluated at langley passed to the national security counselor and evaluated again and a decision reached major millers conscience did not bother him a bit for sending a headsup that violated a long list of security restrictions hed done a tour with delta and knew the sooner they got a headsup the better he unplugged the laptop and locked it in his desk drawer then he changed into his work clothes and caught a taxicab out to the quatro de fevereiro aeroporto to see what else he could find out about what had happened to his airplane chapter ii one the central intelligence agency langley virginia may when at luanda time major h richard miller jr sent his first satellite burst message announcing the apparent theft from the luanda airport of leaseaires it took about three minutes in real time to reach the desk of his boss the cias regional director for southwest africa in langley there is a fourhour difference in time between angola and virginia when it is half past three in luanda it is half past eleven in langley the message was actually received by the regional directors executive administrative assistant as the regional director had not yet returned from a working lunch at the department of state in the district the operative word in the job title was executive it meant that mrs margaret leewilliamson was authorized to execute in the regional director for southwest africas name certain administrative actions among them to receive material classified top secret addressed to the regional director and to take any appropriate action the material called for what this meant was that when the computer terminal on mrs leewilliamsons desk pinged and the message satburst confidential from luanda for regdir swafrica enter access code appeared on the screen mrs leewilliamson typed in a tendigit access code whereupon the simple message from miller appeared on the screen confidential satburst luanda may for regdir swafrica a boeing transport aircraft la registered to leaseaire inc phila penn took off without permission from quatro de fevereiro aeroporto internacional at local time may and disappeared from radar shortly thereafter angolan authorities known to believe aircraft was stolen more to follow stachief luanda mrs leewilliamson read it and pressed the print key she read the printout carefully then decided that while the message should be forwarded it wasnt really all that important very few things classified confidential are ever important certainly not important enough for her to try to get the regional director on the phone during lunch mrs leewilliamson decided that she could handle this herself and tell her boss about it when the regional director returned from lunch she highlighted major millers message with the cursor pressed the copy key and then the end and write keys when a blank message form headed from cia regional director for southwest africa appeared on her screen she typed after she thought about it a moment distlist and when she pressed the enter key it caused distribution list number to appear in the addressee box on the message form national security advisor secretary of defense secretary of homeland security secretary of state director fbi director faa chairman joint chiefs of staff then as an afterthought she added to the list of addressees commanding general central command there had been several complaints from central command concerning their not being given timely notice of certain events and angola was within centcoms area of responsibility she moved her cursor to the message box and typed following received may from luanda angola is forwarded for your information then she pressed the insert key and millers message appeared on the screen mrs leewilliamson then pressed the send key and the message was on its way then she called up a fresh message blank and began to type stachief luanda reference your satburst may re possibly stolen aircraft without diverting substantial assets attempt to develop further regdir swafrica when she had pressed the send key again she decided it was time for a cup of coffee she locked the printout of millers message in a secure filing cabinet locked the office door and headed for the cafeteria two office of the commanding general united states central command macdill air force base tampa florida may general allan b naylor routinely used two computers in his office suite one he thought of as the desktop computer although it was actually on the floor under the credenza behind naylors desk the other which he thought of as the laptop computer he brought to work with him each morning and took home at night when he was in the office the laptop sat either on naylors desk where it could be seen by those sitting at his office conference table which butted up against his desk or it sat before the commanding generals chair on the larger conference table in the conference room next to his office where it was similarly very visible to others at the table quite innocently the laptop had acquired an almost menacing aura none of those at either table could see what was on the laptops screen and it is human nature to fear the unknown everyone at either conference table became aware that at least once every ten minutes or so the cgs attention was diverted from what was being discussed by the conferees to the laptop screen and he would either smile or frown then look thoughtful and then type something or return his attention to the conferees and ask a question or issue an order obviously based on what had been on the laptops screen general naylor had learned his laptop was commonly known among the senior members of his staff as the ibbfor infernal black box more junior members of his staff referred to it privately of course in somewhat more imaginative and scatological terms having the laptop on the commanding generals desk and on the conference table had been the idea of command sergeant major wesley suggins general if you turn that thing on and sign on to the instant messager i can let you know whos on the horn you follow sir it had taken general naylor about ten seconds to follow sugginss reasoning general naylor often thought and said to his inner circle that napoleon was right when he said armies travel on their stomachs that during world war ii someone was right to comment the army moves on a road of paper and that he was forced to the sad conclusion centcom sails very slowly through a sargasso sea of conferences the problem during these conferences was that there were always telephone calls from important peoplesuch as mrs elaine naylor or the secretary of defensefor the commanding general general naylor always took calls from these two but some of the calls were from less important people and could wait sergeant major suggins usually made that decision and informed the caller that general naylor was in conference and would return the call as soon as he could but sometimes sergeant major suggins didnt feel confident in telling for example the assistant secretary of defense for manpower or someone calling from the white house that he was just going to have to wait to talk to the boss in that case there were two options he could enter naylors office or the conference room and go to the general and quietly tell him that he had a call from soandso and did he wish to take it the moment the sergeant major entered the conference room or the office whoever had the floor at the moment in the conference would stopoften in midsentenceand politely wait for the sergeant major and the general to finish this wasted time of course and prolonged the conference the second optionwhich naylor originally thought showed great promisewas a telephone on his desk and the conference table which had a flashing red button instead of a bell that had been a failure too as the instant the button began to flash whoever was speaking stopped talking in the reasonable presumption that if the generals phone flashed the call had to be more important than whatever he was saying at the moment from the beginning the use of the laptop to announce calls had been a success naylor always caught out of the corner of his eye activity on the laptops screen he then dropped his eyes to it and read for example mrs n or sec beiderman or gen hardhead whereupon he would put his fingers on the keyboard and type brt which meant be right there and further meant that he would stand up say excuse me for a moment gentlemen and go into a small soundproof cubicle which held a chair a desk and a secure telephone and converse with his wife or the secretary of defense or in the case of general hardhead for example he would quickly type nn hr which stood for not now have him call back in an hour or fowdwiip which stood for find out what and deal with it if possible general naylor found he could get and receive messages in this manner without causing whoever had the floor to stop in midsentence and wait but then starting with mrs naylor he began to get messages directly from those in his inner circle rather than via sergeant major suggins those who were very privy to the great secret of naylors email screen name there would be a muted beep he would drop his eyes to the screen and see that mrs naylor was inquiring can you pick up two dozen eggs and some rye bread at the commissary to which without causing the conference to come to a complete stop he could reply sure the next developmentwhich he thought was probably inevitablewas the realization that since he was connected to the internet his personal email was thus available the purpose of the conferences was to make sure everybody knew what everybody else was thinking had done or was planning to do very often general naylor knew what most of the conferees were going to say when they stood up listening to something he already knewor at least assigning his full attention to itwas a waste of time time that could be better spent reading what for example his sons thought would interest him both of his sons were in the army and in iraq the oldest was a lieutenant colonel who had followed his father and grandfather into armor the youngest was a captain who commanded a special forces ateam engaged in rounding up saddam hussein loyalists both of themand he was very proud of the way they handled thisroutinely sent him information they thought he might not otherwise geteven though everything military in iraq was under his commandand would like to have the information they sent met two criteria it was not classified and it contained not the slightest hint of criticism of any officer there were many periods in many conferences when naylor felt justified in reading emails from his sons instead of hearing one colonel or general explain something for the fifth time to a colonel or general who just didnt seem to be able to understand what he was being told the conferees had no idea what the commanding general might be typing on his ibb only that he had diverted his attention from them to it the little box in the lower right corner of the laptop screen flicked brightly for an instant and then reported you have a new email from charleycastillo com charley castillo had a unique relationship on several levels with allan b naylor general us army commanding general of the united states central command any one of which would have given him access to naylors private email address one which naylor often thought was the most important was that both he and elaine considered him a third sonthe middle son so to speakeven though there was no blood connection between them they had known him since he was twelve when charley had become an orphan he was also officially one of naylors officers the manning chart of centcorn showed under the j the special activities section and under the sas the special assignments section a list of names of officers and enlisted men on special assignments one of them read castillo cg maj j stood for joint staff division special operations the special activities section of j had to do with things known only to a very few people and the special assignments section was sort of the holding tankthey had to appear on the manning chart somewhere general naylor had had nothing to do with major castillos assignment to what was colloquially known as jayfive sassas although many peopleincluding he suspected his wife and sonssuspected he did castillo had been assigned there routinely when he came back from afghanistan it was an assignment appropriate for someone of his rank and experience general naylor however had had everything to do with major castillos present jayfive sassas assignment general naylor was personally acquainted with secretary of homeland security matt hall they had met in vietnam when naylor had been a captain and hall a sergeant and had stayed in touch and become close friends over the years as naylor had risen in the army hierarchy and hall had become first a congressman and then governor of north carolina and then secretary of homeland security hall over a beer in the bar of the armynavy club in washington had asked naylor allan you dont just happen to know of a hell of a good linguist with all the proper security clearances do you how do you define good matt preferably male and singlei need somebody around all the time and thats awkward with a femaleor a married person of either gender major c g castillo was the next day placed on indefinite temporary duty with the office of the secretary of homeland security with the understanding between the general and the secretary being that if he wasnt what hall needed or they didnt get along castillo would be returned to macdill two weeks after castillo had gone to washington hall had telephoned naylor about castillo hows castillo doing naylor had asked until about an hour ago i thought he was just what the doctor ordered hall said what happened an hour ago i found out hes living in the mayflower how does he afford that on a majors pay didnt i mention that he doesnt have to live on his majors pay no you didnt hall said why not i didnt think it was important is it yeah washington is an expensive place to live now i wont have to worry about him having to go to household finance to make ends meet can i keep him allan for as long as you need him would you have any objection if i put him in civilian clothing most of the time and called him my executive assistant or something like that hell be doing more than translating uhhuh any problem with that hes yours matt im glad its worked out general naylor clicked on the read button without thinking about it the laptop screen filled up almost instantly we just got this from langley what do you make of it following received may from luanda angola is forwarded for your information confidential satburst luanda may for regdir swafrica a boeing transport aircraft la registered to leaseaire inc phila penn took off without permission from quatro de fevereiro aeroporto internacional at local time may and disappeared from radar shortly thereafter angolan authorities known to believe aircraft was stolen more to follow stachief luanda regards charley there were several things wrong with charleys message which caused naylor to frown thoughtfully and which in turn caused half a dozen of the people at the conference table to wonder what had come over that goddamned ibb to cause the commanding general to frown thoughtfully for one thing i dont know if this is from charley or hall charley said we just got this message does we mean the department of homeland security or matt and charley or just charley using the regal we or what was matt standing there when the message arrived and said why dont we ask naylor or words to that effect or is this message a what do you think of this uncle allantype message expressing idle curiosity or wanting to know what i think in case matt asks him later damn it the commanding general of central command rapped his water glass with a pencil and gained the attention of all the conferees gentlemen he said for several reasons high among them that i think were all a little groggy after being at this so long i hereby adjourn this conference until tomorrow morning place and time to be announced by sergeant major suggins the second reason is that it has just come to my attention that an airliner has allegedly been stolen in luanda angola and i would like to know what if anything anyone here knows about it he looked at mr lawrence p fremont as he spoke mr fremont was the liaison officer between central command and the central intelligence agency it was obvious that mr fremont had absolutely no idea what naylor was talking about neither to judge from the looks on their faces did viceadmiral louis j warley usn central commands j intelligence officer nor lieutenant general george h potter usa the centcom j nor mr brian willis who was the federal bureau of investigations resident special agent in charge known as the sac i didnt expect all of them to be on top of this but none of them jesus h christ id like mr fremont admiral warley mr willis and general potter to stay behind a moment please the rest of you gentlemen may go with my thanks for your devoted attention during a long and grueling session general naylor said everybody but the four people he had named filed out of the conference room naylor looked at the four men standing by the conference table if it would be convenient gentlemen id like to see you all in my office in twenty minutes together with what you can find out about he dropped his eyes to the laptop and read cia satburst luanda may in that time he looked up at potter and added larry see if you can find out who the cia man is in luanda id like to know who sent this message i think i know sir general potter said naylor looked at him general potter aware that general naylor believed that no information is better than wrong information said im not sure sir ill check yeah general naylor said he looked at the door and saw sergeant major suggins suggins would you ask general mcfadden if hes free to come to my office in twenty minutes general albert mcfadden us air force was the centcom deputy commander yes sir general naylor then turned his attention to the ibb pushed the reply key and typed working on it ill get back to you regards naylor when he looked up he saw that general potter was standing just inside the door potter was a tall thin asceticlooking man who didnt look much like what comes to mind when special forces is said naylor knew that he had been in his day one hell of a green beanie a contemporary of the legendary scotty mcnab and that he was anything but ascetic he was a gourmet cook especially seafood you have something naylor asked yes sir general i know who the cia guy is in angola hes one of us potter said one of us what hes a special operator general potter said smiling again he took a pretty bad hit in afghanistan with the th and when he got out of the hospital on limited duty we loaned him to the agency i thought he was going to help run their basic training program at the farm but apparently they sent him to angola the th was the special operations aviation regiment you have his name miller h richard miller jr major good man naylor said you know him him and his father and grandfather naylor said i didnt get to meet his greatgrandfather or maybe it was his greatgreatgrandfather but in the spanishamerican war he was first sergeant of baker troop th cavalry when teddy roosevelt led the rough riders through their lines and up san juan hill i heard he was hit charley told me in afghanistan they shot down his helicopter a loach i think yeah it was a loach a piece of something got his knee have we got a back channel to him george its up and running sir we got a back channel from miller about this missing airplane before you heard about it and my notification was out of channels naylor said just a little bitterly but i suppose in good time centcom will hear about this officially im really sick and tired of langley taking their goddamned sweet time before they bring me in the loop he heard what he had said and added you didnt hear that potter smiled and made an i dont know what youre talking about gesture let me see whatever he sends naylor ordered yes sir three what was at first euphemistically described as establishing some really firstrate liaison between the cia and the fbi and centcom was a direct result of the events of what had universally become known as the crashing of skyjacked airliners into the twin towers of the world trade center and into the pentagon and short of its target in the capital into the pennsylvania countryside no one said it out loud but central command was the most important headquarters in the army according to its mission statement it was responsible for those areas of the world not otherwise assigned army forces in the continental united states were assigned to one of the five armies in the united states except those engaged in training which were assigned to the training amp doctrine command with its headquarters within the thick stone walls of fortress monroe virginia southern command which had had its headquarters in panama for many years now listed its address as nw st avenue miami florida it was responsible for central and south america no one feared immediate war with say uruguay chile or argentina or even venezuela or colombia although a close eye was kept on the latter two and of course on cuba the far east command had responsibility for the pacific there were no longer very many soldiers in the pacific because no one expected war to break out there tomorrow afternoon the european command as the name implied had the responsibility for europe for nearly half a century there had been genuine concern that the red army would one day crash through the fulda gap bent on sweeping all of europe under the communist rug that threat no longer existed some people wondered what sort of a role was now left for the north american treaty organization whose military force was headed by an american general now that the soviet threat was minimal to nonexistent and nato was taking into its ranks many countries it had once been prepared to fight the alaskan command had the responsibility for alaska there was very little of a threat that the now russian army would launch an amphibious attack across the bering strait from siberia with the intention of occupying fairbanks or nome that left central command with the rest of the world and most of the wars being fought andor expected to start tonight or tomorrow morning iraq is in centcoms area of responsibility and centcom had already fought one war there and was presently fighting another but the reason general allan naylor believed that he commanded the most important headquarters in the army was that it wasnt just an army headquarters but rather a truly unified command which meant that naylor more often than not had air force navy and marine units as well as army under his command the operative word was command he had the authority to issue orders not make requests or offer suggestions of the other services and for this he was grateful to one of his personal heroes general donn a starry usa now retired starry like naylor was armor as a young colonel in vietnam while leading the cambodian incursion from the turret of the first tank starry had been painfully wounded in the face had the wound bandaged and then got back in his tank and resumed the incursion one of his majors who had jumped from his tank to go to the aid of his injured commander was himself badly wounded and lost a leg many people in the army had been pleasantly surprised when starry had been given his first star officers who say what they think often find this a bar to promotion and starry not only said what he thought but was famous for not letting tact get in the way of making his points clear people were thus even more surprised when he was given a second star and command of fort knox then a third star and command of the v corps in frankfurt germany charged with keeping the red army from coming through the fulda gap and then a fourth star the army thought fourstar general starry would be just the man to assume command of what was then called readiness command at macdill air force base in florida general starry however said no thank you i think ill retire i dont want to go out of the army remembered as a paper tiger starrys refusal to take the command came to the attention of president reagan who called him to the white house to explain why starry told reagan that so far as he was concerned readiness command was useless as presently constituted it was supposed to be ready to instantly respond to any threat when ordered but when ordered to move starry told the president that the way things were the general in command had to ask the air force for airplanesfor which they certainly would have a better use elsewhereand ask the navy for shipsfor which the navy would have a better use elsewhereand then ask for example the european commander for a couple of divisionsfor which eucom again would nave a far better use elsewhere it was rumored that starry had used the words joke and dog and pony show to describe readiness command to the president no one knows for sure for their meeting was private what is known is that starry walked out of the oval office as commanding general of readiness command and the word of the commander in chief that just as soon as he could sign the orders the cg of readiness command would have the authority starry said he absolutely had to have the president was as good as his word starry reorganized what was to become central command so that it would function when needed and then retired when saddam hussein invaded kuwait and the first president bush ordered centcom to respond its then commander general h norman schwarzkopf went to war using the authorities starry had demanded of reagan and reagan had given to centcom schwarzkopfs ground commander in the first desert war was general fred franks franks was the us armys first onelegged general since the civil war hed lost his leg as a result of vietnam wounds incurred as he rushed to help his wounded colonel donn starry centcoms command structure had worked in the first desert war and it had worked in the new one and general allan naylor was determined that it would remain in force sometimes he thought that was just about as hard a battle to fight as were the shooting wars in iraq and afghanistan one of the ways he had done this after when the fbi and the ciaand some other agencieshad sent him liaison officers was to tell them politely and privately that unless they considered themselves as part of the centcom command team and behaved themselves accordingly he was going to send them back where they came from as unsatisfactory and keep sending whoever was sent to replace them back until he was either relieved himself or centcom had liaison officers who regarded themselves as members of the team that had not of course endeared him to the directors of the fbi and the cia but in the end he had prevailed i dont have them running five miles before breakfast honey he told mrs naylor not yet but neither do they think they were sent down here to write reports on what im doing wrong when theyre not soaking up the sun on the beach there was no question in naylors mind that both the fbi and the cia had dropped the ball bigtime in not knowing what was going to happen on so had the defense intelligence agency and the state department intelligence people he didnt know the details and made no effort to get them but he heard things without asking that told him he was right he also understood that the president had been in a tight spot he couldnt fire the heads of the cia and the fbi in the days immediately after something like happened no matter how justified that would have been legitimately frightened people need reassurance and not to hear that the heads of the countrys domestic and foreign intelligence had been incompetent and had been canned another direct result of was the establishment of the department of homeland security and the presidents naming of governor matt hall as its secretary naylor thought that making it a cabinetlevel department was a fine idea and not only because it meant he would have an ear at cabinet meetings the department of homeland security did not have a liaison officerat least not a senior one there were half a dozen or more dhs employees around macdill one wasnt needed the secretary of homeland security and the commanding general of centcom talked just about daily on a secure phone line and of course charleys up there with matt in sodom on the potomac general naylor looked again at charleys email message and in particular at the we just got this from langley opening jesus christ charley we youre just a lousy major but he was smiling fondly not frowning general naylor looked at the door to the conference room sergeant major suggins was standing there sir general potters waiting outside your office it was an unspoken questionwhat do i do with himas much as a statement be right there general naylor said closed the lid of the infernal black box disconnected the ethernet cable and then carried it into his office set it on his desk and connected it to the ethernet cable there four general george potter was pouring himself and general naylor another cup of coffee when mr lawrence p fremont the cia liaison officer to centcom appeared in the door to general naylors office ears burning larry naylor said waving him in and then motioning to the coffee service no thank you fremont said then im the subject of discussion the agency is naylor said george tells me your guy in luanda is one of his and we were idly wondering why theyd send a special operator to angola and your sure to be less than flattering conjecture george well hes black he probably speaks portuguese and hes a special operator langley probably decided hed be less dangerous there less dangerous george in the sense he wouldnt have much of an opportunity to make embarrassing waves potter said unrepentant i also said it was probably because hes black and speaks portuguese i respectfully disagree with premise one fremont said smiling and agree with the rest white people have trouble not standing out in crowds in africa but to judge from this yourmyour guy seems to know what hes doing he handed two printouts to naylor the first was on my desk fremont said thats what you had i suppose the second came in just now yeah naylor said glancing at the first thats what i had he handed it to potter and then read the second message and handed that to potter secret satburst luanda may for regdir swafrica source at aeroporto internacional states la underwent repairs during past week under supervision of captain aj macilhenny of leaseaire registry of hotel del quatro de fevereiro luanda indicates alex macilhenny us citizen of phila penn checked in may inspection of his room shows no indication that macilhenny planned departure all clothing personal effects etcetera still in place possibility therefore exists that macilhenny piloted probably unwillingly leaseaire la more to follow stachief luanda george while we wait for the others can you check and see if we got this from somebody else naylor ordered id like to be sure that its up and running yes sir general potter said and walked out of the office naylor saw fremonts look of curiosity you dont want to know larry naylor said if you knew you might feel obliged to tell someone in langley that i think we can get things quicker than they can send them to us and their feelings might be hurt fremont raised both hands in a gesture meaning i didnt ask and therefore dont know naylor smiled at him fremont had just proven again he thought of himself as a member of the team viceadmiral louis j warley usn central commands j intelligence officer came to the office door a moment later he held two printouts in his hand naylor motioned him into the office ive got the one i think you were referring to warley said and a second one just came in both from dia he handed them to naylor who glanced at them and handed them back thats what were going to talk about naylor said general albert mcfadden us air force centcoms deputy commander walked into naylors office without asking permission somebodys grabbed a he asked read all about it naylor said and motioned for admiral warley to give the printouts to general mcfadden mcfadden read the printouts and added a and the crew apparently i wonder what the hell this is all about no one answered him the last person to arrive was mr brian willis of the fbi he held a printout in his hand the bureau just sent me this general he said actually while we were in the conference is that what you were talking about naylor glanced at it it was millers first satburst thats it but theres already been a second naylor said here general mcfadden said handing it to him naylor waited until willis had read it then said brian can you get on the horn to the fbi in philadelphia and see what they have on this leaseaire corporation and the pilot i think we should have that so do i willis agreed after a moments thought and then appeared to be wondering where he was to sit at naylors office conference table how about doing that now brian naylor asked hoping his voice didnt reveal his annoyance while were waiting for general potter use the phone booth if youd like he pointed to the cubicle with the desk chair and secure telephone willis nodded said oh sure okay and walked into the small room he was still on the telephone when general potter returned up and running boss he said okay good naylor looked around the room everybodys here and everybodys read the two satbursts from angola right everybody nodded okay naylor went on then lets get started he sat down raised the lid of the laptop and turned it on lets do two things he began when all but willis had taken seats lets do worstcase scenario and in the military order junior man first when it came to seniority among the liaison officers somewhat important for some things naylor had used what he thought of as the george orwell theory of seniority all pigs are equal but some pigs are more equal than others all the liaison officers he had decreed were to have the assimilated rank of major general and rank between them was to be determined by how long they had been assigned to centcom that made brian willis of the fbi the junior man he was the fourth fbi liaison officer naylor had sent back the first three as unsuitable fremont had had only one predecessor willis slipped into a chair at the conference table i talked to the sac in philadelphia he began he got the first message from the bureau but not the second itll probably be there in a couple of minutes naylor said are they going to find out what they can about the pilot and the company what is it leaseaire they already knew something about them general willis said andout of schooljerry lowell the sac said wed give fivetoone that hartford is somehow going to be involved im afraid i dont quite understand that naylor said insurance general willis said with a sly smile this leaseaire outfit has been stumbling along for a long time on the edge of bankruptcy their airplane is quote stolen unquote and they get paid you did tell him that the cia guy said there was no indication that the pilot was checking out of his hotel naylor said thats what they call setting the scene general willis explained patiently it looks as if he wasnt planning to leave we decide he was forced to leave to fly the plane he turns up in south africa or someplace and says yes thats whats happened from our standpoint naylor said if the airplane was stolen to collect the insurance he puts it on autopilot and aims it out over the ocean willis interjected and then goes out the back door by now that airplane is probably on the bottom of the sea as i was saying naylor said a little sharply from our standpoint thats a bestcase scenario the airplane will not be used in some kind of terrorist activity i know im speaking out of turn allan general mcfadden said yeah you are shut up and wait your turn and dont call me by my first name in the presence of our subordinates you have the floor general naylor said i had a flash armageddon worstcase scenario as soon as i came in here general mcfadden said i mean think about it whats missing is an old airplane without the range to make a nuisance of itself anywhere important with one exception think about this what these ragheads are really trying to do is get all the other ragheads united against us right and so far theyre not doing so hot right so what would really piss off all the worlds ragheads an american airplane crashing into that black thingwhatever it isin mecca they call that the kaba general mcfadden general potter interrupted muslims believe that it was built by adam then rebuilt by ibrahim and his son ismail its a brick structure a ten on the holy scale where the vatican is maybe a five if you consider that at least the catholics let others in to worship to which general mcfadden said resuming the floor all the ragheads make a pilgrimage he paused to glower at potter for his interruption potter undaunted smiled at him would the ragheads believe another raghead had done that hell no they wouldnt mcfadden went on especially when the plane was traceable to us and the body of an american pilot was found in the wreckage george naylor asked its a little farfetched sir general potter said but it could be done and i have to agree with general mcfadden that it would indeed cause our muslim brothers to think even less of us than they do now all of them potter mcfadden said every goddamned one of them out of the corner of his eye naylor saw activity on the laptop screen and dropped his eyes to it this just came back channel for gen pottersgtmaj

may natalie cohen the national security advisor said into her telephone she was a small lightskinned woman who wore her hair in a pageboy its me natalie her caller said the thick carolina accent unmistakable yes mr president i just finished reading the seven oclock summary yes mr president natalie as the last item or the nexttolast item theres an airplane missing in angola whats that all about we dont know much mr president but i checked with the air force and they dont seem to think it poses a threat to the us at least so far as making it a flying bomb is concerned its too small and doesnt have enough range to fly here there was some concern that it might be used to crash into our embassy there or in south africa but the time for thatif it was to be immediately done after it was takenhas passed right now we just dont know what happened to it dont you mean natalie they just dont know sir our enormous and enormously expensive intelligence community the president said we you and me natalie are supposed to get the intelligence they are supposed to come up with it and then give it to you and me right yes mr president thats the way its supposed to work and they havent been doing that very well lately have they mr president they havent and we both know it the president said she didnt reply sorry i didnt mean to unload on you the president said i didnt think you did mr president i understand your frustration im often frustrated myself i wish i could think of some way to shake them up the president said any ideas im afraid not mr president matt hall and his wife are coming to supper you interested im at your call mr president but i really have made plans well ill see what matt has to say and then you can tell me tomorrow morning what you think whats the buzzword buzzphrase thinking out of the box dr cohen you are absolutely right as soon as matt walks in im going to hand him a stiff drink and tell him to start thinking out of the box she chuckled see you in the morning natalie have a nice night thank you mr president and when you come in in the morning i hope youll be able to tell me we have found this missing airplane i hope so too mr president i just realized natalie that im not kidding maybe matt will have some ideas im sure he will mr president good night natalie good night mr president she broke the connection with her finger but did not replace the handset she pushed a button on the base that automatically connected her to another instrument on the secure network hall a male voice said a moment later a headsup matt i know where youre going tonight he wants to discuss with you ways to shake up what he described as our enormous and enormously expensive intelligence community oh hell thank you natalie i owe you a big one yeah she agreed what lit his fire this time do you know somebody stole an airplane in angola that caught his eye mine too thanks again natalie have fun matt she said with a laugh and hung up chapter iii one the oval office the white house pennsylvania avenue nw washington dc may natalie matt the president of the united states said would you stay a minute please dr natalie cohen the national security advisor and the hon matt hall secretary of homeland security who were sitting on the same couch and both of whom had started to get up relaxed against the cushions hall then leaned forward and picked up his unfinished cup of coffee from the coffee table the president waited until the others in the room had filed out and then motioned to the secret service agent at the door to close it cohen and hall looked at the president who seemed to be gathering his thoughts finally he smiled and spoke maybe i missed something just now the president said but i didnt hear from anyone that anyone knows any more about that airliner that went missing in angola than anyone did yesterday cohen and hall exchanged glances but neither said anything and i thinki may be wrong the intelligence community is so enormous that sometimes i just cant remember every agency whos part of itthat we had in here just now just about everybody who should know whats going on with that airplane maybe not all of them maybe just a few of them but certainly at least one of them wouldnt you agree mr president dr cohen said i checked with the cia and the air force again this morning they are agreed that there is virtually no possibility of that airplane being able to fly hereor for that matter to europewithout being detected thats reassuring natalie and is that the reason would you say that nobody mentioned this missing airplane or maybei realize this may sound as if im a little cynicalwas it because they hoped i wouldnt notice that they have no idea what the hells going on with that airplane mr president hall spoke up im sure that theyand that means the entire intelligence community sirare working on it come on matt the president said we know that he paused and then looked at dr cohen remember what we talked about last night natalie i told you when matt came for supper i was going to ask him to think out of the boxi have no idea what that really meansabout this yes i do mr president she said and looked at hall that i wished i could think about some way to shake up the intelligence community the president went on yes sir she said and paused dr cohen was fully aware that the man sitting at the desk across the room was the most powerful man in the world and that she worked for him and that meant she was supposed to do what he said not argue with him unless she was absolutely convinced he was dead wrong when she saw it as her duty to argue with him and she wasnt absolutely sure he was right about this or absolutely sure he was wrong are you sure you want to shake them up sir she asked even more than the commission report did if theyre not doing their job the president said they deserve to be shaken up that dr cohen thought is a statement of policy and i dont think its open for discussion and doesnt this missing business give us the chance to find out whether theyre doing their job or not the president asked something realworld and realtime above and beyond what the commission report called for he paused this could put us ahead of the curve very possibly it does sir she said it looks to me and matt like an ideal situation to run an internal review the president went on without it interfering with anything important and without anybody having to know about it unless we catch somebody with their pants down he heard what he said sorry natalie that slipped out but wouldnt you agree with matt so matt too has decided arguing with him about this would be futile whats your idea matt she asked as i understand what the president wants hall said its for someoneone manto check everybodys intel files and compare them against both what he can find out and what the others have found out and when isnt that a lot to throw at one man she asked thats a lot of work for one man but i think that if we used even as few as three or four people on this the question of whos in charge would come up theyd probably be stumbling over each other trying to look good and the more people involved the greater the risk that somebody would suspect something like this was going on thats the idea natalie the president said what do you think i think matt has resigned himself to there being what did he say an internal review and he wants to keep it small lowkey and if at all possible a secret have you got the man to do it she asked i asked him last night to think about that the president said i think i have the man sir hall said who the president asked my executive assistant hall said that goodlooking young guy who speaks hungarian cohen asked hall nodded you know him natalie the president asked i dont know him but i saw him translating for matt at a reception at the hungarian embassy she said why do you need a hungarian translator matt the president asked with a smile the hungarian came with the package hall said he speaks seven maybe more languages among them hungarian hes a linguist the president asked hall understood the meaning of the question how is a linguist going to do what we need here well that too sir but hes also a green beret a green beret the president asked his tone suggesting that the term had struck a sympathetic chord yes sir hall replied hes a special forces major i went to general naylor and asked him if he could come up with somebody who had more than language skills he sent charley to me hes a good man mr president he can do this makes sense to me cohen said matt thinks hes smart which is good enough for me and no one is going to suspect that a special forces major would be given a job like this id like to meet this guy the president said okay what else do we need to get this started well need all the intelligence filings hall said i suppose natalie will have most of themor synopses of them anyway mostly all i get is the synopses cohen said i have to ask for the original filing and raw data if i want to look at that the president thought that over a moment we dont know that somebody is not going to try to fly this airplane into the white house or the golden gate bridge hall opened his mouth to say something but the president held up his hand in a gesture meaning he didnt want to be interrupted so i think it could be reasonably argued that the missing is something in which homeland security would have a natural interest hall and cohen nodded so natalie why dont you send a memo telling everybody to send the intelligence filings to matt and the raw data mr president hall asked the president nodded all filings and all raw data from everybody the president ordered yes sir mr president dr cohen said okay were on our way the president said two hunter army airfield savannah georgia may the cessna citation x attracted little attention as it touched down smoothly just past the threshold of the runway possibly because one of the worlds most famous airplanes was moving majestically down the parallel taxiway the copilot of the citation looked at the enormous airplane as they rolled past it and turned to the pilot as the pilot reported sixohone on the ground twentynine the copilot said the pilot nodded sixohone take four right to the parallel hunter ground control ordered the smaller jet be advised there is a on the parallel turn left on the parallel hold at the threshold understand four right the pilot replied then turn left to hold at the threshold thank you for advising about taxiway traffic i might have not seen that airplane youre welcome sixohone the ground traffic controller replied with a chuckle in his voice and by the way hunter the pilot said i think thats a vca not a thank you so much sixohone the controller replied duly noted hunter air force twoninertriplezero i have that cute little airplane in sight and will endeavor not to run over it twoninertriplezero the pilot of the citation said its not nice to make fun of little airplanes especially ones flown by birdmen in their dotage who is that the copilot of the citation asked jerry it sounds like him the pilot said both the pilot and the copilot of the citation knew air force vca tail number well both had more than a thousand hours at the controls of it or its identical twin tail number flying the specially configured boeingswhose call sign changed to air force one whenever the president of the united states was on boardhad been their last assignment before their retirement twentynine both believed was now being flownor actually both strongly suspected just taxied to the end of the runway for a precautionary engine runupby colonel jerome t mccandlish usaf whom they had after exhaustive tests and examinations signed off on two years before as qualified to fly the commander in chief the proofin addition to the sound of his voiceseemed to be that he had recognized the tail number on the citation and felt sure he knew who was flying it citation tail number nc was the aircraft provided for the secretary of the department of homeland security although there was nothing to suggest this in its appearance it was intended to look likeand did look likemost other citations and with the exception of some very special avionics not available on the civilian market it was essentially just like every other citation x in the air miss it jack the pilot inquired as fell behind them sure the copilot said dont you the question is would i go back tomorrow the pilot said and the answer is no i dont think so this is just about as much fun and its a hell of a lot less responsibility i was going to say that but work its a lot less work i agree when the time had come for them to be replaced as pilotsincommand of the presidential aircraftsix months apartthey had been offered within reason any assignment appropriate to full colonels and command pilots there were problems with the word appropriate they were led to understand that although colonels command groups it would not really be appropriate for them to be given command of for example one of the groups in the us air force special operations command that would be a great flying job but the cold facts were that they had spent very little time at the controls of various c aircraft such as the spectre and spooky gunships best known for their fierce cannons and actually knew very little about what special operations really did the same was true of taking command of a fighter wing or a bomber wing although both had once been fighter pilots and bomber pilots that had been early on in their careers decades ago and now they were almost in their fifties what was appropriate it seemed was command of one of the flying training wings in the nineteenth air force they had training experience and knowing that they were being taught how to fly by pilots who had flown the commander in chief in air force one would certainly inspire fledgling birdmen so would becoming a professor at the air force academy be appropriate and for the same reasons it would also be appropriate for them to become air attaches at a major american embassy somewhere they certainly had plenty of experience being around senior officials foreign and domestic but that would not be a flying assignment and they both wanted to continue flying their other option was to retire and get a civilian flying job the problem there was the strong airline pilots unions which made absolutely sure every newly hired airline pilot started at the bottom of the seniority list no matter how much time one had at the controls of a vca those airline pilot positions went only to pilots who had worked their way up the seniority ladder in favor of retirement however was that the air force retirement pay wasnt bad and they would get it in addition to what they would make sitting in the copilots seat of a twinengine turboprop of itsybitsy airlines and both had just about decided thats what it would be when the ragheads flew skyjacked s into the world trade center and the pentagon and the pennsylvania ground the department of homeland security had come out of that and with that the secretary of homeland security even before congress had passed the necessary legislationthere had been no doubt that it was going to happencertain steps were taken among them providing the secretary designate with suitable air transportation he didnt need a vca of course or even another of the airlinersized transports in the air force inventory what he needed was a small fast airplane to carry him on a moments notice wherever he had to go the citation x which was capable of carrying eight passengers milessan francisco for example to washingtonin fewer than four hours was just what was needed there is always a financial cushion in the budget of the secret service to take care of unexpected expenses and this was used to rent the citation from cessna part of the rationale to do this was that the secret service was to be transferred from the treasury department to the department of homeland security anyway the secret service had some pilots but would need four more to fly the secretarys new citation all the t s were crossed and the is dotted on the appropriate civil service commission application for employment forms of course and the applications examined carefully and honestly but no one was surprised when two abouttoretire air force colonels who had been flying the president were adjudged to be best qualified for appointment as pilots aircraft gs step to fill two of the four newly established positions citation thirtyfiftyfive be advised that two hueys are moving to the threshold hunter ground control announced just as the citation x turned left onto the parallel roger that we have them in sight the copilot said and then added jerry remember to lock the brakes before you start your runup the cessna pilot chuckled through the windshield they could see two army uhh helicopters slowly approaching the threshold of the runway about twenty feet off the ground the pilot touched the announce button mr secretary we can see the choppers me too frank thank you secretary hall called back there were four passengers in the citation today secretary hall joel isaacson the supervisory secret service agent in charge of halls security detail tom mcguire another secret service bodyguard and an army major today in civilian clothing whose code name for secret service purposes was don juan the secretarys code name was big boy which more than likely made reference to his size and appearance why the major was don juan wasnt known for sure it could have something to do with his spanish or italiansounding name castillo or frank and jack had privately joked it could have to do with what the secret service secretly knew about him at thirtysix he was a great big guya little bigger than the secretarygoodlooking nice thick head of hair blueeyed no wedding ring andconsidering the foregoinghe probably got laid a lot they had no idea what his function in the department was or for that matter if he was even in the department and of course they didnt ask if it was important for them to know more than his name they would be told he accompanied the secretary often enough to have his own code name and on the occasions when he did so in uniform he sported not only the usual merit badgesparachutists wings senior army aviators wings a combat infantry badgebut also a ring signifying that he had graduated from the united states military academy at west point they found it interesting that when he took off his uniform he also took off the west point ring that offered the interesting possibility that he wasnt a soldier at all but put on the uniformand the west point ringas a disguise when that was required their best guess however was that he was in fact an officer probably a west pointer and more than likely some kind of liaison officer probably between the department and the army or the defense department the two uhlhs touched down on the grass just outside the threshold to the active runway as the citation x rolled to a stop the secret service agents got out of their seats and opened the stair door and then went outside the pilot of the closest huey got out she was slight and trim with short blond hair she tucked her flight helmet under her arm and walked toward the citation x the secretary deplaned first carrying a briefcase and don juan got off last good afternoon mr secretary the pilot said saluting good afternoon colonel the secretary said sir im lieutenant colonel messinger the pilot said ill be flying you to the island i know youre familiar with the aircraft but ill have to ask this gentleman hes familiar with it colonel the secretary said i think youre probably both graduates of the same flying school youre a huey driver sir yes maam i am don juan said and you outrank me colonel colonel the secretary said visibly amused by the interchange this is major charley castillo how do you do major lieutenant colonel messinger said offering her hand and a firm handshake the weathers fine its a short hopabout thirtyfive milesi already have the clearance to penetrate the p area so there wont be marine jets from beaufort around and anytime the secretary is ready we can go she made a gesture toward the helicopters joel isaacson and tom mcguire walked to the more distant aircraft and got in major castillo knew the drill the huey with the secret service agents in it would wait until the one carrying the secretary took off and then follow it until they reached their destination then the secret service huey would land first to make sure there were no problems and then radio the second helicopter that it could land he thought it was a little silly they were going to the carolina white house and if there was something wrong there they would certainly have heard about it but its standing operating procedure which is like holy writ in the us army colonel messinger doublechecked to see that sergeant first class delaney her crew chief had properly strapped in the secretary and the major in civvies smiled at them both and then got back in the right seat a moment later the huey went light on the skids lifted into the air dropped its nose and began to move ever more rapidly across the airfield cooler air rushed in the big doors left open on either side of the helicopter against the georgia heat major castillo unfastened his seat belt and started to stand sir sergeant first class delaney began to protest major castillo put his finger to his lips signifying silence sergeant first class delaney visibly upset looked to the secretary for help the secretary signaled the sergeant that if castillo wanted to stand it was fine with him with a firm grip on a fuselage rib major castillo stood in the doorway for about two minutes looking down at what he could see of fort stewart then he quickly resumed his seat and strapped himself in i once spent a summer here sergeant he said smiling at delaney mostly washing georgia mud from tracks and bogie wheels i havent been back since yes sir sergeant delaney said sergeant the secretary said smiling if you dont tell the colonel we wont yes sir on the other hand charley the secretary said i have seen people take a last dive out of one of these things when there was a sudden change of course sir castillo said i have a finely honed sense of selfpreservation not to worry so i have been reliably informed the secretary said i think the colonel likes you charley she spent much more time strapping you in than she did me its my cologne sir castillo said eau de harleydavidson it gets them every time the secretary laughed sergeant first class delaney smiled somewhat uneasily jesus delaney thought what if that big bastard had taken a dive out the door three the carolina white house hilton head island south carolina may the president of the united states was sitting in one of the upholstered wicker rocking chairs on the porch of an eightyearold house that had been carefully designed and built so that most people thought it was bona fide antebellum and surprised that such a house had been built way back then overlooking the atlantic ocean the president who was wearing a somewhat faded yellow polo shirt with the brooks brothers sheep embroidered on the chest sharply creased but obviously not new khaki trousers and highly polished loafers was drinking heineken beer from the bottle a galvanized bucket on the floor beside his chair held a reserve buried in ice the president pushed himself out of his chair and set his beer bottle on the wicker table as a white gmc yukon with heavily tinted windows pulled up the driver got out quickly and ran around the front of the yukon in a vain attempt to open the drivers door before the secretary could do so himself hey matt the president greeted the secretary his accent sounding comfortable at home in its native carolina the secretary walked up on the porch and offered his hand good afternoon mr president he said its always a pleasure to see you matt the president said with a smile major carlos guillermo castillo aviation us army stood by the yukon waiting for some indication of what he should do the president looked at him and smiled and then turned his back on the yukon dont tell me thats your texmex linguist the president asked thats him mr president the secretary said that guys name is guillermo castillo carlos guillermo castillo the secretary said smiling yes sir mr president the president chuckled and then with a smile and a friendly wave ordered castillo onto the porch welcome to the island major the president said offering him his hand thank you mr president wheres home major the president asked san antonio sir castillo said ive got two questions for you major the president said the first is can i offer you a beer yes sir thank you very much castillo said the president took two bottles of beer from the bucket and handed one to castillo and the other to secretary hall and then produced a bottle opener every time i try to twist one of the easyopen caps off i cut the hell out of my hand the president announced he waited a beat then added with a grin especially when theyre not twistoff caps he waved hall and castillo into wicker rockers and then sat down himself my mother would tell me major that a question like this is tacky but i just have to ask it youre really not what i expected where did a fairskinned blueeyed guy like you get a name like carlos guillermo castillo my fathers family sir is texmex my mother was german i didnt mean to embarrass you the president said the question comes up frequently sir castillo said usually followed by are you adopted to which i reply sir no its a question of genes the president chuckled then grew serious i guess the secretary has brought you up to speed on this he said yes sir he has what did he tell you the president asked castillos somewhat bushy left eyebrow rose momentarily as he visibly gathered his thoughts as i understood the secretary mr president castillo began a boeing which had been parked at the luanda angola airfield for fourteen months took off without clearance on may and hasnt been seen since the incident is being investigated by just about all of our intelligence agencies none of which has come up with anything about where the aircraft is or what happened to it the secretary sir led me to believe that he wants me to conduct an investigation i want you to conduct an investigation the president interrupted yes sir the purpose of my investigation would be to serve as sort of a check on the investigations of the various agencies involved what id like to know the president said with a dry smile on his face and in his voice is what did they know and when did they know it secretary hall chuckled there is nothing to suggest the president said that any of the agencies looking into the gone missing have either done anything they shouldnt have or not done something they should have or that anyone suspects they will in the future you should have that clear in your mind from the beginning yes sir on the other hand the president went on i cant help but have in mind that a highly placed officer in the agency who was in the pay of the russians for years was not even suspected of doing anything wrongdespite his living a lifestyle he could obviously not support on his cia payuntil against considerable resistance from the agency bureaucracy an investigation was launched youre familiar with that story yes sir i am and thenit came far too belatedly to lightthe fbi had a highly placed officer in charge of counterintelligence who had taken a million dollars from the russians in exchange for information that led to the deaths of people we had working for us in moscow and elsewhere yes sir i know that story too thats what the agency would call the worst possible scenario the president went on but there is another scenarioscenariosthat while falling short of moles actually in the pay of a foreign intelligence service can do just as much harm to the country as a mole can do are you following me major i hope so sir intelligenceas you probably are well awareis too often colored or maybe diluted or poisoned i learned by three factors im not sure which is worst one of them is interagency rivalry making their agency look good and another look bad another is to send up intelligence that they believe is what their superiors want to hear or the reverse not sending up intelligence that they think their superiors dont want to hear and yet another is an unwillingness to admit failure you understand this im sure you must have seen examples yourself yes sir i have matt secretary hall and i the president said are agreed that in the intelligence community there is too much of a tendency to rely on what the other fellow has to say i mean in the absence of anything specific the cia will go with what the fbi tells them or the oni on what the dia has developed youre still with me yes sir some of that obviously has to do with funding funding is finite one agency feels that if another agency has come up with something theres no sense in duplicating the effort which means spending money thats just human nature yes sir i understand and then secretary hall came up with the idea that one way to have a look at whats really going on in the field would be to have a quiet look at an active case where more than one agencythe more the betteris involved this gonemissing airplane is a case where not just two or three agencies but most of them are involved i dont have to get into that with you do i major the jealously guarded turf of the various agencies no sir im familiar with the statements of mission okay the president said in the case of this missing airplane the agency has primary responsibility but the state department has been told to find out what they can and the defense intelligence agency and dhs because one scenario is that the plane was stolen for use as a flying bomb against a target in this country there is not much credence being placed in that story but the fact is we just dont know what we do know is that we cannot afford to allow itor any other act of terrorismto happen again and certainly not as a result of interagency squabbling or one agency deciding it doesnt want to spend money because it a would be duplication and b could be more profitably spent on something else so that gives secretary hall reason to send someone to find out what he can because the agency and the others are involved and he will have accessat least in theoryto what intelligence they develop he will not be expected to send a team just go through the motions with someone junior who can be spared you with me major yes sir i think i am the question then became who could secretary hall send on this mission and he answered that by saying he had just the man and he thought i would like him because he was just like vernon walters you know who general walters was of course yes sir i do well are you like vernon walters major you do speak a number of languages fluently yes sir russian yes sir hungarian yes sir how many in all seven or eight sir castillo said depending on whether spanish and texmex are counted as one language or two the president chuckled how did you come to speak russian he asked when i was growing up sir my mother thought it would be useful if the russians won we lived right on the eastwest german border sir and hungarian the president asked an elderly grandaunt who was hungarian lived with us sir i got it from her general walters the president began then paused i suppose protocol would dictate that i refer to him as ambassador walters but i think he liked being a general far more than he ever liked being an ambassador anyway he told me that languages just came to him naturally that they hadnt been acquired by serious study is that the way it is with you major yes sir pretty much the president studied castillo carefully for a moment and then asked you think youre up to whats being asked of you major yes sir major carlos guillermo castillo said confidently okay its settled the president said i was about to say good luck thank you for coming and one of the hueys will take you back to fort stewart to wait for matt for the secretary theres no reason for him to stay at fort stewart mr president hall said actually i promised him the long weekend off if we finished here quickly the president nodded then asked castillo well we are done any plans yes sir i promised my grandmother a visit shes where outside san antonio sir would a chopper ride to atlanta cut some travel time for you major yes sir it would but a ride back to fort stewart is all ill need sir hows that sir im going to meet a cousin at savannah were going to texas together the president raised his voice nathan a very large very black man appeared almost immediately from inside the house he had an earphone in his ear and a bulge under his arm suggested the presence of either a large pistol or perhaps an uzi right on his heels was one of the secretarys secret service bodyguards yes mr president see that major castillo gets to a huey and that it takes him back to stewart the president ordered yes mr president the president offered castillo his hand and put a hand on his shoulder well see each other again the president said thank you ill do my best mr president im sure you will the president said secretary hall shook castillos hand hall said see you in my office at noon on tuesday a secret service yukon rolled up a moment later the president and secretary hall watched as castillo got in the front seat and they waved as the suv started off a very interesting guy matt the president said the secret service dubbed him don juan the secretary said i never asked them why the president chuckled where did you get him matt from general naylor the secretary said i got on my knees and told him i really needed him more than he did thats right the president said you and naylor go back a long way dont you to vietnam the secretary said he was a brandnew captain and i was a brandnew shakeandbake buck sergeant a what the president asked they were so short of noncoms mr president that they had sort of an ocs to make them i went there right out of basic training got through it and became what was somewhat contemptuously known as a shakeandbake sergeant where did naylor get him the president asked actually he and charley go a long way back too the secretary said charley the president parroted he doesnt look much like a carlos does he the secretary said yeah i call him charley so where did naylor get him where does he come from its a long story mr president the secretary said the president looked at his watch if youre not in a rush to get back the president said motioning toward the wicker rockers and the tub of iced bottles of beer i have a little time chapter iv winter one near bad hersfeld kreis hersfeldrotenburg hesse west germany march that has to be it netty mrs elaine naylor a trim palefaced redhead of thirtyfour said to mrs natalie netty lustrous a trim blackhaired lady of fortyfour pointing its exactly threepointthree klicks from the little chapel yeah netty lustrous said slowing the nearly new black mercedesbenz sel and then turning off the winding narrow country road through an open gate in a tenfoothigh steelmesh fence onto an even more narrow road fifty yards down the road a heavyset man stepped into the middle of it he was wearing a heavy loden cloth jacket and cap and sturdy boots a hunting rifle was slung muzzle downward from his shoulder netty stopped the mercedes and the man walked up to it guten tag the man said is this the road to the house in the woods netty asked in german frau lustrous the man asked jet willkomen the man said stepped back and somewhat grandly waved her down the road netty smiled at him danke schoen she replied and drove on i didnt know anything was in season elaine said in obvious reference to the hunting rifle the man had been carrying i dont think anything is netty chuckled but jaegermeisters can carry weapons anytime in case they run into dangerous game in the woods or americans without invitations elaine asked i wouldnt be surprised from what fred tells me if there were three or four jaegermeisters around here looking for things that dont belong the road wound upward for about a kilometerwhich both women as army wives had learned to call a klickthrough an immaculate pine forest and then the trees were gone and what had to be das haus im wald was visible it was large but simple it looked netty thought somehow out of place in the open country like a house from the city that had suddenly been transplanted to the country halfway between the trees and the house was another jaegermeister with a rifle slung from his shoulder he didnt get into the road but stepped to the side of it and took off his cap in respect as the mercedes rolled past him the left of the double doors of das haus im wald opened and a slim woman in a black dress her blond hair gathered in a bun at her neck stepped out onto a small stone verandah shrugging into a woolen shawl as she did so is that her elaine asked i dont know netty said ive never met her and i dont think ive ever seen a picture of her fred knows heror at least has met her he knew her father pretty well fred was colonel frederick j lustrous armor united states army to whom netty had been married for more than half her life netty pulled the car in beside another mercedeswhich she recognized to be that of oberburgermeister eric liptz of fuldaand stopped as the blond woman in the shawl came off the verandah thats the liptzes car right elaine asked meaning inges here i hope so netty said but thats their car she unfastened her seat belt opened the door and got out mrs lustrous the slim blond woman asked in english netty lustrous netty said welcome to the house in the woods the blond woman said offering her hand im erika gossinger her english is accentless netty thought neither brit nor american and she didnt say erika von und zu gossinger interesting on purpose the von und zu business reflected the german fascination obsession with social class it identified someone whose family had belonged to the landowning nobility was it that erika felt that was nonsense or that she was trying to be democratic or just that she had just dropped the phrase for convenience thank you having us netty said thank you for coming erika said elaine came around the front of the mercedes this is my good friend frau elaine naylor frau gossinger netty said the invitation engraved in german had said that frau erika von und zu gossinger would be pleased to receive at luncheon at das haus im wald frauoberst natalie lustrous and one lady friend a separate engraved card in the envelope had a map showing how to reach the property which was several klicks outside bad hersfeld the women shook hands our friend inge is already here erika said as is pastor dannberg why dont we go in the house thank you netty said inge liptz a trim blonde in her early thirties was in the library with a small wizened nearly bald old man in a clerical collar pastor heinrich dannberg who was first among equals in the evangalische hierarchy of the area inge who was drinking champagne walked up to netty and elaine and kissed both of them on the cheek i see were all in uniform she said at a social gathering a year or so before she had smilingly observed that she and netty and elaine were very similarly dressed in black dresses with a single strand of pearls netty had replied i dont know about you inge but for elaine and me this is the prescribed uniform of the day for an event like this inge whose husband was the oberburgermeister of fulda had never heard that before and thought it was hilarious you know pastor dannberg of course erika asked yes of course netty said how nice to see you pastor dannberg he took her hand in his made a gesture of kissing it then clicked his heels and said frau lustrous and then repeated the process with elaine a maid extended a silver tray with champagne flutes again welcome to the house in the woods erika said raising her glass i dont think you have been here before have you no i havent your husband has many times over the years erika said he and my father have taken many boar together yes hes told me netty said i first met your husband frauoberst lustrous pastor dannberg said when he was a lieutenant and he and his colonel came to saint johans school with a truck loaded with boar they had takenvery near here as a matter of factand which they gave to us to feed our students i didnt know that netty said oh yes and they did that often it was a great service to us the woods were overrun with boarthey had not been harvested in the last years of the war we needed the meat of course and additionally the boar we knew were going to cause the badly needed corn crops severe damage i have ever since regarded him as both a friend and a christian gentleman thats very kind of you to say so pastor netty said and it is so why do i feel im being set up for something and my father too thought of colonel lustrous as an old and good friend erika said and there it goes again my husband frau gossinger was very saddened by my father killing himself and my brother by driving drunk at an insane speed on the autobahn erika said very bitterly erika pastor dannberg said both warningly and compassionately its the truth erika said and the truth i believe the bible says shall make you free it also says judge not lest ye be judged pastor dannberg said i meant no offense erika said and certainly none was taken netty said erika signaled to the maid for another flute of champagne i really had meant to say two things erika said when shed taken a healthy sip of the champagne the first was to tell you that were having roast boar today sort of in memory of all the boar your husband and my father and brother took together over the years what a nice thought netty said and thought there it is again whats her agenda and the second was to suggest that although you and frau naylor and i are meeting for the first time this is really a gathering of friends you two and inge i know are very close the pastor has been my good friend in good times and bad since i was a little girl and hes told you how he feels about oberst lustrous who was a good friend of my father and my brother what im driving at is that i would be honored to be permitted to address you by your christian names oh i would really like that netty said and is this where we get the pitch welcome to my home friend natalie erika said please my friends call me netty erika smiled welcome to my home friends netty and elaine she said and kissed both of them on the cheek and then inge liptz kissed all three of them on the cheek why do i think inge is on the edge of tears what the hell is going on here a maid announced the luncheon was served the dining room was on the third floor of das haus im wald a dumbwaiter brought the food from the kitchen on the first floor one wall of the dining room was covered with a huge heavy curtain when erika von und zu gossinger threw a switch and the curtains slowly opened netty and elaine saw that a huge plateglass window offered a view of farmlands and of the border between the peoples democratic republic of germany and west germany netty knew a good deal about the border shed spent much of her life married to a man who patrolled it first hed served as a second lieutenant in a jeep or armored car and now as the colonel of the regiment responsible for miles of it the border was marked with a thirteenfoottall steelmesh fence topped with barbed wire watchtowers had been built wherever necessary so the fence and the land leading up to it could not only be kept under observation but swept with machinegun fire some of it automatically triggered when a detection device of one kind or another sensed someone in the forbidden zone the forbidden zone several hundred yards wide had been cleared of trees and was heavily planted with mines there were two roads one on either side of the fence one for east german border guards and the other for west german border guards and the vehicles of the eleventh armored cavalry regiment thats gossinger land over there erika said just about as far as you can see youll notice i did not say used to be gossinger land one day the family will get it back netty said what came to her mind that fence is an obscenity yes it is erika agreed simply what does she do sit here and look at what the familys lost or is this another part of the setup i now know is coming well why dont we sit down and have our luncheon erika said pastor dannberg said a brief grace and then two maids served a course of roast boar roast potatoes spinach and sauerkraut glasses were filled with liebfraumilch netty sipped hers very slowly and held her hand politely over her halffull glass when one of the maids tried to fill it dessert was bread pudding cognac was offered but declined all around except by frau erika von und zu gossinger who held her snifter in her palm not nearly long enough to warm it before taking a hefty swallow elaine frau erika von und zu gossinger said i hope you wont take this to mean that inge is a gossip but she tells me that not only are you and netty friends but your husbands as well i guess that was the opening statement allan netty said elaines husband saved my husbands life in vietnam theyre very close the reason i brought that up erika said is that i am about to get into a subject i would really rather share only with friends id be happy to take a walk elaine said id rather you stayed netty said frau erika nodded netty she said im afraid im going to try to impose on your friendship and your husbands friendship in dealing with a matter of some delicacy i cant imagine you imposing netty said oh yes i can and im sure my husband netty continued would be honored to try to do whatever you asked of him thank you erika said a little over twelve years ago it was on february thirteenth a child a boy was born out of wedlock to an eighteenyearold girl thats always sad netty said fivetoone daddys an american the father was an american erika said a helicopter pilot no fooling how many thousands of times has some gi knocked up a german girl and promptly said auf wiedersehn pastor dannberg slid an envelope across the table to netty thats the boy he said hes a fine young man very bright netty opened the envelope and took out a photograph of a skinny blond boy of she guessed about twelve hell she said over twelve years ago the boy was wearing short pants kneehigh white stockings a blue jacket with an insignia embroidered on the breast pocket a white shirt and tie and a cap sort of a shortbrimmed baseball cap with redcolored seams and the same insignia thats the uniform of saint johans school as i damn well know for all the marks i spent sending two of mine there okay so this poor kid not poor unfortunate saint johans is anything but cheap is in saint johans which explains why pastor dannberg is involved handsome child netty said and slid the photograph to elaine beautiful child elaine said it has become necessary for the mother to get in contact with the boys father erika said a question of child support netty said im sure my husband will do whatever he can no not of child support the fathers been supporting the boy ill be damned a horny sonofabitch whos met his obligations i dont think i know he doesnt know the boy exists erika said no effort was ever made to contact him my god why not may i ask why now netty said the boys mother is very ill erika said and there is no other family oh how sad netty said and what will happen if freddy can track daddy down is that he will deny swearing on a stack of bibles that he ever took a fraulein to bed all the time he was here and that he certainly has no intention of starting now to support somebody elses bastard goddammit men should be castrated at birth but what did she say it wasnt a question of child support netty carefully considered her words then continued as im sure youre aware and you pastor dannberg im ashamed to say that this boy is not the first child to be abandoned by an american soldier do you have the fathers name jorge castillo erika said he was a helicopter pilot and he was from texas may i speak bluntly netty asked after a long moments thought of course i think my husband can probably find this manthat seems an unusual namebut i also think its possible even likely that this man will be less than willing to acknowledge a child who as you said he doesnt even know hes had weve thought about that of course pastor dannberg said and however remote erika added there is the possibility that he will be pleased to learn he has a son and be willing to assume his parental obligations there is also the possibility that pigs can be taught to whistle in twelve years if this guy wasnt already married poppa already has a wife and children and the last thing he wants his wife to know is he left a bastard in germany who he is now expected to take into his happy home please believe me when i say im trying to be helpful netty said but there are certain questions i just have to ask i understand does the mother have other children no she never married well that answers my next question what does mammas husband have to say about this she raised the boy by herself and never married she never married and she raised the boy by herself erika said this is an indelicate question netty said forgive me for asking it but i have to how does she know this man is the father she knows no other possibility exists he was her first and only lover they were together three times the first night and then the next i really hate to say this but how can we know that because im telling you erika said but erika how do you know netty pursued because we are talking about my son netty erika von und zu gossinger said two headquarters eleventh armored cavalry regiment downs barracks fulda hesse west germany march the sergeant major of the eleventh blackhorse armored cavalry regiment a stocky thirtynineyearold from altoona pennsylvania named rupert dieter put his shaven head in the door of the colonels office you have time for the colonels lady dieter asked colonel frederick j lustrous armor a tall muscular fortyfiveyearold was visibly surprised at the questionnetty almost never came to the officebut rose to the occasion there was some doubt in your mind sergeant major she told me to ask colonel sergeant major dieter said inform the lady nothing would give me greater pleasure lustrous said headquarters of the eleventh armored cav was a threestory masonry building builtlike most facilities occupied by the us armyin the years leading up to world war ii for the german army stables built for the horses of the wehrmacht now served as shops to maintain the tanks armored personnel carriers and wheeled vehicles used by the blackhorse to patrol the border between east and west germany fulda traces its history to a monastery built in ad it lies in the upper fulda river valley between the vogelsberg and rhoen mountain ranges since the beginning of the cold war it had been an article of faithwith which colonel lustrous personally if very privately strongly disagreedin the european command that when soviet tanks rolled into west germany they would come through the fulda gap the mission of the blackhorse was to patrol the border now marked by barbed wire observation towers mined fields and whatever else the east germans and their soviet mentors could think of to keep east germans from fleeing the benefits of marxistleninism and seeking a better life in west germany it was colonel lustrouss private beliefhe was a student of soviet tactics generally and of the red army order of battle in great detailthat if the red army did come through the fulda gap they would do so in such numbers that they would cut through the blackhorsewhich was after all just three squadrons spread out over a very lone section of the borderlike a hot knife through butter the most the blackhorse could do if soviet t tanks came would be to slow them down a little like a speed bump on a country road lustrous was confident that the men of the blackhorse would acquit themselves well if he was wrong and the russians came by that he meant they would not run at the first sight of the russians but fight manyperhaps mostof his men would die and the dead would be better off than those who survived and were marched off into soviet captivity lustrous was a student of how the red army treated its prisoners too lustrous knew a great deal about the soviets and their army he truly believed that know your enemy was a military principle right up there with dont drink on duty failure to abide by either would very likely get you killed he was now on his third tour on the border between east and west germany hed been a just out of west point second lieutenant assigned to the fourteenth constabulary squadron in bad hersfeld in the fourteenth had been redesignated the fourteenth armored cavalry regiment when captain lustrous returned to the border after service in the korean war and when colonel lustrous returned from vietnam he found the regiment was now the eleventh blackhorse armored cavalry the colors of the fourteenth having been furled for reasons he never really understood the desk behind which colonel lustrous now sat was the very same desk in the very same room of the very same building in the kasernenow called downs barracksbefore which lieutenant lustrous had once stoodliterally on the carpetwhile the then colonel had told him exactly how much of a disgrace he was to the regiment to cavalry and armor and the united states army in general colonel lustrous really didnt remember what he had done wrong only that if the colonel had eaten his ass out at such length and with such enthusiasm it had probably been pretty bad and was probably alcohol induced as netty whom he had married the day after hed graduated from the point had not yet joined him in germany to keep him under control he had served under the colonel again in the pentagon when there were two stars on each of the colonels epaulets and he had been a light colonel and there was no question in lustrouss mind that he now commanded the blackhorse because the colonelnow with four stars on each epaulethad told somebody he thought giving the blackhorse to freddy lustrous might be a pretty good idea lustrous who was in wellworn but crisply starched fatigues and wearing nonauthorized tankers boots stood up as his wife came in the office he thought as he often did that netty was really a goodlooking woman she wasnt twenty as she had been when they had married but three kids and all this time in the army had not in his judgment attacked her appearance as much as would be expected and to what do i owe this great if unexpected honor lustrous said i devoutly hope its not to tell me that it wasnt your fault but that serious physical damage has happened to the investment he was making reference to the mercedes sel it was far too grand an automobile for a colonel but lustrous found out that if you didnt have the army ship the battered family buick to germany when you were ordered there and instead on arrival bought one of the larger mercedes at the substantial discount offered by the daimlerbenz people you could drive the luxury car all through your tour then have the army ship it home for you then you could sell it in the states for more than you had paid in germany and so to lustrous in that sense the family car was the investment netty was not amused pissed or angry or both i need to talk to you freddy she said im glad youre here you want some coffee he asked sitting down and gesturing for her to take a seat no she said and then changed her mind yes i do thank you he spun in his chair to a table behind his desk which held a stainless steel thermos and half a dozen white china coffee mugs bearing the regimental insignia he poured an inch and a half of coffee into each of them that was the way they drank coffee no cream no sugar just an inch and a half it stayed hot that way and you tasted the coffee he stood up walked to her and handed her one of the mugs how was lunch he asked i dont think ill ever forget it netty said the colonel took a sip of coffee and thought which tells us that whatever is bothering her happened while she was at lunch who all was there lustrous asked as he walked back behind his desk well frauburgermeister liptz of course netty said and pastor dannberg of saint johans and frau erika von und zu gossinger inge liptz lustrous knew was the wife of fuldas mayor pastor dannberg was a tiny little man who ran with an iron hand not only saint johans church but the evangalische protestantcommunities of the area as well frau erika von und zu gossinger was the only daughter sort of the old maid aunt lustrous thought privatelyof the gossinger family who owned among a good deal else three of the newspapers serving the area the gossingerbrau brewery and a good deal of farmland lustrous had been surprised when netty had gotten the invitation to the house in the woods although he and the old man had been friends before he killed himself on the autobahn there had never been an invitation to the house for netty the old mans wife was dead his only son had never married and the daughter if she entertained socially did not so far as lustrous knew ever invite americans thats surprising lustrous said what was the invitation all about netty did not reply just the five of you he asked that was it fred netty said inge the pastor and frau erika elaine and me well what did you think of the house in the woods he asked im trying to frame my thoughts fred netty said a little impatiently sorry lovely lunch netty said roast boar her dining room overlooks the border while we were eating two of your patrols rolled by frau erika showed me what used to be their property on the other side of the fence ive been up there the last time was last year with her father when we put the radio link in i remember netty said somewhat impatiently okay here we go she went into her purse and came out with a photograph and handed it to her husband what am i looking at fred lustrous inquired one of our love children netty said bitterly really he asked as general george s patton used to say colonel lustrous thought a soldier who wont fuck wont fight and thats probably true but why cant the irresponsible sonsofbitches use a condom according to frau erika netty said the father is a chopper jockey who was here a dozen years ago just long enough to sow his seed how does she know that thats karl wilhelm von und zu gossinger netty said frau erikas only child the frau is apparently honorific let me make sure i have this right lustrous said this kid is frau erikas kid and his father is an american you got it she said and she wants you to find him oh jesus as quickly as possible netty said and of course as quietly and discreetly as possible why after all this time frau erika doesnt have much time she has she said between two and four months pancreatic cancer inoperable shes already taking medicine for the pain this whole thing sounds unbelieveable lustrous said that was my first reaction netty said but pastor dannberg has apparently been aware of the boy since since she became pregnant its real fred and this helicopter pilot didnt want to marry her she said shes sure he doesnt know about the child netty said this wasnt said but it seems obvious to me the family preferred that she bear this child she was eighteen when she had him by the way out of wedlock rather than the alternative which was seeing the blood line corrupted by marriage what do you mean corrupted by an american you mean not just an american according to her the father of that blond boy is jorge alejandro castillo from texas oh boy colonel lustrous said yeah freddy oh boy netty said let me see what i can do he said and then a thought popped into his mind and he asked it aloud does the boy know i dont know netty said shell have to tell him if she hasnt already let me see what i can find out lustrous said netty met his eyes then nodded then stood up youre coming home for supper she asked he nodded were having roast boar netty said as we were getting in the investment to come back a maid came out with an enormous platter of food wrapped in aluminum foil the maid said frau erika wanted me to have it otherwise it would go to waste i like roast boar he said i know she said when you were a lieutenant you and the colonel used to snoot them with thompsons and give the meat to saint johans ive told you that story have i i was here dear she said a stillblushing bride and i almost left you when you walked into the house staggering under the weight of the ugliest animal carcass i had ever seen and made it clear that i was expected to turn it into dinner he chuckled theres more than enough if you want to ask anyone netty said the naylors he asked why not she walked to him kissed him and said do me a favor freddy dont put this on a back burner ill get right on it he said he led her to the door with his arm around her shoulder sergeant major dieter looked up from his desk see if major naylor is available will you please colonel lustrous said to him three headquarters eleventh armored cavalry regiment downs barracks fulda hesse west germany march how are we doing sergeant major colonel frederick j lustrous greeted sergeant major rupert dieter as he walked into his office but before dieter could reply lustrous went on but before we get into that you might want to put a quiet word into the ear of the mess sergeant of baker troop first squadron yes sir i had breakfast there uhoh uhhuh you take my point sergeant major i will have lunch there sir it was really bad dieter lustrous said and thats one of the things we just cant have ill take care of it sir i leave the matter in your capable hands sergeant major lustrous said and motioned for the sergeant major to follow him into his office dieter snatched one of the three stainless steel thermos bottles from the coffee machine table and followed lustrous into his office give me a second colonel dieter said what i want to show you is on my desk lustrous nodded said sure took off his field jacket and hung it on a coattree and then went behind his desk and sat down dieter came back in the office a moment later carrying an eightinchthick stack of paper about fourteen inches across and twentytwo inches long fastened together with enormous ace spring metal clips on it sat a thin book bound in marooncolored artificial leather what the hell is that lustrous asked the regimental newspaper sir dieter said specifically for the year did you find daddy in there yes sir i think i did dieter laid the stack of old newspapers on lustrouss conference table and carefully opened it in about the middle want to have a look sir dieter asked lustrous heaved himself out of his chair and walked to the table dieter pointed to a somewhat faded photograph of two young officers in flight suits standing by the nose of an hud thats a dog model he said indicating the huey helicopter uhhuh dieter said the headline over the picture read blackhorse to train with skycav the caption under the picture read st lt james biden left ithaca ny and wojg ja castillo san antonio tex of the nd aviation company shown by their hud helicopter one of eight which will participate in a threeweeklong joint training exercise with troopers of the blackhorse its a lousy photo lustrous said but he looks like hes fifteen years old i noticed that sir dieter said well you found him lustrous said good for you you better hold off on that sir dieter said thats not all i found he picked up the book bound in maroon artificial leather and handed it to lustrous lustrous looked at the title the medal of honor he asked curiously dieter nodded i stuck a piece of paper in it sir he said lustrous found the slip of paper and opened the book to that page jesus h christ he said when he found himself looking at another photograph of warrant officer jorge alejandro castillo this one he guessed taken when castillo had graduated from flight school castillo also looked like he was fifteen years old i dont think theres too many guys who flew hueys with a name like that dieter said i think thats your guy colonel colonel lustrous started to read the citation on and april while flying hud helicopters in support of operation lam son he stopped and looked at dieter april we were out of vietnam by then not the aviators dieter said air force and army we left a bunch of themplus some heavy artillerybehind to support the south vietnamese i looked operation lam son up and the south vietnamese went into laos to cut the ho chi minh trail dieter said they got clobbered and so did our choppers we lost more than a hundred and five times that many were shot up lustrous dropped his eyes to the book again and continued time and again warrant officer castillo flew his aircraft into extremely heavy fire to rescue the crews of downed american helicopters in the process he was twice shot down himself and suffered painful wounds contusions and burns for which he refused medical treatment as a result thereof warrant officer castillo was on his fiftysecond rescue mission in the fifth helicopter he operated during this period when his aircraft was struck by heavy antiaircraft fire and exploded lustrous looked at dieter and repeated fiftysecond rescue mission thats what it says sir we lost i told you more than a hundred choppers they mean destroyed by that it doesnt count the ones that got shot down they really kicked our ass a lot of chopper crews had to be either picked up or the vc would have gotten them well it says he was given the medal posthumously lustrous said so it doesnt look as if he will be able to assume his parental obligations does it hes buried in the fort sam houston national cemetery sir dieter said they didnt get his body back right away sonofabitch lustrous said i didnt expect this we dont know for sure its our guy sir for sure i mean oh come on dieter you dont think its possible sir that frau whatsername knew about this all along no i dont lustrous said automatically but then added why would she do something like that desperate women shit desperate people do desperate things colonel things that dont make a lot of sense i hate to agree with you but i do lustrous said this situation has just become something that cannot be dealt with by someone of my pay grade what are you going to do sir im going to try to get general towson to find a few minutes in his schedule for me lustrous said try to get him on the horn sergeant major yes sir sergeant major dieter said and picked up one of the telephones on lustrouss deskthere were two one a local commercial telephone and the other connected to the army networkand dialed a number from memory hey tony he said after a moment rupert dieter how they hanging fat guy there was a pause tony my boss wants to speak to your boss possible there was another pause and then dieter said thanks tony and handed the phone to colonel lustrous the v corps commander will be with you shortly sir he said thanks lustrous said he had to wait fifteen seconds before lieutenant general robert b towson commanding general v united states corps came on the line towson good morning general lustrous what can i do for you fred sir i need about ten minutes of your time and some guidance if theres a chopper available id appreciate a ride if not ill drive obviously you dont want to talk about this on the phone id rather not sir personal matter fred no sir theres a personal element i was just thinking for the good of the service okay you and i are on for lunch a chopper will be there in thirty minutes and you dont even have to change out of those oilstained fatigues and illegal boots okay thank you very much general general towson hung up without saying anything else okay lustrous said there will be a chopper here in thirty minutes you me and major naylor locate colonel stevens and tell him i said i want him to come here and mind the store lieutenant colonel charles d stevens was the executive officer of the blackhorse yes sir sergeant major dieter said four office of the commanding general v corps the ig farben building frankfurt am main west germany march sir colonel lustrous is here sergeant major anthony j sanguenetti a large dark almost entirely bald fortyfiveyearold said into the intercom on his desk is he alone no sir he has major naylor and a really ugly sergeant major with him all of you come in and tell lownsdale no calls until i say so yes sir sanguenetti said and looked up at lustrous sir the corps commander will see you major naylor and ol whatsisname over there now sergeant major dieter gave sergeant major sanguenetti the finger as he walked past him to enter general towsons office lustrous naylor and dieter saluted crisply towson returned it with an almost casual wave of the hand when tony said ugly he said rising from his chair to offer his hand to sergeant major dieter i knew it had to be you how are you rupert too long a time no see its good to see you too sir you look skinny general towson said he been overworking you yes sir he has so i guess you know what this is all about yes sir then you should too tony general towson said close the door towson waited until the door was closed then looked at lustrous one sentence fred he said for the good of the service sir i think its very probable that just before he went to vietnam where he earned a posthumous medal of honor a young warrant officer impregnated a german girl to whom he was not married towson looked at him for a long moment thats one hell of a onesentence summary fred he said i was expecting to hear something like hankypanky in dependent housing lustrous didnt reply youre sure of your facts towson asked no sir but id bet tentoone on what we think why did this come up now the mother just found out the guy was a hero no sir the mother just found out shes dyingpancreatic cancerand there is no other family here to take care of the boy who is now twelve why do you think shes telling the truth i was a friend of her fathers sir and she is not after money how do you know that because she has more than she needs shes frau erika von und zu gossinger general theres a brewery three newspapers and other properties related to the guy who wiped himself out on the autobahn that was her father sir and her brother and how did this come to your attention she told netty general yesterday at lunch i think shes telling the truth sir she probably is but we cant take any chances general towson said tony get on the horn to saint louis tell them to fax us whats this fellows name warrant officer junior grade jorge alejandro castillo sir sergeant major dieter furnished mr castillos service record and any other information they have about him right now and to follow that up with xeroxes of same sent by the most expeditious means if they say they cant do it today you tell them i said if they said they cant im going to route my request through the chief of staff if they ask why you dont know got it yes sir do that right now towson said rupert can bring you up to speed about what we talk about now yes sir sergeant major sanguenetti said and looked at sergeant major dieter who was writing mr castillos full name on a sheet of paper when dieter handed it to him sanguenetti left the office towson looked at lustrous getting records out of saint louis is like pulling teeth he said i actually had to go to the chief of staff a couple of weeks ago i hope they remember that he paused thoughtfully and then went on okay lets say youre right fred and if netty believes this woman you probably are where do we go from here colonel lustrous had served under general towson twice and correctly suspected here that sentence was rhetorical and towson did not expect an answer if mr castillo was married towson went on thats one situation death benefits and possibly a pension would have gone to his widow benefits to which this german boy may be entitled ill have a talk with the judge advocate and get the details if he wasnt married thats another situation okay we dont know enough now to make any kind of a decision the only thing i can think of right now is to get a blood sample a little coldheartedly if theres a match it wont prove anything if theres not it would prove there was no parental relationship so the only thing i can tell you to do fred is to get a sample a large sample of the boys blood and make sure we can testify we were there when the sample was taken and that the blood never left our custody yes sir lustrous said and looked at major naylor who said yes sir what did he do to get the medal of honor towson asked sir are you familiar with operation lam son towson searched his memory then nodded mr castillo was on his fiftysecond rescue mission picking up downed chopper crews when he was hit and his huey blew up i know that story towson said he kicked his copilot and crew chief out of his bird told them there was no sense all of them getting killed that young man really had a large set of balls he heard what he had said and added an unfortunate choice of words right i have an unfortunate tendency to do that five headquarters eleventh armored cavalry regiment downs barracks fulda hesse west germany march sir i have frau von gossinger on the line sergeant major dieter called from the outer office thats von und zu dieter lustrous said gestured for major naylor to pick up the extension on the conference table and then picked up the telephone on his desk fred lustrous here frau erika lustrous said good afternoon colonel there have been some developments in this situation lustrous said id really like to discuss them with you in person rather than over the telephone would that be possible of course when would that be convenient for you whenever it is for you she said now if youd like i thought i would bring netty with me lustrous said and elaine naylor and her husband major naylor whos going to help us with this of course it will take me say thirty minutes to go home pick up the ladies and change out of my work uniform and then fortyfive minutes or so to drive up there that would make it a little after sixthirty would that be all right that would be fine colonel and there is no necessity for you to change uniforms and if you have the time please take supper with us thats very kind lustrous said but i dont want to impose dont be silly it is i who is imposing on your friendship with my father i will expect you sometime before seven and thank you there was a click as the line went dead lustrous looked at naylor she said supper with us colonel naylor said yeah i heard lustrous said then he raised his voice rupert sergeant major dieter put his head in the doorway i heard he said you want me to drive you no i think well go in the mercedes lustrous said will you

steps of das haus im wald as they drove up in lustrouss mercedes the boy was wearing a nearly black suit with a white shirt and tie and his blond hair was neatly combed the naylors had two sons a fourteenyearold and a tenyearold and the first thing allan naylor thought was theres not much fun in that kids life that was closely followed by shit and now this colonel lustrous had taken frau erika von und zu gossinger at her word he and naylor were still wearing fatigues their wives were more formally dressed mother and son waited on the steps for the lustrouses and the naylors to get out of the mercedes and walk up to them how good it is to see you again colonel lustrous frau erika said offering her hand welcome thank you lustrous said may i introduce my good friend major allan naylor of course elaines husband how do you major netty walked up to frau erika and kissed her on the cheek and then elaine did and this is my son frau erika said karl wilhelm the boy put out his hand first to netty then elaine then lustrous and finally naylor and each time said in english how do you do i am pleased to meet you his english while obviously not the american variety was accentless neither the nasal british variety taught by english teachers at saint johanswhich allan b naylor iii had brought home and earned him the nickname lord fauntleroyor the to be expected germanaccented english of a young german boy my boy goes to saint johans elaine said allan do you know him he is two forms before me ahead of me karl wilhelm von und zu gossinger said i know who he is why dont we go in the house and have a cocktail frau erika said a maid in a white apron stood behind a bar set up on a table in the library there were bottles of gossingerbrau in dark bottles with ceramic and rubber stoppers bottles of german and french white and red wine french and german champagne bourbon and scotch whiskey gin cognac and an array of glasses to properly serve any of it lustrous netty and allan naylor asked for scotch elaine naylor said she thought she would have a glass of rumpoldskirchener and frau erika poured a snifter heavily with cognac welcome friends all of you to our home frau erika said raising her glass what is it you taught my father to say oberst lustrous mud in your eye mud in your eye she took everyone noticed a healthy pull of her cognac i dont know what that means karl wilhelm von und zu gossinger said either do i come to think of it karl lustrous said is it all right if i call you karl yes sir of course the boy said would you mind karl if we had a private word with your mother lustrous said of course not sir frau erika lustrous said of course she said karl would you go into grosspappas office for a moment karl didnt like it all but he nodded curtly and walked to the far end of the library lustrous saw there was an office of some kind in an adjoining room there was a desk a typewriter a leather armchair and several tables in a small room lined with bookcases when my father was angry about something frau erika said he used to go there to write the editorial he said it was very difficult to stay angry in there then i have to presume most of the editorials i read were not written here lustrous said frau erika smiled at him he also used to say losing your temper had to be a sin it was so pleasurable she said lustrous smiled and turned to netty can i have that please honey he asked netty dug in her purse and came up with a plasticized xerox copy of the newspaper photograph spec sam rowe sergeant major dieters jackofalltrades had spent several hours doing the best he could netty handed it to her husband who wordlessly handed it to frau erika she looked at it carefully and then at lustrous yes thats him it must have been taken at the time my god he was so young only nineteen im afraid i have to tell you that he was killed in vietnam lustrous said erika met his eyes for a moment then nodded somehow i knew that she said he said he said that i would probably not hear from him much he wasnt much at writing letters but that as soon as he came home from the war he would come back i was very young i believed him even when there were no letters at all its easy to believe when you are young for what its worth he died a hero lustrous said it doesnt mean anything to me but it will to karl erika said and raised her voice karl kumst du hier bitte she sounded almost gay lustrous saw the cognac snifter was just about empty and then looked at netty and saw the pain in her eyes the boy came back from the small office yes mother oberst lustrous has brought a photograph from a newspaper of your father erika said the boy said nothing erika handed him the plasticcovered clipping he looked at it and then at his mother he never came back to us karl because he was killed in the war erika said your father was quite a hero karl lustrous said mother said he is dead the boy said he was killed while trying to rescue other helicopter pilots naylor said so how if i may ask will that affect things the boy asked excuse me lustrous said if he is dead i cannot go to him can i naylor thought that means of course he knows about his mother his reaction is coldblooded to learning that his father is dead and that he now will have no family at all karl netty said softly weve asked for his records they will be sent here shortly i cant promise this but its possible even likely that your father had a family and i would go to them no i will not pastor dannberg says i can stay at saint johans but if there is a family netty said they would love you why would they love me mother says they dont know i exist thats true naylor thought and the boy senses or has figured out that it would be one hell of a transition from das haus im wald to texas even if he doesnt understand that with a name like castillo its highly probable that his life in texas would be that of a texmex and thats not at all like that of an upperclass german naylor had developed his own theory of how nineteenyearold jorge alejandro castillo had wound up flying a huey first in germany and then in vietnam there were two reasons seventeen and eighteenyearold young men had gone into the army during the vietnam war it seldom had anything to do with patriotic notions of rushing to the colors but rather with their economic situation and the draft if there was no money to go to college and get an educational deferment the draft was damned near inevitable jorge alejandro castillo had been bright enough to get into the warrant officer candidate program which meant that he was certainly bright enough to get into college that he had not gone suggested strongly that there hadnt been money for college naylor knew that army recruiters had regularly trolled high schools for seniors about to graduate and specifically for those who couldnt afford college their sales pitch was that if the kids enlisted now rather than waiting for the inevitable draft they would be guaranteed their choice of specialty which almost invariably meant being trained in electronics or automobile mechanics which also meant they wouldnt be handed a rifle and told to go kill people the offer was valid the training was given as promised the price was a threeyear enlistment draftees had to serve two years the army got another year of service during which the kid got the five to eight months of specialist training promised and he then could serve for two years in his specialty on the kids side he got the training and if he didnt screw up in training he didnt go to the infantry what happened when the kid got to the reception center was that he was given the army general classification test which was sort of a combined aptitude and intelligence test the average gi scored between and scores of or better qualified the new soldier for such things as officer candidate school and the longer more technical specialist courses when a kid turned in a score of or better he came to the attention of a lot of people who needed really bright young men such as helicopter pilots putting this all together naylor had reasoned that jorge alejandro castillo had joined the army to be trained as an electronics repairman or some such and to be kept out of the infantry he had scored really high on the agct and been recruited for the warrant officer candidate program it wasnt hard to get a kid to agree to swap his promised training as a radio fixer for training as a pilot and the flight pay and status of a warrant officer that went with it naylor remembered a sign he had seen in an officers club annex at fort rucker the army aviation center in alabama it had read warrant officer pilots wishing to drink beer must have a permission note from their mommy that was a joke but there had been a lot of warrant officer pilots already back from a vietnam tour who had had to do their drinking on post because they were too young to be served alcohol off post jorge alejandro castillo was by no means the only huey pilot who had looked like he was fifteen the bottom line to this was that major allan b naylor thought it entirely likely that karl wilhelm von und zu gossinger of das haus im wald was about to find himself transported to a lowincome housing development in texas and possibly even to one in which english was a second language they would love you karl because they are your family frau erika said mother thats nonsense and you know it is the boy said i am not going and no one can make me he marched angrily out of the library i will talk to him frau erika said this has to be tough for him elaine naylor said there are no other options for him frau erika said erika colonel lustrous said theres something else she looked at him to prove that karl is indeed mr castillos son were going to have to have a sample of karls blood really she replied icily and as quickly as possible lustrous said i suppose it was naive of me to think i would be taken at my word even by you i take you at your word lustrous said do you really yes i do lustrous said flatly we all do erika netty said very well we will bleed my son erika said and then she smiled shall we go into the dining room karl wilhelm von und zu gossingersurprising all the americanswas standing behind a chair at one end of the table politely waiting for the others to take their seats neither he nor his mother gave any sign that he had lost his temper wine was offered and poured frau erika held her hand over her wineglass and said i think i would like another taste of the cognac please bring the bottle halfway through the main course frau erika said karl it will be necessary for you to have a blood sample drawn the americans wont take your word for what you have told them he replied you will give blood frau erika said tomorrow you will give blood what i thought i would do karl allan naylor said was come out here in the morning drive you past the kasernedowns barracksand afterward take you to saint johans the boy studied him a moment wouldnt it make more sense herr major for mothers driver to take me to school as he usually does and for you to meet me there that would save you the drive all the way here yes as a matter of fact karl it would naylor said then it is settled i will see you just inside the gate tomorrow morning deal naylor said the rest of the dinner was a disaster erikasuddenly naylor thoughtgot very drunk knocked over her glass and then stood up you will have to excuse me she said i suddenly feel ill netty and elaine seeing she was unsteady on her feet jumped up and helped her out of the dining room mothers in great pain karl wilhelm von und zu gossinger said matteroffactly the cognac helps but then she gets like that were all very sorry your mother is ill karl naylor said yes karl said it is a very unfortunate situation seven quarters the pershing house fort sam houston texas march the commanding general fifth united states army was in the breakfast room of the house named forand once occupied bygeneral of the armies john j black jack pershing when he was joined by major allan b naylor good morning sir naylor said long time no see allan general amory t stevens said offering his hand he was a tall very thin man with sharp features yes sir naylor said general i feel im imposing dont be silly could i do less for an officer who was once a darling baby boy i bounced on my knees sit down and have some coffee and then tell me what the hell this is all about youre not eating i hate to eat alone marjories with her mother and i didnt think youd get up before noon what time did you get in a little after three sir i said i dont like to eat alone i didnt say i dont like breakfast may i fry some eggs for you sir i thought you would never ask general stevens said i will even go in the kitchen and watch naylor opened the refrigerator and took out a carton of eggs and a package of bacon and laid them on the table i have what they call an enlisted aide these days general stevens said fine young man but hes an even worse cook than i am theres a frying pan in there he pointed sunny side up but not slimy if you please i know how to make toast its done by machine naylor chuckled i carry with me the compliments of colonel lustrous naylor said as he went looking for a frying pan since you wont be back over there in time to tell him and ruin the surprise freddy is now brigadier generaldesignate lustrous to myand a lot of other peoplessurprise well thats good news he certainly deserves it im not surprised freddy has always had an unfortunate tendency to tell his superiors theyre wrong stevens said that usually results in getting you passed over your father being one of the rare exceptions when did this happen yesterday thats where i was in washington at the promotion board dont tell him i was on it hell take that as my approval of his big mouth which of course you dont theres a difference allan between admiration and approval general stevens said write that down im going to need a spatula naylor said one of those drawers stevens said pointing and i know there are plates around here somewhere naylor found the spatula and laid it on the stove so whats this hushhush mission for the good of the service youre on all about then he had another thought dont you want an apron that would be an excellent idea naylor said stevens took an apron from the back of a door and handed it to him i do know where some things are he said so whats up twelve years ago a youngvery youngchopper pilot left a german girl in the family way before going off to vietnam oh hell from which he did not return naylor went on and the mother is now terminally ill and went to colonel lustrousactually to nettyand asked for help in finding him i thought you said he didnt come back from nam he didnt what im doing now is making an initial reconnaissance for colonel lustrous to see what this guys family is like i have an address and after breakfast im going to go start looking they have a thing now they call the telephone general stevens said all freddy had to do was call me i would have had somebody do this for you general towson suggested to colonel lustrous that he send me over here naylor said bob towson said send you general stevens asked i must be missing something here allan why the fuss and feathers im ashamed to say that a lot of our soldiers pfcs through general officers left german girls in the family way behind them thousands of them sir i guess i left out that the father got the medal of honor in vietnam yes i guess you did stevens said that little fact does put a different color on things doesnt it and colonel lustrous and the boys grandfatherwho wiped himself out on the autobahn several months agowere good friends whats freddy concern personal and official i think sir hes worriedi know i amthat the fathers family is going to be less than overjoyed to learn their son left an illegitimate child behind in germany twelve years ago if thats the casethey reject the ideacolonel lustrous wants to cushion the boy and his mother from that as much as possible and bob towson is concerned about what would appear in the papers if the family and the mother get in a pissing match german woman claims medal of honor winner father of her bastard child yes sir im sure thats true well you cant blame the mother wanting to make sure the child is fed and cared for stevens said and on the other hand you cant really blame the family for being suspicious of someone who claims to be the mother of a child fathered by the dead son yes sir thats true naylor turned to the stove and flipped the bacon there was a knock at the kitchen door and then the door opened and a young cleancutlooking buck sergeant came through it good morning sir he said pay attention to what the major is doing wally general stevens said one day in a dire emergency i may have to press you into service again yes sir the sergeant said with a smile major naylor sergeant wally wallace stevens said how are you sergeant how do you do sir you had breakfast wally general stevens asked yes sir i have thank you what you hear here stays here wally okay yes sir of course you have a name you said allan general stevens asked yes sir the next of kin are the pilots parents mr and mrs juan fernando castillo let me have that again the name i have for the next of kin is castillo mr and mrs juan fernando this gets better and better or worse and worse i shudder to think what interesting fact may next pop out of your mouth general stevens said sir wally go get mrs stevenss phone book the pink one its on her desk in the study yes sir sergeant wallace said you know these people sir naylor asked and the alleged father of this outofwedlock german child is jorge alejandro castillo am i right yes sir yeah allan i know them general stevens said they own most of downtown san antonio plus large chunks of the land outside the city plus a large ranch near midland under which is the permian basin and i dont really think don fernando juan fernando sir naylor corrected him i see freddy has corrupted you allan you too are too ready to correct your superiors when you make a snap judgment theyre wrong in the culture of which the castillos are part mr juan fernando castillo is addressed as don fernando as a mark of respect much like they call upperclass englishmen sir john get it yes sir sorry sergeant wallace returned with a pink telephone book general stevens sat down at the table and looked through it then he held up his hand sergeant wallace took the handset of a wall telephone and put it in his hand general stevens punched in the number good morning he said this is general stevens from fort sam i apologize for calling at this hour would it be possible for me to speak with don fernando its a matter of some importance there was a reply and then general stevens went on perhaps dona alicia might be available this is really important there was another reply and then general stevens went on again thank you very much but no message ill call again thank you he broke the connection with his finger and held the telephone over his shoulder sergeant wallace took it from him and hung it up don fernando is out of town stevens said that may mean hes at their ranch or it may mean hes in dallas new york or timbuktu dona alicia is at the alamo she likes to get there early the alamo sir youve heard of the alamo havent you allan john wayne died there defending it against the overwhelming forces of the mexican general santa anna yes sir being a general allan as your father may have told you is something like being an aviator long days and hours of utter boredom punctuated by moments of terror i am now forced to make a decision whether to wait until i can meet with don fernando or to go over to the alamo before he gets back and dump this in dona alicias lap no matter which decision i make it is likely to be the wrong one he paused and then went on after two full seconds of thought i have decided to go with my cowardly instincts and go to dona alicia her temper is not nearly as terrible as that of her husband naylor who didnt know what to say said nothing wally get on the horn and call the office and say i wont be in until i get there and the only messages i want on the radio are from the chief of staff or an operational immediate saying russian bombers are over san antone yes sir sergeant wallace said and went to the wall telephone please tell me allan that you havent burned my bacon and eggs i have not burned your bacon and eggs sir eight alamo plaza san antonio texas march dona alicias office is in the daughters of the republic of texas library general stevens said pointing to the building and before we go in there i think a little historical background is in order yes sir major naylor said contrary to what most people think the alamo is not owned by the federal government or texas but is the property of the daughters of the republic of texas that organization is not unlike the order of the cincinnati membership in whichim sure you know since you and your father are membersis limited to direct lineal descendants of george washingtons officers membership in the daughters of the republic of texas is limited to ladies who can claim to be direct descendants of men and women who rendered service to the republic of texas before the republic struck a deal with washington and joined the union it helps if your ancestor or ancestors died at the alamo but the battle of san jacinto will also get you in if other ladies like you with me so far yes sir dona alicia castillo has twice been president of this august organization and it is reliably rumored that the castillo family over the years has contributed a hell of a lot of money to keeping up the alamo and the san jacinto battlefield and other historical things important to texas getting the picture yes sir i really dont know how shes going to react to the news that she has an illegitimate grandson in germany i suspect shes not going to be overwhelmed with joy i understand sir i think the best plan of action is for me to do the talking and for you to say no more than yes maam or no maam yes sir in these circumstances it seems to mesince freddy and netty lustrous believe the mother elaine and i do too sir naylor interrupted and we have the results of the blood test general stevens gave him a frosty look and went on that we have an obligation to see the boy gets what hes entitled to as the fruit of the loins of a fellow officer who was awarded the medal of honor among other things the boy gets a pass into west point if he so desires we cannot permit the castillos to sweep this kid back under the rug even if that means they are going to suffer some embarrassment i understand sir so put a cork in your mouth when we get in there and let me do the talking yes sir dona alicia castillo a trim woman who appeared to be in her late fifties and whose jetblack hair drawn tight in a bun showed traces of gray came to the door of her office when her secretary told her over the intercom that general stevens who did not have an appointment was asking for a few minutes of her time what an unexpected pleasure general she said smiling and offering her hand please come in she turned and went into her office stevens and naylor followed marjories well i trust she said as she settled herself behind her desk i saw her last week at the united fund luncheon shes fine dona alicia shes visiting her mother please give her my regards dona alicia said and added please sit down and tell me what i can do for you dona alicia general stevens said may i introduce my godson major allan naylor his father and i were roommates at west point well im very pleased to meet you major naylor welcome to the alamo thank you maam naylor said a somewhat delicate matter has come up dona alicia general stevens said is that so allan major naylor has the details dona alicia smiled and looked at naylor expectantly jesus christ what happened to let me do the talking and put a cork in your mouth the thing is maam naylor began hesitantly yes we have reason to believe that mr castillo has a son in germany naylor said she looked at him for a moment without a change of expression somehow i suspect you are talking of my late son jorge she said evenly rather than my husband jesus christ naylor thought how fucking dumb can one major be yes maam i am and how did this come to your attention she asked maam im stationed in germany in fulda the boys mother went to my wife and my commanding officers wife major naylor is referring to colonel frederick lustrous dona alicia general stevens said i know him well hes a very fine officer i see dona alicia said you were saying major frau gossinger being the childs mother dona alicia interrupted yes maam the women are friends and colonel lustrous and frau gossingers late father were friends and therefore you believe this frau gossinger yes maam and we know that the boy and mr castillo your late son have the same blood type i dont think thats conclusive proof of paternity is it no maam it is not naylor admitted this would have had to be more than a dozen years ago yes maam the boy is twelve do you have any idea why she brought this up now twelve years after the fact she is terminally ill mrs castillo naylor said i dont suppose you would have a photograph of the child would you yes maam i do naylor said and took several photographs from the breast pocket of his tunic his name is karl naylor said hes a really bright kid dona alicia stared at the first photograph for a long moment and then laid it down and stared at the second and then laid that down and stared at the third blond she said and so fairskinned yes maam naylor said would you think me rude if i asked you gentlemen to wait outside for a few minutes dona alicia asked grace will get you coffee i think i should talk to my husband about this yes of course general stevens and major naylor said almost in unison they left the office and sat beside one another on a couch in the outer office general stevens looked at major naylor and raised his eyebrows i dont think that went as well as it could have gone stevens said nine room the plaza hotel new york city mew york march who the hell can that be juan fernando castillo inquired almost angrily when the telephone rang although there was no one else in the threeroom suite he was a tall heavyset man with a full head of dark hair he was dressed in white jockey shorts and a hotelfurnished terry cloth bathrobe he had not knotted the cord and his chest covered with thick hair was visible he laid the wall street journal down on the room service table and tried to push back the chair he had just pulled up to it it hung up on the carpet and fell over in stepping over it he bumped into the room service table knocking over his freshly squeezed grapefruit juice which for some reason known only to god the goddamned hotel served in a stemmed glass he walked to the telephone what is it he snarled into it did i wake you

friendsabout the boy oh sweet jesus please alicia doesnt need this when jorgetheir baby and their only sonhad died juan fernando castillo had to seriously consider getting institutional care for his wife it hadnt gotten that far but she had been clinically depressed for more than a year and she still had trouble at least twice a year on jorges birthday and on the date of his death sweetheart

permit the lustrous mercedes to pass until he had authority from the house when it finally came and they reached the house karl wilhelm von und zu gossinger was waiting for them on the stone verandah good evening he said hey karl major naylor said i am sorry but mother is not receiving the boy said we really want to talk to her naylor said may we come in of course he opened the door for them and then followed them into the house i dont believe i know this lady he said when they were all inside karl netty began this is your karl im your grandmother alicia castillo said oh if i had known about you i would have been here much sooner alicia said may i give you a hug and a kiss i would rather you didnt the boy said jesus karl naylor said its all right alicia said karl netty said we would really like to see your mother for just a moment mother is not feeling well the boy said we understand karl elaine naylor said she has had a good deal to drink the boy said karl alicia said take me to your mother he looked at her for a moment and then said if you insist the room alicia was to remember later reeked of cognac erika von und zu gossinger was in bed on her side and raised her head when the light from the corridor came into the darkened room whos that she challenged in german get out and leave me alone im sorry alicia said i dont speak german who are you frau erika asked not pleasantly in english i am jorges mother my dear alicia said and ive come to take care of you and karl frau erika not without effort managed to sit up in the bed and turn the light on youre jorges mother yes i am my name is alicia frau erika put out her hand and dona alicia took it i am so sorry i didnt know about you and the boy alicia said tears ran down frau erikas cheeks and she began to sob alicia put her arms around her chapter v spring one over the atlantic ocean offshore savannah georgia may five minutes out of the helipad at the carolina white house shortly after they had reached cruising altitude sergeant first class delaney took a headset from a hook by the door and handed it to major c g castillo who was now sitting down and properly strapped in castillo put it on found the mike button and said thanks sergeant major castillo a female voice said adding jokingly this is your pilot speaking yes maam castillo i was just thinking lieutenant colonel messinger said im going offduty when we get to hunter i could give you a ride into fort stewart if youd like and grease you through the process of getting into the fieldgrade boq i live there major castillo had an unkind and perhaps less than modest thought for female officers keeping ones indiscretions a hundred miles from the flagpole was even more important than it was for male officers for unmarried female officersand if lieutenant colonel messinger lived in the fieldgrade boq she was more than likely unmarriedit was even more difficult to be discreet if they didnt opt for the chastity option they had to be very careful castillo knew that every brotherand sisterofficer wondered not always privately whom lieutenant colonel messinger was banging banging outside the bounds of holy matrimony was conduct unbecoming an officer and gentlelady banging a fellow officer especially a married one was bad banging a subordinate was even worse a or on the conduct unbecoming scale and banging a married subordinate was a helping a visiting fellow fieldgrade aviator who was not wearing a wedding ring through the often maddening process of getting into visiting officer quarters after which he would naturally suggest having a drink and dinner after which they would go to the boq together was something else no more than a on the scale or even a providing of course that loud cries suggesting intense carnal union were not later heard all over the boq thats very kind of you colonel castillo said but someones meeting me at savannah international really then what you really need is a ride there yes maam but ill catch a cab or something ill take you to savannah not a problem the terminal or the private aviation side of the field the private aviation side please no problem major ill be coming out here again colonel castillo said can i have a raincheck im in the book messinger she said call me thank you i will there was no further communication between the pilot and major castillo while they were in the air but when she settled the huey on its skids on the business aviation tarmac major castillo went to the cockpit window and offered her his hand thanks for the ride colonel castillo said my pleasure she said and its anne charley castillo said and when she finally let go of his hand he waved then turned and started walking toward a sign reading passenger lounge when he pushed open the door to the passenger loungea large room furnished with chromeandplastic armchairs and couches a wall of coke and snackdispensing machines and a table with regular and decaf coffeemakersa man sitting in an armchair and drinking coffee from a plastic cup called out loudly hey gringo the man was heavyset almost massiveit was said he took after his late maternal grandfatherdarkskinned and dressed in a yellow polo shirt blue jeans and wellworn western boots it took castillo a moment to locate the source of the voice and then smiling he walked quickly toward the man who with surprising agility for someone of his bulk came quickly out of the chair they embraced fernando manuel lopez effortlessly lifted carlos guillermo castillo off the floor how the hell are you he asked where the hell have you been out at the carolina white house castillo said when he had finally freed himself the president needed my advice on foreign policy matters i would say oh bullshit but i never know when youre pulling my chain my boss was out there castillo said i was brought along to carry his briefcase and pass the hors doeuvres how long can you stay fernando asked i have to be back in washington monday at noon oh jesus dont you ever get any time off sure i do but i know wiseass but i prefer to spend it in the company of naked women right thats cruel fernando castillo said with more than a hint of an effeminate lisp i cant believe you think that of me fernando chuckled if you need to take a leak gringo take it its going to be a little bumpy up there and i dont want you pissing all over my new toy what new toy take your piss and then ill show you i may even let you steer it for a minute or two pretty castillo said several minutes later as he and fernando walked around a small sleek glistening white jet airplane what is it a lear jet i can see that a bombardierlearjet xr to be specific you said yours ours fernando said you finally got abuela to get rid of the old lear grandpa loved it fernando said she wouldnt admit that of course until i finally wore her down it was the old the wolfs at the door rationale what did it cost dont ask fernando said but grandpas lear belonged in a museum i know castillo said but i know how she feels its not easy losing another connection to your past two hacienda san jorge near uvalde texas may the bombardierlearjet xr did not exactly buzz the sprawling redtileroofed spanishstyle big house and its outbuildings but it did fly directly over it and wiggle its wings at maybe feet before picking up altitude in a sweeping turn to make its approach to the paved foot runway a half mile from the house inside the big house dona alicia castillo recognizing the sound for what it was raised her eyes heavenward made the sign of the cross laid down the novel she had been reading and walked quickly out of the living room onto the verandah she loved all of her children and grandchildren of course and tried to do so equally but she knew that the airplane that had just roared overhead held the two people she really loved most in the world her grandson fernandothe son of her daughter patriciaand his cousin carlos she didnt like them flying at all and she especially didnt like it when they were in the same airplane and fernando might be tempted to show offwhich in flying so low over the big house he certainly was she got out on the porch in time to see the lear put its landing gear down as it lined up with the runway if i stay out here on the verandah it will look as if im desperately waiting to see them which of course i am she sat down on a couch upholstered with leather pillows five minutes later they appeared in the ancient rusty jeep in which juan fernando may god rest his soul had taught them both to drive when they were about thirteen patricia and francisco her husband had been furious when they found out but juan fernando had silenced them by saying theyre going to drive anyway and it was better that he teach them than have them kill themselves trying to teach themselves juan fernando had used the same argument more or less two years later when the boys wanted to learn how to fly this time he said carlos was going to fly as his father had been a pilot even before he went in the army and what carlos did fernando was going to do whether or not anyone liked it or vice versa they were really more like twin brothers dona alicia thought than just cousins they didnt look at all alikewhile carlos had been a big boy fernando had been outsized since he was in diapersbut they were the same age within several months and they had been inseparable from the time she and juan fernando had brought carlos home from germany dona alicia thought both had gotten many physical genes from their grandfathers carlos had shown her a picture of his mothers father when his grandfather had been a lieutenant colonel in the german army at stalingrad carlos looked just like him except for the eyes which were jorges eyes carlos got out of the jeep and walked onto the verandah hows my favorite girl he asked putting his arms around her and kissing her your favorite girl would be a lot happier if you hadnt flown over the house like that she said carlos pointed at fernando not me abuela fernando said the gringo was flying hes lying abuela carlos said dona alicia looked at fernando how many thousand times have i asked you not to call him that fernando looked thoughtful then shrugged five maybe he asked innocently fernando had always called carlos gringo or the gringo but anyone else who did so got punched she and fernando had worried on the plane from frankfurt how the two twelveyearolds were going to get along would fernando resent his new cousin fernando was not only much larger than carlos but had acquired his grandfathers temper as well the problem hadnt come up you talk funny you know that fernando had challenged five minutes into their first meeting so do you if that language youre using is supposed to be english carlos had replied fernando who was not used to being challenged had looked at him a long moment and then finally said i think im going to like you even if you are a gringo you know how to ride of course come on ill show you around the place and they had been inseparable from then on since i didnt think you would think to dona alicia said i called maria and shes bringing the children out for supper abuela fernando demanded how are the gringo and i going to get drunk if my wife and the rug rats are coming youre not going to fernando stop you are making me angry yes maam he said contritely rug rats dona alicia said i dont know where you got that watching television comedy abuela carlos said i agree with you thats disgusting rug rats his own sweet and loving children dona alicia tried and failed to keep a smile from her lips well if you feel you must she said come in the house and have a cocktail i may even have a glass of wine myself i left my suitcase on the airplane abuela carlos said have i got a change of clothes in my room of course you do she said you know that you forgot your suitcase on the airplane how in the world could you do that tell abuela whose airplane it was and where you have been carlos guillermo fernando said as they walked into the living room she looked at him expectantly my bosss airplane secretary hall the president sent for him and i caught a ride with him carlos said did you get to see the president she asked from a distance carlos said not liking the lie but knowing it came with the job your grandfather knew his father dona alicia said they did some business together in alabama something i think to do with trees for pulp longleaf pines whatever that is really that didnt come up didnt they make the connection or did they know and did knowing that have something to do with that twominute job interview until just now i thought the president was just trusting hall or maybe they knew and wanted to see if i would bring it up we used to see them at the kentucky derby dona alicia said the presidents father i mean and his wife a really lovely woman your grandfather really loved horses abuela fernando asked from the bar wine you said please she said theres some argentine cabernet sauvignon in one of the cabinets three baltimorewashington international airport baltimore maryland may lear fiveohsevenfive on the ground at five past the hour will you close us out please castillo who was in the pilots seat said into his microphone not bad gringo well have to report a hard landing but not bad screw you fernando castillo said bwi ground control lear fiveohsevenfive fernando said into his microphone request taxi instructions to civil aviation refuel facilities correction castillo said after keying his mike ground control we want to go to the ups facility visibly surprised fernando didnt say anything until after ground control had given directions ups he asked yeah ups castillo said thats where im going and i cant ask why right thats right but if you promise to keep your mouth shut and i mean shut fernando you can tag along if youd like ups fernando repeated wonderingly an armed department of transportation security officer was waiting warily for them when they opened the lears cabin door can i help you gentlemen he asked good morning castillo said and took a small leather wallet from his jacket pocket and handed it to the security guard the security guard carefully examined the credentials then handed the wallet back yes sir he said now how can i help you you can point us toward ups flight operations castillo said ground floor second door of that building the guard said pointing thank you castillo said i think youd better come along lopez yes sir fernando said halfway to the twostory concreteblock building fernando asked what did you show him the pictures of your rug rats maria gave me yesterday castillo said a man in an opencollared white shirt with the fourstripe shoulder boards that are just about the universal identification of a captain of an airline came through the second door as they walked up to it he smiled you got past the guard so i guess you didnt come here to blow anything up how can i help you castillo took a regular wallet from his hip pocket and from it first one business card and then a second he handed the first to the man in the white captains shirt and the second to fernando youd better have one of these lopez he said thank you sir fernando said politely and looked at it the card bore the insignia of the department of homeland security gave the washington address two telephone numbers an email address and said that c g castillo was executive assistant to the secretary how can i help you mr castillo the captain asked he offered his hand im jerry witherington the station chief here i need a favor castillo said i need to talk to somebody who knows the boeing and if theres one here id really like to have a tour ive got a lot of hours in one witherington said this have anything to do with the one they cant find in africa you heard about that did you castillo said ive been trying to figure it out since i heard about it witherington said how the hell can you lose a i dont know castillo said but i guess the cia the fbi the faa and everybody else who is trying to get an answer will eventually come up with one youre not investigating it oh no castillo said were you ever in the service mr witherington werent we all air force seven years okay i was army so you know what an aidedecamp is right sure the only difference in being the secretarys special assistant and being some generals aide is that i dont get a gold rope to dangle from my shoulder witherington smiled at him and chuckled among other things like carrying his briefcase what i try to do is get answers for the secretary before some reporter asks the question and some reporter is going to ask him what about the missing and since i know he knows as much about s as i doalmost nothingi figured id better find someone whos an expert and get some facts and you flew here in that lear to do that lopez and i were in texas castillo said so i asked myself who would have the expert and maybe even an airplane that i could look at and where the answer was ups and here youre a pilot right i drove mostly hueys when i was in the army castillo said i know nothing about big jets but you were flying the lear right the secretary is a devout believer that idle hands are the tools of the devil castillo said so he told lopez here instead of you watching the fuelremaining needle drop while castillo snores in the back why dont you teach him how to fly the lear it might come in handy someday witherington chuckled he must be a good ip he said i happened to be watching when you came in you greased it in they call that beginners luck fernando said the reason i asked the question mr castillo i dont suppose you could call me charley could you okay charley witherington said im jerry he looked at fernando most people just call me lopez fernando said its hard to make up a nickname if your first name is fernando okay lopez it is witherington said as he shook his hand the reason i asked was to give me an idea where to start the lecture witherington said and ive been trying to guess what questions your boss will get asked well the obvious one is do you think it was stolen by terrorists who plan to fly it into another building thats the first thing i thought of when i heard somebody stole the witherington said and what do you think i dont think so witherington said why not hey i dont want to get quoted and then have some raghead fly this missing into the white house witherington said none of this gets written down castillo said nobody in the office even knows im here so why not it would be easier to skyjack another witherington said if you think about it when they took down the trade center and almost the pentagon and the white house they really thought it through they had great big airplanesthe wingspan of a is feet and some inches the s wingspan is feet even a third wider huh castillo said i didnt realize there was that much difference what the ragheads had was airplanes with just about toppedoff tanks witherington said the has a range of about nautical miles the tanks on a can hold almost gallons of fuel jesus thats a lot of fuel castillo said yeah it is witherington said and thats what took down the trade towers when all that fuel burned it took the temper out of the structural steelhell melted a lot of itand the building came down what youre saying is that it probably wouldnt have happened with a i really dont want to sound like a knowitall but hey this is just between us im grateful for your expertise just dont quote me huh you have my word castillo said the s max range is no more that miles witherington said the way most of them are configured no more than and that means less fuel is needed so smaller tanks i never heard of a and ive flown a lot of themwith tanks that hold more than gallons most hold about onethird of what a carries castillo said right witherington said so what im saying is that if i wanted to blow myself and some building upand get a pass into heaven and the seven whores that are promisedi think id rather grab another instead of going all the way to africa to steal a which wouldnt do nearly as much damage and which would be damned hard to get into any place where it could do damage theyre still watching as i guess you know incoming aircraft pretty carefully so ive heard castillo said one of our guys was coming here from rio in a witherington said he was supposed to make a stop in caracas but didntthere was weather and we had another flight going in there an hour laterso he just headed for miami and forgot to change his flight plan twenty minutes after he was supposed to have landed at caracas he got a call from an excited controller asking him where he was and what he was doing and he told him and ten minutes after thatbefore he got to santo domingohe looked out the window and saw a navy fighter looking at him so what do you think happened to the castillo asked i think they probably flew it a couple of hundred milesmaybe lessand then started to cannibalize it theres a market for any partengines on upin what we call the developing nationsand no questions asked i hadnt thought about that castillo said that makes sense let me tell them where im going witherington said and get a golf cartthe one we have here as a backup for this part of the country is too far down the line to walk youre really being helpful castillo said i appreciate it my pleasure be right back when witherington was out of earshot castillo said after we get the tourwhich shouldnt take longwell get some breakfast and then you can head home i was hoping you would say fernando since youre staying over why dont you stay with me we can have dinner or something youre staying over i have to confer with our washington attorneys what about so i can truthfully tell the irs the reason i brought the lear to washington was to confer with our washington attorneys and not using the corporate aircraft for personal business what about you picking me up at savannah that was a routine crosscountry proficiency flight youre a devious man fernando not in the same league as you gringo castillo was about to ask him what the hell that was supposed to mean when witherington appeared around the corner of the concreteblock building at the wheel of a white golf cart and there wasnt time four old executive office building th street and pennsylvania avenue nw washington dc may major c g castillo wearing a dark suit and tie not unlike that of the countless civilian staffers moving in a purposeful fashion up and down the hallways of the oeob stopped before an unmarked heavy wooden door and put a key in its lock inside there was a small antechamber with nothing in it but a somewhat ragged carpet and mounted more or less unobtrusively high above a second door a small television camera castillo rapped at one of the panels in the door and a moment later there was the buzz of a solenoid and when castillo put his hand on the door it opened this was the private entrance to the office that secretary of homeland security matthew hall maintained in the old building across from the white house which had once housed the state war and navy departmentsall threeof the federal government the secretary had seen who it was and pushed a button under his desk to unlock the door i said twelve oclock and here you are at eleven fiftyfive hall said why am i not surprised punctuality is a virtue sir castillo said i thought i told you that since its my only one i work hard at it hall chuckled ive heard that chastity and temperance arent among your virtues he said whats up charley i went to baltimore and got ups to show me one of their s their guy doesnt think it will be used as a flying bomb against us here i hope hes right hall said and then i came hereabout fortyfive minutes agoand have worked my way maybe onethird down the stack of stuff dr cohens memo got us and after page two and considering the urgency of our conversation with the president i thought what i should do is go over there and the sooner the better hall considered that momentarily after the secretarys discussions in the oval office with the president and natalie cohen then further discussions privately between hall and dr cohen there was no question that the president was pissed and therefore no question that castillo now had a blank check to carry out his mission okay he said have them make the arrangements ive already done that sir im on a lufthansa flight to rhinemain tonight you have to go through frankfurt i want to give my boss at the tages zeitung a headsup that hes sending me to luanda charley said then london to angola on british airways you think thats necessary going as whats your name karl wilhelm von und zu gossinger castillo said thats a mouthful no wonder i cant remember it sir i had the feeling that you really wanted me to be the fly on the wall on this job thats the best way to do it sir i submit as a german journalist the less anyone knows what youre doing charley the better theres no sense in having it get out the president ordered this unless it has to come out yes sir i understand anything i can do for you before you go hall asked and then had a thought how are you going to get a visa for angola on such short notice thats my next stop sir the angolan embassy hall stood up and put out his hand if you were going as my assistant i know the angolan ambassador and could give him a call but he would ask questions if asked a favor for wilhelm whatsisname a german journalist i dont have to go as karl wilhelm von und zu gossinger sir castillo said but i think it makes more sense so do i hall said have a nice flight charley you know how to reach me keep me in the loopquietly and good luck thank you sir five embassy of the republic of angola th street nw washington dc may it was very good of you to see me sir on such short notice castillo said to the very tall very black man in the consular section he was speaking in what he hoped was good enough portuguese to be understood his texmex and castilian spanishactually a combination thereofhad worked for him well enough in sao paulo brazil but this man was from a portuguesespeaking african country and that was something different the black man smiled at him and asked in english how can the angolan embassy be of service to a spanishspeaking german journalist i was afraid my limited experience with your language would be all too transparent sir castillo said how may i help you my newspaper wants me to go to luanda and write a story about the airplane no one seems to be able to find castillo said and i need a visa i have all the documents i understand i need he began to lay documents on the mans desk they included his german passport and three photocopies thereof two application forms properly filled out a printout of an email he had sent himself from texas ostensibly from the tages zeitung ordering him to get to luanda angola as quickly as he could in order to write about the missing as herr schneider is ill and cannot go his curriculum vitae stating he had earned a doctorate at phillips university marburg an der lahn and had been employed by the tages zeitung as a writer and lately foreign correspondent for the past nine years and his white house press credentials and a onehundreddollar bill almost hidden by all of the above as soon as he had spread the documents out he found it necessary to blow his nose and politely turned away from the consular official to do so when he turned back approximately twenty seconds later the consular official was studying the documents the onehundreddollar bill was nowhere in sight there are some documents missing mr gossinger the consular official said politely your proof of right of residency in the united states for example with all respect sir castillo said i thought my white house press credentials might satisfy that requirement they really wouldnt let me into the white house if i wasnt legally in the united states and youll notice sir i hope that my passport bears a multipleentry visa for the united states the consular officer studied the german passport so it does he agreed perhaps that will satisfy that requirement but there are some others he paused will you excuse me a moment please he walked out of the office castillo took another hundreddollar bill from his pocket and put it in his passport which concealed all but one edge of the bill he laid the passport back on the table mostlybut not completelyunder the stack of documents the numerals were visible a minute later the consular official came back into his office castillo felt the need to blow his nose again and did so when he turned back to the table thirty seconds later the passport was now on top of the stack of documents but the onehundreddollar bill was nowhere in sight well you have most of the documents youll need the consular official said except of course for your return ticket and the written statement that you understand you will have to abide by the laws of the republic of angola and of course the portuguese translations of your curriculum vitae the email from your newspaper andsince i find your white house press credentials satisfactory proof that you reside legally in the united statesthe portuguese translation of those it is here sir that i turn to you for understanding and help castillo said and how is that i dont have my airline tickets castillo said they are electronic tickets and i will pick them up when i get to heathrow airport and when will that be the day after tomorrow sir so soon so soon this is an important story and they want me to get on it now thats so soon castillo took a small wad of currency from his pocket three onehundreddollar bills and held them in his hand i realize that this is asking a good deal of you sir but if you could see your way to having those documents translated into portuguesei realize that will be expensiveand perhaps be so kind as to call british airways yourself to verify that i have a return tickethe laid the three onehundreddollar bills on the consuls desk this should be enough i think for the translations after thirty seconds the consul picked up the german passport opened it to a blank page took a rubber stamp from his desk stamped the passport and then scrawled his signature on the visa we try to be as cooperative as possible when dealing with the press he said handing castillo the passport the visa is for multiple entries into the republic of angola have a nice flight mr gossinger i cant thank you enough for your courtesy sir castillo said offering the consul his hand what i have done in addition to spending five hundred of my own money which i will never be able to claim as a reimbursable necessary expense is violate at least three separate provisions of the united states code having to do with the making of or offering to make a bribe to an official of a foreign government on the other hand im on my way to luanda angola six the mayflower hotel connecticut avenue nw washington dc may fernando lopez was sitting at a table by a window in the bar when castillo walked in and slipped into the other chair i would offer you a pistachio fernando said pointing at a bowl but i seem to have eaten the whole thing bored sorry i got hung up i am never bored when there are interestinglooking females around now i know why you live here theres supposed to be more women in washington than men castillo said but im not sure if thats true a waiter appeared what are you drinking castillo asked unless you desperately need a jolt fernando said id rather go to your room sure i can wait castillo said and then to the waiter added check please last of the big spenders if you pay for it maria will get the bill and know that you were boozing it up in the big city no she wont my bills go to the company then jacqueline will know but she wont tell maria fernando said grandpa trusted her discretion completely and ive learned i can too i wouldnt be too sure castillo said i always thought she was sweet on grandpa im not too sure how she feels about you you really think jackie had the hots for don fernando fernando asked smiling the question was never answered the waiter appeared castillo scrawled his name on the check and they walked out of the bar and into the lobby what are we going to do about dinner fernando asked when he came out of the bathroom pulling up his zipper in castillos suite first before i have to make an important decision like that im going to have a drink and ill even make you one if you promise to stay sober for the next hour or so why should i do that because i need to talk to you about what you in some kind of trouble yeah i guess i am i need to talk to you fernando you dont really talk to me you tell me misleading halftruths i thought maybe youd noticed what do you want to drink ive been drinking scotch but if youre in trouble maybe we better not its not that kind of trouble im still waiting to hear if a rabbit in new york died but aside from that you sonofabitch fernando said chuckling castillo handed him a drink and then sat down in an armchair facing fernandos across a coffee table they raised glasses locked eyes for a moment and then took swallows you were telling me about this lady who seduced you in new york fernando said or was it rape i wish it was that simple castillo said what the fuck are you talking about i realized a while back that i was getting to the point where i didnt know who i was or am i dont know how to say it i told you this isnt simple try im not really as dumb as maria would have you believe that id card i showed the guard at baltimorewashington what about it it impressed the guard castillo reached in his pocket and came out with the leather wallet and tossed it to fernando fernando failed to catch it and had to pick it up he opened it and looked at it carefully im impressed he said department of homeland security united states secret service supervisory special agent i thought you were still in the army i am and im not in the secret service castillo said i got that because it was the easiest way for me to carry a pistolor anything elseonto an airplane and that id calls the least attention to me when i do you often do that carry a gun i dont often carry one but i usually have one around close it says supervisory special agent instead of just special agent in case i run into a real secret service agent and his hair stands uptheyre good they can spot people who arent what their credentials say they are theres a double safeguard against that in there first they probably wouldnt want to stick their necks out and question a supervisory special agent but if they do theres a code on there if they call a regional office and ask if there really is a supervisory special agent named castillo and give the code theyre told im legitimate and to butt out right now its happened twice so youre not really the what did that calling card say the executive assistant to the director of homeland security yeah i am you just said you were still in the army and i am getting the picture fernando when i said i was getting confused about who i really am im pretty confused gringo try living it castillo said okay lets start with the army im a major just selected for promotionwhich means that i go on the bottom of a list when some special forces lieutenant colonel retires or gets dead or promoted and there is a space for one more lieutenant colonel the top man on the list gets promoted eventually i work my way up to the top of the list and become lieutenant colonel castillo are congratulations in order that may take a while ill let you know when it happens and you can buy me a drink you just said special forces i thought you were aviation i was commissioned into aviation when i graduated from west point i was there remember i was still an aggie cadet and i wanted that dollar you had to give me when i was the first one to salute you i got it framed its in my office i was commissioned into aviation because of my father into what other branch of service could i go makes sense general naylor wasnt so sure about that castillo said he thought i had the potential to be an armor officer hey gringo me too i remember our first trip to fort knox thats when his sales pitches started he thinks hes your stepdaddy and that makes me his nephew anyway full of west point piss and tabasco i embarked on what i thought was going to be my career as an army aviator i spent most of my graduation leave taking the atr exams remember i remember i didnt quite understand why you wanted an airline transport rating it you were going to be flying in the army i wanted to be prepared what occurred to me lately is that thats when all this bending of the rules started what do you mean brandnew second lieutenants dont go right to flight school they spend a couple of years learning how to run a platoon in the infantry or laying in cannon in the artillery or driving tanks i dont suspect for a second that general naylor had anything at all to do with me being sent to fort knox for my initial assignment thats because you know he doesnt like you right fernando chuckled jesus he came to college station and gave me a sales pitch to go in armor that wouldnt quit he made it clear to me that if our sacred ancestors only had a couple of tanks at the alamo we really would have kicked santa annas ass all the way back to mexico city so you went in armor when you finished a ampm and you learned all about the ml abrams right right and i finished that just in time to get my ass shipped to desert storm and i was supposed to be there doing the same thing but i wasnt right they found a vacancy for you in flight school at fort rucker as i recall they made one son of medal of honor recipient enters flight school looks good in the newspapers i had my picture taken with the post commander the day i arrived i couldnt have flunked out of flight school if i wrecked every aircraft on cairns army airfield well so what you could fly when you got there youre supposed to forget all that and start with this is a wing because of less pressure on its upper surface it tends to rise in the air taking with it whatever its attached to fernando laughed and this is a helicopter castillo went on it is different from an airplane because the wings go round and round fernando chuckled and smiling fondly shook his head i was there about three weeks i guess and i fell asleep in class basic radio procedure or something id been out howling the night before with a magnolia blossom named bettysue or something unsuccessfully as i remember bettysue was holding out for marriage anyway the instructor a lieutenant stood me tall are you bored in this class lieutenant well the answer to that was hell yes im bored but i couldnt say that so i thought about what i could say i asked you a question lieutenant he pursued so i said sir with respect yes sir i am a little that was in the days when i really believed when all else fails tell the truth i wish i still did anyway he puffed up like a pigeon and asked why and i told him i had an atr and knew how to work the radios i dont think he believed me he kicked me out of class told me to go to my boq and stay there the next morning i was summoned before a bird colonel i wasnt as good at reading the brass as i am now but i could tell he was nervous he was dealing with the son of a medal of honor winner a graduate of hudson high who had lied he said lieutenant did you tell lieutenant corncobuphisass that you hold an airline transport rating yes sir i did i said and showed it and my logbook to him i could tell he was relieved he said eleven hundred hours two hundred in rotary wing lieutenant why didnt you bring this to our attention sir nobody asked me fernando chuckled and took a pull at his drink so cutting a long story short i was sent back to the boq and that afternoon they took me out to hanchey where an ip gave me a check ride in a huey i blew his mind when i said id never flown one with only one engine before my huey time was in the twinengine models used by rig service aviation of corpus christi fernando interrupted laughing oh jesus they must have loved you shortly thereafter i found myself wearing wings and rated in us army uhf rotary wing aircraft castillo went on and enrolled in phase iv which was transition to the apache the general himself came out to hanchey when i passed my final check ride and shook my hand while the cameras clicked abuela bought twentyfive copies of the expressnews with your smiling face on page one and mailed one to me fernando said i was then living in a tent a hundred miles out of kuwait city i really thought i was hot shit castillo said second lieutenants tend to do that anyway speak for yourself gringo i myself was the epitome of modesty phrased another way i wondered what the fuck i was doing in the desert having absolutely no idea how i was supposed to command a platoon of mis when we went through the iraqi berms you did that well as i recall silver star the way they were handing out medals all you had to do was be there and you got the bronze star you got the silver star if you didnt squash anybody important under your tracks they didnt pass out the silver star with the mres fernando tell that story to somebody else castillo challenged and then went on so there i was at ohtwohundred hours on seventeen january sitting in the copilots seat of an apache i couldnt understand why the cwo flying it was less than thrilled to have my services at ohtwothirtyeight we flew over the berms you were talking about and then started taking out iraqi radar installations you were on that first strike yeah and we took a hit the cwo took a hit something came through his side window took off his visor and then went through my windshield and instrument panel he had plastic and metal fragments in his eyes he said youve got it get us out of here and take us home there being no other alternative that i could think of i did just that i never heard that story before fernando said for which i received the distinguished flying cross and the purple heart castillo went on i didnt hear about that either fernando said you got hit too i had a couple of scratches on my hands castillo said some fragments went through my gloves they were about as serious as a bee sting you were lucky fernando said lucky is not like doing something that earns you a medal castillo said and then went on anyway the paperwork for the new hero went to schwarzkopfs headquarters naylorby then he had his second starwas there he was sort of the buffer between schwarzkopf and franks freddy franks the onelegged general castillo nodded the first since the civil war he commanded the ground forces they were not too fond of one another anyway when naylor heard about the paperwork for my two medals it was the first time hed heard i was anywhere near arabia he went right through the roof winter seven office of the assistant chief of staff j united states central command ministry of defense and aviation air force base riyadh saudi arabia january major general allan naylor had the giggles and he thought he knew why hed had about six hours sleepin segments of not longer than ninety minutesin the last fortyeight hours and in the fortyeight hours before that hed had no more than eight or ten hours on his back again for never much over an hour at a time there was chemical assistance available to deal with the problem but naylor was both afraid of taking a couple of the pink pills and philosophically opposed to the idea he had instead consumed vast amounts of coffee which had worked at first but only at first he was exhausted the air phase of the war against saddam hussein had kicked off about four hours ago it had been decided that iraqi radar positions had to be taken out before a massive bombing and interdiction campaign began and it had been further decided that the army would take them out using boeing ahb attack helicopters the idea was that the iraqi radar would be on the alert for air force and navy bombers fighterbombers and other highflying highspeed aircraft and that the apaches flying nap of the eartha few feet off the ground under the radarcould sneak in and destroy the radar installations before the iraqis knew they were there it was the first timeexcept for the invasion of grenada which had been a command and control disasterthat really close coordination between what really were three air forcesair force navy and armywould be required and this time there could be no foulup the air commander general chuck horner usaf had the responsibility for the mission but he would be using the armys apaches so naylor had been taking so to speak his operational orders from him that had gone well naylor liked the former fighter pilot much more than other senior air force officers he had come to know and they had worked well together the thirtysix hours leading up to local time had been a period of intense activity in the twofloorsbelowground command center and naylor as the j j meaning joint command meaning plans and training had been at the center of that activity which meant not only the final preparations but in being in close proximity to general horners boss general h norman schwarzkopf usa the overall commander stormin norman had a legendary temper and it had erupted a halfdozen times naylor considered it among his other obligations the soothing of battered senior officer egos after they had been the target of a schwarzkopfian tirade and there had been three of these naylor and general homer who was subordinate only to schwarzkopf had already talkedcircuitously it was trueabout the absolute necessity of keeping general freddy franks who would command the ground war when that started and schwarzkopf as far apart as possible freddy was a mildmannered man who didnt even cuss but he had a temper too and he would neither takenor forgive laterthe kind of abuse stormin norman was liable to send his way if displeased and it seemed inevitable to both chuck horner and allan naylor that freddy sooner or later would do something to displease stormin norman yet in the opinion of both desert storm needed both freddy franks and stormin norman schwarzkopf the giggles which general naylor was unable to shake had to deal with general schwarzkopf and a hapless justarrived light colonel attached to j intelligence there were some classified documents in the safe to which the light colonel would need access however access to the documents was really restricted and schwarzkopf himself had to sign the authorization the light colonel had been told of the procedure he was familiar with others like it in other headquarters and so he had sat before a computer terminal and typed up the access document for schwarzkopfs signature and then taken his place in line of those who wanted a minute of schwarzkopfs time his turn finally came he marched into schwarzkopfs office saluted identified himself said he needed the generals signature on the access document and offered it to the general the general glanced at it glowered at the light colonel and announced im only going to tell you this once colonel im not normal sir goddammit are you deaf i said im not normal he had then tossedpossibly threwthe access document across his desk in the general direction of the light colonel who had then understandably confused and shaken picked the access document from the floor and fled only several minutes later when the light colonel had reported the incident to the j and the j had pointed it out to him did the lieutenant colonel realize that when he had typed the signature block for schwarzkopfs signature hed made a typo what he had laid before stormin norman had read h normal schwarzkopf general us army commanding naylor had been giggling uncontrollably since hearing the story which was bad for three reasons he was laughing at the behavior of his immediate superior he was laughing at a mishap of a junior officer which was worse and it meant that he was pushing his physical envelope to the breaking point and that was worse than anything he would need if anything came upand something inevitably wouldnot only all the brains god had given him but those brains in perfect working order with that it mind he had gone to his small but comfortable office and told master sergeant jack dunham his senior noncom to see that he wasnt bothered unless it was really important he closed the door and lay down on a folding cot and giggled he had been in his office not quite ten minutes and was seriously debating with himself the possible merits of taking a medicinal drink when the door opened colonel j brewster wallace from public relations came into the room as a general rule of thumb general naylor did not like public relations officers and he specifically disliked colonel j brewster wallace sorry to bother you general colonel wallace began if youre sorry you pastyfaced sonofabitch why did you bull your way past my sergeant that took some doing not a problem what have you got colonel first one general first one what recommendation for an impact award an impact award meant decorating a soldier immediately for something he had just done rather than running it through the bureaucratic procedure which could take weeks or even months the actions of the individual and the circumstances had to be such that there was no question he had done something at great personal risk above and beyond the call of duty why are you showing this to me naylor asked as he reached for the computer printout i thought you might want to show it to general schwarzkopf colonel wallace said this ones going to make all the papers an apache pilot a west pointer whose father won the medal of honor in vietnam naylor read the computer printout priority secret january from commanding officer rd aviation battalion to commander in chief us central command attn jl info public affairs the undersigned strongly recommends the impact award of the distinguished flying cross and the purple heart medal to second lieutenant c g castillo ssn aviation th attack helicopter company with citation as follows second lieutenant castillo was flying as copilot of an ahb attack helicopter in the opening hours of operation desert storm after successfully destroying several iraqi radar installations and other targets the aircraft was struck and severely damaged by iraqi antiaircraft fire the pilot was blinded lieutenant castillo was wounded and his windscreen was destroyed lieutenant castillo took the controls of the aircraft and despite his painful wounds and the loss of essentially all communications and navigation equipment flew the damaged aircraft more than miles back to his base subject officer is a graduate of the us military academy his next of kin are his grandparents mr and mrs juan fernando castillo box route uvalde texas his father wojg jorge alejandro castillo was posthumously awarded the medal of honor as a helicopter pilot in vietnam his mother is deceased photographs of subject officer and the battle damaged helicopter will be forwarded as soon as possible martin c seward lt col aviation commanding major general naylor looked at colonel wallace and said how badly was this officer wounded do we know he cant be too badly hurt general if he flew that shotup apache a hundred miles i think they would have said something if he was seriously injured naylor snorted you see what i mean sir colonel wallace asked its a great story the son of a medal of honor winner and i think we can infer hes a texmex with all the implications of that this will be on the front page of every newspaper in the country tomorrow no it wont general naylor said sir listen to me carefully colonel i am placing an embargo on this story it is not to be released leaked talked about anything unless and until general schwarzkopf overrides my decision is that clear its clear sir but i dont understand good we understand each other that will be all colonel thank you the office of major general oswald l young the jl personnel of central command in the command bunker was almost identical to that of major general naylor and the two were old friends got a minute for me oz naylor asked any time allan i was just thinking about youspecifically of freddy lustrousand wishing i had his asschewing ability i remembered one he gave you and me in nam i just did my best but it wasnt in the same league im thinking of delivering one of my own naylor said what was yours about they had a pool out there twenty bucks winner take all the winner was to be the guy who picked the number closest to the actual number of casualties well take in the first twentyfour hours jesus actually there were several such pools kia wia mia plus lost fighters lost as lost apaches goddamn i dont understand people who could do that it wasnt a bunch of old sergeants either a couple of colonels were happy gamblers whats rubbed you the wrong way aviators jesus christ theyre worse than the goddamned marines anything for publicity that makes them look good going down that road i just got a recommendation for an impact dfc for an aviator an apache pilot who did good who shouldnt have been anywhere near where he was those goddamned sonsofbitches i thought i was the only one around here who lost his temper a voice said from the door it had been opened without first knocking by general h norman schwarzkopf neither major general naylor nor major general young said anything but general young got out of his chair im glad youre here allan schwarzkopf said i was coming to see you next after i tell you two why im pissed off you can tell me what the goddamned sonsofbitches you were talking about have done or havent done yes sir major generals naylor and young said almost simultaneously have either of you heard about an office pool or pools being run around here sir i have dealt with that situation general young said you allan i didnt know about it until just a moment ago sir naylor said he looked at young were some of my people involved young nodded sir i will deal with that situation immediately naylor said okay so you werent talking about that who has you so pissed off naylor did not immediately respond take your time allan schwarzkopf said ive got nothing else to do but stand here waiting for you to find your tongue sir oz have you got the message from the rd right here general young said picked it up from his inbox and handed it to naylor who handed it to schwarzkopf who read it something wrong with this you dont believe it is that what youre saying oh i believe he did it sir naylor said with the trumpets of glory ringing in his ears youre losing me allan when i was young and a second lieutenant i heard those trumpets didnt we all sir he graduated from the point in june i saw that so sir you dont go from the plain to the cockpit of an apache in six months uuuh general schwarzkopf grunted you know this kid allan yes sir i talked him into going to the point youre saying he got special treatment im saying what i said before general was that aviation is worse than the marines about getting publicity because of his father his fathers moh they rushed him through training and sent him over here where he is way over his head naylor said he seems to have done pretty well schwarzkopf said hes over his head sir naylor argued you dont think he deserves the dfc yes sir i think he does and he was wounded what i want to do is get him out of there before he kills himself trying to do something else hes not capable of doing jesus allan people get killed general young said and some sonsofbitches are willing to bet on how many schwarzkopf said i think i know what allans thinking the class of right thats in my mind sir my brother was in the class of and didnt come back from korea schwarzkopf asked tom had been an officer six months when he was killed sir and your son is here too right with freddy franks allans class of sir hes had two and a half years to learn how to be a tank platoon leader i take your point i always thought it was insanity to get the class of nearly wiped out in korea schwarzkopf said you cant eat the seeds if you do you dont get a crop he paused okay allan im going to give you the benefit of the doubt on this handle it any way you want thank you sir sir i told colonel wallace to embargo this story until you gave him permission to release it you think thats important yes sir i do okay its squashed there will be other impact awards so far phase iknock on woodseems to be going well thank you sir i dont want to hear one more goddamned word about a howmanycasualties pool understood yes sir generals naylor and young said almost in unison general schwarzkopf momentarily locked eyes with each of them and walked out of the office so what do we do with this young officer general young asked youre the personnel officer oz you tell me okay there arent many options or at least good ones general young said if he got out of west point six months ago and is an apache pilot we can presume two things one that he can fly helicopters if my memory serves it takes longer than six months to get qualified in an apache after youve got x many hundred hours and x many years flying hueys i think youre right can i go on sorry we can presume he can fly helicoptersthe huey at least since you have doubts that he should be flying the apacheand is qualified in no other useful skill like being an infantry or armor platoon leader okay and if he stays in aviation and all those terrible things you think aviation brass is doing to him are trueand i think youre probably rightand is an apache pilot they will continue to put him in an apache cockpit where he will get killed and probably get a lot of people with him killed naylor interrupted allan by now you should have vented your temper general young said the problem is a given now lets find a solution sorry oz schwarzkopf has given you a blank check at one end of that range of options is a message saying this young man is grounded by order of h normal himself this time when naylor heard h normal it didnt seem at all funny i dont think we want to do that general young went on for a number of reasons that should be selfevident so whats left we have to get him out of aviation but where can we send him i have a suggestion which i sort of thought you would think of first you set it up what did i set up the rd civil government detachment young said commanded by colonel bruce j mcnab a classmate of ours who we can talk to you or me or both of us and i told you when i set it up that i didnt like it that what it was was green beanie mcnab playing james bond general schwarzkopf was told to do it by colin powell personally and he told me to do it and not to ask any more questions than i had to but we both know that whatever scotty mcnabs involved with it doesnt have very much to do with civil government we dont think it has much to do with civil government young said unless you know something i dont naylor shook his head and then asked what would castillo do there theres six maybe eight hueys on mcnabs to ampe young said referencing the table of organization amp equipment he could fly one of those for all i know scotty is planning to fly into baghdad in one or more of those hueys and try to kidnap or assassinate saddam hussein i frankly wouldnt be surprised but to repeat you or me or both of us could have a word with him and make sure he understands this young officer is not to be put in harms way for the benefit of army aviation public relations if mcnabs doing something covert naylor said thoughtfully i said that about hussein to be clever but now that i think about it im not so sure its that far off the markhes certainly got some cover operation up and running to hide it a perfectly legitimate military operation possibly even having something to do with civil governments probably young agreed from which he can detach whatever number of people he needs to conduct whatever almost certainly illegal operation he wants to do without attracting much attention young nodded in agreement oz how about you transferring castillo to the rd civil government detachment and i will get on the horn to colonel scotty mcnab and tell him that whatever he does with castillo is not to be even remotely connected with what he is doing covertly done young said but i think id better talk to scotty not you why because it takes you out of the loop young said over the years allan youve spoken to me of lieutenant castillo often have i yeah and i got the feeling youre really fond of him guilty this way i received the impact recommendation and wondered how this young officer could be flying an apache six months out of west point drew the same conclusions you did went to h normal got his permission to fix it and am doing so i owe you a big one oz naylor said dont worry ill get it back general young said eight office of the assistant chief of staff j united states central command ministry of defense and aviation air force base riyadh saudi arabia march sir master sergeant jack dunham said a strange look on his face theres an officer out therehe gestured toward the closed door who said and i quote sir be a good fellow sergeant present the compliments of colonel bruce j mcnab to the general and ask the general if i might have a few moments of his valuable time major general allan naylor replied why do i have the feeling jack that you think colonel mcnab could not melt inconspicuously into a group of say a dozen other colonels ive got twentyfour years service general and i never saw naylor chuckled and smiled my compliments to colonel mcnab sergeant and inform him that i would be delighted to see him at his convenience yes sir dunham said then went to the door and opened it and said general naylor will see you colonel good show a voice boomed in an english accent and through the door came a small muscular ruddyfaced man sporting a flowing red mustache he was wearing aviator sunglasses his chest thickly coated with red hair was visible through a mostly unbuttoned khaki jacket the sleeves of which were rolled up general naylor was sure the khaki african hunters safari jacket had not passed through the us army quartermaster corps and neither had colonel mcnabs khaki shorts kneelength brown stockings or hunting boots on mcnabs head was an arabian headdress circled with two gold cords which naylor had recently learned indicated the wearer was an arabian nobleman the white cape of whatever the headdress was called hung to mcnabs shoulders in the center of it barely visible between the two gold cords was the silver eagle of a colonel an uzi mm submachine gun hung from leather straps around his neck a spare magazine for the uzi protruded from an upper pocket of the shooting jacket and the outlines of fragmentation grenades bulged both lower pockets he saluted thank you ever so much general for granting me your valuable time naylor returned the salute close the door please colonel naylor said yes of course sir forgive me colonel mcnab said and went and closed the door then he turned and smiled at naylor i was hoping that you would not be overwhelmed to see me but for old times sake you may kiss me chastely of course despite himself naylor laughed and smiled its good to see you scotty he said and came around his desk and offered his hand mcnab wrapped his arms around him in a bear hug how the hell did you get into the building dressed like that easily for one i was on the list of those summoned to the schwarzkopf throne room for anotherperhaps as importantto whom do you think stormin normals bodyguards owe their primary allegiance i wondered where they came from naylor admitted nurtured to greatness by my own capable hands youve noticed im sure that hes still walking around despite the many peoplemost of them on his staffwho would love to kill him what did general schwarzkopf want did someone tell him about your uniform using the term loosely to answer that i have to overcome my wellknown modesty mcnab said i got another medal and general schwarzkopf wanted to tell me himself that terribly belatedly the powers that be have recognized my potential and sent it to that collection of clowns on capitol hill known as the senate seeking their acquiescence in my becoming a brigadier general its overdue scotty naylor said there are those allan my boy who are going to beat their breasts and gnash their teeth while shrieking the injustice of it all infidels are not supposed to get into heaven naylor thought hes right a whole hell of a lot of colonels who have spent their careers getting their tickets punched and never making waves are going to shit a brick when they hear scotty mcnab got his star when you pin the star on naylor said youll find that its anything but heaven i told powell i would just as soon stay where i was thank you just the same he talked me into it saying it was the price i had to pay for being right again he means that i am in the presence of the only colonel in the us army who would tell the chairman of the joint chiefs he didnt want to be a general right about what who do you think won this war freddy franks and his tanks chuck horner and his airplanes i think they had a lot to do with it i am a profound admirer of generals franks and horner and you know it but special ops won this war we took out the iraqi radar and communications the only airplaneswith a couple of exceptionschuck horner lost were due to pilot error or aircraft failure and he admits it the greatest loss of life was caused by that one scud we didnt take out and that hit the barracks in saudi arabia by the time freddy drove across the berms the iraqis had no communications worth mentioning and thus no command and control the one scud you didnt take out or render inoperable or bring back with us i understand the air force was really disappointed to learn how primitive those things are what decoration did you get mcnab reached in his jacket pocket rooted down beside the uzi magazine came out with a distinguished service medal and dangled it back and forth for a moment i cant imagine schwarzkopf pinning the dsm on that khaki jacket but obviously thats exactly what just happened i gather the presentation ceremony was rather informal naylor said then he asked you do have some reason for being dressed like that aside from i like it you mean naylor nodded you want some coffee scotty ive got a footlocker full of booze on my dune buggy outside mcnab said formerly the property of the us embassy in kuwait city i thought you might like a drink against the rules you havent changed have you if i drink other people will want to and think they can they dont have to know you dont have to stand in your door and shout hey everybody fuck the arabs im going to have a snort and you havent changed either i see naylor said you wouldnt love me allan if i did mcnab said i wouldnt love you no matter what you did naylor said you just want to see me cry mcnab said now thats a thought naylor said mcnab smiled at him you know where youre going when you get the star naylor asked bragg deputy commander or some such of the special warfare center what im going to be doing is writing up what we did right in this war so we can do it right when we have to do it again you think were going to have to do it again yeah of course we are macarthur was right when he said there is no substitute for victory and so was whoever said those who dont read history are doomed to repeat it i guess what the president was worried about was a lengthy occupation with a hell of a lot of guerrilla warfare naylor said freddy franks told me a he could have had his tanks in baghdad in probably less than fortyeight hours and b he was really worried about a lengthy occupation with a hell of a lot of guerrilla warfare i had the feeling he was more than a little relieved he didnt have to make the decision you really think were going to have to do this again the only question is when mcnab said next year two years from now a decade but well be here again saddam hussein is a devout student of stalins keep the people in line techniques a real sonofabitch were going to have to take him out sooner or later christ knows that if i could have found the sonofabitch i would have taken him out myself i hope youre wrong naylor said the cross resting so heavily on my manly shoulders for all these years has been that i rarely am wrong mcnab said jesus christ youre impossible naylor said laughing it is difficult to be modest when youre great mcnab said frank lloyd wright said that ill try to remember naylor said is there something i can do for you scotty or is this just a visit i thought youd never ask mcnab said first i want to thank you for sending me second lieutenant castillo which i just did he almost restored my respect for hudson high let me have that again you havent heard my speech whats wrong with west point i got a copy of donn starrys speech the one he gave to the association of graduates the one that began i have many memories of my four years as an inmate of this institution none of them favorable ah yes but general starry has always hated to say anything that might in any way offend anyone mine wasnt so polite i cant imagine you being anything but polite scotty but thats not what i was asking you just heard that i sent you castillo i went to oz young and said mustering up my best manners thank you for sending me castillo and now i want to keep him whereupon oz said i cant do it see allan naylor hes the one who sent you castillo oz said that did he he led me to believe that you are that splendid young officers mentor or sort of a de facto loving stepfather or both ive known him since he was twelve naylor said at which age he became an orphan ive sort of kept my eye on him he let me know just now that he has the pleasure of your acquaintancejust that not that you have a personal thing going he said if there was time he would like to pay his respects hes here at the moment hes my pilot i dont trust just anyone to haul my dune buggy around you brought your dune buggy here slung under a helicopter lieutenant castillo at this very moment is seeing that it is loaded aboard the c which will carry me to the land of the big px later today youre taking your dune buggy to the states with you i told them it was going to the museum at bragg my god naylor said and then without thinking added id love to see him i told him he had until im sure hell show up here to see you mcnab paused i want to keep him allan what for for openers my aidedecamp mcnab said while im writing up what we did right here ill run him through special forces training i thought you had to have five years of service to even apply for special forces training thats right mcnab said and you need three years and i dont know how many hundred hours of pilot time before you can apply for the apache program oz told me about that too this will probably piss you off scotty but i dont like the idea of him being in special forces because like just about everybody else in the army you dont like special forces we dont play by the rules god only knows what those crazy bastards will do next i didnt say that naylor said but thats what you meant mcnab said allan youre just going to have to get used to the idea that special operations is where the army is going can i say something that will piss you off im surprised that you asked first shoot you are old buddy behaving like the cavalry types who told i d white that he was making a terrible mistake pissing his assured career in cavalry away when he left his horses at fort riley in and went to fort knox to play with tanks possibly naylor said aware that he was annoyed and like the paratroop types who said the same thing to alan burdette jack tolson and the others when they stopped jumping out of airplanes at benning and bragg and went to camp rucker in the early fifties to learn how to fly that was supposed to have ended their chances to get a star okay white wound up with four stars burdette and tolson with three they did not throw their careers away because they could see the future im not asking this kid to do what i did what do you mean when i took the special forces route bull simon himself told me he wanted to be sure i understood that i would be lucky to make light bird in special forces and that my chances of getting a star were right up there with my chances of being taken bodily into heaven point taken charley castillo is a natural for special forces mcnab said because he slings your dune buggy under a huey no i mean he has a feel for it i dont think i follow you naylor said what makes you think that i dont know how much you got to hear about the russians we grabbed not very much naylor admitted the incident had been talked about but not much because it had been classified top secret and he hadnt had any bona fide need to know okay quick afteraction after the air war started when chuck horner had given us air superiority that gave us more freedom of action with our choppers the air force really wanted a scud and i was asked if i thought i could get them one i checked and there was one about eighty klicks into the desert they were getting ready to shoot it at this place anyway i staged a mission two apaches and four black hawks forty fortyfive minutes in five minutes to take out the crew fifteen minutes on the ground to figure out how to pick the sonofabitch up you didnt know you were going to move it we figured we would improvise mcnab said a little sarcastically and fortyfive minutes out it should have gone according to schedule but when my guys got on the ground they found that all the guys with their hands up werent iraqis we had two iraqi generals one russian general one russian colonel and half a dozen other noniraqis the generals were visiting the site the others were there to make sure the scud shot straight they would really have liked to hit this place we werent on the ground long enough to really find out for sure but charley youre talking about castillo he was on this operation i tried very hard allan to keep him alive he wasnt in on the operation we were sitting in my huey thirty klicks from the scud site in the middle of nowhere we had to get that close so we could talk to the choppers and i could relay the word that we were coming out to our air defense people okay naylor nodded he understood so they give us a yell tell us about the russians and what are we supposed to do with them then i had to go to the site of course so we went to the site it took us no more than ten minutes or so but that added ten minutes to the operation time the iraqis were about to figure out that all was not well and i had to decide what to do with the russians which depended on who the russians were and do that in a hell of a hurry when i got out of the huey i muttered something like i wish i spoke better russian or words to that effect and charley says sir i speak russian so i took him with me and found out he speaks russian like a native and german so five minutes after we touched down thanks to charley i knew who was going with us and who we were leaving behind we brought out one iraqi general one russian general one russian colonel and three of the technicians who were probably exeast germans who moved to russia we werent there long enough to find out for sure and the scud of course naylor said yeah and the scud one of the black hawks just picked it up and flew off with it well a black hawk can carry a mm howitzer its crew and thirty rounds naylor began then paused and added the story that went around here was that half a dozen iraqi helicopters had defected that happened because we came here because of the prisoners not where we were supposed to go and got picked up on radar and somebody with a big mouth here let the press know six choppers were approaching the border but were not to be shot at we had to give some explanation if you cant tell me dont but what happened to the prisoners we turned the iraqi over to the saudis and then we flew the officers and the technicians to vienna on royal air arabia and put them on an aeroflot flight to moscow still wearing the clothes they were wearing when we grabbed them and with copies of the pictures we took of them at the sitemcnab smiled including some of them with my guys arms around their shoulders apparently having a hell of a time what was that all about sending them to moscow that came from either the agency or the state department i dont thinkat least i never heardthat anything was ever done officially a complaint to the un or something that russians were servicing the scuds but they couldnt deny the whole thing we had the pictures and somehow they lost their identification papers and we found them thats a hell of story naylor said which i will deny ever telling you of course should someone ask the point of me telling you this war story was so i could explain why before we got back here i could see a hundred places where charley would be useful with his languages and then when we took the russians to vienna and i saw him working with them i decided i wanted him had to have him what he should be doing is time with troops now that this war is over naylor said you did it and i did it when we were second lieutenants and he should too i thought it was a waste of my time when i did it mcnab said i knew i wasnt going to spend thirty years of my life with cannons going off in my ears and you know as well as i do if charley goes back to aviation theyll pull this like father like son bullshit all over again hell spend his time giving speeches to rotary clubs and you know it and im not kidding about needing him if i had to come up with the two most important skills for an aide to a special forces general they would be fly a helicopter and speak as many languages other than english as possible and what if i say no scotty what if i say this young officer has done too many unusual things already in his brief career and now its time that he had a large dose of normal i hope you dont allan i would hate to remember this so far heartwarming reunion of ours with rancor as if on cue master sergeant dunham put his head in the door sir second lieutenant castillo wonders if you can spare him a moment naylor made a sendhimin gesture with his hands except that he wasnt wearing an arabian headdress castillo was dressed very much like colonel mcnab the buttons of his khaki african hunters safari jacket were closed but he was wearing shorts and kneehigh stockings a car the carbine version of the standard m rifle was slung from his shoulder naylor didnt see any grenade outlines but he saw enough to realize that the young lieutenant had fallen under the spell ofas he thought of it had been corrupted byscotty mcnab and there was no way he would be happy doing what he really should be doing castillo saluted and then saw colonel mcnab i didnt expect to see you here sir you can hug that ugly old man charley mcnab said i did god its good to see you charley naylor said and spread his arms its good to see you sir they embraced i just told colonel mcnab feeling like a father selling his daughter to a brothel keeper that if youre insane enough to want to get involved with special forces i will give you my very reluctant blessing i really would like to go sir its done then naylor said colonel mcnab why dont you kill say thirty minutesgo slit a few throats blow something upand give charley and me a few minutes alone chapter vi spring one the mayflower hotel connecticut avenue nw washington dc may so you became this green beret colonels fairhaired boy fernando asked castillo nodded he asked with a raised eyebrow if fernando wanted another drink fernando held out his empty glass fairhaired boy does not accurately describe what i was castillo said but i went right to work for him he could arrange your transfer just like that the c landed usand mcnabs dune buggyat dover air force base in delaware castillo said mcnab told me to get the dune buggy to the special warfare center at fort bragg and when i had i could take ten days off after which i was to report to him at bragg i asked him how i was supposed to get the dune buggy off the air base much less to fort bragg he said he was sure i would figure something out and left me there right then standing beside the dune buggy on the tarmac in my short pants bush jacket and ghutra short pants bush jacket and what and kneehigh stockings castillo said dont want to forget those fernandos face showed he wanted an explanation i got the story from guys who were with him before i got there castillo said he lined them all up said that he had looked into previous hostilities in the area and learned that the brit uniform had been short pants bush jackets and kneehigh stockings he had therefore purchased with his discretionary operating funds a supply of same from a hunting outfitter in nairobi they made he said a lot more sense than what the army was issuing to ordinary soldiers and the other thing the gootsomething that came next castillo said smiling according to the story i got he went on to say that lawrence of arabia who had been a very successful irregular warrior in the area always wore a ghutra an iqal the standard arab headdress he made a circular movement around the front of his head fernandos nod told him he had the picture actually theres two kinds one with a redandwhite headcloth thats the shumagh castillo went on with a white headcloth its a ghutra since lawrence had learned it was a practical item of military clothing for arabia that was good enough for mcnab and his special operators it obviously made more sense than a kevlar helmet since they were going to be out on the desert in the sun a lot he had acquired a supply of themone size fits allin riyadh and you all actually wore this thing i admit some heads turned when we showed up in riyadh castillo said chuckling so how did you get the dune buggy to fort bragg i knew how far i would get if i went to the air force with my problemespecially in my lawrence of arabia uniformso i went into dover rented a tonandahalf truck from uhaul loaded the dune buggy aboard and drove to bragg thank god for the american express card then i went home spent ten days with abuela and grandpa and then went back to bragg while i sat in the goddamned desert fernando said drinking lukewarm bottled water and eating mres i admit i was really beginning to think that i was something special castillo said which notion was promptly taken from me when i got to bragg by then he was brigadier general mcnab i expected either thanks or even congratulations for getting his damned buggy to bragg instead he chewed me out for not protecting the footlocker full of scotch and cognac what before the marines liberated kuwait city special ops guys were there including mcnab his first stop was the us embassy where he blew the door on the crypto room and filled a footlocker with the booze the diplomats had locked up before getting out i had forgotten it was still on the dune buggy he said if i was going to be in special forces i was going to have to understand that special forces people could be trusted with anything but somebody elses whiskey and i could consider myself lucky that nobody at swc thought i could possibly have been stupid enough to leave it on the dune buggy and that it had still been there when he collected the buggy fernando laughed and then he said he was going to charm school what i didnt know what it was either castillo replied what they do is gather all the justpromotedtobrigadiergenerals together usually at fort leavenworth the command and general staff school i know about leavenworth fernando said and the chief of staff and some other really senior brass tell them how to behave as general officers mcnab said the real purpose was to make sure the new generals didnt get too big for their solid striped trousers thats right fernando said generals have one solid stripe down the seam of their trousers dont they id forgotten that and with that in mind i was on the fourforty flight from fayetteville to columbus georgia via atlanta where starting the next morning i was to begin the course of instruction leading to being rated as a parachutist dont pay any attention to their bullshit charley mcnab said they still think what they call airbornevertical envelopment which means a thousand hanging targets floating down onto a fieldis modern warfare and getting those wings is an end in itself just keep your mouth shut get through the course and then come back here and well get you some useful training so less than twentyfour hours after i arrived at bragg a decorated wounded hero who had been on a couple of interesting operations and was now to be the aidedecamp to the deputy commander of the special warfare center i found myself lying in the mud at benning with a barrelchested hillbilly sergeanthis name was staff sergeant dudley j johnson jr ill never forget thatin a tshirt with airborne printed on it standing over me screamingi couldnt do forty pushupsthat he couldnt understand how a fucking flaming faggoti loved that linelike me got into the army much less into jump school and i better get my act in gear or he would send me back to whatever fairyfucking dipshit outfit i came from so fast my asshole wouldnt catch up for six months i know the type of gentle nurturing noncommissioned officer to which you refer fernando said laughing but then he had a thought and asked didnt he know you were a lieutenant had been in desert storm worse that you were a west pointer that i was a lieutenant yeah sure but rank doesnt count in jump school and i was still a second lieutenant he probably thought id just graduated from ocs or more than likely from some rotc college he didnt think id been in desert storm because i was there mcnab brought me home a couple of days after the armistice and id already learned what wearing a west point ring means what people watch you closely to see if youre really perfect and are absolutely delighted when you fuck up so my ring went in my toilet kit beside my wings i was pretty stupid but i knew better than to show up at jump school wearing pilots wings but you muddled through fernando asked i could even do fifty pushups by the time i finished was there a temptation to show up at the graduation ceremony wearing your wings ring and dfc yeah but i didnt id worked for mcnab long enough to know that when he said i was to keep my mouth shut he meant that i was to keep my mouth shut and staff sergeant dudley j johnson jr was really just doing his job trying to get people through jump school alive i did see him come to think of it a year eighteen months later he had applied for special forces and reported in to the swc to go through the q course it was mcnabs turn to give the welcoming speech and there behind him in class a uniform wearing a green beanie with the rope of an aide hanging from his epaulets was this familiarlooking lieutenant an aviator fernando chuckled i did check to see how he was doing castillo said he didnt make it through camp mackall they busted him out as unsuitable what does that mean it can mean any number of things but its usually because the raters which include other trainees conclude that he would be either a pain in the ass in an ateam or that he couldnt carry his share of the load special forces requires more brains than brawn you cant make it on the number of pushups you can do then how the hell did you get through if it takes brains castillo looked at him thoughtfully a moment fernando im not trying to paint myself as john wayne but when i decided to have this little teteatete with you i decided i was going to tell you everything i could okay gringo i understand i had already passed the real test id been on operations and carried my weight the instructors at mackall knew that so they knew all they had to do with me was give me skills i didnt have and polish the very few i already did aside from having my ass run ragged i actually liked mackall the instructors knew what they were teaching and they wanted you to learn i cant remember one of them ever shouting at me even when i did something really stupid interesting fernando said my weekends were free castillo went on i spent them proofreading the how to fight in the desert literature general mcnab was preparing and staying current as an aviator how did this affect your social life if you mean how did i find time to get laid i didnt poor gringo anyway i finally finished the course and went to work as his aide passing hors doeuvres and shining shoes at ohdarkhundred his driver picked me up at my boq and drove me to simmons army airfield where if i was lucky the guy given the great privilege of being the generals copilot that day had already checked the weather and had the huey ready to go nine times out of ten he had not so i did the weather got the huey up and running and flew it to smoke bomb hill then i went inside got the coffeepot running and checked the overnight mail by then his driver had picked him up and delivered him to headquarters then the three of us took a three or fourmile run around scenic smoke bomb hill to get the juices flowing following which we returned to the office where i spent part of the day taking notes at meetings of one kind or another to which the general was part and the rest of the day flying him wherever he thought it would be advantageous for military efficiency for him to drop in unannounced camp mackall the stockade the stockade delta force is in what had been a stockade makes sense it was already surrounded by large fences and barbed wire you got involved with delta force youve just heard all i can tell you about delta force castillo said and then went on and other places he felt he should keep an eye on sometimes we even got to eat lunch it was a blueribbon day if we happened to be flying near the fort bragg rod and gun club out in the boonies and the general decided he would like one of their really firstclass hamburgers speaking of food getting hungry all i had was two bowls of pistachios fernando said so am i i just realized theres a mortons of chicago across the street a little fancy no they have huge lobsters and nice steaks i suspect i will be able to get neither where im going and where is that luanda angola and where is that on the west coast of africa looking for this missing yeah let me check on my flight and then well go ill even buy castillo said he took a notebook from his jacket found the number he wanted and dialed it guten abend heir is von und zu gossinger karl he began and then inquired into the status of his businessclass reservation dulles to frankfurt am main he hung up and looked at fernando im going on lufthansa he said it leaves at onethirty in the morning as karl von und zu gossinger fernando asked hes the washington correspondent of the fulda tages zeitung castillo said accredited to the white house and everything charming fellow people say he has quite a way with the ladies he reached into his jacket again and tossed a german passport to fernando who looked at it thats who it says you are gringo you going to tell me what thats all about the passport is legitimate since i was born in germany so far as the germans are concerned im a german citizen nobody likes journalists you own those newspapers and you admit to such a thing castillo chuckled and every week or so i write something for it i generally steal it from the american conservative magazine that way if somebody checks on karl theres his picture beside his latest story from washington and if they look closer the masthead says it was founded by hermann von und zu gossinger in as i was saying nobody likes journalists but theyre expected to ask questions when an american army officer asks questions people tend to think hes in the intelligence business gringo why are you suddenly telling me all this for the last christ i dont know the last ten years youve been like a fucking clam about what you do i wont tell you anything you shouldnt know why are you telling me anything straight answer fernando nodded because im sometimes not sure who i am i used to be able to unload on general mcnab but that hasnt been possible lately and that leaves only four people i can really trust only four thats sad gringo abuela general naylor otto and you castillo said i cant tell her what i do obviously otto im sure has a good idea but i cant talk to him for different obvious reasons he doesnt know fernando interrupted i wondered about that im sure he has a damn good idea but weve never talked about it castillo answered and then went on general naylor knows but if i let him know that i sometimes get a little confused a little shaky hed jerk me jerk you send me back to the army thank you for your services and dont let the doorknob hit you in the ass on your way out he paused that left you and you thank god know how to keep your mouth shut christ whats wrong with going back to the army you said theyre going to make you a light colonel because im very good at what i do castillo said and if i went back to the army what would i do be a lieutenant colonel hold parades berate lieutenants fly airplanes it wouldnt work for a number of reasons come home to texas make an honest woman out of the most deserving of your harem breed rug rats castillo appeared about to respond to that but didnt lets go eat castillo said two washington dulles international airport sterling virginia june the stewardess a trim redhead led castillo into the firstclass compartment of the boeing er and smilingly indicated his new seat ich danke innen vielmals he said keine ursache herr von und zu gossinger she replied flashed him a very cordial smile and then went down the aisle castillo had once known another redheaded stewardess who had worked for delta he had blown that brief but fairly interesting dalliance because he had been unable to remember that she was a member of the cabin crew who flew for delta in her minddorothy was her namethe distinction was very important and anyone oblivious to it was obviously a male chauvinist not worthy of being admitted to her bed occupied with memories of dorothy mingled with thoughts of the trim lufthansa stew who had just bumped him up to first classand who had a very attractive tail indeedand with putting his laptop briefcase in the overhead bin castillo did not notice who was going to be his traveling companion until he actually started to sit down guten abend he said to the goodlooking lanky blonde sitting in the window seat and then switched to english or should it be good morning i think thats up for grabs the lanky blonde said in english with a smile i think i should warn you i dont belong up here in the front of the bus castillo said lufthansa took pity on me and gave me an upgrade then were both usurpers she said me too another member of the cabin crew this one a wispy male of whose masculinity castillo had immediate doubts came and offered a tray of shortstemmed glasses will you have some champagne madam he asked in german the lanky blonde replied in not bad german yes thank you i will the steward offered the tray to her and then to castillo who wondered why is steward okay and stewardess some sort of slam and then said in german you will go to heaven because you have just saved my life the lanky blonde smiled he raised his glass to the blonde to a pleasant flight he said to a pleasant flight she parroted and touched glasses with him why do you think lufthansa picked you for an upgrade he asked goddamned pity ill be in germany only long enough to change planes im a journalist she said oh shit really i work for forbes the magazine it happens a lot if i make sure they know i work for forbes i know he said same thing youre a journalist who do you work for the fulda tages zeitung castillo said a small newspaper in hesse i write mostly about american business there or here i couldnt help but notice that your english is just about perfect im based in washington he said and ive been here a while going home on vacation i vacation whenever i can find something to write about in florida he said that way the paper pays for it no im going because they sent for me they do that every once in a while to make sure im not being corrupted by you decadent americans jesus it would be nice if just once when i met a goodlooking female i could tell her the truth about who i am and what i do but to do that i would have to have a job that i could talk about well im a district sales manager for whirlpool you know washing machines you dont look as if you would be easy to corrupt she said oh youre wrong castillo said i can only hope you wont take advantage of me she laughed at that displaying a nice set of teeth and bright red gums no promises she said and offered her hand patricia wilson pat her hand was warm and soft my name is karl but i try to get people to call me charley he said nice to meet you charley the pilot ordered that the passenger compartment be readied for flight when they turned the cabin lights on the next morning castillo opened his eyes and saw patricia wilson was still asleep beside him she had her seat all the way backit was one of the new seats that went almost horizontal she was straight in the seat with the small airline pillow in the nape of her neck she looked good a lot of women he thought did not look good first thing in the morning especially after they had spent most of the night flying across an ocean some of them slept with their mouths open and some snored which he found amusing if not very attractive he unstrapped himself and got up carefully so as not to disturb her and then took his laptop briefcase from the overhead bin and went to the toilet he urinated and then closed the toilet seat and laid the laptop briefcase on it he went quickly through his morning toilette which concluded with splashing cologne on his face and examining it in the mirror as he swished listerine around in his mouth that done he opened the computer section of the briefcase and removed one of the computercushioning pads it appeared to be simply a black plastic cushion it was not he pried apart what looked like a heatwelded seam and then tugged on the velcro inside until it separated then he arranged all the documents which identified him as carlos guillermo or c g castillohis army ago card his supervisory special agent secret service credentials his department of homeland security identification building pass and business cards and his mastercard visa and american express credit cardsinside against what looked like a random pattern of the plastic the lines on the pattern were actually of a special plastic that would both keep the documents from shifting around thus making a lump in the cushion pad and also present a faint baffling pattern to xray machines he carefully closed the cushion pad put it back in the briefcase zipped everything up and went back to his seat patricia wilson was not only awake but sitting up and sipping at a glass of tomato juice there was another glass of tomato juice on the small flat area between their seats she pointed to it you didnt strike me as the canned orange or grapefruit juice type she said okay youre a mind reader he said which will probably get me in trouble she smiled but did not respond directly let me get out and go where you have been she said and then you can sit down take my seat if you like three frankfurt international airport frankfurt am main west germany june when the lufthansa touched down at frankfurt international airportwhich he always thought of as rhinemain as it was known to american military personnelcastillo remembered somewhat painfully the first time hed come there twentyfour years ago at age twelve hed said goodbye to his mother three hours before he had understood that she was close to dying and didnt want him to see her last days but leaving her had really been tough they had both known it was really goodbye forever otto gorner had driven him and abuela and grandpa down from bad hersfeld in his mothers mercedes major naylor and his wife and colonel lustrouss wife had met them in the pan american vip lounge there had been a man from the american consulate there too to make sure things went smoothly it had been the first proof of what his mother had said about grandpa that he was a man of influence the naylors and mrs lustrous had told him they would see him in america he hadnt believed them otto had made him promise to write and to get on the phone if he ever needed anything or just to talk mrs naylor and mrs lustrous had kissed him major naylor had hugged his shoulders otto had shaken his hand and then he and abuela and grandpa had gotten on the firstclasspassengersonly bus which carried them to the it was not only the largest airplane he had ever seen but the first airplane hed ever been inside of he had stared out the window fighting back tears as they taxied to the runway and then taken off he had been surprised how little time it had taken before germany disappeared under them pat wilson went with castillo while he rented a car she was on her way to berlin she had told him and coming the way she had even though it meant changing planes after a twohour wait in frankfurt would get her there faster than either waiting for a direct dullesberlin flight or catching one in new york would they had exchanged telephone numbers and promised to call whenever one of them was in the others city forbes was published in new york city he intended to call her the next time he had some free time in manhattan but the number he gave her was that of one of the answering machines in his suite in the mayflower he never answered the machines the karl von und zu gossinger machine announced in his voice in english and german that herr von und zu gossinger was out of town but would return the call as soon as possible if the caller would leave a name and number at the beep he didnt want to see her in washington she was a journalist and there was too much in his life there that would ignite her curiosity seeing her in new york was something else again or anywhere but washington for that matter maybe he could coincidentally find himself wherever her journalistic duties took her as castillo drove away from the hertz lot in an opel kapitan he was surprised to realize he really wanted to see more of patricia wilson four executive offices der fulda tages zeitung fulda hesse west germany june castillo took the a autobahn to schultheim where it turned into highway and continued on that until he came to the a autobahn to fulda once out of the frankfurt area traffic he made good time he kept the speedometer needle hovering around kilometers per hour which meant he was going about miles per hour which seemed both fast enough and safe on the fourlane gently curved superhighway a steady stream of cars an occasional audi or porsche or mercedes but mostly volkswagens and other small cars passed him as if he were standing still he told the burly guardalmost certainly a retired copat the entrance to the tages zeitung parking lot that his name was gossinger and that he had an appointment with herr gorner which wasnt exactly true but got him into the parking lot by the time he entered the buildingwhich had been built in the late nineteenth century destroyed in world war ii and then rebuilt to prewar specifications afterwardand went up the wide staircase to ottos office otto was standing at the head of the stairs waiting for him otto gorner was a hessian but he looked like a postcard bavarian plump redcheeked and radiating gemutlichkeit he was wearing a dark gray vested suit hed probably had made in berlin but he would have looked just as much at home in lederhosen and a green hat with a tassel waving a liter mug of beer ach der verlorene sohn otto said you should have let me know you were coming id have had someone meet you you mean you would have been waiting for the prodigal son at rhinemain i rented a car no problem castillo said otto put his arm around castillos shoulders when castillo reached the head of the stairs hugged him briefly and then waved him into the suite of executive offices the two women and one man in the outer office stood up as they entered castillo smiled and shook hands with each of them they knew who he was and thought they knew what he did he was the owner and was the washington correspondent of the gossinger g mb h newspapers read playboyremittance man otto followed him into his office and waved him into one of the leather armchairs facing his desk i was just thinking about you actually otto said im flattered i just got your monthly bill from the mayflower otto said ive got to come see you and see what all that money is buying on the other hand youre not paying me a salary castillo said we should not forget that especially since youre sending me all the way to africa is that where im sending you uhhuh what story is that otto asked and then answered his own question that missing airplane the missing castillo nodded ive been following that yarn on reuters otto said actually i think we ran sort of a wrapup in the sunday editions looks like a fascinating story castillo said dare i hope that you will send something we can use unless i am eaten by a lion or wind up in some cannibals pot i intend to file daily when do you want to go im on british airways flight ba departing heathrow at seven thirtyfive tomorrow night and will arrive at luanda at fourten the next morning and were sending you first class of course its a long flight otto you do know youll need a visa i got one in the states one of their assistant consul generals couldnt do enough for me otto snorted you cant stick around a couple of days he asked id like to otto but otto shrugged not a word not a single word had ever been exchanged between them about what castillo did but that didnt mean otto didnt know he was a highly intelligent man and a good journalist he knew but never asked questions thats luanda angola right otto asked castillo nodded you want me to let our embassy know youre coming that might be very helpful you have a ticket to london no and i dont have hotel reservations in luanda either otto picked up one of the telephones on his desk and told frau schroder to get herr gossinger to heathrow in time to make british airways flight ba to luanda angola at seven thirtyfive the next night first class of course and to see what she could do for him about some place to stay and when she had done that to send a message to the german embassy in luanda angola saying that herr gossinger was coming and requesting all courtesies and to cancel all his appointments for the rest of the dayhe and herr gossinger were going to bad hersfeld and she could reach him in his car or at das haus im wald were going to bad hersfeld are we castillo asked when otto hung up i want you to see your godchild and the other children okay castillo said and smiled i carry the greetings of fernando that wasnt true of course but if he had told fernando where he was going fernando would have said give my best to otto i am also godfather to one of fernandos rug rats you know jorge one of his what his rug rats he calls his children the rug rats thats terrible otto said but he laughed rug rats how is fernando well i think hes still growing castillo said hes well working hard you want something to eat before we go otto asked i ate a large breakfast on the plane thank you and your grandmother very well thank you she spends most of her time at the hacienda but not much gets by her i saw her a couple of days ago you will give her my best regards karl of course as they passed through the outer office otto turned to castillo and said give me the keys to the rental car karl why so i can have someone turn it in theres no sense paying for it if youre not going to be using it he paused had a thought and added unless there is some reason i cant take you to the airport id rather you didnt but how do i tell you no its a long ride back and forth to frankfurt good that will give us more time to be together i left my luggage in the car castillo said frau schroder well leave the keys to herr gossingers rental car with the guard otto ordered have someone turn it in ottos car was a black mercedes s the big one with a v engine it belonged castillo knew to one of the companies that way it was considered essential transportation for an employee deductible as a business expense and not regarded as part of ottos taxable income in the six days fernando castillo had been in germany to meet and take his grandson home he had seen enough of otto gorner who had been running the company since hermann wilhelm von und zu gossinger and his son wilhelmcastillos grandfather and unclehad died on the autobahn to make the snap judgment that he should remain in charge for the time being grandpa told carlos years laterwhen hed gone home on christmas leave during his final year at west point and was about to turn twentyonethat hed of course had otto investigated as quickly as he could grandpa said he trusted his snap character judgments only until he could get some facts to back them up otto had apparently stood up under that expensive close scrutiny because he had been running everything ever since the estate had been complicated hermann von und zu gossinger had intended to leave das haus im wald and twentyfive percent of his other assets to his daughter the rest of his estate less some bequests to faithful employees and saint johans church was to go to his son but it was determined that wilhelm had died first in that black mercedesand the implications thereof had not yet been decided by the courts when erika von und zu gossinger had died typical germanic gross absurdity carlos grandpa had told him everybody knew everything was going to come to you you were everybodys only living heir your uncle had neither wife nor children that meant his estate would ultimately go to his nearest living relatives your grandfather and your mother her will left everything to you if your grandfather had died first in that wreck his estate would have been distributed according to the provisions of his will but since your uncle was dead his inheritance would have gone to your mother but if your uncle died first then his assets would be shared between his nearest living relatives his father and your mother but since his father was dead it would go to your motherwho had already named you as her sole heir it took fifty lawyers five years god only knows how many judges and a hell of a lot of money to split those legal hairs even though it didnt matter a damn what any of the courts decided the bottom line was that you were going to get it all when you turned twentyone and that happens on february the thirteenth what am i going to do with it carlos had asked if youre smart youll continue what i set up with otto gorner he gets a good salary a lot of perksincluding use of that house in bad hersfeld a car and an expense account our american irs wouldnt let me or you get away with plus a percentage of the profits hes a hard worker and honest and about as smart as they come ill continue to keep an eye on things for you if youd like and he had so long as he had lived now the familys law firm kept an eye on things in germany and fernando who had taken a law degree after desert storm at grandpas advice kept an eye on them frau helena gorner was a blond bavarian but she didnt look as if she belonged in a dirndl with her hair braided into pigtails she was a svelte blondewhich made castillo think of patricia wilsonwho dressed in what castillo thought of as neiman marcus or maybe bonwit teller clothing when he went into the foyer of das haus im wald and she kissedor made smacking noises in close proximity tohis cheek she smelled of expensive perfume he had no idea what she really thought of him and often wondered if she was pleased displeased or didnt give much of a damn that he was godfather to her second son hermann wilhelm who had been named after both his grandfather and uncle she was tenmaybe moreyears younger than otto they had married when castillo had been in his junior year in high school and ottoever the businessmanhad combined their honeymoon trip to america with a business conference with fernando castillo in san antonio abuela had liked her and been receptive to the idea that hisand of course fernandosspending their summer vacation in germany would be a good idea abuela had told him as he and fernando were getting on the airplane to go to germany that helena had told her that otto had told her he had several times offered marriage to erika von und zu gossinger but that she had refused and that otto had always looked on karl as a son if we knew you were coming karl helena said i could have prepared something some of your old friends from saint johans or something which is another reason i didnt tell otto i was coming maybe the next time castillo said but thanks anyway helena karl just came to see us and our rug rats otto said i beg your pardon thats what fernando calls his children otto said visibly pleased with himself i dont understand helena said why doesnt that surprise me how is fernando and maria helena asked electing to get off the subject of rug rats and your grandmother all well thank you helena they send their best wishes well lets go out in backthe weather is wonderful maybe spring has finally comeand have a glass of wine before lunch helena said or knowing you two something stronger the children the rug rats you mean otto interrupted the children normally come home about four helena said not amused by either the term or her husband but sometimes they go off with their friends ill call and make sure they come home shit i didnt think to bring any of them a present among other things i am a lousy godfather and sortof uncle hell ill give them money he and otto had just touched glasses dark with scotch when one of the servants handed him a walkaround telephone frau schroder herr gossinger his caller announced i have booked you on british airways hold one please frau schroder i want to write this down he mimed a writing instrument to otto who handed him a leatherbound notebook and a gold felttip pen a journalist without a notebook otto asked go ahead please frau schroder castillo said herr gossinger i was unable to get you a firstclass ticket to london what do you have i have a business ticket for you on british airways flight leaving frankfurt tomorrow afternoon at fourthirty and arriving in london at fivefifteen fine castillo said i presume you have a ticket to luanda yes i do in that case herr gossinger british airways in frankfurt will check your luggage through to luanda if you wish great i have made reservations for you at the le presidente hotel a small suite in luanda its a meridien hotel they will send a car to meet you at the airport and will bill us directly frau schroder you are absolutely marvelous thank you very much it is my pleasure herr gossinger the tickets will be at the british airways counter at frankfurt and now that you have approved the itinerary i will inform the german embassy in luanda that you are coming thank you very much frau schroder it is my pleasure have a pleasant trip herr gossinger five heathrow airport london england june the firstclass lounge at heathrow provided internet access in nice little cubicles providing some privacy but castillo decided against sending his boss an email announcing where he was and where he was going for one thing secretary hall knew where he was going and didnt expect a stepbystep report instead castillo had a drink and watched the bbc television news until an attractive british airways passenger service representative came and collected him and an ornately costumed tall jetblack couple he thought were probably from nigeria for no good reason except they were smiling and having a good time he also thought perhaps unkindly as they walked through the terminal to the boarding gate that the brits still had the class distinction business down pat and up and running the passenger service rep had called him by nameincluding the von and the zu in german she had addressed the africans in french as msieu et madame le ministre which meant two things that they were not angolans where the language was portuguese and that he was some sort of senior government official which explained what they were doing in first class the three of them were apparently the only firstclass passengers the businessclass passengers were lined up ahead of them in the airway under the care of another passenger service representative looking like so many thirdgraders being led into the school library there were he guessed twenty or twentyfive of them it took some time for them to pass through the final ticket check which of course was waived for the upper class the lower class had already been herded into economy which occupied most of the rear of the boeing fuselage once through the door and on the plane three members of the cabin crew under a steward smilingly directed them left into the firstclass compartment which was in the nose he didnt intend to look to the right into the businessclass section because he usually found himself looking at someone disappointed that he wasnt either a movie star or an oilrich arabian prince traveling with a highpriced usually very blond mistressofthemoment but he did look and patricia wilson looked back at him jesus h fucking christ thats the last fucking thing i need was that really her you know goddamn well it was did she recognize me three to five she did that wasnt curiosity on her charming face it was surprise what the fuck do i do about this the cabin attendant handed him a glass of champagne before he was half finished with it the pilot ordered the cabin be prepared for flight the seat of his pants and the sound of the engines cutting back told him that they were at cruising altitude even though the fasten seat belts sign remained lit that was explained when the door to the flight deck opened and the captain a middleaged man with a royal air force mustache came out and quickly disappeared into the toilet well guess who forgot rule piss before takeoff castillo unlatched his seat belt and went to the toilet door when the captain came out castillo extended his business card ive got a little problem you can solve in about ten seconds captain the captain didnt like being intercepted but you dont ignoremuch less snap atfirstclass passengers how may i help you he asked theres a passenger in business a fellow journalist a very goodlooking fellow journalist miss patricia wilson who works for forbes magazine i would like very much to make this long flight in her company either move me back there or her up here the captain looked around the firstclass compartment only three of the eighteen seats were occupied he beckoned to the steward the steward will take care of your little problem for you sir the captain said when the steward was within hearing range thank you very much captain i really appreciate your courtesy not at all the captain said glad i could be of service i thought that was you patricia wilson said three minutes after the fasten seat belts sign went off youre going to luanda is that where this thing is going on the story she asked he nodded me too she said you told me you beautiful creature that you were going to berlin therefore you were lying or are lying or both what the fuck is going on here besides that missing airliner is a breaking story forbes comes out every other week they dont do breaking stories as if she had read his mind patricia wilson said my editor wants an indepth piece about sloppy air control in africa and i thought well hell why not start where they lost an airplane good try patricia but thats bullshit good idea castillo said six le presidente hotel largo de fevereiro luanda angola june there were a dozen or more black men in business suits and chauffeurs caps holding cards with names lettered on them waiting for the passengers as they came out of customs at the airport one of the cards read patricia wilson i guess the hotel sent a car for me too she said what do we do i suspect youll have to pay for it anyway castillo said and i suspect both cars will be small and probably french she asked if yours breaks downand it probably willill rescue you castillo said and you can do the same for me call me later i need the attentions of a beautician absolutely he said he had put her into her car a citroen and then followed his driver to a mercedes he wondered if that was random or whether the meridien hotel chain had a policy germans get mercedes americans get citroens when he didnt see her in the hotel lobby he was disappointed he thought her driver had probably made much better time through the very early morning traffic in the small citroen than he had in the larger mercedes and that she was probably already in her shower that triggered an immediate mental image theres no question about it at this almost obscene hour of the morning my hormones are raging and you know in your bones that this one is dangerous and that you should back off he tried out his portuguese on the assistant manager behind the registration desk but the french hotelier insisted on responding in barely understandable german in which he said welcome to le presidente and that he would have to keep castillos passport hotels did that either to make sure they got paidnot a valid excuse here because his bills were to be paid directly by the tages zeitung or so the police could have a look at it the small suite was a sitting room a bedroom and an alcove with a desk and chair that wasnt large enough to be called a room a highspeed internet cable was neatly coiled on the desk the windows of both the sitting room and the bedroom looked out and fifteen stories down onto the bay there was a basket of fruit and a bottle of wine on the coffee table and a terry cloth robe had been laid across the double bed castillo wondered if the room was bugged but that was an automatic thought as he always assumed any gun he picked up was loaded he always assumed hotel rooms were bugged he knew a lot of people who really should have known better who had fired unloaded guns and others who had wrongly presumed theres no way this place could be bugged he took his laptop from its briefcase and plugged the charger and the ethernet cable into it the highspeed access to the internet was up and running there were three email messages for him on tageszeitung washaol com one was from a company promising to return the full purchase price less shipping if their product failed to increase the size of his male member after a moments thought and pleased with himself he forwarded that one to fernandolopezcastillo com the second offered viagra online without a prescription and the third told him now was the time to refinance his mortgage he deleted both there was only one message on his msn account from shaken bakeyahoo com uncle allan is worried that your car broke down shall we tell uncle bill youre coming love mother major castillo took a moment to consider his reply to the secretary of homeland security and then quickly typed it uncle allan is a worrier car running fine ill call uncle bill if i have time to go there love charley he read the screen to make sure there were no typos and then pushed enter going to the american embassy here would be a waste of time and it would almost certainly draw attention to him furthermore he had already read in washington the intel summaries what the military attache had sent to the defense intelligence agency what the cia station chief had sent to langley and what the ambassador had sent to the state department if there had been significant developments on what happened to the missing while he was on his way to angola the secretary would either have indicated that in the email or at the least ordered him to call home his job here wasnt to find the airplane but rather as the president had put it to find out who knew what and when they knew it the german embassy was another matter not only would a german journalist be expected to check in with the embassy but otto had sent them a message saying he was coming more important they might know something or have an opinion that they almost certainly would not have shared with the americans castillo unpacked then had a shower and a shave he drew the blinds against the early morning sun lay down on the bed and went to sleep he intended to sleep until nine or thereabouts when he woke it was he dressed brushed his teeth and then went down to the lobby had a cup of coffee and a croissant in the lobby lounge and then went out and got in a taxi the doorman who put him into the cab asked in portuguese where he wanted to go and castillo told him in what he hoped sounded like portuguese the doorman seemed to understand him seven the chief of mission at the german embassy whose name was dieter hausner was about castillos age he was thin nearly bald and well dressed his office overlooked an interior garden it was impersonal the only picture on the walls was of the brandenburg gate in berlin and the furniture was modern crisp and efficient castillo was not surprised that the chromeandleather chair into which hausner waved him was awkward to get into and would be worse getting out of hausner told him the ambassador was sorry he couldnt receive herr von und zu gossinger personallythe press of dutybut he hoped that while herr von und zu gossinger was in angola he would have the chance to offer him dinner that would be very nice castillo said you know although i now consider myself a berliner im from hesse myself hausner said wetzlar oh yes and im an alte marburger the reference was to phillips university in marburg an der lahn not far from either fulda or wetzlar castillo had told people he was a marburger he knew enough about the school to get away with it including the fact that the university usually turned a deaf ear to inquiries about its alumni unless they came from another university obviously he couldnt do that here and get in a game of did you know with hausner my uncle wilhelmwilliwas a marburger castillo said but not you where did you go to university i am being interrogated why because the ambassador wanted to check me out before he fed me dinner or is dieter here really the agency spook or the spook or counterspook in addition to his other duties so far as i know i have never done anything to arouse the curiosity of german intelligence but that doesnt mean they dont have a dossier on karl wilhelm von und zu gossinger would hausner routinely have run a security check on me when he got ottos headsup that i was coming or would he presume that if the tages zeitung sent me i was who they said i was or will he if i arouse his curiosity ask for a security check the minute i walk out of here i went right from saint johans in fulda to georgetown in washington castillo said my grandfather was a believer in the total immersion system of learning a foreign language and did it work i speak fluent american castillo said and passable english hausner laughed and youre now based in washington it was either that or fulda castillo said i understand fulda offers about as much of the good life as wetzlar when i was a kid i went to the school at the leitz plant castillo said leica cameras came from the leitz factory in wetzlar i used to drink in a gasthaus by the bridge zum adler hausner furnished so did i so what brings you to luanda the missing airplane uhhuh hausner said and the man who would ordinarily cover the story was unable to come and i speak a little spanish which is a little like portuguese i understand what do you think happened to that airplane how much do you know about it only what i read in the newspapers an airplane a boeing which had been here for a year suddenly took off without permission and hasnt been seen since thats about all i know hausner said why was it here for a year how do you hide an airplane that size was it stolen what do you do with a stolen airplane you could fly it into a skyscraper in new york hausner said but i dont think thats what the thiefthieveshad in mind really it would be so much easier to stealwhats the term skyjack an airplane in the united statesor for that matter in london if they wanted to fly into buckingham palacethan it would be to fly an airplane from here to wherever they wanted to cause mischief thats true castillo agreed it probably is true but for some reason i remain unconvinced i have a theorybut please herr von und zu gossinger i really dont want to be quoted not even as a highranking officer speaking on condition of anonymity not at all he liked highranking officer all right you have my word let me put it this way hausner said i wouldnt be at all surprised if in two or three weeksor this afternoonthe airplane will be found not more than a couple of hundred miles from here perhaps even closer on a deserted field the empty hulk of the airplane everything that can be taken off of itengines instruments even the wheels and tireswill have been taken off for resale on the black market uhhuh theres a market all over africa for aircraft parts that would open the possibility that the owners of the aircraftyou dont know why it sat here for a year it may have needed parts do you know who owned it a small airplane dealer in philadelphia castillo said that probably had it insured and will now place a claim that may be enough in itself but if they were involved in having the plane stolen and can sell the parts precisely hausner said id like to see where the airplane was parked all that time castillo said after a moment is that going to be difficult theres not much to see hausner said a concrete pad in a far corner of the airfield ive been there but no it wont be a problem i know the security man at the airfield ill give him a call and tell him youre coming hausner opened his desk drawer and took two business cards from a box he wrote a name on one of them and then handed both to castillo a small gift for his favorite charity might be a good idea hausner said smiling i think ill go out there now castillo said before it gets hot ill send you out there in one of our cars hausner said and then you can take a taxi to your hotel when youve finished thats very kind of you castillo said not at all hausner said he stood up and offered his hand eight hausner was right there was nothing much to see at the airport although the little gift castillo gave to the airport security manager for his favorite charity resulted in having that dignitary drive him to the remote parking area in his citroen pickup truck there were four parking pads near the north threshold of the main runway none were in use the one the security manager pointed out as where the had been parked was identical to the othersan oilstained square concrete pad with grass growing through its cracks controllers in the tower across the field would have seen the every time they looked in the direction of the runways northern threshold taking off without permission would have been simple all the pilot would have had to doand almost certainly did dowas call ground control for permission to taxi to the hangarterminal area when that permission was granted all the pilot had had to do was make a right turn off the taxiway onto the threshold and then another right onto the runway and go he would have been airborne before any but the most alert controller would have noticed he wasnt on the taxiway castillo ran the numbers in his mind if the pilot kept the close to the ground he would have been out of sight in no more than a minute or two and disappeared from radar in not much more time if he was making three hundred knotsand he almost certainly would have been going at least that fastthat was five miles a minute in twenty minutes he would have been a hundred miles from the airport in half an hour he would have been miles from the airfield and even if he had climbed out by then in the interest of fuel economy he would have just been an unidentifiable blip on the airfields radar screen he certainly would not have activated his transponder in the taxithis one a peugeotto el presidente hotel castillo decided that he was not going to learn much more in luanda than he already knew the cia and dia and state department intel filings would have the details of who was suspected of flying the plane off who serviced the plane so that it would be flyable after sitting there for so long and so on there was no sense wasting time duplicating their efforts himself now when hed assembled and collated everybodys filings he would know which of the agencies had made the same sort of decision to let another agency develop something they should have developed themselves this is one of the things the president had said he wanted to know the airplane was bound to show up when that happened he would probably be able to determine who had done the best job of finding out what had happened and more important who had not learned something that should have been learned plus of course who had made the best guess about what was going to happen the president had made it clear he wanted to know who had known what and when and who had done or not done something others had done castillo decided that what he would do was go to his room and write a story for the tages zeitung he would email it both to germany and to hall the secretary would understand from the tages zeitung filing that he hadnt learned anything that hadnt already been reported afterward he would spend the afternoon hanging around the hotel bar striking up conversations with strangers often produced an amazing amount of information if something newor even the suggestion of something newcame up he would run it down if not hed go back to germany and from germany home until the plane showed up there was really nothing else he could do and the plane might not show up for weeks unless of course he thought wryly he went back to washington where the would show up when he was halfway across the atlantic and as a corollary of this reasoning castillo decided he would stay away from miss patricia wilson for one thing she wasnt what she announced herself to be and that made a dalliance with her if not actually dangerous then an awkward situation very likely to explode in his face for another he had the feeling she was not the sort of female who could be lured into his bed in the little time he planned to be in luanda nine there was no blinking green light in the locking mechanism of castillos hotel room door when he slid the plastic key into it he tried reinserting it in all possible ways simultaneously working the levertype doorknob he had just inserted it as he thought of it wrong side out and upside down when the door was opened from the inside as a reflex action he jumped away and flattened his back against the corridor wall there was no explosion either per se or of persons bursting into the corridor with weapons ready instead a chubby smiling very black face looked around the doorjamb into the corridor he recognized it immediately it belonged to major h richard miller jr aviation us army a usma classmate of castillos the major was wearing a notverywellfitting singlebreasted black suit a frayedcollar white shirt and a somewhat ragged black tie he looks like those drivers at the airport castillo thought and thats probably on purpose what the hell is he doing here were going to have to stop meeting this way charley miller said softly people will start to talk you sonofabitch castillo said you scared hell out of me he quickly entered his room and closed the door the two men looked at each other for a moment what the hell are you doing here castillo asked thats what i was about to ask you miller who was fifty pounds heavier and four inches taller than castillo replied plus who the hell are you oh shit castillo said and then the two embraced in the manner of brothers they had last seen one another in less than pleasant circumstances eighteen months before in afghanistan sorry about the door miller said when they broke apart what the hell did you do to it miller took an unmarked black aluminum box about the size of a cellular telephone from his pocket i give this thing ten seconds to find what its looking for and then i hit the emergency button that opens the lock but sometimes it upgefucks the mechanism which apparently my dear major whateverthehellyournameistoday is what happened in the present instance castillo shook his head i suppose the lock on the minibar is similarly destroyed no thats a mechanical lock i opened that with a pick all the wine is french which of course as a patriotic american i dont drink but there isor wasjack daniels and several kinds of scotch how long have you been here castillo asked as he opened the minibar about an hour which gave me plenty of time to sweep the room its clean castillo nodded then held up two miniature whiskey bottles one scotch and one jack daniels miller pointed to the bourbon and castillo tossed it to him he opened the scotch and poured it into a glass as miller did the same with his stillhalffull glass castillo walked to him and they touched glasses its good to see you dick castillo said yeah you too charley miller said i never got a chance to say thanks for the ride castillo made a deprecating gesture you were pretty much out of it dick he said now i know why the mafia shoots bad mob guys in the knee miller said it smarts considerable how is it that depends on who you ask miller said so far as im concerned its fine i have so far been unable to convince even one flight surgeon of that but hope springs eternal or so im told so what are you doing here you knew they sent me to the agency when i got out of the hospital i heard you were training nice young men to be spooks at the farm that didnt last long i strongly suspect that my boss called in all favors due to have me reassigned elsewhere anywhere elsewhere so they sent you here to do what on paper im the assistant military attache but actually youre the resident spook which you cant talk about miller nodded jesus i wish i had known that it would have saved me the trip over here actually being the resident spook is a real pain in the ass miller said why you met her miller said my boss excuse me who sent me to find out who you really are the lady suspects there is something fishy about you my german journalist friend youre talking about the blonde on the airplane miller nodded who is she castillo asked her name is wilson mrs patricia davies wilson shes not wearing a wedding ring castillo interrupted ah so you havent lost your legendary powers of observation miller said at the airport i wasnt sure meaning i did everything charley but blow you a kiss miller said i didnt see you castillo admitted so who is this married woman the companys regional director for southwest africa miller said everything from nigeriaactually cameroon not including nigeriato south africa but excluding that too and halfway across the continent none of the important countries shes spookincharge of what in a politically incorrect society one might think of as the african honey bucket castillo smiled in military installations the fiftyfivegallon barrels cut in half and placed as receptacles in field sanitary facilitiesonce known as latrinesare known as honey buckets she told me she works for forbes magazine castillo said thats what they call a cover charley miller said dryly and who is mr wilson a paper pusher at langley middle level maybe twenty years older than she is one unkind rumor circulating is that hes a fag with an independent income and married the lady to keep the whispers down having met him im prone to believe the unkind rumor and whats her background she was an agricultural analyst at langley before she was smitten by cupids arrow shortly after her marriage she managed to get herself sent through the farm reclassified as a field officer and has worked herself up to where she is now which she sees as a steppingstone which is what makes her a genuine pain in the ass to get back to that how so her underlings make all the mistakes and when something is done rightthat actually happens once in a whileshe takes the credit i personally know three nice young guys who quit because they couldnt take any more of her bullshit and she thinks im fishy either that or she wants to really make sure youre who you told her you are before she lets you into her pants she has a reputation for that too charley shes certainly not getting what she so obviously needs at home miller said there have been whispers sounds like the girl of my dreams castillo said so how do you want me to handle this charley except for letting her know we know each other run me castillo said id like to know what can be turned up about gossinger like i said the lady is a bitch miller said what if she finds out now or later that we know each other i can cover that castillo said you are hereby ordered not to divulge that we are acquainted you have that authority charley dick i was sent on this excursionand you are hereby ordered not to divulge this eitherby a guy who lives parttime in a gone with the windstyle mansion that overlooks the atlantic ocean near savannah no kidding castillo nodded so whats the excursion all about can you say the guy im talking about wants to know and i quote who knew what and when they knew it end quote about this missing i think they call that internal review miller said i was about to send my boss an email ill tell him i ran into you and ordered you to keep your mouth shut you email the president directly no i work for matt hall the secretary of homeland security millers face showed he knew who hall was and was surprised that charley had asked who is a good guy castillo went on he was a sergeant in vietnam he and the president are great buddies youre covered dick miller made a gesture meaning he took castillo at his word so what have you learned about the airplane that went missing miller asked somemaybe mostpeople think its close to here being cannibalized for parts only a fewvery fewpeople think it will be flown into a skyscraper somewhere theres also a theory that the pilot put it on autopilot and went out the back door so the owners can collect the insurance and how many people just for the hell of it agree with my theory about what happened to it i dont understand dick that vasily respin got it vasily who the russian arms dealer you dont know about him castillo shook his head and i didnt see his nameor anything about a russian arms dealeron either the cia dia or state intel files either castillo said you filed your theory miller nodded youre sure you saw all the files he asked i saw everything hall got and i saw cohens memo that hall was to get everything castillo said which offers all sorts of interesting possibilities castillo thought but did not say hey maybe thats really what all this is about so far as many people close to the oval office were concerned there were three things wrong with dr natalie cohen the presidents national security advisor in ascending order of importance they were that she was a woman brilliant and a close personal friend of the president if someone was trying to stick a knife in her back she would a either sense it or find out about it whereupon b she would go to the president the president would then logically decide that hall was one of the guys at that level who should look into it for a couple of reasons hall was also an absolutely loyal personal friend of the president and unlike the other cabinet officers the secretary of homeland security did not have his own intelligence service asking any of the heavy agencies to look into what was bothering dr cohen would have the cia pointing a finger at the dia or the dia pointing a finger at the state department und so viete anywhere but at someone in their own agency maybe thats what this is all about maybe not what its all about but its an element of it certainly if the president and maybe probably hall too thinks someone is screwing with cohen they want to know who it is and the facts about how the various agencies had handled the gonemissing would point them in the right direction such as miller asked dick this may be more important than you know castillo said let me make sure i have it right you have a theory that some russian arms dealer vasily respin miller furnished either stole or was responsible for the theft of the i dont think he was in the cockpit charley but i have a gut feeling hes at least involved in this and i saw some of his people here tell me about him why do you think that you never heard of him im surprised there should be a hell of a file on him who is he what does he do cutting a long story short charley in when vasily was twentyfivehe bought three antonov cargo planes from russian military surplus paid grand for all three is what i heard anyway the russian black market had just begun to kick into high gear the russians had gold and the danes had thingsbasic things but luxuries in moscowto sell and liked getting paid in gold respin made a lot of money and quickly and within a year he had set up an airline in sharjah in the united arab emirates dubai has a dutyfree port respinwho by then had already expanded his fleetflew everything from ballpoint pens to automobiles home to mother russia he made a fortune and then he got chummy with mobutu in the congo and that brought him to the attention of langley who put out the word to watch him and shortly afterward the cia in kinshasa was sending photographs of respin standing by an ilyushin at a congolese field in the middle of nowhere while mobutus soldiers offloaded crates of aks and more sophisticated weaponry okay castillo interrupted i know who youre talking about but i thought his name was aleksandr pevsner thats one name he uses miller said then looked at castillo and deadpanned its really astonishing how many people you meet these days who have several names from what ive heard pevsneror whatever his name ishas lots of airplanes what would he want this one for starting with the obvious he hasor so the story goesseveral maybe half a dozen s they need parts okay its entirely possible that this one went directly to sharjah it would have to refuel castillo interrupted probably twice miller quickly agreed no problem with a little planning the friendly skies over mother africa are pretty open charley and there are probably thirty deserted airstrips in the congo and sudan where a can sit down unseen and get itself refueled for that matter respin wouldnt even have to preposition fuel on deserted fieldsalthough my bet is that he did whoever was flying this could land and take on fuel at kisangani in the congo and kartoum in the sudanwith no questions asked in either placeand then take off to sharjah the satellites didnt spot itor any unidentified on any airfield anywhere castillo argued whats an unidentified miller asked all they had to do was land the stolen somewhere close to here and do a quick paintover of the numbers on it using the numbers of one of pevsners s conveniently out of sight in a hangar in sharjah they would have had plenty of time to do that before langley could turn the satellite cameras on he paused put his hand on his hip and mimicking a lightonhisfeet photo analyst examining satellite downloads lisped well thats a all right bruce but its not the one were looking for that belongs to raghead airways i have that tail number right here i take your point castillo said chuckling maybe pevsnerd use the airplane himself but more likely if he didnt use it for parts hed sell it to somebody the chinese or any one of the holy warrior organizations how much of this fascinating scenario did you put in your file dick castillo interrupted i sent a satburst to langleythe third one i thinkgiving the nut of the scenario i was in the commo room when we got the acknowledgment so it should have been on the desk of the regional director for southwest africa when she went to work at langley the next morning then i went to work writing what i would send when i got the without diverting substantial assets attempt to develop further response its sop i expected that would come in as soon as she read the satburst let me get this straight you prepared more than a satburst a sixpage filing miller said i even read it over very carefully to make sure i had all the big words spelled right i never saw anything like that when did you send it i never sent it miller said i never got the develop further reply why didnt you send it anyway if you had it had done it i told you because i never got the develop further response she wasnt interested she wasnt interested why not youre suggesting she just shot down your idea why would she do that if it was shot down by somebody at langley i suspect she was the shooter but i dont know that what we were supposed to get dick were summaries to date plus not yet evaluated raw data castillo said even if langley didnt have time to evaluate it hall was supposed to get it and i read everything he got there was no copy of your satburst or anything from anybody about a russian arms dealer miller nodded alleged arms dealer miller said that may be it charley you want my gut reaction with the caveat thatas you may have suspectedi dont like the lady yeah pevsner is smart as hell and theres no question in my mindif no proofthat the agency has used his services he doesnt ask questions about whats in the boxes loaded in his airplanes all he cares about is the cash upfront where are you going with this dick castillo asked if i strongly suspect the agency used pevsner mrs wilson probably knew that the agency did okay so if she passed my file upward a couple of things could have happened for one thing i suspect the african section would have told her to send one of those without diverting substantial assets attempt to develop further messages to me in her mind if i would have looked into it further there were only two possible results one i would have come up with zilch which would have embarrassed herone of her underlings was incompetentor two i would have come up with something solid which would have opened the pevsner can of worms and pissed off the covert guys either way it would be a speed bump on her path to promotion you dont have a copy of your file do you castillo asked your satburst and then what you wrote and didnt send of course not charley miller said maintaining personal copies of classified documents is a serious violation of security regulations anyone who does so is liable not only for immediate dismissal from cia service but subject to criminal prosecution either under the us code or the uniform code of military justice whichever is applicable you of all people should know that miller paused looked impassively at castillo then asked you want to see it if i go to my boss with this im going to have to have it castillo said millers right eyebrow rose in thought and stayed there for thirty seconds but seemed longer then he took a business card from his wallet wrote something on it and handed it to castillo if im going to risk sending my brilliant career down the crapper he said not to mention going to the slam i might as well go whole hog and use email let me have your email address charley and ill go home and send it to you its on my laptop itll be encrypted thats the key castillo looked at the card miller had written bullshit on it gringo at castillo dotcom he said you want to write it down miller shook his head dick once you do this you might think about getting rid of your file miller considered that for ten seconds before replying i will give that solemn thought charley he stood up and put out his hand thanks for the booze charley he said why dont you give me three minutes to get to the service elevator then go outside and find theres something wrong with the lock on your door castillo nodded okay he said then dick im pretty well covered but youre really sticking your neck out i know miller interrupted he touched castillos shoulder and walked toward the door castillo looked at his watch punched the timer button and precisely three minutes later went into the corridor closed the door and tried again to open it with the plastic key when again it wouldnt work he walked down the corridor to the bank of elevators where he had seen a house phone the concierge said that he would send someone right up ten it took five minutes for a bellman to show up on the fifteenth floor and another five minutes for him to prove to himself that there was something wrong with the lock at the door to suite whereupon he went back to the house phone by the elevator bank and reported this to someone five minutes later an assistant manager and the bell captain got off the elevator on the fifteenth floor they spent another five minutes proving to themselves that there was something wrong with the lock on the door to suite then the bell captain went to summon further assistance while the assistant manager stayed behind to assure herr gossinger that this sort of thing almost never happened and that it would be put right in short order five minutes after that a hotel engineer and his assistant showed up with a device that was supposed to open door locks in situations such as this and after another five minutes they managed to get the lock to function partially in other words it would permit the door to be opened but once closed again the lock again refused to function with the plastic key the engineer and the assistant manager then held a whispered conference after which the assistant manager went to herr gossinger and said that he certainly didnt wish to alarm him but in the opinion of the engineer someone might have tried to gain access to herr gossingers room when the engineer opened the door again it would probably be a good idea to see if anything was missing furthermore the entire lock was going to have to be replaced which would take some time and if herr gossinger had no objections probably the best thing to do was move him to another suite of rooms herr gossinger had no objections the assistant manager went to the telephone conferred with the front desk about available rooms and then told whoever he was talking to to immediately send bellmen plural to herr gossingers room fifteenthirtyfour is available herr gossinger he said it is a very nice suite not far from here perhaps you would like to check your property to make sure you have everything as castillo went through his luggage the assistant manager paid close attention castillo wondered if this was simply a manifestation of his great professional interest in a guests potential problems or whether he had other reasons castillo reported that he seemed to have everything by that time there were three bellmen hovering by the door the assistant manager snapped his fingers and pointed the bellmen carried castillos possessions out of the suite and down the corridor to which was identical to and placed everything in the new room where it had been in the old the assistant manager apologized once again for the inconvenience herr gossinger had been caused and suggested in almost a whisper that if the locks had been of german manufacture this probably wouldnt have happened castillo finally got rid of him and plugged his laptop into the highspeed internet connection there were two email messages in his mailbox at castillo com one was from fernando who had obviously received the enlarge the size of your member advertisement castillo had forwarded to him and had replied they dont send me advertisements like this because the whole world knows i dont need something like this maybe yours would grow to a normal size if you dont abuse it so much the second message had no subject and only herewith as the message it contained however a kb download castillo downloaded it then signed off before going through the decryption process it was simple all he had to do was type bullshit and then press enter millers satburst appeared and below it the analysis he had prepared and not sent secret satburst luanda may for regdir swafrica sources at policia nacional luanda confirm that sergei nostroff russian national and known associate of vasily respin alleged arms dealer and paolo walli angolan national suspected of various criminal activities are known to have been in luanda in past week present whereabouts of either are unknown undersigned suggests possibility that both may be involved with disappearance of la respin reported to own at least two and possibly three boeing aircraft la may be flown elsewhere possibly to sharjah united arab emirates where respin controls three or more airlines either for use with false identity numbers or to be stripped of usable parts for other aircraft strongly recommend immediate and widespread use of satellite awacs other surveillance assets and humintel on all possible routes between luanda and sharjah and other points in middle east more to follow stachief luanda that should have been enough castillo thought when he read the satburst of interest to anyone wondering what possibly could have happened to the missing and it certainly should have been sent to secretary hall and then he read the six pages of what miller had written but not sent i dont know if this russian arms dealer theory holds water theres no proof but goddammit this should have been brought to the attention of everybody who could possibly check it out what the hells going on here he read it through again and then inserted what miller had sent to him into the middle of a lengthy article he had writtenmostly paraphrased from the american conservative for the tages zeitung a week before and encrypted the whole thing he deleted millers file shredding it so it would not be recoverable from his laptop computers hard drive then he stood up and went to the window and looked down at the harbor and thought about what he should do next he went to his suitcase and took a tissuewrapped temple hall cigar from a whitepainted box and by the time he had gone through the ritual of carefully unwrapping it clipping the end and lighting it he had made up his mind i told otto gorner that i would file a story for the tages zeitung about the missing and i will including in it the rumor that the russian arms dealer variously known as vasily respin and aleksandr pevsner is somehow involved ill send a copy of the story to hall hell have to have it translated from the german but he will and discreetly knowing that i would not have sent to him a copy of the story unless there was a reason and when he gets to the part about respinpevsner hell understand what i meant about getting something im surprised he didnt get and at that point hell try to find out who dick miller is and when he does everything will make sense to him i hope he went to the laptop opened the word program and began to type it took him about thirty minutes to write about seven hundred words he read it over a final time then went on the internet entered tages zeitung s email address put halls private email address in the blind copy to block and sent the story then he sent a second email to hall to make sure first that he was doing what he could to cover dick millers tail and also to make sure hall understood what was going on i bumped into an old friend dick miller who works for uncle charley i told him not to mention to uncle charley that we had met or knew each other as im not going to have time to see uncle charley and i dont want to hurt his feelings dick gave me something i think youll be really surprised you dont already have im bringing it home with me see you very soon charley he read it over decided that should do it and clicked on the send button then he picked up the telephone and told the hotel operator to connect him with british airways the british airways representative told him their next flight to london would depart luanda tomorrow at if mr gossinger really had to get to london and then frankfurt am main as soon as possible there were of course other ways to do this but unfortunately they required changing planes and airlines at least once the british airways representative spent fifteen minutes detailing other travel options available the best of these alternate routes involved catching the onceaweek air chad flight to ndjamena which was conveniently departing luanda at tenfifty tonight which would arrive at ndjamena at five tomorrow morning after a sixhour layoverwhich unless he had a chadian visa and he didnt he would have to spend in the transient lounge at the airporthe could catch egyptian airways flight to cairo where he would have his choice between three different flights to london or for that matter to his ultimate destination frankfurt am main presuming there was space on them making reservations in luanda for flights departing from ndjamena or cairo sometimes was difficult just make sure i have a seat on your flight to london tomorrow night please castillo said our pleasure herr gossinger castillo decided that it was beer time no matter what time the clock said it was and went to the minibar under the television the key was in the lock which surprised him until he opened the door and found the minibar empty i will just have to run the risk of running into mrs patricia davies wilson in the hotel bar in which i will take the most remote table possible not only am i thirsty but the rumble in my stomach just reminded me that i didnt have lunch eleven the lobby newsstand offered the international edition of the herald tribune which was published in paris it was four days old it also offered le matin and paris match which were also published in paris they were two days old he wondered if this was coincidental or whether the newsstand had twodayold copies of the trib hidden somewhere in order to promote sales of le matin and paris match then he saw partially hidden behind a stack of the local newspaper which was in portuguese die frankfurter rundschau it was yesterdays paper what is that another manifestation of allaround teutonic efficiency he bought the rundschau and took it with him into the bar where he found a table that was not only deep inside but mostly behind a thick pillar he could not see into the lobby and therefore someone in the lobby would not be able to see him a waiter quickly came to the table and laid a bowl of cashews and a larger bowl of what looked like homemade potato chips before him castillo asked for a local beer and a menu the waiter said he was sorry but not only was there no food service in the bar after four oclockit was now fourohfivethere was no local beer either there were three kinds of french beer and two kinds each of german holland and english plus one kind of american what time does the restaurant open half past five sir ill have a warsteiner please castillo said as he scooped a handful of cashews from the bowl three warsteiners and one bowl each of cashews and homemade potato chips later as he was reading the rundschau s nearly vitriolic opinion of the social democrats notions of fair severance pay he sensed movement near him and lowered the rundschau just in time to see mrs patricia davies wilson slipping into the banquet seat beside him this is not a chance encounter my love you didnt just happen to see me as you walked through the lobby you were looking for me hi she said showing him a mouth full of neat white teeth i had really forgotten how good looking you are watch yourself charley hi yourself he replied how was your day she asked not bad yours i was out to the airport she said so was i he said you want to swap what you found out for what i found out i think you would come out on the short end of that he said i didnt really learn much that hasnt already been written much or nothing she asked he didnt have to answer the waiter appeared with fresh bowls of cashews and homemade potato chips i cant drink beer patricia said indicating his nearly empty glass it makes me feel bloated thats my cue to suggest something for her to drink somehow you dont strike me as someone who drinks anything that comes with a paper parasol and a chunk of pineapple he said she laughed and there was something appealing about the laugh how do you feel about martinis as a reward for a days hard work she asked if i knew you better id tell you what my boss says about martinis she laughed again softly shaking her head the way a woman does when something naughty is intimated telling him she knew the joke martinis please she told the waiter beefeaters gin if you have it she paused and looked at him okay i dont think i need a martini right now but lets see where this goes fine he said she smiled at him again i missed lunch castillo said and i was five minutes late to get anything to eat in the bar the restaurant opens at fivethirty i tried to get something to eat at the airport she said and failed at that too it was supposed to be a chicken sandwich but somehow it didnt look like chicken as soon as the restaurant opens im going to try my luck there he said will you join me id hoped youd ask i really am hungry she paused you were telling me what youd found out no i wasnt he said i belong to the getyourownstory school of journalism as he spoke he thought that should light up her curiosity now shell really want to know what ive come up with what if i show her the story for some reason she doesnt want the russian connection to come out maybe learning that im bringing it out in the open will make her worry a little or is it the hormones speaking come up to my room mon petit cherie and i will show you my story were not really competitors karl patricia said im not trying to beat you into print i work for forbes remember i bet thats what you tell all the newspaper boys that youre not trying to beat them into print he said tempering it with a smile and what do you tell all the newspaper girls she countered that im lonely and my wife doesnt understand me castillo said youre married she asked sounding surprised he smiled and shook his head thats so they dont immediately start thinking of marriage he said a lot of women my age unmarried women regard an unmarried man my age as a challenge to be overcome you are a bastard arent you she asked laughing absolutely he agreed and if they dont believe im married i have pictures of my cousins kids to show them she laughed and then said i am you are what married youre not wearing a wedding ring he challenged you looked she asked but it was a statement not a question he nodded then why did you what confess that youre single to me professional courtesy he said thats why journalists and lawyers feel safe swimming in sharkinfested waters she laughed again the waiter delivered two enormous martinis she touched the rim of her glass to his heres to you even if you wont show me your story and think im a shark i didnt say you were a shark he said that was the implication she said i meant to imply nothing of the sort castillo said the hell you didnt she said i know that youll find this hard to believe but on more than one occasion ive had a story stolen from me by women nearly as goodlooking as you ive learned that when a womana goodlooking womanbats her eyes as me im putty in her hands youre outrageous she laughed i cant believe that any woman has ever taken advantage of you karl i expected you would say something like that he said while you were batting your eyes i was not she protested if you werent then i can only hope you wont he said im not sure i could resist she shook her head so what do you think happened to the she asked it was stolen by parties unknown for unknown purposes he said it is alleged youre not going to tell me what you found out are you he shook his head tell me about mr wilson he said changing the subject where is he now home with the kiddies no kiddies she said do i look like the motherly type let me think about that he said im not she said and mr wilsons not the fatherly type either no hes not she said hes somewhat older than i am it was too late for us when we got married somewhat older how much older is somewhat thats none of your business what does he do doesnt he have a hard time with you rushing off to the four cornersin this case to darkest africain hot pursuit of a story none at all she said he has his professional life and i have mine and mine requires from time to time that i travel hes very understanding sounds like a nice arrangement castillo said whats that supposed to mean just what i said it sounds like a nice arrangement somehow it didnt come across that way it sounded sarcastic i think youll know when im being sarcastic he said then added all im doing is trying to keep you off the subject of you wanting a look at my story really really that didnt work either all youre doing is making me really curious she said tell you what ill do he said as an olive branch i think were in the same time zone here as germany we are she furnished the tages zeitung goes to bed at one in the morning if were still up then ill show you my story if not ill show it to you at breakfast you seem pretty sure ill want to have breakfast with you i dont know what youre thinking but what i had in mind was that we might still be here in the barnot drinking martinis of course which would be likely to get either or both of us in trouble but maybe coffeeat one amor that we could meet in the restaurant at say half past nine tomorrow morning no you werent she said he looked at her a moment okay no i wasnt he said ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free or in your case probably angry what happens now you storm out of the bar with or without throwing whats left of your martini in my face she met his eyes for a long moment you understood me before when i said my husband was very understanding didnt you i dont know if i did or not hes twentythree years older than i am she said and very understanding yes very understanding yes i think i understood you he said would you like another martini yes i would she said do you think we could get one from room service im sure we could but why would we want to do that because were going to have to go to your room sooner or later so that you can show me your story so why not go now i told you not until after the tages zeitung goes to bed he said ill split the difference with you karl she said how about after we do you drive a hard bargain castillo said but what the hell business has been slow chapter vii one office of the director the central intelligence agency langley virginia june secretary hall is on secure for you boss the director of central intelligences private reaction to the announcement was somewhat less than unrestrained joy he had a headache for one thing and for another he had promised his wife that he would really try to get home for once on time if not early they were having dinner at the white house but he smiled his thanks at his executive assistant picked up his phone and pushed the second of four red buttons on his telephone and a very good afternoon to you mr secretary he said and how may the central intelligence agency be of service im glad i caught you john i was literally about to stand up and walk out the door whats on your mind we have what might be a problem the secretary of homeland security said you sound serious matt unfortunately i am youre on a secure line yeah so tell me are you going to the white house tonight i dont think youre just idly curious matt yeah arent you i think we should talk this through before we go there and are asked about it talk what through you want to come over here ill wait for you what id really like for you to do is come to the mayflower suite you mean right now right now john i wouldnt ask if i didnt think it was important the director didnt reply for a moment then he said matt i dont want to have to come all the way into the district only to have to go back across the bridge to get dressed and then go back across that damned bridge again at rush hour will this wait until i go home and put on a black tie that way i can bring eleanor with me and well be right around the corner from the white house how would eleanor feel about having a drink in the mayflower bar with one of your bodyguards while we talk she wont like it but shell do it okay john thank you ill be expecting you ill be there as soon as i can matt fourohfour you said fourohfour hall said okay the dci said and hung up then he telephoned his wife told her that he was just now leaving the office for the house but as soon as he got there he would have to take a quick shower put on a dinner jacket and leave immediately he told her she had her choice of going with him right now and having a drink in the bar of the mayflower while he talked to someone or going into the district later alone and meeting him outside the mayflower or at the white house whichever she preferred eleanor said that what she really would prefer was that he come home as he said he would really try to do and that they go to the white house together but since that was obviously out of the question again she would do whatever was best for him let me think about it on the way home he said do that john she said think about it then she hung up two the mayflower hotel connecticut avenue nw washington dc june the director of central intelligence had been driven alonehis choicefrom his home to the mayflower hotel in a dark blue gmc yukon the yukon was armored and the windows were deeply tinted there were three shortwave antennae on the roof but the vehicle the director believed would not attract very much attention there were probably three hundred nearly identical vehicles moving around the district and by no means did all of them belong to the government he suspected that maybe half of them belonged to say middlelevel bureaucrats in say the department of agriculture who had bought them to impress the neighbors as a say middlelevel bank manager in st louis missouri would have bought a jaguar or a cadillac he really couldnt afford for the same purpose in washington prestige came with power rather than money in washington and environs the way to impress the neighbors was to look as if you were important enough to move around in an armored windowdarkened yukon with antennae on the roof the dcis yukon and the dci himself attracted little attention when he rolled up in front of the mayflower quickly got out and marched across the lobby to the bank of elevators even though he was preceded and trailed by security men they ascended to the fourth floor one of the security men got off the elevator first looked up and down the corridor and then indicated the direction of suite with a nod of his head the security man waited until the dci started off the elevator then led the way down the corridor to where he knocked three times on the door it was opened by a young man in a dinner jacket the security man quickly scrutinized the guy he was not of the beadyeyed political lackey sort that the security man was accustomed to encountering in this town he showed confidence and control who are you the security man asked not very politely the young man glanced down the corridor saw the dci approaching and evenly replied if youre looking for secretary hall this is it he opened the door wider the dci appeared in the doorway come on in john the secretary of homeland security called the dci entered the suite the living room looked like someone lived there he thought rather than as if it were just one more executive suite occupied by some businessmannot government employee a government per diem allowance wouldnt come close to paying for this placein washington for a few days the young man in the dinner jacket started to close the door in the face of the security guard who held it open with his foot and hand and looked to the dci for guidance its okay the dci said and the security man removed his foot and hand and the door closed in his face john this is my executive assistant charley castillo the secretary said the dci smiled and put out his hand but didnt say anything how do you do sir castillo said politely shaking the hand eleanor downstairs the secretary asked no shes coming in later i told her to call my cellular when she got close the dci said well maybe we can wrap this up before she gets here the secretary said can we get you a drink john thank you no whats this all about matt the secretary picked up a folder from the coffee tablethe dci noticed that it bore no security stamps of any kindand handed it to him the document inside six singlespaced pages also was barren of security stamps of any kind but two sentences into it the dci was aware he was reading an intel filing this one suggested the strong possibility that the boeing that had gone missing from luanda angola had been stolen by or for a russian arms dealer by the name of vasily respin either for parts to be used by one of his enterprises or to be sold to others this sounds more credible than some of the other theories ive heard the dci said where did this come from and is this why you asked me to come here i asked you to come here because i thought we could handle something thats come up between us hall said id rather if possible that we kept this out of school john the dci nodded and waited for hall to go on john did you see natalie cohens memo that i was to get everything including raw data from everybody about the hall asked i saw it wondered about it and ordered that it be carried out the dci said would you say that that file met the criteria for material i was to get obviously i didnt get it john thats the problem the secretary said you obviously got it from somebody matt i dont understand the problem is that i should have gotten it from you and i didnt the satburst was filed to langley by your station chief in luanda hall said nodding at the file the dci was still holding in his hand and the filing the satburst was either spiked or lost or something in langley i never got it from you and the filing the dci repeated somewhat impatiently that was never sent because there was no response to the satburst i cant believe that the dci said well thats what happened john hall said then where did you get it the satburst and the filing charley brought them to me just before i called you the secretary said and then added when he came back from luanda the dci glanced at castillo i thought he said this guy was his executive assistant so what was he doing in luanda and with his nose obviously into something thats none of the department of homeland securitys business how did he come into possession of this file how did he know this file was sent to langley that it was either spiked there or that something else happened to it you are going to tell me whats going on here right matt i am and im afraid youre not going to like it we wont know that until you tell me will we how about starting with what mr castillo was doing in luanda and how he came into possession of this the dci held up the file he was in luanda because the president ordered him to find out what everybody knows about the missing and when they learned it hall said everybody meaning who the cia the dia the fbi the state department the office of naval intelligence everybody hall said i wasnt told the dci said a little coldly nobody was hall said except you powell said more coldly thats the way the president wanted it john is natalie involved in this she knows about it hall replied the president told her why he wanted everybody to send me everything why she was to send the memo i will be goddamned powell said whitefaced charley thought after hed gone through all the material natalies memo produced that the obvious place for him to start was in luanda i agreed and thats where he went youre telling me unless im getting this wrong that the president authorized you to sniff around on my lawn the dci said he did yours and everybody elses hall said i wonder whose idea this was the dci asked almost of himself it doesnt really matter does it the president ordered that it be done the dci turned to castillo castillo isnt it yes sir how did you come into possession of this the dci asked how do you know that it was sent to langley castillo looked at hall who nodded the officer who wrote it gave it to me castillo said and who is this officer castillo looked at hall again and hall nodded again h richard miller sir and he is hes the cia station chief in luanda sir castillo said his cover is assistant military attache at the embassy and why would he do any of the foregoing the dci asked icily easy john the secretary said reveal his cia connection the dci went on angrily his cover give you access to classified cia files castillo didnt reply answer the question mr castillo the dci said not pleasantly that sounded like an order john the secretary said i think you should keep in mind that charley doesnt work for you the dci glared at the secretary and that the only superior authority either one of us can appeal to is the president the secretary went on given that i think we should really make an effort to deal with this between us the dci looked at the secretary for a moment but didnt speak answer the directors question charley please the secretary said tell him what you told me yes sir castillo said sir i informed miller that what i was doing was at the direct order of the president castillo said i can only presume that he felt that orders from the commander in chief carried greater weight than any others to which he was subject disclosure of classified material to unauthorized persons is a felony under the us code the dci said as is the receipt by unauthorized persons of classified material the operative word there john is unauthorized the secretary said charley was authorized to see the file first because of cohens memo and second or maybe first because he was acting at the orders of the president there has been no disclosure of classified material to unauthorized persons lets get at least that straight between us i dont want miller to get in trouble over this miller doesnt work for you matt the dci said i decide what is acceptablefor that matter criminalbehavior on his part and whats not hall looked at him for a long moment and then said that being the case i dont think we have anything more to talk about do you john the telephone on the side table by the couch rang castillo looked at the secretary for guidance answer it charley hall ordered castillo went to the telephone and picked it up he said hello and then immediately switched to german the conversation lasted not much more than a minute and then he hung up that was very interesting sir he said to hall well as soon as the director leaves you can tell me what it was all about the secretary said you are about to leave mr director arent you it was a moment before the dci answered i dont want to leave on this kind of a sour note matt exactly what is it you want of me my hope which now that i think about it was probably naive was that you would accept this situation as a problem for both of us instead he paused obviously searching for the right words go on matt instead youre acting like a typical bureaucrat protecting his turf thats what you think eh frankly john you seem far more concerned that somebody has found out the cia has egg on its faceand that the presidents going to hear about itthan you do about fixing whats wrong is that so what i had hoped our friendly chat would accomplish was that i could truthfully tell the president that we had uncovered a stoppage in the flow of information at langley that i had told you about it and had your assurance you would personally look into it and get back to me the dci looked at him the presidents going to know about that filing tonight john and hear how i came by it hall went on and im going to relay charleys concern that miller is probablyhow do i put thisin some jeopardy because he decided his first duty was to obey the orders of the commander in chief and acted accordingly the dci looked as if he was going to say something then changed his mind and now if youll excuse me john hall said i have to go home and put on my tux and if i gave you my assurance that i will personally look into thiswhat did you call it stoppage in the flow of informationand get back to you then thats what the president will hear hall replied i would also like to tell him i had your assurance that youre not going to make a sacrificial lamb of miller frankly i havent made up my mind about mr miller i suggest you do john the presidents going to hear one thing or the other powell did not respond directly you said youre going to give the president that filing he asked the satburst and tell him about the unfiled filing i dont think hell want to take the time to read the filing but if he asks for it ill of course give it to him ill tell him whats in it and ill also make sure that charley is available to personally answer any questions the president might have okay deal the dci said ill take your word that castillo here is authorized to be made privy to material like this since thats the case miller did nothing to violate the law so he gets a pass on this powell walked to hall handed him the file and put out his hand hall shook powells hand and said it was never my intention johnand damn it you should know itto go to the president with the intention of embarrassing you or the cia i know that matt the dci said not very convincingly the dci looked at castilloclosely as if trying to figure him outthen nodded at him but neither spoke nor offered his hand then he crossed the room to the door opened it and walked out the automatic closing mechanism didnt quite work and castillo went to the door and pushed it closed your lady friend called at what i think they call a propitious moment charley the secretary said i really didnt want powell to walk out of here marshaling his troops for a turf war it wasnt my lady friend sir castillo said it was my boss excuse me my editor otto gorner castillo corrected himself halls eyebrows showed interest what did he want you said it was interesting very interesting castillo said he said that hed heard from respinpevsner or whatever the hell his real name isthe russian he heard from him hall asked sounding as if he was either confused or disbelieving from some guy who said he was speaking for him castillo said otto said hes made several requests for an interview of respinpevsner and this was the first time theres been any kind of a response what was the response that he will give mekarl gossingeran interview in vienna you specifically yes sir otto asked me what i wanted him to do how much does your editorwhats his name otto gorner how much does gorner know about what you do thats a tough question sir hes a highly skilled journalist and very intelligent that specific question has never come up between us but that doesnt mean he doesnt have a very good idea of what i do and he wont talk because why you own those newspapers thats part of it sure but otto is like an uncle to me he was very close to my mother the kind of relationship you have with allan and elaine naylor just about sir ive known otto all of my life even before i met the naylors what about your real family hall asked what do they think you do for a living my cousin fernandohes a texas aggie he won a silver star as a tank platoon commander in the first iraqi warhas got a pretty good idea nothing specific but he knows where i work for example that i was at the carolina white house he knows how to keep his mouth shut im not close to any of my other relatives in texas and none of them has any idea or for that matter is interested hall thought that over a minute and nodded why do you suppose this russian arms dealer suddenly changed his mind about talking to the press he asked it probably had something to do with the story i wrote for the tages zeitung sir otto gave me a byline hall grunted and then said until just now i guess i didnt understand that that story would be printed i thought it was just a means to give me a headsup about what youd found over there it was printed in the tages zeitung on june sir castillo said before i even left luanda a number of the german papers picked it up and so did the associated press its logical to presume respinpevsner saw it hell he might even have a clipping service his man called otto just before otto called here the timeline works what do you think i should do with that interesting bit of information turn it over to the dci and see what the cia can find out fromor aboutthis guy i was hoping youd tell me to get on a plane to vienna my god charley those people are dangerous somebodythe police commissioner in philadelphia as a matter of facttold me the russian immigrant gang there makes the italian mafia look like choirboys and from everything ive readnot only your pal millers filingrespin or whatever else he calls himself respin and pevsner and there are probably other names charley furnished and chuckled and then asked hereafter pevsner sir it was a reference to the rules laid down for writing intelligence reports which permitted for example references to the arabic scholar sheikh ibn taghri birdi to be shortened after the first use of his name in a filing by adding the phase hereafter birdi hall smiled at charley hereafter pevsner he said hereafter pevsner is the head thug if he didnt like seeing his name in the newspaper hes entirely capable of having you assassinated both for writing the story and to discourage others i dont think he would telegraph his moves sir he would simply have sent somebody to eliminate me in fulda i think we ought to see what he wants what could he want i dont know but i dont think hes really going to give an interview as the first step to getting on larry king live he wants something hall smiled again but what could he want charley well never know sir unless you tell me to get on the next plane to vienna i dont know hall said doubtfully sir i also respectfully suggest that having me out of town for the next few days might be a good idea because of our encounter with the dci just now hall asked castillo nodded then said i had the feeling he thinks killing the messenger is probably a very good way to handle something like this i dont think hed go that far charley but he didnt seem to be taken very much with your charm and good looks did he no sir i didnt think so hall looked at castillo thoughtfully for fifteen seconds and then said okay charley bring me a sacher torte and i mean bring me i dont want it shipped here with your body yes sir white or dark chocolate sir hall shook his head touched castillo affectionately on the shoulder and walked out of the apartment three the mayflower hotel connecticut avenue mw washington dc june the leading security officer accompanying the dcithe trailing security officer was following the dciglanced through the plateglass door leading from the mayflower lobby saw the yukon was where he expected it to be and that there was nothing suspicious on the street and pushed the door open then he turned and found the dci was nowhere in sight jesus christ he hurried back into the lobby the trailing security officer was standing his hands folded in front of him near the front desk he made a small gesture indicating what looked like the entrance to a hallway near the end of the front desk and smiled at his colleague the sonofabitch thinks its funny the leading security officer started into what he thought was a corridor it was instead an alcove holding four house telephones and two pay telephones the dci was using one of the pay phones the leading security officer sort of backed out of the alcove and took up a position facing the trailing security officer who smiled at him and said vigilance pete constant vigilance the leading security officer mouthed fuck you the dci was on the pay phone for almost twenty minutes in that time he had spoken with the cias regional director for africa and the deputy director for personnel both of whom were in their homes the regional director for africa told him that he had not seen either a satburst or a filing suggesting that a russian arms dealer had stolen the boeing missing in angola get on the horn and right now to whoever is directly responsible for angola that would be the regional director for southwest africa mr director whatever and find out what he knows about this ill call you back in ten minutes have a number where i can reach him its a her mr director mrs patricia davies wilson all right when i call you back have a number where i can reach her shes over there mr director in luanda yes sir actually sir shes on her way back by now i think shed probably

white house i dont want you calling me there about this ill get back to you later whatever you wish mr director the deputy director for personnel when asked who is this man miller we have in luanda didnt know off the top of his head but he called his duty officer in langley who got the information the station chief in luanda was an h richard miller jr his cover was assignment as the assistant military attache where did he come from how long has he been with us what do we know about him it took another ten minutes to get the answers h richard miller jr had come to the agency from the army that he was a major in the army that he had been on temporary duty with the agency for seventeen months five months as an instructor at the farm and since then in luanda since he had been in luanda he had received two letters of official reprimand from the regional director for southwest africa one for exceeding his authority and the other for exceeding the limits of his discretionary operating funds hes relieved as of now the dci said his security clearances are suspended as of now i want him out of angola in twentyfour hours or less i want somebodysomebody good somebody we wouldnt ordinarily send someplace like angolaon his way there within four hours to replace him gregory leese is in johannesburg mr director i dont think i know him good man sir he was in caracas until recently did a fine job there okay if you say so send him tell him i ordered it and ill be in touch with him yes sir may i ask what this is all about not right now should i have this man miller report to langley mr director if so to whom if he asks why hes being relieved what may i tell him you dont know to answer that first no i dont want him in langley until i have a chance to chat with this mrs wilson yes sir if hes on temporary duty to us that must be from someplace where do military people like that come from usually either from the pentagon mr director or from central command in this caseill have to checki should think it would be central command major miller is special forces why am i not surprised to hear that well find out and send him back where he came from say that hes under investigation yes sir investigation concerning what dont say yes sir anything else mr director secretary hall of homeland security has an assistant named castillo i want to know about him if we dont have anything make inquiryvery discreet inquiryof the civil service commission they should have the results of his background investigation if that doesnt work ask somebody we know we can trust in the fbi you have a first name on this fellow mr director hall called him charley its probably charles ill get right on it mr director thank you the dci said and hung up then he pulled his head out of the translucent shell over the pay phone and looked down the alcove to the lobby the security guys were waiting for him the dci made a gesture toward the connecticut avenue entrance and the lead security man started to move in that direction four apartment b rua madre dios luanda angola june the peculiar tinkle of the telephone that came with the apartment woke major h richard miller jr quickly more as a strange sound than as a telephone he rarely used the frenchmanufactured dial instrument the cellular phone system was far more efficient he picked up the handset which placed a brass conelike microphone before his mouth as well as the speaker against his ear tentoone its a wrong number hello he said major miller an american male voice inquired speaking major this is colonel porter what the hell does he want at ohdarkhundred yes sir i am five minutes from your apartment major lieutenant colonel james r porter artillery the defense attache of the united states embassy in luanda said somewhat stiffly please be prepared to admit me youre coming here miller asked really surprised he belatedly added sir i am coming there please be prepared to admit me yes sir miller said there was a click as the connection was broken miller found the light switch in the dark put the old telephone handset in its cradle and then swung his legs out of bed wincing at the pain in his knee fuck he said aloud and then walked to the bathroom where a terry cloth robe hung on the back of the door if porters going to be here in five minutes im not going to have time for a shower and to get dressed he pulled the robe around him and then decided hed better add undershorts then he went back in the bathroom and swirled scope around in his mouth what the hell does he want the lobby buzzer went off three minutes later miller went into the kitchen and pushed the intercoms speak button yes this is colonel porter major miller porters voice came metallically over the wire pushing the solenoid now sir miller said miller had the door to his apartment open by the time the elevator came up colonel porter in uniform walked off the elevator followed by one of the embassys marine guards the gunny miller thought as he recognized the noncommissioned officer in charge of the guard detachment miller knew the large and muscular shavenheaded man a lot better than he was supposed to majors and es are not supposed to socialize but miller and the gunny had in common both being black and not quite being fully recovered from the hits they had taken from the ragheads in afghanistan this was not the gunnys first visit to millers apartment but this time gunnery sergeant roscoe fortenaux usmc was obviously on duty he had a smith amp wesson in a holster on his hip roscoe had told him that the state department insisted the marine guards be armed with the s ampw revolver rather than with the standardissue beretta mm semiautomatic neither of them had been able to understand the logic of that even the cops had gone to semiautomatic pistols good morning sir miller said to lieutenant colonel porter how are you gunny good morning sir gunny fortenaux said after you sir miller said motioning porter into the apartment porter took six steps into the corridor of millers apartment then turned as if to make sure miller had followed him inside miller gestured for him to go farther into the apartment porter turned and walked into the living room then turned again to wait for miller major miller lieutenant colonel porter said formally you stand relieved sir and you will consider yourself under arrest to quarters oh shit charley couldnt cover me yes sir miller said sir relieved of what of your duties with the cia and of course as assistant military attache your security clearances have been suspended pending an investigation an investigation of what sir you will be informed in due time porter said sir with all possible respect i dont believe you have the authority to relieve me of my cia duties miller said a message from washington from the cia in washington has ordered your relief the ambassador has ordered me to implement your relief may i see the message sir dont make this any more difficult than it already is miller porter said sir porter cut him off i am also to take possession of any and all classified materials in your possession sir i am not in possession of any classified material of any kind porter looked at him closely almost visibly deciding whether or not to believe him you will remain under arrest to quarters until such time as transportation can be arranged for you to leave angola that will occur within the next few hours yes sir sir two questions after a moment porter nodded his head sir transportation to where porter started to reply but stopped and took a small notebook from his shirt pocket he flipped through the pages then said you will report to the special activities section j us central command macdill air force base tampa florida yes sir thank you sir and with all respect sir i again ask the nature of the charges against me you will be informed in due time yes sir with respect sir in that circumstance i will not consider myself under arrest to quarters until such time as i am advised of any charges against me porter lost his temper youre under arrest to quarters because i say you are is that clear enough for you major sir if the colonel will consult the uniform code of military justice i have a copy siri think you will find that prior to being placed in confinement including arrest to quarters the accused will be notified of the nature of charges being considered against him youre a guardhouse lawyer too are you miller sir i am simply informing you of my position in this matter porter inhaled and then exhaled slowly very well major miller i am informing you that in the very near future you will be advised of your travel plans with that in mind i am ordering you to remain in your quarters until that happens does that satisfy you yes sir so long as we are agreed that i am not in arrest to quarters i suggest that you start packing major miller yes sir sergeant fortenaux you will station yourself outside major millers door and report to me immediately by telephone if the major leaves his apartment yes sir may i suggest sir miller said that the sergeant could keep a closer eye on me if he was inside my apartment i also suggest sir that if my neighbors see an armed marine standing outside my door there would be talk porter glowered at him very well he said finally then started for the door he turned ill be in touch shortly major miller just as soon as your transportation has been arranged yes sir porter went down the corridor to the door after a moment they heard it close miller went to the corridor to see if porter was really gone then turned to look at gunnery sergeant fortenaux relax roscoe miller said i read the sign i understand your problem what sign is that sir the one behind station one at the embassy a marine on guard has no friends thats boot camp bullshit fortenaux said what the fuck did you do im going to make coffee you want some fortenaux nodded they went into the kitchen miller took coffee from a cupboard and then pointed at the coffee machine if you think you can work that thing ill take a shower go on fortenaux said fortenaux carrying two mugs of coffee came into millers bedroom as miller was getting dressed miller took one and nodded his thanks like i said what the fuck did you do fortenaux asked you dont want to know something to do with that honky bitch from the cia hey roscoe how can we get pissed when they call us niggers if we call them hankies point taken fortenaux said something to do with that white lady bitch from the cia miller nodded but you really dont want to know more than that you in the really deep shit ive got a pal who said hes got me covered miller said until i learn for sure otherwise im going to believe that your pal has the clout miller nodded again and you trust him hes gotten me out of the deep shit before miller said when i got shot down in afghanistan i knew i was really in the deep shit i was bleeding like a stuck pig and i couldnt walk fifty feet and the weather was way below minimums so i knew the candy asses wouldnt launch a medevac chopper and then all of a sudden a black hawk appears right on the fucking deck charleys flying it wearing his raghead suit and beard he stole the black hawk to come and save my ass you told me that war story but not about your pal dressed up like a raghead hes a spook too yeah and a green beanie and we qo all the war back to west point i trust him okay then you going to pack porter wasnt kidding about getting you out of here quick they were breaking their asses at the embassy getting you on the next plane out i guess i better miller said ill make sure they dont rob you blind when the shippers pack you up fortenaux said thanks miller said and went into a closet and started taking out suitcases five room june castillo pushed open the heavy draperies over the window beside the bed and looked out he could see the rear of the vienna state opera and the red awnings over the sidewalk cafe of the hotel sacher on philharmonikerstrasse he had suspected as the bellman had led him down the corridor that he might have such a view but hadnt been sure he put his head against the glass and looked to see how much of the front of the opera and the openningthe ringhe could see not much it didnt matter he was simply curious once when hed stayed at the bristol as a kidgrosspappa gossinger loved the opera and theyd come at least once a yearhis grandfather had pulled aside the drapes in their suite and motioned him over he pointed down at the opernring in front of the opera you see that karlchen hed asked thats austria excuse me you see those three men resetting a cobblestone yes sir in hesse when a cobblestone needs resetting they send one man to replace it thats all it takes in austria they send three men one does the work the second drinks a beer and eats a wurst and the third supervises the other two poppa his mother had complained which had only served to fuel his grandfathers desire that his grandson should understand the austrians behind all this gemutlichkeit karlchen theyre really a savage people poppa stop you know they had an empire here karlchen yes sir and an imperial family yes sir let me tell you what they did when a member of the imperial family died karlchen they cut open the body and took out the heart and the guts then they buried the heart in one place the guts in another and the gutted corpse in saint stefans cathedral if that isnt savage what is why did they do that karl had asked to make sure he was dead i suppose his grandfather had said and ill tell you something else karlchen enough poppa his mother had said you know what the ss was karlchen the worst of the nazis yes sir most of their officers the bastards were austrians not germans at that point his mother had dragged him out of the room and taken him to a pastry shop called demels over a cup of hot chocolate almost hidden by a mountain of whipped cream she had told him that grosspappa had had bad experiences in the army with the ss and austrians what kind of bad experiences in russia he saw all the terrible things the ss did and he had an ss officer on his staff who reported everything your grandfather did but meine hertz all the austrians arent like that and you shouldnt pay too much attention to grosspappa the story about eviscerated imperial bodies had of course stuck in the mind of a tenyearold boy and a decade later sergeant carlos g castillo of the united states corps of cadets had found in the library of the united states military academy at west point confirmation of both that interesting custom and of what his grandfather had told him about the officer corps of the schutzstaffel somewhere between seventy and eighty percent had been austrian hed asked one of his professors about it colonel schneider had told him it was probably something like the joke about people converting to roman catholicism trying to be more catholic than the pope after the anschluss castillo one way to keep from being treated as a secondclass german because you hadnt been born in germany before the anschluss was to become a true believer in national socialism and adolf hitler and if you could join the ss and put on the deathshead insignia castillo let the drape fall back into place and unpacked then he took a shower put his dirty linen in a plastic bag to have it washedhe had no idea how long he would be in viennaand then left his small suite and walked down to the lobby he stopped before entering the lobby and mentally filed away pictures of people sitting there who could see people getting off one of the elevators that done he started across the lobby and at the last moment stopped himself from picking up a copy of the international edition of the herald tribune that the hotel had stacked on a table for the convenience of its guests americansand some englishread the herald tribune a reporter from the tages zeitung probably would not he went through the revolving door declined the offer of a taxi and went and stood on the corner for a moment taking in the sights and making mental notes of other people standing around where they could see who entered and left the hotel bristol then he walked down kaertnerstrasse to philharmonikerstrasse and turned left walking past the sidewalk cafe of the hotel sacher again making mental note of the people sitting at its tables the bar inside the sacherjust barely visible from the streetwas where he was supposed to go every afternoon at five until pevsner made contact that done he made his way to demels and made breakfast of white chocolatecovered croissants and hot chocolate topped with whipped cream he thought of his mother and he thought if i were michael caine or gene hackman or whatsisname the latest and doing what im doing i would have a gun several guns with which shooting from the hip i could hit a bad guy at fifty yards and drop him permanently but thats not the case here im about to meet with a really bad guy and i dont have so much as a fingernail file with which to defend myself i could have of course packed a fingernail file in my suitcase thus eluding the attentions of my coworkers in the department of homeland security at the airport and a knife but not a gun the only way i could legally get my hands on a gun here is from the cia and they wouldnt give me one without authorization which would be hard to get inasmuch as they dont know why im here and hall is not about to tell powell tonight i can probably buy one that will mean first finding a hooker and through her her pimp and through him a retail dealer in firearms as opposed to mr pevsner who is in the wholesale weapons business who will get me a pistol of some sort for an exorbitant price not a dime of which can i expect to get back from the government but i cant do that until late tonight and its possible but improbable that when i go to the sacher bar pevsner will send someone to fetch me to the rendezvous to which i would be very foolish to go without a weapon of some sort to which i would be foolish to go armed with all the weapons in the combined arsenals of mssrs caine hackman and whatsisname the answer is a knife knives despite the best efforts of professionals in the knifefighting profession to teach me how to use a blade the archbishop of canterbury is probably a better knife fighter than i am but as its said desperate times call for desperate measures in a sporting goods store on singerstrasse not far from saint stefans cathedral castillo bought two knives telling the salesman he wanted something suitable to gut a boar which he intended to hunt in hungary i thought there were boar in hesse the salesman said more to make it known that he had cleverly picked up on castillos hessian accentwhich viennese believed was harsh and coarsethan anything else theyre a lot cheaper to hunt in hungary castillo replied which happened to be true he bought a hornhandled hunting knife with an eightinch blade a folding knife with a sixinch blade and whetstone and oil and took it all back with him to the bristol none of the faces of people standing around on the sidewalk or sitting where they could see who got onto the elevators looked familiar which meant that either pevsner hadnt sent someone to keep an eye on him or that whoever had been sent had been relieved and replaced he went to his room ordered a large pot of coffee and when it had been delivered placed a towel on a small desk and began to sharpen the blades of both knives when hed finished he worked on the mechanism of the folding knife until he was able to bring it to the open position with a flick of his wrist then he lay down on the bed turned the television on found the payperview movie selection and chose a film called the package starring gene hackman chapter viii one abeche chad june there are no hangars at the abeche airport only an opensided shack that serves as the terminal building for the one scheduled flight from ndjamena each weekwhich is more often canceled than flown there is not much call for transportation to abeche a town of some forty thousand inhabitants miles east of ndjamena the capital of chad most travelers catch rides on trucksa threeday journeyif they have reason to go to what is actually a picturesque small city of narrow streets fallingdown buildings marketsand mosques but there is an airfield on which a boeing aircraft can landexcept in the rainy seasonand if it is the intention of those controlling the aircraft to strip the aircraft of its paint and registration numbers then repaint it and do so without attracting any attention whatever abeche is ideal for one thing the available labor pool is large and grateful for any kind of work and the wage scale is minimal a job involving sandpapering paint off an aircraft under a sun shield patched together from tents is better than no job at all and a patchedtogether sun shield on an airfield categorized in most official aviation publications as dirt strip no radio or navigation aids is unlikely to attract the attention of those scrutinizing satellite photography looking for a missing boeing it took three days with workers swarming around the wings and fuselage like so many ants feasting on a candy bar to remove the markings of leaseaire la from the wings fuselage and tail it was taking considerably longer to repaint the aircraft in the paint scheme and appropriate registration numbers of air suriname the generator providing power to the air compressor for the spray guns which those in charge of the aircraft had thoughtfully shipped ahead of them by truck had failed and there was no way of making repairs to it in abeche it was thus necessary to apply the paintincluding a primer coat they didnt want the new paint scheme and markings to come off thirty thousand feet in the airby hand and the two men in charge of the aircraft were agreed that a genuinelookingthat is to say neatpaint scheme was essential to their plans they were also agreed when examining the progress of the work that another threeperhaps fourdays would pass before the job was finished they had hoped to be finished long before then but it couldnt be helped it was the will of allah two hotel bristol kaerntner ring vienna austria june when karl w gossinger of the fulda tages zeitung got off the elevator he glanced around the lobby looking for a familiar face there was none he went onto the ring through the revolving door and turned right again looking for someone familiar then he started walking down kaertnerstrasse toward saint stefans cathedral walking was easier than he thought it would be after experimenting castillo had decided the best way to carry the bonehandled hunting knife was to strap the sheath to the inside of his left calf with adhesive tape it wouldnt be easy to get at it there but it would probably go unnoticed the flipopen knife was in his shirt pocket even though that meant he had to keep his jacket buttoned he was aware of the weight of the hunting knife but he didnt think it made him walk funny the only problem was the flipopen he would have to remember not to bend over he turned left onto philharmonikerstrasse and walked past the hotel sacher to the corner before turning and walking back and going into the bar there were six people in the bar four men and two women none of whom looked as if they were likely to be connected with a bigtime russian arms dealer like aleksandr pevsner castillo took a seat at the bar and after studying the array of beer bottles lined up under the mirror behind the bar ordered a czech beer a dzban it came with a bowl of pretzels a bowl of peanuts and a bowl of potato chips which he thought was a nice custom until the barman laid the bill on the bar and castillo turned it over to see that the beer was going to cost about eleven dollars american as discreetly as he could castillo studied his fellow drinkers in the nonetooreflective mirror and turned his ears up the couple at the end of the bar was speaking american english which permitted him to devote his attention to the others they were all speaking viennese german the second couple was probably married for they had the rings and he heard the woman say youve never liked my mother and you know it the remaining two men were alone and aside from ordering drinks said nothing and no one showed more than a slight and quickly passing interest in him he had had three dzban lagers between five and quarter to six when he decided that if aleksandr pevsner was going to send someone to meet himhe thought it highly unlikely that pevsner would come himselfit wasnt going to be tonight he paid the bill with an american express card that had both karl gossingers name and der tages zeitung on it and left the bar on the way back to the bristol he didnt see anyone on philharmonikerstrasse or kaertnerstrasse or the ring who either looked familiar or who showed any interest in him he had another beer this time an ottakringer gold fassl as the bristol didnt stock dzban the gold fassl came with a bowl of potato chips the bar was crowded no one showed any interest in him he signed the tab noticing the gold fassl was as expensive as the dzban and then walked across the lobby to the restaurant no one in the lobby showed any interest in him he ordered what the hell im in vienna a wiener schnitzel and was happy that he did the pounded very thin breaded veal cutlet covered a very large plate and was delicious he had what the hell im in vienna an apfelstrudel for dessert and then went to his room he undressed to his undershorts and removed the knife taped to his thigh wincing as the adhesive pulled hair next he hooked up his laptop and sent otto with a copy to hall a short email message no show but i just had three great beers and a marvelous wiener schnitzel regards karl then he went to bed and watched another movie an old one blackandwhite called the third man starring joseph cotten trevor howard and orson welles it was laid in vienna right after world war ii and there was a long sequence on the enormous ferris wheel in viennas amusement park the prater down by the notreallyblue blue danube orson welles was the villain dealing in black market penicillin castillo decided that hed kill time tomorrow by taking a cab out there he remembered his first ride on the wheel grosspappa had taken him when he was about six or seven what ill do is take a ride on the ferris wheel and then have one of those great wurstchen on a crusty roll with that sinusclearing mustard and maybe some roasted chestnuts and a beer for lunch what the hell im in vienna with that pleasant prospect in mind castillo turned off the lights and punched the pillow under his head then lewd and lascivious mental images of the two hours he had spent with mrs patricia davies wilson in his room in the le presidente hotel popped into his mind well if that turns out to be ol charleys last piece of tail in this world no complaints three office of the director the central intelligence agency langley virginia june good morning mr director mrs patricia davies wilson said as she was shown into dci powells office powell stood up courteously i understand you came directly from dulles powell said would a cup of coffee be in order oh yes thank you very much he gestured for her to take one of the two upholstered chairs facing his desk as he picked up his telephone to order coffee how was the flight powell asked more to the point how are things in angola under control mr director she said i hope it was clear that she meant unless theres something i dont know about and powell smiled his understanding something has come up actually he said and interrupted himself as a secretary came in with a tray holding a coffee service they were silent until after the coffee was poured and handed to them and the secretary had left thank you so much patricia wilson said frankly for the last hour of the flight i was looking forward to a long bath and a gallon of coffee powell smiled at her as i was saying something has come up he said and i wanted to talk to you about it as soon as possible i understand mr director are you aware mrs wilson of a filing from luanda suggesting that a russian arms dealer by the name of aleksandr pevsner has had something to do with the airplane the thats gone missing over there mr director there was a satburst from millerthe station chief powell nodded to tell her he knew whom she meant suggesting that something like that was possible and i didnt think it was credible mr director she said everything thats come to me suggests that the most likely scenario iswhats the phrasean insurance scam and everything i was able to develop myself when i was in angola supports that when you got the satburst what did you do nothing mr director i dismissed it as a wild hair you didnt send a develop further no sir i did not but i looked into it when i was in luanda as i said a moment ago you so to speak just dismissed the satburst out of hand yes sir i did perhaps if it had come from someone else powell made a go on gesture with his fingers may i speak frankly mr director she asked so far as i know this office is not wired for sound he said with a smile mr director the thing is after i had my bath and gallon of coffee the third thing i was going to do was come here and askalmost demandthat miller be relieved and replaced you have found him wanting yes sir im sorry to say i have mr director i never had the chance to sign off on millers assignment if i had been asked i would not have concurred in the assignment why not let me say mr director that i understand the human resources problem personnel had to deal with to fill that vacancy a qualified individual simply wasnt available there simply arent enough african american officers to go around and even fewer who speak portuguese and wethe agencyneeded someone over there desperately the slot had been vacant for months they had to scrape the bottom of the barreland they didand they came up with miller who really was just not qualified to hold down the job interesting powell said i should have asked that he be relieved a long time ago and why didnt you because luanda is not one of the more important postings until this airplane was stolen sir nothing much has really happened there in a year eighteen months aware of the human resources problem i decided i would just let it slide and hope for the best i realize now that was an error in judgment powell grunted does the name charles castillo mean anything to you mrs wilson she searched her memory before replying no mr director i cant say that it does may i ask who he is at the moment i dont know much about him myself powell admitted he paused then he went on you said that you were going to come here first thing and ask that miller be relieved why now well i was frankly annoyed or disappointed or both that the best theory miller came up with was the absurd idea that a russian arms dealer stole this old airplane and he waited fifteen seconds for her to go on and when she did not asked and im reluctant to go into this mr director go into it miller you know hes army and not really one of us powell nodded he may have a drinking problem sir oh we had dinner sir she said modestly averting her eyes and after two martinis and a bottle of wine miller made it plain to me that he would like to enter a personal relationship with me he made a pass at you powell asked yes mr director he did patricia wilson said sir im perfectly capable of dealing with situations like that but if thats indicative of his behavior i take your point mrs wilson powell said we cant afford to have people who lose control sir no we cant and youre right about this man miller being out of control sir apparently in anticipation of a develop further from you miller did a fiveor sixpage filing really and then when it became obvious to him that he wasnt going to get a develop further from you instead of shredding the filing he apparently gave it to this mr charles castillo who works for the secretary of homeland security that violates just about every regulation concerning filings powell furnished yes it does patricia wilson said righteously indignant mr director that sort of behavior simply cannot be tolerated it hasnt been powell said it wont be necessary for you to request millers relief mrs wilson i have already relieved him she met his eyes what will happen to him she asked he goes back to the army of course theyll have to decide what to do with him i see she said my first reaction was to see that he was disciplined for his breach of security but on reflection i think that an army service record indicating his relief for cause from a sensitive position and the revocation of his security clearances will be enough punishment i probably shouldnt say this mr director but i always feel badly when something like this is necessary i do too powell said he thought especially when im going to have to explain this goddamned mess to the president four special activities section j united states central command macdill air force base tampa florida june master sergeant omar perez special forces us army who was the noncommissioned officer in charge of the special activities section j looked at the officer standing in front of his desk and rose to his feet as a gesture of respect perezwho hated his present behinddesk assignment but had philosophically decided that it was a dirty job that somebody had to do and he had been selected by the fickle finger of fate to do itdidnt always do this but this guy was obviously no candy ass this guy had two silver stars three bronze stars and two purple hearts to go with his iwuzthere ribbons plus master parachutists and senior aviators wings and of course he had a green beret in his hand good morning sir perez said how may i help you sir oh sergeant major h richard miller jr said smiling would that you could but i think i better see an officera light colonel at least and more senior if you have one around my name is miller i gather the major does not wish to discuss with me what he wishes to discuss with the mostsenior officer i have on tap the major does not miller said who is the mostsenior officer you have on tap colonel peter j grasher sir and does the sergeant have any idea what sort of a mood grasher the gnasher is in i would say sir that the colonel is in his usual charming mood i was afraid of that miller said nevertheless ill see if colonel grasher is available sir perez said perez went through a door and closed it twenty seconds later it opened colonel peter j grasher a stocky nearly bald fortyyearold was standing in it i knew goddamn well something bad was going to happen today he said get your ass in here dick good morning sir as miller walked past colonel grasher grasher draped an arm around his shoulders i was hoping youd get et by cannibals he said what brings you back here i have been relieved sir grasher met his eyes miller is scared humiliated or both what the hell jesus christ grasher said he pointed coffee chair he said thank you sir haifa cup half of one of those envelopes of phony sugar grasher ordered thank you very much miller poured the coffee handed a cup to colonel grasher and then sat down some candy ass in the state department found out about you sending backchannel stuff grasher asked no sir i think i got away with that miller said then what didnt you get away with there have been no specific charges sir miller said i asked the milattache and he said i would be advised in due course i really dont like where this is going what job were you relieved from the attache job or the agency both sir and my security clearances have been revoked he said he had been ordered to implement my relief by the ambassador who also apparently told him to get me out of the country as quick as possible which he did i was on a south african airways turboprop three hours after colonel porter came to my apartment and relieved me a south african airways turboprop miller nodded yes sir it was the first plane out luanda to kinshasa in the congo on the turboprop then brussels on air francewhich bothered me im boycotting all things french and i hated to see them getting my tax dollarsthen london on another puddle jumper and then orlando on a virgin airlines full of disney worldbound tourists i rented a car in orlando drove here found a motel took a shower and had a shave put on my uniform and came here hes being witty but as much to convince himself hes tough and in charge than to amuse me but jesus they must have really wanted him out of there right then theres all kinds of explaining to do when you have to move an american on a foreign carrier or maybe thats something else the goddamned cia routinely gets away with what the hell did miller do colonel grasher held up his hand palm out as a signal for miller to say nothing else for the moment then he picked up one of the telephones on his desk omar have we had a headsup on major miller for that matter have we had anything on major miller he listened to the reply and then said if anything comes in get it to me right away he replaced the telephone in its cradle be imaginative miller he said come up with some reason why you might have incurred the displeasure of the cia the state department and the defense intelligence agency sir you have not advised me of my rights to have legal counsel right what i tell you will not appear on a charge sheet if he didnt think he was really in the deep doodoo he wouldnt have said that jesus that bad huh okay what you say here is forgotten as soon as you say it when that airplane the grasher nodded went missing i sent a satburst suggesting a russian arms dealer named aleksandr pevsner may have had something to do with it i saw that the boss showed it to me grasher said the satburst and before that your back channel sir i expected i would get a followup message what the agency calls a develop further so as soon as i had time i did a filing the develop further never came and so i suppose what i should have done was shred my filing but i didnt you suppose you should have done you know goddamn well it should have been shredded why not sir i thought i was right and i thought that maybe the develop further would come late but that it would come and they found the filing that should have been shredded on his computer and shit a brick is that what this is all about what about the filing did someone find out it hadnt been shredded whatever comes next is important hes trying to figure out the best way to say it sir i gave my filing to major castillo jesus h christ he doesnt mean gave he means sent the last i heard castillo was passing hors doeuvres in washington charley castillo yes sir you mean you sent it to him he was in luanda sir undercover as a german journalist i knew goddamn well castillo was doing something besides passing hors doeuvres in sodom on the potomac he went to you no sir he came on the same plane as mrs wilson who is sir mrs patricia d wilson is the companys regional director for southwest africa my immediate supervisor in the cia okay sir she smelled something wrong about castillothat he wasnt really who he said he was karl gossinger or something like thatand she told me to check him out so i did i went to the hotel and found out he was charley major castillo and you gave major castillo your filing yes sir because you believed you had valuable intel that was being ignored and that you should get it into the right hands even if doing so violated security regulations noble thought dumb fucking thing to do good god miller youre a west pointer and a fieldgrade officer you know better than to do something like that yes sir that too miller said what the hell does that mean that too that too miller sir major castillo told me he wassir what he actually said was that he had been sent by by a guy who lives parttime in a gone with the wind mansion on hilton head island two hundred and six guys live parttime in mansions on hilton head which you understood to mean he meant the president yes sir miller said and sir he ordered me not to divulge that did major castillo tell you what he was doing for the president in angola yes sir he said that he had been sent to look into the missing aircraft jesus christ this is unreal every intelligence agency under the moon is looking for that aircraft and miller is telling me the president personally sent a major to find it it is so unreal that im starting to believe it colonel grasher pressed the button on his intercom omar would you see if general potter can give me five minutes yes sir right away sir colonel i have uh a message about major miller bring it in grasher ordered yes sir master sergeant perez appeared almost immediately walked to colonel grashers desk and laid a sheet

that he gets one get the number to me and give him my personal number to be used only if he thinks he has to okay and tell him the key to charleys apartment will be waiting for him at the mayflowers front desk tell him to hang around the apartment as much as possible that ill contact him ifwheni need him okay that probably wont be until charley gets back back from where i told him to bring me a sacher torte hall said it took naylor a moment to take the meaning of that whats charley doing in vienna meeting with a russian arms dealer by the name of aleksandr pevsner hall said jesus christ allan i think it would be better if miller wore civvies but make sure he has a uniform with him done as soon as i can ill explain all this to you allan id like that matt i hate to stumble along in the dark as soon as i can allan good enough naylor said and thanks matt well be in touch hall said and broke the connection six hotel sacher wein philharmonikerstrasse vienna austria june there had been no familiar faces in the lobby of the bristol nor on the sidewalk outside nor on kaertnerstrasse as castillo walked to philharmonikerstrasse and the sacher and there was no one in the bar when he went inside the barman remembered him from last night ein anderes dzban meine herr he asked ja bitte castillo said he had finished about half of the beer when the american couple he had seen last night came the man remembered him too apparently he nodded and gave castillo a brief smile as he walked past him to sit where they had sat last night castillo had just signaled the barman for another dzban when two men came in he could not remember having seen them before they were in their forties and from the cuts of their suits castillo decided they were from somewhere east czechoslovakia or hungary or maybe poland that aroused his interest but neither man paid any interest to castillo at all one of them took some stapledtogether papers from a rattylooking briefcase and both men studied them with care they spoke very softlyalmost whisperedas if afraid that someone would eavesdrop on their conversation castillo could not make out what they were saying when he finishedslowlythe second bottle of dzban castillo signaled for another and then went to the mens room he had just begun to relieve himself when he heard the door whoosh open and turned from the urinal aware that his heart had jumped it was the american from the bar the american smiled beer goes right through me he announced castillo nodded and returned his attention to the urinal more than a little embarrassed at his jumping heart and then oh shit someone had pulled his jacket down effectively immobilizing his arms careful the american said you dont really want to piss all over the silk brocade wall the american patted him down finding both knives he took the folding knife and flipped it open with a flick of the wrist nice he said i suppose a journalist does need something like this to sharpen his pencils doesnt he then he closed the knife and put it back in castillos shirt pocket what i was looking for was a wire the american said and then in russian said adjust mr gossingers jacket sergei whoever was behind him pulled the jacket back in place castillo had trouble maintaining the direction of the flow of his urine into the urinal but did well under the circumstances the american went to the adjacent urinal and pulled down his zipper he looked over at castillo beer really does go right through me he said castillo said nothing when his bladder finally emptied he pulled up his zipper and wondered what he was going to do next he saw that the mens room wall was indeed upholstered in red silk brocade if they were going to hurt kill me they certainly had the opportunity what the hell is going on the american completed his business with a satisfied sigh and castillo heard him pull up his zipper the american went to a washbasin and started to wash his hands over his shoulder he said when you finish mr gossinger mr pevsner hopes that you will join him on the cobenzl may i turn around castillo asked of course castillo turned one of the eastern europeansthe larger onewas standing three feet from him with his hands crossed at his crotch the american was still washing his hands as much to have something to do as for reasons of hygiene castillo took the half steps to the small row of washbasins and started to wash his hands the american carefully dried his hands well he asked well what are you going to join mr pevsner on the cobenzl do i have a choice of course you do why the cobenzl you know the cobenzl castillo nodded it was on top of a hill at what castillo thought of as the beginning of the vienna woods the street leading up ithe remembered the name cobenzlgassewas lined with heuriger gasthausen that sold new wine which castillo also remembered had a hell of a kick and produced memorable hangovers mr pevsner likes to watch the sun set over vienna at this time of the year the american said he thought you might enjoy it yourself ill go castillo said mr pevsner will be pleased the american said this guy thinks im an asshole and wants me to know he does unfortunately hes right i was taken just now like a bumbling idiot like peter sellers inspector clouseau castillo dried his hands the cars outside the american said i took care of your tab thank you castillo said adding mentally the asshole said politely the car at the curb was a mercedes a new with deeply tinted windows and prague license plates the other east european stood on the curb holding the rear door open the large east european got in the front seat and the american motioned for castillo to get in the back itll be a little crowded in here im afraid say hello to ingrid the woman castillo had thought was the americans wife was already in the car she smiled at him guten abend herr gossinger ingrid said offering her hand guten abend castillo replied she was he saw now a trim woman with luxuriant dark red hair shes much better looking than i remembered i just didnt pay attention to her before does terror kill my sex drive or is it that that area of my brain is completely filled with lewd images of patricia wilson the american got in the backseatand it was a little crowded he could feel inges hip against hisand the door was closed inge works in our prague office the american said among other things she brought the cars from prague for us to use what the hell is he doing telling me that inge is available or even presuming im a good boy that inge is the prize or just making polite conversation do you know prague herr gossinger inge asked as the car started to move yes i do castillo said politely seven the other car was another black mercedes another new one but the big one like otto gorners the with the v engine its windows were similarly deeply tinted and it too carried a prague license tag it was parked sideway across three pullin spaces at the observation point on the cobenzl which was nothing more than a flat area paved with gravel and with a steel waisthigh fence to keep people from falling down the hill there were no other cars although there was space for seven or eight a tall man darkhaired welldressed was leaning on the metal guardrail puffing on a long light brown cigar another hefty east european type was resting his rear end on the front left fender of the mercedes there was a small folding table beside him something like a card table but smaller on it was a bottle of cognac two snifters and a small wooden box the tall man who appeared to be in his late thirties turned and looked at the smaller mercedes the american got out of the and castillo followed his lead the american got back in the car herr gossinger the tall man asked in german castillo walked toward him and put out his hand im gossinger he said and youre herr pevsner why not whats a name after all pevsner said with a warm smile pevsners german was fluent and he sounded like a berliner the next thing that castillo noticed was pevsners eyes they were large and blue and extraordinarily bright i wonder if hes on something pevsners grip was firm without being aggressive castillo noticed that his teeth were not only healthy looking but clean that was not always the case with russians well i guess if youve made multiple fortunes in the arms business you can afford a good dentist tell me herr gossinger pevsner asked are you by chance a cigar smoker yes i am pevsner picked up the wooden box a small cigar humidor and extended it to castillo try one of these these are the good upmanns he said excuse me castillo asked as he took one from the canary islands factory pevsner said i dont think theres any question that theyre much better than the ones castro is making in cuba in the plant he took away from the upmann people in the name of the people ive heard that castillo said thank you and an arms merchant can afford really good cigars and big black mercedeses pevsner handed him a silver guillotine and castillo trimmed the cigar ive always wondered if those things were patterned after the head chopper or the other way around pevsner said i think the big one is named after a french doctor named guillotin without the e castillo said well im glad to know that pevsner said and not surprised that you knew i suppose journalists have to have brains stuffed with odd facts dont they ive heard that too castillo said pevsner handed him a gold dunhill butane lighter and castillo carefully lit the cigar took a couple of good puffs then said very nice indeed thank you herr pevsner and gold dunhill butane lighters my pleasure herr gossinger pevsner said now another question do you like french cognac yes i do pevsner picked up the bottle and poured threequarters of an inch into one of the snifters and then added more to his glass thats a big snifter theres a lot of booze in that glass castillo picked up the snifter and began to warm the bowl in his palm we are now equipped to watch darkness fall over vienna pevsner said but as aviators know darkness doesnt fall it rises isnt that so thats what im told castillo said tell me what you think of the cognac pevsner said castillo held up a finger indicating he wanted a moment and then swirled the cognac around in the snifter for another twenty seconds then he took a sip very good he pronounced and very good cognac who said crime doesnt pay im pleased pevsner said and smiled at him you seem like such a nice fellow pevsner went on i am really pleased that it was not necessary to give you an indian beauty mark excuse me with a sudden movementso quick castillo didnt have time to jerk his head out of the waypevsner touched castillo in the center of his forehead with his index finger what the hell is that all about indian beauty mark jesus christ hes talking about a bullet hole in the center of my forehead pevsner picked up his cognac snifter and carried it to the guard fence he very carefully balanced the glass on the top railing of the fence relit his upmann with the dunhill and then leaned on the fence with his hands supporting him after a moment pevsner looked over his shoulder then waved with his left hand for castillo to join him castillo walked to the fence pevsner gestured at vienna there it is he said laid out before us as it was for emperor franz josef and before him napoleon and youre right on time we will shortly begin to see darknessas you well know rise and gradually mask vienna i suppose we will charley said so here we are we are drinking rather decent cognac and smoking what i think are really good cigars and when darkness has finished rising from the ground and all we will be able to see is a sea of lights under us i hope you will be my guest at dinner thats very kind of you castillo said two inane responses in a row attaboy charley dazzle this guy with your quick mind and verbal agility under those circumstances wouldnt it be nice if we could be honest with one another as we begin what could beand i hope will bea long and mutually profitable association whats he going to do offer to put me on his payroll not to mention his name in print that would be very nice herr pevsner castillo said thats three in a row charley i really hope you mean that major castillo pevsner said in english jesus h fucking christ please dont act as if you have no idea what i mean pevsner said how the hell did you find out castillo asked after a long moment it doesnt really matter does it but i understand your curiosity pevsner inclined his head toward the smaller mercedes before he became associated with me howard spent twenty years with the fbi is that his first name or his last howard kennedy pevsner said over the years our relationship has changed from employeremployee to being friends i call him by his christian name it took a surprisingly short time for darkness to rise until all that could be seen of vienna was a sea of lights pevsner had said nothing more he had sipped his cognac and puffed on his cigar it went out once and he relit it with the gold dunhill and then politely offered the lighter to castillo mines still going thank you castillo had said finally pevsner said well thats all there is to see unless we want to stay here until the sun rises shall we go fine castillo said pevsner started toward the there was just enough light for castillo to see the east european hurry to open the rear door for them pevsner waved castillo into the backseat ahead of him when he was inside he saw that howard kennedy was in the front seat i guess inge doesnt get to ride with the boss kennedy turned and extended his hand over the seat back its a pleasure to meet you castillo in certain circles you have quite a reputation castillo shook the hand but said nothing im sorry about that business in the mens room kennedy went on but mr pevsner for obvious reasons doesnt like his conversations recorded castillo nodded out the window he saw the east european first move the cognac snifters the bottle and the small humidor to the trunk of the smaller mercedes and then fold the table and put that in the trunk then he got behind the wheel and they started off they followed the down cobenzlgasse into vienna and then through the early evening traffic back to the center of the city finally turning off the ring onto kaertnerstrasse do you know the drei hussaren major castillo yes i do what do you prefer to be called carlos or charley or perhaps karl charley is what my friends call me thats what howard thought pevsner said youre really amazing howard thank you howard chuckled pevsner touched castillos arm in that case since i really hope we are to become friends may i call you charley of course my christian name is aleksandr pevsner said howard calls me alex would you be comfortable calling me alex charley at the last split second castillo stopped himself from saying yes sir yes i would thank you thats a lie i am not comfortable calling you alex i am not comfortable period i cant remember the last time i felt so helpless so much at the mercy of a situation i dont understand and over which i have absolutely no control and the drei hussaren is all right with you for dinner if you have another the drei hussaren is fine with me castillo said as the mercedes pulled up in front of the entrance to the restaurant and what would have happened if i had said come to think of it i know a very nice place just off gumpendorferstrasse the doorman of the drei hussaren pulled the doors open kennedy and pevsner got out and castillo slid across the seat and joined them the headwaiter was standing inside the entrance greeted them effusively and led them down the stairs into the dining room and then across it and into a private dining room there were three places set at a table that could hold eight i guess inge doesnt get to eat with the boss either glasses were produced and a waiter poured a white liquor into them in german pevsner said since you have been here before karl you know about the slivovitz the management has learned the more slivovitz they can give away the less likely their customers are to complain about the service the size of the portions the quality and most important the size of the bill castillo knew about the plum brandythe best came from moldaviaand suspected that what pevsner said was absolutely true he chuckled herr barstein the headwaiter said thats a terrible thing to say about us castillo picked up on the barstein but its truth and the truth is important isnt it karl very important castillo said picked up the glass tipped it toward the headwaiter said prosit and tossed it down pevsner laughed karl one of the few things they do half decently around here is the sauerbraten they make it with deervenison may i suggest that that sounds fine castillo said for all of us pevsner ordered and aware im taking an awful chance a dry red wine of your choice you can leave the slivovitz jawohl herr barstein the headwaiter said after he left kennedy went to the door and made sure it was closed howard pevsner said charley is curious about how we learned he is not all the time herr karl wilhelm von und zu gossinger kennedy chuckled helped himself to some more slivovitz poured some in castillos and pevsners glasses and said i know i really shouldnt drink this stuff but i like it pevsner and charley chuckled kennedy looked at castillo well when the story came out and mr pevsner decided we should have a talk with you we sent some people to fulda to give me an indian beauty mark on my forehead and when they reported that gossinger was in washington mr pevsner asked me to personally take over i put a lot of time in dc when i was with the bureau did taking over mean that you were going to personally apply the indian beauty mark anyway it wasnt hard to find out that gossinger was sharing suite in the mayflower with a fellow named carlos castillo for a bit we thought that castillo might be gossingers playmatea handsome cuban or texmex might explain why gossinger wasnt married and that might have been useful he took a sip of water then continued but then we found out lo and behold that gossinger and castillo were one and the same and then we started asking about senor castillo the first thing i thought then was that you were probably with the agency but then i found out first that youre an army officera west pointer a green beret an aviatorand then that you are matt halls special assistant at that point mr pevsner decided we should have a talk with you a talktalk as opposed to a beauty spot chat so we had someone call herr gorner and tell him that mr pevsner was willing to give herr gossinger an interview and here you are my original purpose in all this charley pevsner said wasfor that matter still isto keep the us government off my back and of course to keep my name out of the newspapers i had nothing to do with stealing that old airplane in angola where did you get that anyway you had nothing to do with stealing the absolutely nothing for one thing i have airplanes just last week i bought another onea nearly new from an airline that went under in argentinaand i dont need an old particularly i dont need to steal one which would attract the sort of attention i really dont want from the us government and a lot of other people ill be damned i believe him or is that because i had two beers in the sacher two hefty snifters of cognac on the cobenzl and two slivovitz here where did you get the idea i had anything to do with it pevsner asked two of your people were seen in luanda just before the airplane was stolen castillo said you dont happen to remember their names do you kennedy asked casually if i did i wouldnt give them to you no castillo said simply i dont howard pevsner said ill look into it kennedy said jesus christ what did i just do cause two people i never met never saw to take a bullet in the forehead the conversation was interrupted by two waiters who delivered a richlooking meatandvegetable soup and two bottles of red wine this one herr barstein the waiter said as he poured a sip into pevsners glass is hungarian the other is from the north of italy definitely not a chianti whichever is your pleasure will be a small gift from drei hussaren as pevsner raised the glass to his nose he signaled with his finger for the waiter to give castillo and kennedy a taste the waiter poured wine into their glasses pevsner took a sip and nodded his approval very nice he said now lets try the other one the ritual was repeated for everyone which required other glasses to be produced from a cabinet against the wall decisions decisions pevsner said what do you think karl i like the hungarian castillo said so do i pevsner said i like the italian kennedy said the hungarians a little too sweet for me well kennedy doesnt apparently feel compelled to agree with the boss about everything in that case pevsner said we accept the drei hussarens kind gift of both thank you very much our great pleasure herr barstein the waiters filled glasses and then left the vegetable soup was as good as it looked as he reached for his wineglass castillo thought easy on the sauce charley youre already half crocked he took a very small sip and when he put the glass down sensed pevsners eyes on him if you didnt steal the who do you think did castillo asked im not absolutely sure about this but right now i think it was stolen by an obscure group of somalian lunatics somalian castillo interjected surprised who call themselves the holy legion of muhammad pevsner went on he paused and then added who plan to crash it into the liberty bell in philadelphia pennsylvania thats crazy charley blurted sounds that way doesnt it kennedy agreed but thats what weve got so far i used the word lunatics pevsner said crazy people tend to do irrational things thats what makes them so very dangerous the liberty bell castillo argued not the statue of liberty the white house the golden gate bridge why would they want to hit the liberty bell we think two reasons kennedy said maybe three for one thing since the white house statue of liberty most important bridges etcetera have been pretty well covered nobody gives much of a damn about philadelphia so they stand a better chance of carrying it off second these holy warriors probablyhell almost certainlythink the liberty bell is more of a symbol than it is its a thirdrate tourist attraction thats all castillo thought aloud im surprised at that comment from someone like you pevsner said thats what they call mirror thinking looking in the mirror and working on the premise that other people think like what you see in the mirror they dont and thats especially true of people who call themselves something like the holy legion of muhammad goddammit hes right the booze is clouding my thinking youre right castillo said i am supposed to know better and thirdhere i admit i dont know what im talking about kennedy said i have a feeling theres a philadelphia connection a philadelphia connection castillo asked if these holy warriors intend to take out the liberty bell somebody gave them the idea they never would have come up with it themselves and that suggests somebody in philadelphia did just that who some converts to islam idn bin ragonhishead born john james smith castillo grunted did you ever give any serious thought to why so many american blacks converted to islam kennedy asked no castillo admitted maybe you should kennedy said you tell me because they hate whitey as much as the ragheads hate all infidels kennedy said and for exactly the same reason they got left behind and they dont like it thats what this war is all about charley pevsner said the muslim world getting left behind think about it he paused and took a spoonful of the soup take away their oil reserves and what do they have pevsner went on they once dominated the known world now with the exception of their oil they are completely unimportantmore to the point powerlessin the modern world they simply dont have the skills and the culture to compete in it they gave the world mathematics and some of the most wonderful architectureso long as the architecture is based on one stone laid on top of another all the skyscrapers in the arab world were designed and built by the infidels and their airplanes were designed and built by infidels and their telephone systems even their sewers and they need infidels to keep everything running this isnt the way muhammad told them it was going to be he promised them in the koran that they would control the world and they all know this because higher education in the arab world consists mostly of menonly menmemorizing the koran and since nothing is their fault it has to be someone elsesthe infidels that seems pretty simplistic castillo said and immediately thought careful charley you dont want to piss pevsner off because an answer is simple doesnt mean its not the answer pevsner said he took another sip of the soup and then a healthy swallow of the hungarian wine the muslim world is four hundredmaybe five hundredyears behind the western world pevsner went on and adding to that problem is their religious hierarchy who likes it that way people in power are never in favor of a system change that will see their power diminished thats also true in the western world of course the roman catholic and my own orthodox hierarchieswho also go around in medieval clothingare as guilty of this as the mullahs the difference is that as the influence of the christian hierarchies on their societies has diminished over time the muslim hierarchies influence has grown they haveas we see examples of just about every daythousands tens of thousands perhaps many hundreds of thousands of faithful who are perfectly willing to sacrifice their lives because their mullahs tell them it will please god and also send them directly to heaven where they will receive the attentions of grateful whores this i think you will have to agree makes for a very dangerous situation for western society he stopped and took another healthy sip of the hungarian red excuse me pevsner said i really didnt mean to deliver a lecture you make some interesting points castillo said we were talking about the holy legion of muhammads intention of crashing into the liberty bell i believe we were howard pevsner said we found out the was flown to chad kennedy said but we dont know where in chad and chad is a big country lots of remote places where you could hide a and we dont know if its still there they may have finished painting new registration numbers on it you mean i think theyre going to do more than that the only way they can hope to get close to the usphiladelphiais to disguise the airplane so it looks like somebody elses the question there is whose when we have more information well get it to you pevsner said why are you giving me this information castillo asked because the us government is better able to deal with the holy legion of muhammad than i am pevsner said if i could deal with these people myself i would i dont want these lunatics to get away with this why should you care castillo asked for the first time he sensed anger in pevsner his head snapped toward charley and his eyes were cold because i am on the same side in this war as you are pevsner said i hoped i had made that clear and if we find the airplane the pressure is off you i cant say that hes already angry people sometimes say things when theyre angry they shouldnt and also because if we find the the pressure is off you castillo asked meeting pevsners eyes pevsner didnt reply for a moment then evenly he asked are you married charley castillo shook his head and you prefer women to men yes i do castillo said and blurted jesus christ howard told me that you have a certain reputation in that area pevsner said but i wanted to see your reaction to a question like that well fuck you alex there has been some speculation about my ownwhats the word they use now orientation pevsner said probably because very little is known about my personal life the truth is jesus christ is he going to tell me hes a fag that i have a wife whom i adore and we have three lovely children two boys and a girl pevsner reached into his jacket pocket came out with an alligatorskin wallet the size of a passport and took from it a color photograph and handed it to castillo my family charley he said the photo showed pevsner and a blond svelte woman seated on chairs charley thought she looked something like ottos helena a slim blond girl of about thirteen stood to their left a blond boy of maybe ten stood to their right and a sixyearold boy dressed in white was on his knees in front of his father smiling mischievously at the camera very nice castillo said as he handed the picture back and thinking that it could have easily been a fabricated photo one showing a family that did not exist except for an arms dealers convenience castillo wondered how hard it would be to check it out there had been nothing in the dossier on pevsner that hed read that mentioned a family yes pevsner agreed they are very important to me charley i dont want them blown up or poisoned or machinegunned by some lunatic from a culture five hundred years behind ours who believes that hes pleasing god charley nodded understandingly as i said before pevsner said i am on the same side in this war as you are there are other reasons but the only reason i need is my family do you understand of course i believe i can make a contribution to this war pevsner said i have what i think is a pretty good intelligence apparatus and i have many contacts im sure you do castillo thought aloud what i want to do is get the information i sometimes have to someone in the us government who is in a position to do something about it he paused to let that sink in and then continued right now the ciaand to a lesser extent other intelligence agenciesare of two minds about me neither of them very flattering one opinion held is that i am an arms dealer and the sooner i can be put out of businesspreferably imprisonedthe sooner the world will be a safer better place the second opinion is that i am a useful asset for the movement of things and people when the operations division needs to have things and people moved covertly they handle me i have a handler he makes handler sound like an obscenity and the ops division charley kennedy said is not about to tell the fbior anyone elsethat mr pevsner does contract shipping for them or that when they feel the need to provide weapons to some group of people they often turn to mr pevsner who often knows where they can buy such weapons very quietly the door opened again and two waiters began to clear the soup bowls away replace the silver and lay a steaming tray of hirschbraten in a thick reddish brown sauce kartoffelknodel and sauerkraut on the table they also brought two more bottles of wine when a waiter started to fill castillos glass he put his hand over it and said ive had enough thank you pevsner did the same thing like you charley pevsner said wine loosens my tongue i tend to say things i shouldnt was that some sort of a reprimand or simply an observation i tend to do things i shouldnt castillo heard himself say but then charley youre a bachelor you have that freedom pevsner said god that smells good he waved the waiters out of the room and served the venison and just about everything that needed to be said has been said pevsner said wouldnt you say im not sure i know what you mean castillo said mr pevsner hopes that you will go to matt hall and tell him that i had nothing to do with the theft of the airplane in luanda pevsner interrupted and that we are going to do whatever we can to help you stop the holy legion of muhammad from attacking the liberty bell kennedy picked up without missing a beat and make other contributions as we can to help in the war between the modern western world and islam pevsner interrupted again in exchange for which mr pevsner hopes that hall will do what he can and i expect him to do something concrete pevsner interrupted again with regard to keeping mr pevsner from undue attention kennedy finished you understand that charley undue attention pevsner asked and then added and both what i intend to do and why i am doing it you have to understand that i just work for hall castillo said i take orders run errands thats all thats not what i hear kennedy said well then you hear wrong but you will charley wont you talk to secretary hall pevsner asked and just in time again castillo stopped himself from replying yes sir yes i will of course i will all right then lets enjoy our meal pevsner said no one had room for dessert but there was of course cognac and a cigar to go with the coffee castillo knew that he shouldnt take the cognac but decided there was no way he could refuse when kennedy slid the cognac bottle across the table to pevsner who had gone through his cognac quickly pevsner held up his hand we have to go howard he said and stood up he put out his hand to castillo who took it and somewhat ungracefully stood up himself its been a pleasure charley i look forward to seeing you again and ill be in touch i have no idea how matt secretary hall will react to this castillo said nothing ventured nothing gained isnt that what they say pevsner said the other car will take you back to the bristol good night charley good night alex castillo said watch your back charley kennedy said you dont want to piss on the red silk brocade do you he touched castillos shoulder and then followed pevsner out of the room jesus christ castillo said aloud when they had gone the mercedes was at the curb when he left the restaurant pevsners car was nowhere in sight he half expected to find inge in the backseat but she wasnt there he went to his room in the bristol and decided the first thing he needed was a cold shower and some coffee lots of black coffee he called room service and ordered coffee and then stood under the shower as cold as he could stand it for as long as he could stand it and tried to think he finally reached the conclusion that he was in no condition to make any but the most basic decisions as he shivering dried himself and pulled on the terry cloth bathrobe hanging on the back of the bathroom door he made three of these first that he was not going to see pevsner again in vienna pevsner had said all he intended to say he had probably gone from the drei hussaren to the airport where almost certainly a private jet was waiting for him second that he would not try to put anything down on the computer andor send any kind of a message maybe in the morning but not now and third that he had to get to washington as quickly as possible he called the concierge and told him that something had come up and he really needed to get to washington as soon as he could even if that meant getting there by a circuitous route the concierge said he would do what he could and call him there was a knock at the door while he was still on the phone with the concierge it was the floor waiter with his coffee when the floor waiter had gone charley realized the coffee posed another problem whats smarter take the coffee and see if it clears my thinking or just go to bed and sleep it off and then not two minutes later there was another knock at the door what did i do forget to sign the bill when he opened the door inge was standing there she ducked past him and entered the room he saw that she held a bottle of cognac hello charley inge said i thought you might like some company you thought or alex pevsner thought she laughed in her throat and walked close to him does it matter she asked and then he felt her hand on him under the terry cloth robe and a moment later she laughed again deep in her throat and howard was afraid you were a poofter she said what the hell why not maybe itll get patricia wilson out of my mind chapter ix one baltimorewashington international airport baltimore maryland june the beagle headed for major carlos g castillos suitcase with a delighted yelp dragging his master a hefty middleaged redhaired woman in tootight trousers and who wore both a cell phone and a smith amp wesson revolver on her belt after him the other passengers who had traveled from munich aboard lufthansa and were waiting for their luggage to appear on the carousel were fascinated excuse me sir the woman said to castillo what do you have in that bag just personal possessions castillo said a couple of gifts you dont happen to have any fresh bakery products in there do you i think it would be a good idea if you called your supervisor castillo said first id like to have a look at what you have in that suitcase sir the redhead said she snatched the cell phone from her belt spoke into it and in a very short time another uniformed armed female officer this one a wiry black whose hands didnt look large enough to handle her appeared she was pushing a small cart sir if you will put your luggage on the cart and come with me please the wiry woman said i have one more bag castillo said what about that castillos second bag had somehow become lost deep in the airbuss baggage compartment and it was ten minutes before it finally appeared on the carousel and he could load it on the cart right this way sir the wiry female said pointing to a door with an authorized personnel only sign hanging above it castillo resisted the temptation to wave goodbye to his fellow passengers there was a low counter in the room place your bag on the counter please sir the wiry woman said may i ask that you call your supervisor sir it is a violation of federal law to bring fresh bakery products meat fruit or vegetables into the united states if you have any such products in your luggage and declare them now they will be confiscated if you do not make such a declaration and i am forced to search your luggage please call your supervisor castillo said the wiry woman snatched her telephone from her uniform belt and ninety seconds later a very large uniformed armed black man with captains bars on his collar points appeared probably bakery products the wiry woman said sir the captain said would you please open your luggage that one the wiry woman said pointing that one the captain parroted castillo worked the combination and opened the suitcase it was almost concealed beneath hotel bristol toweling but there it was a box nine inches deep and about a foot square it was wrapped in white paper sealed with silver tape with a gold label reading demel stuck in the middle whats that sir the captain said its a cake what they call a sacher tone castillo said my boss asked me to bring him one from vienna your boss should have known better the captain said not unkindly and what you should have not done was bring it onto the airplane in the first place and then you should have declared it wed have confiscated it and you would be out the cost of the cake and that would have been the end of this but now i understand castillo said may i see your passport sir castillo handed him instead his secret service credentials in the leather folder was the business card identifying him as the executive assistant to the secretary of homeland security the captain handed both back to castillo looked at him without expression and said nothing either way i will tell himand he always asksthat the security procedures at bw seemed to be working just fine castillo said your call captain the captain looked at castillo for a long moment ive heard tell hes a pretty good guy the captain said finally what did he show you the wiry woman asked the captain held up a massive hand to tell her to shut up hes a really good guy castillo said ill take this from here the captain said you can go back on the floor when the wiry woman hesitated the captain pointed somewhat impatiently at the door when she went through it the captain said close your suitcase sir thanks castillo said i heard he was a sergeant in vietnam the captain said he was castillo said and closed his suitcase the captain picked up one of the suitcases and led castillo out a back door and then into the arrival lobby tell him another nam sergeant hopes he likes the cake the captain said i will castillo said and then started dragging his suitcases toward the buses and taxis door two the mayflower hotel connecticut avenue nw washington dc june a bellman pushing an ornate baggage cart followed castillo into his apartment just put them in the bedroom please castillo said as he handed him his tip i keep telling you charley we have to stop meeting in hotel rooms like this major h richard miller jr said from behind him people are going to talk charley startled looked around the living room miller was sprawled low in an armchair he was wearing a suit his shirt collar was open and his tie pulled down a bottle of heineken beer sat on the table beside him what the hell are you doing here charley asked an old pal told me not to worry he could cover for me turns out he couldnt you are looking at a disgraced youknowwhat relieved for cause oh shit castillo said relieved for cause they did everything but cut off my uniform buttons and march me through the gate at the luanda airport while a band played the rogues march how did you know where to find me general naylor knew where you were or at least about this apartment he told me a key would be waiting for me and i was to make myself as invisible as possible until whatever is going to happen happens ill be damned charley said nice place charley you must be on a different per diem scale than i am its close to where i work charley said my boss likes to have me available yeah miller said disbelievingly then added i have a cell phone with the number of your boss to be used only if necessary what does that mean miller shrugged general naylor gave it to me i guess if somebody shows up here with a cross to nail me to your boss wants to know well let me see whats going on charley said and took out his cellular telephone where the hell have you been miller asked castillo put up his hand to tell him to wait sir this is your personal fedex international courier he began i have your sacher torte for you yes sir i just walked into my apartment yes sir hes here if i can have twenty minutes for a shower and a shave ill be right over sir i can come over there yes sir ill be waiting for you he hung up and turned to miller get your ass off the chair and try to look respectable my boss is on his way over here and before he gets here i need a shower you want me here miller asked i think he wants to see you too charley said after a just barely perceptible hesitation castillo freshly shaved and wearing crisp trousers and a dress shirt opened the door to secretary hall good afternoon sir i tried to call you in vienna hall said i had all kinds of second thoughts about you and pevsner and all the bristol would tell me was that you had checked out early this morning i was really getting worried charley hall saw miller im matt hall major miller he said putting out his hand how do you do sir now that our friend is back in one piece im feeling a lot better than i was a half hour ago did he tell you wheres hes been what he was trying to do no sir miller said i picked up on vienna charley walked into the bedroom and came back with the sacher torte from demels here you go sir he said one cake of fourteen raspberry layers i was kidding charley you sounded serious to me sir and its fresh i picked it up on the way to the airport this morning hall took the box and shook his head howd you get it into the country a customs service captain at bw is one of your admirers he said to tell you one vietnam sergeant to another that he hopes you enjoy it you told him you worked for me it was either that or go to jail i was in custody two armed females and a beagle the beagle sniffed the cake hall shook his head but chuckled my god charley he said but thank you what do i owe you my pleasure sir i was happy to do it well argue about that later hall said right now all i want to say is that im glad you had second thoughts about trying to meet with pevsner too sir hes really a dangerous character charley i asked joel isaacson if he knew anything about him and got a fiveminute lecture all frightening hes a frightening man charley agreed the fbi is sending me his dossier hall went on and then he thought aloud which i should have had by now anyway im glad you missed him i met with pevsner sir you met with him yes sir ive got a long story youre going to have a hard time believing im not sure i believe it myself well lets hear it charley sir miller asked would you like me to make myself scarce hall looked at him no he said after a moment it was your filing after all that started this whole thing he paused and i have the feeling that what one of you knows so does the other so no major miller dont make yourself scarce he looked at charley the bottom line castillo began is that he said he didnt steal the which is precisely what one would expect him to say hall said and that hes going to help us find it charley said in exchange for which he wants you to use your influence to get the government to reduce the attention its paying to him the telephone rang castillo looked at hall for guidance answer it hall said charley walked to the telephone and picked it up and said hello he was silent a moment then replied yes it is the drei hussaren no wait he patted his chest and finding no pen gestured to miller to give him something to write with hall beat miller to it okay charley said now i need some paper miller picked up the washington post from the couch and handed it to castillo okay castillo said into the receiver shoot he made notes on the newsprint then said let me make sure i have that right i spell ablebakerechocharleyhotelecho right hello hello shit he put the phone back in the cradle he hung up come on charley hall said gesturing for details it was a man american accent he asked if i was major castillo i said i was he said he had a message from alex if i would tell him where i had dinner last night i told him he said that as of last night the was on the ground in abeche chad alex being pevsner hall asked yes sir why would he refer to you as major castillo he knew who i was before he called otto gorner charley said thats why he agreed to the interview before he knew im me he was going to take out gossinger he told you that hall asked the way he put it was that gossinger was going to get an indian beauty mark charley said thats a small red circle in the middle of the forehead jesus hall said and he was serious right i believed him charley said i never should have let you go over there at least not alone if i hadnt been alone i dont think he would have met with me permission to speak sir miller asked hall gave him a strange look but said permission granted two things miller said i dont think it was a coincidence that phone call came fifteen minutes after charley walked in here thats the first time its rung since ive been here which means they have somebody here are paying a bellman or someone yeah castillo grunted his agreement two miller went on pevsner would know where the is because he put it there i dont think he stole it charley said he told me he has airplanes that he just bought a nearly new from an argentine airline that went bellyup charley i think you should take it from the top hall said yes sir and you miller if you have any questions while hes telling us ask them yes sir miller said sir i sent an email saying he didnt show at the sacher the first night charley began so i went back the next nightthats last nightand so how did you handle the woman who went to your room hall asked with a smile you left it that she showed up at your door with a bottle of cognac and then drove you to the airport in the morning i was hoping you wouldnt ask sir charley said you dumb sonofabitch charley miller said agreed charley said and that brings up the equally embarrassing fact that i was at least half drunk which should be factored into this you think pevsner purposefully got you drunk hall asked we all had a lot to drink charley said but do i think there was a conscious effort to get me drunk no he was drinking cognac when i met him on the cobenzl offered me some which i didnt think i should refuse and i kept up with him he had as much to drinkfor that matter so did kennedyas i did and how reliable do you think this information isthat the is or was last night in chad i think pevsner thinks it is charley said i dont think he would take a chance at the beginning of the long and mutually profitable association he says he wants by giving me anything that was doubtfuland certainly he wouldnt give me anything false okay that means were going to have to tell powell hall said he took his cellular telephone from his jacket pocket and pressed one of the autodial numbers matt hall for the dci please he said john im on my cellular but i wanted to get this to you as soon as possible the thing were looking for was according to information i consider reliable enough to pass on to you at a place called abecheablebakerechocharleyhotelechochad last night at five oclock no not over a cellular im not ill tell you more in the situation room tonight what im doing is giving you information i consider reliable enough for you to really look into okay again ablebakerechocharleyhotelecho got it ill see you shortly he put the cellular in the palm of his hand and pressed another autodial key matt hall for director schmidt please im fine mark thank you yourself mark i never got the fbis dossier on aleksandr pevsner i asked for is something holding it up well if its on your desk i cant read it can i what do you mean you werent sure i still wanted it the tone of halls voice changed and both miller and castillo looked at him his face showed that he didnt like what he was hearing well mark first the dci has not found time in his busy schedule to tell me he doesnt think theres much to this pevsner nonsense scenario from that loose cannon special forces guy in luanda but that doesnt really have anything to do with this does it yes of course i still want it as soon as i can have it send it over by messenger right now yes of course i realize its classified then ill send one of my secret service agents to get it i sound like im angry i cant imagine why actually im not in my office im in room at the mayflower but if thats going to cause any problems i can have a secret service agent in your office in five minutes okay fine ill be looking for him and while ive got you on the line mark theres something else i need as soon as i can have it i want the dossier on one of your special agents maybe an exspecial agent a man named howard kennedy thats right howard kennedy well if you have probably a halfdozen agents named howard kennedy i guess youll have to send me the dossiers on all of them i dont mean to sound confrontational mark and im sorry you feel that way i dont suspect for a moment that you and the dci are deciding together what to send me in response to dr cohens memo because that would probably make me confrontational but i am getting more than a little curious why this is turning into a problem what would you call it mark how long is it going to take you to assemble the dossiers on how ever many howard kennedys are or were fbi special agents frankly i dont think i should have to wait that long if theres some reason i cant have the kennedy dossiers by nine tomorrow morning why dont you send me a memo for record that i can show dr cohen yes i think youre right we do seem to be having a communications problem ill be waiting for the pevsner dossier nice to talk to you mark he pushed the end call button and put the phone in his pocket the turf war has begun he announced i was afraid of that he turned to major miller and said i hope youll understand i have to ask this sir did you make a pass or anything that could be construed as a pass at mrs wilson no sir i did not when you had dinner with her how much did you have to drink i have never had dinner with mrs wilson sir did you have drinks with her no sir i did charley said you did hall asked and when charley nodded asked and did you make a pass at her it was more that she made a pass at me charley said and i was in a receptive mood sir charley said jesus christ miller said i told you she was dangerous you also told me she wasnt getting what she needed at home and she is a very attractive female at the time i was supposed to believe her story that she was a reporter for forbes and she thought i was a fellow journalist named gossinger but you knew who she was hall pursued yes sir dick told me who she was and that she wasnt getting what she needed at home just what did you mean by that miller sir the fact is that mrs wilson is twenty years or so younger than her husband the rumors going around have it he likes young men and married the lady as a beard hall looked at him for a long moment but didnt respond instead he turned to castillo tell me charley and the truth please the cow is out of the barn so to speak why did you take mrs wilson to bed in hindsight sir it was irresponsible what happened was that she wanted to look at my story why probably to see if i really had a story was in fact a journalist she smelled something she sent dick to check me out and then presuming i had a story she wanted to know what i had found out and was reporting about the missing whats that got to do with taking her to bed i told her she could have the story just as soon as the tages zeitung went to bed she replied why not as soon as we do whereupon you shut off your brain and turned on your dick miller blurted almost in disbelief you could put it in those terms i suppose charley said that strikes me as a succinct summingup charley hall said shaking his head a little crude but right on the money i hope she was worth it thatlittle dallianceis likely to turn out to be costly hall looked at his wristwatch i dont know how soon the fbi will show up but i dont think i can risk going back to the office i very much doubt if theyd give the pevsner dossier to you could we get coffee and something to munch on do you think coffee and a large hors doeuvres coming up sir charley said heading for the telephone sir am i allowed to make a suggestion miller asked hall considered that before replying sure why not what pevsner saidor the exfbi agent one of themabout there being a philadelphi a connection hall nodded his understanding sir i might be useful in running that down how my father and the police commissioner are friends sir commissioner kellogg miller im going to pass on to the fbi what charley heard in vienna theyll certainly look into it including asking the police what they might have sir sometimes the cooperation between the fbi and the police isnt all that it should be meaning im sure the cops will answer any specific questions put to them by the fbi but probably not very quickly and im also sure theyre not going to volunteer anything that might give up their snitches or if they have somebody undercover with the muslims his identity or and you think theyd confide in you more than they would in the fbi miller said particularly if commissioner kellogg knew i was asking the questions for you hall exhaled and shook his head charley did you hear this he asked yes sir that wasnt really the question charley and you know it what do you think i was thinking sir that if the president may i talk about that hall studied miller a moment then turned to castillo he knows youre working by order of the president doesnt he i think hes figured that out sir since the cow is out of the barn hall said gesturing for castillo to continue sir if the president wants to know who knew what and when and the cops in philadelphia know something isnt he going to want to know when the fbi found out about it hall looked at him a long moment charley thought hes thinking but not about miller going to philadelphia i just had a washington bureaucrats thought that im a little ashamed of hall confessed i was thinking my god if we find the before anyone else does a lot of people are going to have egg on their face and really be annoyed with us we can count on payback so miller doesnt go to philadelphia charley asked that depends hall said he took his cellular telephone from his pocket again and pressed an autodial key matt hall for general naylor well i have to talk to him and now he turned to castillo and miller the commander in chief of central command is out jogging on the beach he announced with a smile the commanding general of central command is never out of touch it took fewer than ninety seconds to get a telephone to naylor you sound a little winded allan hall said and what about sunburn at your age the commanding general was apparently not amused hall smiled temper temper allan and no this couldnt wait its important but were both on cellulars okay so youre just going to have to trust me that last fellow you just sent to me i would like to use him the same way im using the first one would that be okay with you more important if it will get him in any trouble say so of course he volunteered hall handed miller the telephone yes sir yes sir i understand thank you sir yes sir he handed the phone to castillo yes sir yes sir im fine yes sir i will castillo handed the cellular to hall thank you allan ill be in touch when we can talk have a nice jog hall put the cellular back in his pocket what did he say to you miller sir he said that vocg i am to place myself at your orders centcom orders will be published tomorrow vocg hall asked verbal orders of the commanding general sir miller furnished okay id forgotten that phrase if i ever knew it i never saw a general up close when i was in the army its sop sir charley said when there is no time to get a set of orders published hall nodded i understand your security clearances have been revoked he said to miller so im unrevoking them as of right now charley call the office and dictate a memorandum for the record yes sir what are you going to give him everything he had before they were pulled hall said in addition i authorize you to tell him anything you think he needs to know about your orders from the president yes sir put that in the memo for record too hall ordered yes sir castillo said and punched an autodial key on his cellular while hes doing that hall ordered see if you can get commissioner kellogg on the phone yes sir miller said thank you commissioner hall said when you get to the office at eight major miller and my executive assistant a man named castillo will be waiting for you this is important and im grateful for your understanding he saw castillos eyes on him as he pushed the phones call end button yeah youre going for several reasons we obviously dont have time to get miller any identification for one for another i want you both out of town for a while yes sir what if theres another message from pevsner i thought if its all right with you that id have joel isaacson put a man in here in the apartment he would know only what he has to know that if there is a call for you youre out of town but can be reached on your cellular and give the caller your number thatll work sir so far as pevsner is concerned but if you put secret service people in here theyll know i live here isnt that going to cause problems they already know where you live and a lot more about you than you probably think why do you think your code name is don juan really miller chuckled and you didnt think isaacson and mcguire let me walk over here by myself did you i wondered about that sir but once they get in here youre talking about the improbability of your being able to pay the rent on this place on your army pay thats the sort of thing that causes gossip sir why should it if i know about it my approval is implied yes sir i dont think id have to tell joel to remind them to keep their mouths shut but i will when do you want us to go sir id like you to see what the fbi has on your friend pevsner but that can wait until you get back id like to have you out of town before i go to the white house castillo looked at his watch we just missed the metroliner he said theres another in an hour thatd do it hall ordered castillo went to the telephone whore you calling miller asked the concierge castillo answered and then spoke to the phone this is mr castillo ill need two firstclass tickets on the next metroliner to new york charge them to my room and have a cab waiting in thirty minutes to take me to union station you said two tickets to new york you know miller said when castillo had hung up yeah i know i think you were right about the timing of that call from pevsners man i was thinking that if i wanted information about somebody in a hotel i would lay lots of long green on the concierge i think hes probably the villain im pretty sure thats how kennedy found out that carlos castillo was not karl gossingers boyfriend and i wouldnt he thought that miller asked highly amused yeah he did and i wouldnt be surprised if someone from the cia asked him about the guy in either dci powell seemed very curious about me you really think he would order something like that hall asked castillo nodded and either promised money or appealed to his patriotism to have him keep an eye on me maybe im wrongid like to be wrongbut if im right i sort of like the idea of two pairs of spookspowells and pevsnersfrantically searching through the people getting off the train in penn station in new york looking for me and whoevers with me what have you got against the dci hall asked i dont like the way he handled dick castillo replied he told you he wouldnt do anything to him and then he had him relieved for cause once that happens to an army officer he might as well resign and he knew it im dealing with that hall said im the door knocker rapped it was a bellman with a large tray of hors doeuvres and two pots of coffee fifteen minutes later there was another rapping of the door knocker castillo opened it there were two men in business suits one of them carried a briefcase when charley glanced down the corridor he saw joel isaacson coming toward the door from one direction and tom mcguire coming from the other there must be something about these two people they think is fishy yes castillo said were looking for secretary hall the elder of the two men at the door said who are you the man who had spoken took a leather folder from his pocket and held it up oh my the fbi castillo said more loudly than was necessary he got a smile from isaacson before isaacson stopped at a nearby door and appeared to be slipping a plastic card into its lock come in please castillo said the secretary expects you good afternoon mr secretary the man from the fbi said im inspector doherty from director schmidts office hall smiled at him and put out his hand mr secretary we have a dossier for you inspector doherty said but its from the directors personal files and hed like it backif possible hed like us to take it back now after youve had a chance to read it he handed hall an expanding cardboard folder hall looked at the folder and then at doherty the look on his face showed he didnt like at all hearing that schmidt wanted his dossier back right away director schmidt will have everything xeroxed for you sir doherty offered in that case charley hall said handing the folder to castillo i think you and miller had better have a quick look at the dossier before you go the look on dohertys face showed he didnt like that announcement at all with all respect sir do these gentlemen have the proper security clearances hall didnt reply the look on his face was answer enough you understand sir i had to ask inside the expanding folder was the dossier a thick stack of paper held together with a large aluminum clip theres coffee mr doherty the secretary said thank you but no thank you sir castillo walked to the couch laid the dossier on the coffee table and started flipping through it after a minute miller sat down beside him i hope you mr secretaryand these gentlemenunderstand that some of the material in these files has not been confirmed doherty said castillo closed his dossier sir ill need more time than miller and i have he said okay hall said then you better leave you and miller can read the xeroxes when you get back castillo took the dossier and started to put it back in the expanding file just leave it there please hall said ill read as much as i can before i have to go to the white house yes sir castillo said he and miller went into the bedroom in five minutescastillo now wearing a necktie and suit jacketthey came out carrying suitcases hall looked up from the dossier on the coffee table keep in touch he ordered three the white house pennsylvania avenue nw washington dc june secretary hall had heardand it had not displeased himthat the passengers of only three vehicles were ever exempted from careful scrutiny before being passed onto the white house grounds the presidential limousine the vicepresidential limousine and the blue gmc yukon xl that he ordinarily rode in he thought of that as his yukon approached the gates and was pleased to realize he enjoyed that little perk and john powell and mark schmidt did not right now he was not very fond of the dci or the director of the fbi and he was therefore surprised and a little disappointed when the uniformed secret service officer waved the yukon to stop joel isaacson rolled down the drivers window good evening mr secretary the guard said sir the president requests you to go to the quarters before you go to the situation room natalie cohen was sitting with her legs tucked under her skirt on a couch in the sitting room of the presidents apartment she raised her hand in a casual greeting when hall walked in the president was sitting slumped in an armchair holding a crystal tumbler of what was almost certainly his usual bourbon makers mark on the rocks you want one of these matt he asked raising the glass to give you courage to grovel before powell im not going to grovel before powell hall blurted then remembered to add mr president am i let me tell you where our little fishing expedition has crashed on the rocks the president said he pointed at an array of bottles on a sideboard hall walked to it told himself he was in trouble would need all his wits not a drink and then poured two inches of the bourbon into a glass and took a sip then he leaned against the sideboard and looked at the president the fbi has learned that leaseaire inc has filed a claim for the loss of its airplane which is now with a seventy percent probability at the bottom of the atlantic ocean sir isnt that to be expected the president held up his hand as a signal for him not to interrupt the dci has reported that he found it necessary to relieve the station chief in luanda for one turning over to your major the linguistclassified material that had already been evaluated and found useless by langley because your major told him he was working for methis was to be a secret operation rememberand two incidentally getting shitfaced at dinnersorry nat dr cohen raised her hand in exactly the same way she had raised it when hall had walked into the room and making a pass at his boss the president took a sip of his drink and then looked at hall waiting for his reaction the secretary of homeland security after three seconds of thought made a profound philosophical decision that he learned in vietnam when lives also were at stake pick men you trust and trust the men you pick in my judgment mr president hall said there is an almost one hundred percent probability that the missing airplane is not at the bottom of the atlantic thats interesting dr cohen said you dont happen to know where it is do you matt the president asked very softly mr president there is an almost eighty percent possibility that as of five oclock yesterday afternoon it was at a remote airfield in chad a place called abeche i have so informed the dci and the source of your information matt dr cohen asked very softly a russian arms dealer by the name of aleksandr pevsner and what did the dci say when you told him you had learned from mr pevsner that the airplane was in chad the president asked and then without giving hall time to reply asked and did mr pevsner happen to tell you what the is doing in chad in a short answer sir the airplane is being prepared to be flown into the liberty bell in philadelphia by a somalian group which calls itself the holy legion of muhammad you told this to powell the president asked no sir only that i had reliable information that the aircraft was at abeche he didnt ask for your source yes sir he did but i told him i was on a nonsecure telephone this guy pevsner has come up before the president said according to powell hes a russian gangster the head of the russian mafia are you aware of that did the dci also tell you sir that the agency uses pevsners fleet of airplanes to move things covertly for them and as a source for weapons of all kinds no the president said thoughtfully he didnt happen to mention that what was your contact with pevsner dr cohen asked how did that happen my contact was through major castillo hall said you want all the details every one of them mr secretary the president said every goddamned lastminute detail it took about ten minutes okay dr cohen the president said youve heard this fascinating yarn youre my security advisoradvise me have i got everything matt dr cohen said theres one or two more things but nothing bearing on the location of the airplane or what the terrorists intend to do with it goddammit i said i wanted every detail matt yes sir major miller did not make a pass at mrs wilson so he would say right mrs wilson made a pass at major castillo when she thought he was the german journalist and he caught it interesting dr cohen said and id like to hear that from major castillo the president said id like to hear the whole goddamned wild incredible story again from him sir at the moment hes on the metroliner to philadelphia i can call him and have him return but that would take several hours hes checking into the possible muslim connection in philadelphia dr cohen asked and when hall nodded went on mr president youre not going to have time to check castillos story out yourself youre going to have to make a decision and right now i know that i have to make a decision natalie the president said he sounded tired rather than sarcastic what i want from you is advice on what that decision should be she did not immediately reply come on natalie this is why you make the big bucks the president said sir my adviceyour wifes in chicago right the president nodded sir what i think you should do is call the marines and chopper out to camp david taking matt with you no explanation to anybody what do i do with powell i will go to the situation room and tell himand schmidtthat just before you left for camp david you told me to tell him you really want to know whether or not the missing airplane isor wasat this place in chad abeche hall furnished thank you she said and that he is to let me know immediately what he finds out why should i gomatt and i goto camp david the president asked because if you were going to ask for matts resignation thats where youd take him to ask for it dr cohen said they should know whether that airplane is where matt thinks it is by morning the president thought aloud may i suggest mr president that you come back here about this time tomorrow dr cohen said okay the president said after a moments thought lets do it dr cohen picked up the handset of a multibuttoned telephone on the coffee table and pushed one of the buttons this is dr cohen she said the president will require marine one for a flight to camp david immediately no prior or posttakeoff announcement refer all inquiries you cant handle to me she put the handset back in the cradle thank you natalie the president said and then he looked at matt hall jesus h christ matt they really want to crash that airplane into the liberty bell four aboard marine one the white house pennsylvania avenue nw washington dc june the pilot of the helicopter said marine one lifting off and the sikorsky vhd sea king of hmx the marine corps presidential helicopter squadron did just that rising quickly and smoothly from the white house lawn and then making a smooth climbing turn which would put it on course for camp david the president of the united states said i feel like nixon fleeing from the angry crowds at the white house with a very insincere smile on my face mr president secretary of homeland security matthew hall began and then stopped what matt i was about to say im sorryand i am because of the trouble thats developedbut what i really want to say is thank you for trusting me on this the president waved his right hand meaning unnecessary and said i know you believe what you told me and it seems pretty obvious that i cant take a chance and ignorehowever incredible it may soundthe possibility that these lunatics actually intend crashing this airplane into downtown philadelphia and may have the means to carry it off hall didnt reply and were about to see how efficient all the technology really is arent we just about now natalie is telling powell that i want to know whats on or what has been on the field in chad and very soon satellite sensors will be having a look mr president fully aware that im taking another walk on dci powells lawn theres something else that might be done what sir ive not brought any of this up to general naylor naylor why should you have he may have some means to find out whats going on at abeche and possibly before the ciaand whoever else the dci enlists to help himcan you dont think powell will do that anyway jesus you really dont like him do you thats two questions sir no i dont really like him and no i dont think hell seek assistance from general naylor until his back is against the wall and he has to right now what he wants to do is make the agency look good thats a pretty serious accusation matt yes sir i realize that but my responsibility is homeland security and im willing to admit i need all the help i can get two more questions one what do you think naylor could do to help and two whats really caused this trouble between you and powell until yesterday i thought the two of you got along pretty well he lied to me hall said he gave me his word that he would take no punitive action against major miller and then did just that what did he do he relieved him for causei wont even get into that business of accusing him of making a pass at mrs wilsonfully aware that when an officer is relieved for cause his career is down the toilet he chose to believe mrs wilson i think they call that loyalty downward the president said and from where i sit you are showing the same thing to major castillo and to major miller who doesnt even belong to you he does now sir general naylor put him on temporary duty with me and sir i dont know what general naylor can do but he may have somethingeven if only an ideaand i think we should ask for whatever he has let me think the president said as the president stood in the doorway to exit marine one and get in one of the golf carts lined up to carry people to the cabins of camp david he turned and met halls eyes it looks to me as if major miller is an innocent bystander caught in the line of fire i dont like that what can i do to help him the question took hall by surprise he had never even considered the possibility that the president would offer to help miller sir i think if you wrote miller a letter of commendation for his serviceunspecified but under very difficult conditions for someone of his rank and experienceand sent it to him via the defense intelligence agencytheyre the ones who want to crucify him you write it and ill sign it the president interrupted him but call general naylor first and without getting into your problems with the dci tell him if he has any means of finding out whether or not the airplane is or was in chad to use them yes sir thank you mr president five the warwick hotel locust street philadelphia pennsylvania june i really wish youd come out to the house with me charley major h richard miller jr said as the taxi stopped in front of the hotel im sure you can eventually make your father understand what happened but in the time between when you tell him that you were relieved because of something i asked you to do and the time he understandsthirty seconds or thirty minutesid just as soon rather not be around general miller thank you just the same coward miller said chuckling and left it there ill pick you up in the morning at half past seven he said be standing on the sidewalk shaved and sober and full of energy because you gave your pecker the night off castillo gave him the finger and got out of the taxi his initial impression of the warwick hotel was that it was a nice one nice lobby with a really impressive floral displayreal flowers as he walked by he checkedon a beautiful table to the right was the entrance to the restauranthe could see enough of that to make the judgment it too looked firstrateand a bar there was a young woman sitting alone at the bar she didnt look like a hooker but sometimes it was hard to tell he decided to give the brunette and the hotel the benefit of the doubt the warwick didnt look like the kind of a place where ladies of the evening were either encouraged or permitted to practice their profession and the brunette really didnt look like a hooker he was pleased too with the room it was large highceilinged with a kingsized bed and the bathroom shelf was loaded with small bottles of highquality shampoo and mouthwash and crisp packages of expensive soap of the type he liked to put in his toilet kit at checkout time against the inevitability that the next hotel would not much care if their guests bathed or washed out their mouths not that i need either a bath or a mouth rinse what i need is a drink maybe two no more than two and then something to eat and then some sleep dick said to be on the sidewalk outside at half past seven jesus the last time i went to bed was in vienna that and cobenzl and the drei hussaren and pevsner and inge was last night one drink and then something to eat and then to bed but not in the restaurant i dont want a full meal and i hate to eat alone at a restaurant table maybe i can get a sandwich at the bar that is based solely upon my desire to have something simple to eat not on the brunette it really is and anyway by the time i get back down there shell more than likely be gone nice girls and we have decided thats what she is do not sit around hotels where young men with outofcontrol gonads might think theyre available major carlos g castillo had been in his room no more than ten minutes before he left it got back on the elevator and rode it down to the lobby the brunette was still sitting alone at the bar at that point major castillo told himself he would have headed right for the restaurant had he not also seen there were four men sitting at a table in the bar eating some kind of goodlooking sandwiches on crusty bread he entered the bar taking care not to look at the brunette but taking a stool separated from hers by only one stool his cellular went off as the bartender approached him is there a local beer on draft castillo asked the waiter gave him a name hed never heard before one of those please castillo said and a menu as the phone rang a third time he pushed its answer button hello yes sir i just checked into a hotel sir the warwick im about to have dinner well that was certainly nice of the him sir and thank you for telling me ill past the word to dick sir hes going to pick me up here at ohseventhirty sir thank you again sir good night sir he put the cellular back in his pocket as the bartender approached with a glass of beer and a menu what are those gentlemen eating castillo asked nodding his head slightly toward the four men sitting at the corner table two cheesesteaks one meatball and one sausageandpeppers the bartender said italian sausage and peppers castillo asked the bartender nodded get me one will you please are you some kind of a serviceman the brunette asked and moved to the stool next to him wrong again charley you master of analysis you what gave you an idea like that yes sir no sir thank you sir ohseventhirty sir the brunette said im a texan we talk that way you sounded as if whoever you were speaking to was a general or something actually hes a member of the presidents cabinet and he was calling to tell me the president just did something very nice for a friend of mine who was in a little trouble she chuckled almost laughed nice smile what do you do actually ill be damned she really doesnt look like a hooker actually i work for a company called rig service incorporated of corpus christi and what we do is service rigs whats a rig an enormous oil well drilling platform sitting in the gulf of mexico and how do you service them my end of it is the catering castillo said you know the food and also the laundry personal needs they call it may i ask you something am i looking for a little action am i married am i a fag why not could you keep talking to me for a little while sure id be happy to i have a little problem the brunette said my sainted crippled mother desperately needs brain surgery i dont have the money and im willing to do anything anything to come up with it my boyfriend was supposed to meet me here a half hour no fortyfive minutes ago the brunette said and hes stood you up you think no she said firmly hell be here and im not trying to get you to buy me a drink or anything like that but ive been sitting here alone andyou see those men at the table castillo nodded they keep looking at me like im a hooker well you certainly dont look like a hooker to me thank you well will you will i what what frankie does all the time is forget to charge his cell phone the brunette said so the battery goes dead and he cant call me hes somewhere on i right now i knowhes driving up from washington dc and its hard to find a pay phone anywhere anymore much less on the interstate i would be happy to talk with you until frankie either gets his batteries charged or shows up whichever comes first and would be even happier if you would permit me to buy you a beverage of your choice i couldnt let you do that the brunette ordered but let me treat you she waved at the bartender give this gentleman another beer she said my treat sir the bartender said jesus he thinks shes a hooker too goddammit i dont think she is well have another round but put it on my tab no i insist the brunette said firmly charley looked at the bartender who shrugged okay thank you fifteen minutes later as castillo was finishing his italian sausageandpeppers sandwich a large young man wearing a zippered jacket and a look of gross annoyance marched into the bar and up to them once betty explained to frankie what had happened and how nice mr castle here had been to her while she was waiting for him without a telephone call muchbut by no means allof the look of annoyance left his face betty and frankie left betty said maybe theyd bump into each other sometime which did not seem to please frankie very much but when charley asked for the bill the barman said the broads boyfriend took care of it charley tipped the bartender anyway and went to his room and after leaving a call for quarter to seven got in bed and went to sleep wondering what it would be like to really work in the catering end of rig service inc a wholly owned subsidiary of castillo petroleum inc and maybe meet a nice girland betty was a nice girlby accident in a bar somewhere and seeing what would develop chapter x one office of the commanding general united states central command macdill air force base tampa florida june when general albert mcfadden usaf centcoms deputy commander appeared in general naylors office in response to naylors right now please summons lieutenant general george h potter usa centcom j was already there i had just bought another bucket of balls mcfadden announced whats up allan general mcfadden was wearing a lemon yellow golf shirt and powder blue slacks general potter was wearing a translucent filipinostyle shirtjacket over white shorts general naylor was wearing khaki slacks and a gray usma sweatshirt only command sergeant major wesley suggins was in uniform close the door please wes general naylor ordered no interruptions yes sir suggins said i just had a telephone call from the secretary or homeland security naylor announced in the middle of the call the president came on the line primarily i think to make it clear that hall was acting at the presidents orders naylor let that sink in for a couple of seconds and then went on there is some reason to believe that the missing is or was at a remote airfield in chad a place called abeche he pointed to a map laid on the conference table mcfadden and potter got out of their chairs and examined the map they could make it from there to mecca easily general mcfadden said secretary hall has information suggesting that the airplane was taken by a somalian terrorist group calling itself the holy legion of muhammad and that it is their intention to crash the plane into the liberty bell in philadelphia naylor said jesus christ general mcfadden said where did he get that general potter rolled his eyes but said nothing the credibility of secretary halls intel depends in large measure on whether or not the is or was at abeche in other words if it is there or was there the rest of the scenariothat it was seized by the holy legion of muhammad and that they intend to crash it in philadelphiabecomes more credible the liberty bell in philadelphia why the hell would they want to do that general mcfadden asked incredulously and if it is not at abeche or was not at abeche naylor went on a suggestion of impatience in his tone then the scenario is probably unlikely but in the absence of any other intel regarding the missing airplane the secretaryandor the presidenthas obviously decided to go with what he has centcom has been ordered to find out as quickly as possible whats the cia got to say about this general mcfadden interrupted let me finish please general naylor said icily sorry sir mcfadden said not sounding very apologetic but to get that question out of the way naylor said while i am sure the cia is already working on this problemsatellites and human intel if they have anyone in the regionwe have been ordered to find out as quickly as possiblewithout sharing our intentions with the ciawhether or not the missing is or has been at abeche or not the cias not in the loop general potter asked the cia is not in the loop naylor confirmed suggestions off the top of my head general mcfadden said i dont know where the nearest air commando pave low is but i can find out in a couple of minutes we could send one in under the radari dont imagine theres much of that in chad goddammit naylor thought there you go again doesnt the air force teach its officers to let make the junior officer speak first so he says what he thinks rather than what he thinks his seniors want or dont want to hear that would probably take longer than the time we have naylor said i think the president wants an answer as soon as he can get it were talking about hours delta sir general potter said maybe probably gray fox delta force was special forces elite unit it was famous there had even been moviesalmost hilariously inaccurateabout it there had been no movies about gray fox which was an elite unit within delta because very few people had even heard rumors about it thats the answer i knew i was going to get and knew i wouldnt like lets see what general mcnab has to say what he can contribute naylor said get him on the horn please wes yes sir command sergeant major suggins said and went into the phone booth fifteen seconds later suggins called from the phone booth sir general mcnab will be on the line momentarily bring it in here wes and put it on speakerphone sergeant major suggins came into the office carrying the secure telephone and its thick connecting cable and placed the instrument on a table between naylor potter and mcfadden then he pushed the speakerphone button why do i know telling him to do that was a mistake the answer came immediately good evening sir the voice of the commanding general of xviii airborne corps lieutenant general bruce j mcnab boomed over the speaker my delay in getting to the telephone was caused by an irresistible summons of nature my apologies sir thank you for sharing that with me general naylor said his annoyance audible in his voice youre most welcome sir mcnab said brightly goddammit scotty do you always have to be such a wiseass naylor flared naylor was immediately sorry and embarrassed if the general has in any way offended the general sir mcnab said sounding very much like a west point plebe answering the wrath of an upperclassman the general is sorry sir when naylor glanced at the others sergeant major suggins was studying the ceiling general mcfadden the floor and general potter his wristwatch sonofabitch scotty do you know where abeche chad is naylor asked one moment sir mcnab said everyone heard what sounded like fingers snapping ten seconds later general mcnab went on sir abeche chad is in a remote section of the country the coordinates are north latitude i know where it is scotty naylor interrupted the question was do you know a simple yes sir would have sufficed yes sir there is a possibility that the stolen from luanda angola is or was there theres a foot runway more than enough for a whats your source naylor did not answer the question instead he asked how soon could you get someone in there to find out for sure scotty sir black or out in the open under the circumstances general i dont believe well have time to enter into any diplomatic negotiations with anyone naylor said everyone heard faintly but clearly general mcnab issue an order tommy sound boots and saddles for gray fox then more clearly they heard general mcnab say i understand sir sir how much support may i expect what do you need scotty id like something available to back up the c c is the usaf designation for the boeing ostensibly all of them are assigned to the air national guard one howeverwith a number of modificationsis kept in a closely guarded hangar at pope air force base which adjoins fort bragg you intend to fly into abeche naylor blurted no sir what i have in mind is royal air maroc flying over abeche at feet mcnab said his tone suggesting he was talking to a backward child royal air maroc you know has permission to overfly all those unfriendly countries between morocco and saudi arabia what he did not say but which everyone at the table understood was that mcnab intended to parachute people from his onto the abeche airfield you think thatll do it scotty yes sir thatll do it what am i supposed to do with the airplane if its there right now just find out if its there or if it was there yes sir will communications be a problem no sir i mean to communicate between there and here well have communications between here and there linking to you is not a problem why do you want backup for your airplane id sort of like to get my people back sir and the communications equipment some of that stuff costs a lot of money how quietly can you do this scotty i doubt if anyone will even suspect were there sir unless of course the airplane is there and you tell me to take it out a blownup airplane would tend to make people suspect that something was not going quite the way they wanted it to worstcase scenario scotty something goes wrong and they find out youre there thats why i want a little backup a c iii would be nice the boeing c iii was a cargo aircraft capable of using unimproved landing fields its four thrustpound engines could drive it at threequarters the speed of sound to a service ceiling of feet with nearly pounds of cargo with inair refueling it was capable of flying anywhere on the globe naylor looked at mcfadden who nodded meaning there was a c immediately available and probably more than one mcfaddens nod had been immediate how do you plan to use it im an optimist they dont find out were there abeche is not what you can call a bustling airport tommy just handed me a data sheet saying theres a onceaweek flight from ndjamena and thats irregular im going to put maybe four or five people on the ground they find out about the i am not ordered to take it out they hide out somewhere near the end of the runway the cen route somewhere i havent figured that out yetmakes a discretionary landing at abeche it goes to the end of the runway opens the door my guys jump in and the c takes off more or less the same scenario if im ordered to blow the except that my guys hide out in the boonies near the nearest flat area a c can use worst scenario my guys are on the run from indignant chad authorities ill have some heavy firepower on the c and twenty people they jump onto the flat area and hold it long enough for the c to touch down and get everybody on board i dont want you to start world war iii scotty naylor thought aloud funny i thought we were already fighting world war iii mcnab replied i think you take my point general naylor said coldly i take your point sir where do you want the c naylor asked here as soon as i can have it it can follow us to menara menara general mcfadden asked menara morocco mcnab replied who was that general mcfadden naylor said good evening sir mcnab said good evening general mcnab mcfadden said have you considered a pave low yes sir time and distancewise it wouldnt work here how are you scotty potter said i recognize that unpleasant nasal voice how are you george more important how many other people are eavesdropping on this fascinating conversation thats it scotty naylor replied generals mcfadden and potter wes suggins and me good im a devout believer in the theory that the more people who know a secret the sooner the secret is compromised on that subject general naylor said the cia is not privy to this operation and are not to be made privy to it jesus i must have done something right thank you for sharing that with me general general naylor glanced at command sergeant major suggins and lieutenant general potter both of whom were trying and failing to suppress smiles how soon can you get started on this scotty naylor asked we shoot for wheels up in sixty minutes and generally shave a chunk off that okay naylor said get the operation going general mcnab yes sir two royal air force base menara morocco june among other modifications made to usaf c tail number was provision for removable fuel bladders when installed they gave the aircraft transoceanic range when landedafter a sixhour tenminute flight from pope air force baseat menara which is miles south of casablanca it had hours of fuel remaining in its main tanks enough for example so that it could have diverted to any number of us airbases in europe from spain to germany had that been necessary diversion was not necessary at local timean hour off the moroccan coastthe casablanca control operator cleared us air force to make a refueling stop at menara it touched down smoothly at and five minutes later it had been tugged into a hangar whereupon the hangar doors had closed royal moroccan air force technicians quickly plugged in power and airconditioning ducts the rear door of the aircraftunder the tailextended from the fuselage and two men came quickly down the stairs both wearing khaki pants and white tshirts a slight man in a light brown flight suit stood at the foot of the stairs a leather patch on the chest of the flight suit identified him as a coloneland pilotof the royal moroccan air force behind him stood another pilot colonel in a flight suit he was older much stockier and had a thick britishstyle mustache both moroccan officers saluted and both americans returned them good morning general the slight man said in only faintly accented english good morning your royal highness lieutenant general bruce j mcnab usa replied as he returned the salute i am deeply honored that your royal highness has found time in his busy schedule for me i always have time for you general the colonel said and not only because im fond of you let me guess mcnab said a member of your family has questions i need a favor covers a lot of ground general even between friends you remember colonel thomas dont you your royal highness of course the colonel said its good to see you again tommy always a pleasure sir lieutenant colonel h alexander thomas said and how are you colonel mcnab asked very well general the man with the mustache said the slim man made a gesture with his hand and mcnab followed him until they stood beside the landing gear an american was stolen a couple of weeks ago from luanda mcnab said i saw that there is some reason to believe its either on the ground or was at abeche chad im supposed to find out if thats so and retake it or destroy it my orders right now are just to see if it is or was there mcnab said orders subject to change of course i dont think they will be if retaking it was on the agenda i would have been told i think to send a crew with my people if they wanted to take it out sending in an unmanned aerial vehicle would be a lot cheaper and less riskier than this he pointed to the c the slim man didnt say anything for a long thoughtful moment thats it general thats all i have your royal highness and the basic plan drop five people on abeche from a royal air maroc transport overflying chad en route to jiddah have them find out what they can how are you going to get them out a cs about two hours behind me im going to use that so all you want to do is fly to jiddah and back here again the slim man thought over what he had heard is that somehow disturbing to you mcnab asked why was the airplane stolen do you know can you tell me i can tell you that we think it was stolen by a somalian group who call themselves the holy legion of muhammad never heard of them the slender man said somalian neither had we your royal highness mcnab said there are two possible scenarios neither with much to support them the first is that they intend to crash it into the kaba in mecca thats absurd it sounds absurd your royal highness but on the other hand the airplaneif it is in abecheis within range of mecca the holy legion of muhammad the slim man repeated and then raised his voice and called satu the bearded colonel walked quickly to them your highness one moment the slim man said and the other scenario general that they intend to crash it into the liberty bell in philadelphia mcnab said i dont know what that means in philadelphia where our founding fathers signed our declaration of independence is constitution hall i know about constitution hall the slim man said ive actually been there as a matter of fact but whats that got to do with a bell immediately adjacent to it your royal highness is the liberty bell it has a certain emotional historical significance to americans much like constitution hall itself i wonder why the holy legion of muhammad would be interested the slim man said for that matter i wonder how they even heard of it what do we know about these people satu what people your highness the holy legion of muhammad the slim man said impatiently theyre somalis i never heard of them your highness to answer your question general the slim man said yes i find this disturbing i will have to ask a certain member of my family how to proceed but in the meantime i think you should ask tommy to begin the chameleon process thank you sir you and i will go to the officers mess for breakfast the slim man said colonel bensatu will stay here long enough to ensure that tommy has whatever he needs then he finds out what he can about the holy legion of muhammad and brings that information to the mess yes your highness tommy the slim man raised his voice coming sir lieutenant colonel thomas said as he started at a trot toward them yes sir how many men do you have with you counting the air force your highness yes by all means lets count the air force the slim man said fifteen sir that includes the general and me good lets count you two as well the slim man said i will have the mess send breakfast for thirteen here when you believe your chameleon operation is sufficiently under way you might wish to join general mcnab and me at the mess ill leave a car for you yes sir thank you sir tommy please make sure that none of your men leave the hangar for any purpose yes sir colonel bensatu will ensure that you have whatever you need thank you your highness shall we go scotty the slim man said there were three identical black mercedes l sedans outside the hangar one of them took the slim man and mcnab to the officers mess a long sandcolored building near the flight line the twentyodd officers in the dining room rose as one man when someone spotted the slim man who immediately waved them back into their chairs he led mcnab to a table in the corner of the room order fried eggs potatoes toast and coffee for me please the slim man said i have a couple of calls to make then he walked out of the room ten minutes later he came back into the dining room all of the officersnow including mcnab and thomasrose to their feet and were immediately waved back into them by the slim man that was quick tommy the slim man said as he sat down they dont need me to help with the plane sir thomas said im just in the way a waiter delivered three plates of fried eggs potatoes and toast that fellow we were talking about earlier scotty the slim man said yes sir he doesnt believe either of your scenarios either but he thinks that looking into it is a very good idea thank you your royal highness and of course he is pleased to be of some small service to an old friend the slim man said he asked me tell you that im honored that he thinks of me as an old friend mcnab said im sure he does but i believe he was talking of our countries the slim man said did you know tommy that morocco was the first nation to recognize the us even before it was the us in no your highness i didnt know that lieutenant colonel thomas confessed my own history is a little fuzzy but i think your seat of government was then in philadelphia i believe it was mcnab said and was this bellthe liberty bell you said was that in philadelphia at the time and if so what is the connection your highness i am more than a little ashamed to say i have no idea general mcnab confessed it probably was but i just dont know the slim man waved a finger at general mcnab that is terrible he said three royal air force base menara morocco june a redandyellow tug pulled what three hours earlier had been us air force c tail number from the hangar what the slim man had called the chameleon process had been completed twenty minutes before plastic decalcomania had been applied to the fuselage with just enough adhesive to hold them in place for a short time there were now green and red stripes running from the nose to the tail down both sides of the s fuselage the words royal air maroc now appeared from just aft of the flight compartment windows rearward there was now a red shooting star on both sides of the vertical stabilizer beneath it in the largest letters of all were the initials ram in red once everything had been stuck in place the decalcomania had been sprayed with a very expensive clear quickdrying paint it was by no means permanent but tests had shown it would stand up to fifty hours of highspeed flight at altitude thirtysix hours in the sun at degrees fahrenheit and fortyeight hours at degrees fahrenheit it was not believed the paint was going to have to last anywhere near that long within thirtysix hours at the most it was hoped that royal air maroc now named rabat would be back in the hangar at menara where it would be sprayed with a solvent even more expensive than the paint the solvent would in a matter of minutes chemically attack the paint and permit both the paint and the decalcomania to be removed in a very short time the engines were started and rabat taxied to the threshold of the runway andhaving been cleared to do soturned onto the runway without stopping and lifted off the royal air force controller in the tower informed casablanca area control that ram was off the ground at twofive past the hour destination jiddah saudi arabia at that precise moment major carlos g castillo pushed his way through the circular door of the warwick hotel in philadelphia and took the few steps down to locust street four the warwick hotel locust street philadelphia pennsylvania june castillo looked up and down locust street his eyes falling on a lifesized statue of a man with an umbrella erected almost directly across the street then he heard two beeps of a horn and when he looked for the sound saw millers arm waving from the front seat of a dark blue buick sedan parked fifty feet from the hotel entrance he walked quickly toward it and as he approached miller opened the rear door from the inside the driver was a small wiry lightskinned man with a precisely manicured mustache good morning general castillo said courteously major general h richard miller sr usa retired turned on the seat and pointed a finger at castillo the first time i saw you castilloyou were a plebe at the timei knew you were going to be trouble sir if the general is referring to dicks return from africa that situation has been taken care of sir taken care of what the hell does that mean good god a miller relieved for cause how charley major h richard miller jr asked the president is sending you a letter of commendation via the defense intelligence agency cg castillo said secretary hall called last night to tell me what that will do general miller said not at all mollified is cause dicks records to be flagged political influence thats almost as bad as the comment relieved for cause general miller moved his icy glare from castillo long enough to look for a break in the traffic found one and pulled away from the curb major miller turned on the seat and with a combination of facial expressions shrugged shoulders and other body language managed to convey to castillo that he was sorry his father had attacked castillo but on the other hand that charley knew the general and thus what to expect charley used a combination of gestures to signal that he understood the situation and that he didnt mind castillo thought jesus christ thank god i didnt go home with dick last night if i had i would have had nonstop general miller in an outrage this will be over as soon as we get to police headquarters and no thank you dick i will not go home with you later to at least say hi to your mother their route to police headquarters took them around city hall and toward the delaware river castillo thought he remembered that constitution hall and the liberty bell were somewhere in the area but he wasnt sure jesus here i am trying to keep a bunch of lunatic terrorists from crashing an airplane into it and i dont even know where it is police headquarters turned out to be a curved building a couple of blocks off market street the parking lot into which general miller drove the buick had a sign reading police vehicles only general miller pulled the car into a parking slot with a sign reading chief inspectors only turned off the ignition and opened the door then he put his head back in the door and announced lets go castillo we dont want to keep the commissioner waiting do we my god hes going with us sir are you going with us general millers response was a shake of the head indicating his disgust with a stupid question followed by an impatient hand gesture meaning lets go lets go there is absolutely nothing i can do about this what the hell is he up to a policeman walked up to them sir you cant park there thats reserved for chief inspectors im general miller here to see the commissioner the general replied he advised me to park there im surprised you werent so notified if there is a problem i suggest you call him the policeman looked at general miller carefully and then nodded and walked away inside the building through a glass door there were four waisthigh columns through which police and civilian employees passed swiping identity cards to the right of the columns was a desk for visitors manned by a uniformed officer general miller and two others to see commissioner kellogg general miller announced sir i was led to believe that the commissioner expects us at eight castillo said its only sevenforty then your information is incorrect general miller said they were obviously expected for the policeman immediately produced three visitor badges and pushed the button which released the barrier in the visitor turnstile they boarded an elevator which was like the rest of the building curved and rode up when the elevator door opened a detective or a plainclothes policeman was waiting for them good morning general he said the commissioner expects you general millers response was a curt nod of the head they followed the police officercastillo couldnt see any kind of a badge but there was a glock mm semiautomatic pistol in a skeleton holster on his beltdown the corridor to another desk manned by another plainclothes officer where they signed the visitors register and were allowed to pass first through an outer office and then into what was apparently the commissioners office a very large black man in a wellfitting dark blue suit rose from behind his desk and smiled good morning richard he said offering his hand and then offering it to major miller its good to see you dick its been a while good morning sir and this is that commissioner general miller said is major carlos g castillo and i am here to tell you something about him i was expecting the special assistant to the secretary of homeland security commissioner kellogg said but how do you do major how do you do sir charley said will what you have to tell me about major castillo wait until we have some coffee the commissioner asked as he waved them into chairs ill pass on the coffee thank you general miller said i realize your time is valuable and this wont take long the commissioner sat in his chair and made a goahead signal with both hands i have known major castillo since he and dick were plebes at west point general miller began they were then and are now like a container of gasoline and a match one or the other lights the match and the other blows up really the commissioner said with a smile furthermore major castillo rather than adhering to the west point code of duty honor and country at all times has frequently chosen to follow the jesuit philosophy that the end justifies the means there is a point right richard to this character assassination the commissioner asked he was smiling but it was strained on one such occasion general miller went on three very senior officers reluctantly concluded that the weather the time of day and enemy groundtoair missile and automatic weapons capability absolutely precluded the dispatch of a medical evacuationdust offhelicopter to attempt to rescue the crew of a shotdown helicopter in mountainous terrain in afghanistan when they presented their recommendation to the general officer in overall command they told him they had reached their conclusion despite their painful awareness that a nofly decision would almost certainly result in the death of two of its crew members who were seriously wounded and the death or capture of the other personnel on the helicopter a total of five officers and three enlisted men the bottom line as they say was that sending a rescue helicopter which would almost certainly either be itself shot down or crash because of the weather conditions could not be justified the commanding general with a reluctance i submit that only another senior commander who has been forced to make such decisions can possibly understand accepted the recommendation of his staff and gave the nofly order major castillo who was serving in what i shall euphemistically describe as a liaison capacity to that headquarters was privy to the final discussion of the situation and the commanding generals decision on hearing that decision he went to the flight line and in direct disobedience to the generals order took overstolea black hawk helicopter and flying it aloneit has a twopilot crewwent to the crash site and rescued everyone there jesus the commissioner said looking at castillo one of the two seriously wounded officers major castillo rescued was dick general miller said with all respect sir castillo blurted they were wrong i knew i could do it it wasnt anywhere near as foolhardy as you make it sound major you are a west pointer general miller said evenly measuring each word you knew full well the meaning of the oath you took to obey the orders of the officers appointed over you it did not mean obedience to only such orders as you happen to agree with it meant cheerful and willing obedience to any and all orders castillo said nothing on the other hand general miller went on trying but not quite keeping his voice from quavering it is equally clear to me that i am deeply indebted to you for saving my sons life since i have not previously had the opportunity permit me to thank you now my wife and i and dicks brother and sisters are deeply in your debt major castillo general miller stood thank you commissioner for allowing me this opportunity in your office in your presence before an old friend sir castillo said softly dick would have done the same thing for me yes i daresay he would that brings us back to what i said about you two being a gasoline can and a match he started for the door then turned mrs miller would be pleased if your schedule would permit you to take dinner with us he said and then went through the doorway the commissioner shook his head your dad does have a way of capturing your attention doesnt he sir i had no idea he was going to come up here with us miller said i suspected that the commissioner said may i ask you a question major miller certainly sir what did he mean when he said euphemistically describe as a liaison capacity castillo hesitated sorry i asked the commissioner said i cant let him think that im not telling him everything castillo thought then said slowly sir i was with a delta force detachment we were looking for usama bin laden you were commanding the delta force detachment charley miller corrected him theres a difference the commissioner shook his head in amazement or disbelief and then smiled funny you dont look like sylvester stallone he said okay lets get to it what can the philadelphia police department do for the department of homeland security sir castillo began on may twentythird a aircraft belonging to leaseaire inc of philadelphia was stolen from the airport in luanda angola apparently secretary hall thinks this incredible story is credible enough to send you here to warn me about this the commissioner said i presume the governor and the mayor have been notified sir thats not why i was sent here castillo said what dick and i are to do is find out what we canif there is anything to find outabout a possible connection between somebody in philadelphia and the people we think stole the airplane youre telling me the mayor and the governor have not been notified the commissioner asked incredulously sir we dont know that the airplane was stolen by terrorists and even if that is the case that they intend to use it as a flying bomb here what were doing is trying to find out what happened to it every agency of the federal government with any interest in this at all is trying very hard using all their assets to find out what happened to that airplane but you think dont you that it was stolen by terrorists of some sort somalians or somebody else yes sir but thats my personal opinion no more and you think its possible at least that these people intend to fly the airplane into the liberty bell yes sir i do but again thats just my personal opinion i have nothing to go on except what pevsner told me in vienna and we wont know whether or not the airplane is or was in chad for some time going off at a tangent how are you going to find out one way or the other if its where this russian said it is or was i havent been told that sir im sure the satellites will really give that airport some close study i dont know what humint sources the cia or anyone else humint meaning human intelligence cia agents that sort of thing the commissioner interrupted yes sir and its possibleeven likely if we dont have people in the areathat theyll send in an air force special ops pave low helicopter theyll find out just as soon as they can maybe within an hour maybe not for twentyfour hours and until they do all we have is speculation i wonder if you understand my problem major castillo im not sure i follow you sir there are two people responsible for the safety of people in philadelphia one is the mayor and the other one is me dont misunderstand this the mayor is probably the best one weve had since frank rizzo but he doesnt know how to direct traffic much less handle the nutsandbolts problems that would result from a plane crash in downtown philadelphia the commissioner saw the look on castillos face you can see where im going right he asked and none of this occurred to you before no sir castillo confessed if there is even a slight chance that this incredible scenario is going to come to pass then it would seem we should have whatever precautionary measures we can right warn the citizens etcetera etcetera yes sir there are problems with that the commissioner said starting with panic and there is also the problem of crying wolf if the mayor puts these measures into play and nothing happens not only is he going to look like a fool but the next time this happens people would not pay attention most people are already starting to think of the world trade towers going down as something they saw in a movie starring charlton heston and paul newman he paused still with me yes sir i believe i am the mayor as i say is about as fine a leader as they come unfortunately he is also a politician i have absolute confidence in my deputy commissioners i have virtually none in the mayors staff i am very much afraid that if i pass this situation on to the mayorand it is clearly my duty to do sohe will pass it on to certain members of his staff and they will either panic and let the story out or they will do so consciously seeing the mayor on television defending the city from terrorist attack as a very good way to ensure his reelection if there is a flurry of activity against this potential attack and nothing happens i think it might well cost him reelection and i would hate to see that happen jesus h christ miller said softly your father just now alluded to making unpleasant choices when it is clearly your duty to do so the commissioner said i am about to do something like that i am going to both fail to do what i know i am duty bound to do and im going to lie and so are you sir when you and dick came in here major you told me nothing of this crash of an aircraft into the liberty bell scenario your visit to my office was in the nature of a courtesy call secretary hall wanted my assistance in your investigation of leaseaire incorporated i of course told you i would be happy to cooperate yes sir castillo said you said a moment ago major that you believe there will be information regarding the location of this missing airplane within twentyfour hours yes sir perhaps a little less time than that the commissioner looked at his watch it is now eightthirteen he said in thirtytwo hours it will be fourthirteen tomorrow afternoon at that time im going to the mayor with this he will like that because it will give him time to make the six oclock news you understand me i dont want any misunderstandings about this and it goes without saying that i expect you to immediately bring me up to speed on any further developments i understand sir castillo said and dick the commissioner went on i dont want you to tell your dad about this under any circumstances i love him like a brother but he has as he says and has shown that west point duty honor country philosophy and i dont want him doing something he feels duty and honor require him to do what this situation requires is someone with the philosophy your dad says the major has that the endprotecting philadelphiajustifies the means i understand sir miller said the commissioner rose from behind his desk were now going to the counterterrorism bureau i will ask the commanding officer of the organized crime and intelligence unittheyre in the same buildingto meet us there he said i dont know what they have on any connection between our local african american terroristswho so far have limited their efforts to bring philadelphia to its knees by taking potshots at passing patrol carsand any other terrorists but if anyone has that information they will i will tell chief inspector kramer and captain obrien that they are to give you anything and everything they have or can develop i will tell chief inspector kramer that twice because he has an unfortunate tendency to obey only those orders he considers wise and reasonable thank you very much commissioner castillo said be warned that neither of these officers is going to be willing to share any more than he feels he absolutely has to with either an army officer or the special assistant to the secretary of homeland security but if either of them really gets his back up get back to meright awayand ill have another chat with him sir how doeschief inspector kramer and captain obrien you saidfeel about the secret service the secret service i dont know i know kramer hates the fbi with a fine pennsylvania dutchmans passion and i dont think obrien thinks very highly about the fbi either the secret service i dont know why do you ask sir i have credentials identifying me as a supervisory special agent of the secret service castillo said the commissioner looked at him for a long moment shaking his head what do we say about dick or does he have a secret service shield too i think we can probably get by by showing my credentials castillo said okay thatll work the commissioner waved them through his office door ahead of him he stopped at a desk manned by a uniformed sergeant put out the arm for chief inspector kramer and captain obrien he ordered have them meet me right now in kramers office at the arsenal yes sir have an unmarked car a good one with all communications delivered out there right away if one isnt available take one away from somebody else yes sir we are cooperating with the secret service thats all you know yes sir come on jack the commissioner said to the plainclothes policeman who had been waiting for them at the elevator were going for a ride yes sir jack this is supervisory special agent castillo of the secret service and special agent miller gentlemen this is my executive officer captain jack hanrahan the men shook hands as they walked to the elevator five frankford industrial complex philadelphia pennsylvania june deja vu all over again major h richard miller jr said shortly after captain jack hanrahan had turned the commissioners unmarked ford crown victoria off tacony street in northeast philadelphia into what looked like an old industrial complex of brick warehouses i have been here before what is this place the commissioner chuckled it used to be the frankford arsenal he said yeah miller said remembering we used to come to the commissary here when i was a little kid when they closed the arsenal the city tried to turn it into an industrial park the commissioner said that didnt work so they let unimportant parts of the city governmentthe police for instanceuse the buildings hanrahan pulled up before a small centuryold twostory brick building into a slot marked chief inspector kramer picked a microphone from the seat and said cone at ct castillo looked for a sign on the redbrick building but couldnt see one everybody got out of the car and the commissioner walked purposefully into the building visibly startling two uniformed police officers on their way out who obviously did not expect to run into the commissioner the others followed him just inside the small lobby to the right was an unmarked door there was a door buzzer button set into the wall beside it the commissioner pressed it a not very charming voice came over a small loudspeaker yeah open the door the commissioner ordered who is it its the commissioner bullshit what do i have to do take the damned door there was the sound of a solenoid and when the commissioner pushed on the door it now opened beyond the door was a stairway the commissioner went up the stairs two at a time at the head of the stairs was an embarrassedlooking black man wearing a shoulder holster commissioner im sorry i didnt the commissioner waved a hand meaning no problem chief inspector kramer the commissioner asked i just dont know sir ill put the arm out for him captain obriens waiting for him too he nodded across the room toward a glasswalled office the arms already supposed to be out the commissioner said ill find out whats happened sir the mancastillo and miller both assumed he was a detectivesaid the commissioner walked across the crowded room to the glasswalled office signaling the others to follow him as they got close a uniformed captain got out of a chair the commissioner shook his hand but made no introductions instead saying well wait for fritz he sat down at a desk that had a small nameplate on it reading chief inspector fw kramer took out his wallet and looked inside anybody got two bucks he asked kramer is very sensitive about his coffee kitty castillo was first to come up with the money captain hanrahan took it from his hand and left the office miller nudged castillo and indicated with a nod of his head at what first appeared to be a poster for the green berets movie in starring john wayne but when castillo took a second look he saw that waynes face had been painted over the face was now that of a smiling young man and the blaze on the beret was now that of the th special forces group the detective put his head in the door two minutes commissioner he announced thank you the commissioner said captain hanrahan returned with a tray holding mugs of coffee thirty seconds before a very tall trim very toughlooking man with a full head of curly gray hair walked into the office he was wearing a shirt tie and tweed jacket that had left a clothing store a long time ago the butt of a colt acp semiautomatic pistol rose above his belt to what do i owe the honor he demanded then hanrahan you better have fed the kitty the kittys been fed inspector captain hanrahan said gentlemen this is chief inspector kramer who commands the counterterrorism bureau the commissioner said we go back a long way about the time of noahs ark we were sergeants in major crimes and this is captain obrien who heads the organized crime and intelligence unit this is supervisory agent castillo of the secret service and special agent miller kramer examined castillo and miller carefully but didnt so much as nod his head obrien offered his hand to both listen carefully both of you the commissioner said you are to give them not only whatever they ask for but whatever elseanythingyou even suspect they might have use for captain obrien said yes sir chief inspector kramer said nothing you heard me fritz the commissioner said you understand me kramer didnt reply directly you going to tell me what this is all about he asked mr castillo will tell you what you have to know which will not be all youd like to know understood kramer nodded just perceptibly and the fewer people around here who even know theyre here the better understood kramer nodded again i want you to assign somebodysomebody who knows whats going on around herefulltime until this is over i ordered an unmarked car sent here i get another car this must be important kramer said it is fritz believe me and i dont want to hear from mr castillo that either one of you is not giving him anything he wants and ive told him to call me the minute he suspects that okay i heard you kramer said well be in touch the commissioner said to castillo and miller and then waving to hanrahan to follow him walked out of kramers office chief inspector kramer went behind his desk sat down leaned back in the chair and put both hands behind his head okay mr castillo ask away what does the secret service want to know what id like to know miller said nodding at the john wayne movie poster is whos the ugly character wearing the blaze of the tenth group kramers glower would have cowed a lesser man captain obriens face showed clearly that he understood it was not wise to comment on the poster or say anything that could possibly be construed as criticism of us army special forces in kramers hearing what do you know about the tenth special forces group kramer asked icily he was in the tenth castillo said then they found out he could read and write and wasnt queer and sent him to flight school two wiseasses kramer asked but there was the hint of a smile on his thin lips charley spent too much time in the stockade at bragg miller said his brain got curdled delta force no shit captain obrien asked delta force whats delta force castillo replied the name reitzell mean anything to you mr castillo if your reitzell is johnny and has a wife named glenda yeah i know him and if i called the colonel up and asked about you what would he say hed probably tell you he never heard of delta and to mind your own business castillo said yeah thats probably exactly what colonel johnny would do kramer said he got out of his chair and offered his hand first to miller and then to castillo as i was saying mr castillo what does the secret service want to know youve heard about the thats gone missing from angola kramer and obrien both nodded not for dissemination anywhere theres a scenario that it was stolen by somalian terrorists who intend to crash it into the liberty bell obriens face showed incredulity at that announcement kramers face didnt change but he took a moment to consider it you wouldnt come in here with a yarn like that unless you and some other people who can actually find their asses with one hand in the dark believed there was something to it kramer said finally its not even close to being for sure but its all weve got at the moment the same source who told us the airplane was grabbed by somalians and is probably in chador was in chad theyre running that downsaid there may be a philadelphia connection thats what we need maybe kramer said we have some aalsthat stands for african american lunaticsin town who would love to see something like that right now all theyre doing is throwing molotov cocktails at patrol cars sniping atcorrection shooting at patrol cars theyre not snipers as we understand the termbut theyre ambitious ill see what i can turn up inspector call me dutch kramer interrupted thats what they called me in special forces im charley castillo said dick miller said dutch we need what you have yesterday castillo said ive got some people inside kramer said and so does captain obriensometimes intelligence and counterterrorism overlaps theres four major groups of aals and between us weve got one two or three people in each bunch but theyre in deep you follow me we cant get on the phone and say jack i need what you have on a somalian connection itll take us several hours at least to get in touch with any one of them and anywhere from an hour or more after that to set up a meet youre talking about cops or informants castillo asked cops kramer said good cops who have their balls on the chopping block twentyfour hours a day we dont want to blow their cover and we dont want them killed understand castillo nodded kramer said nothing has come across my desk mine either obrien interrupted which could mean there is nothing kramer went on or it could mean theyre afraid to say something because it sounds like something that would come from a cokefried brain i understand castillo said the fing fbi was in here a couple of days ago the what miller asked a couple offing assholes from the fing fbi wanting to know what if anything i had on leaseaire inc fing miller pursued thats not nearly as offensive in mixed company as fucking is it kramer asked innocently and what did you tell the fing fbi castillo asked smiling the fing truth i didnt have a fing thing on leaseaire inc the four men were now smiling at one another but maybe you should go out and have a talk with them ill send one of my people with you kramer said makes sense miller said thank you whos that young woman castillo asked obrien and miller followed the nod of his head a goodlooking young woman in a skirt and sweater which almost but not entirely concealed the glock semiautomatic she wore in the small of her back was bent over the second drawer of a filing cabinet why do you want to know kramer inquired i think i met her last night castillo said he saw the look on millers face which said jesus christ charley we lucked out and got to play the special forces card with this guy and now you and your constant hardon are going to fuck it up bigtime its not what you think dick castillo said the response to which was another facial distortion that meant oh bullshit schneider kramer boomed get in here please the brunette walked to the office door her face registering mild surprise at seeing castillo and stopped inside sergeant kramer ordered and close the door yes sir she said and complied i understand youve seen this guy before kramer said but somehow i dont think youve been properly introduced sergeant betty schneider this is supervisory special agent castillo of the secret service sergeant schneider works for captain obrien he told me he was in the foodcatering business for oil well rigs or whatever they call them and what did you tell him that i was waiting for my boyfriend she said tell him what you were really doing he has the commissioners personal blessing and more important mine tony frisco and cats cazzaro were having a sandwich at the warwick bar with two characters from the coney island mafia thats the russian mob mr castillo really nice folks obrien explained the table was wired they were giving me the eye so i made a play for this gentleman get anything obrien asked she shook her head you think they made you he asked she shook her head again but they were antsy enough about you to worry you yes sir which means obrien cant use you again for a while there kramer said right frank obrien nodded which makes her available to mr castillo he said his name was castle she blurted that okay with you frank kramer asked done schneider until further orders you will sit on these two gentlemen yes sir she said theres supposed to be an unmarked car here if its not here already it will be soon take mr castillo and special agent miller out to leaseaire at the airport and wherever else they think or you think they should go do whatever they want you to do and dont tell anybody what youre doing can i ask what this is all about mr castillo will tell you what you have to know sergeant kramer said then asked this okay with you charley its fine dutch thank you very much and while youre out at the airport ill put the arm out for those other people we were talking about the sooner the better castillo said i know kramer said anytime gentlemen sergeant schneider said castillo and miller followed her out of the office let me see about the car she said and walked across the room when she was out of earshot miller said put a fing padlock on your dick charley please captain obrien looked at castillo intently but did not comment directly if you can think of anything i could be doing all scraps of information gratefully received miller said chapter xi one on interstate philadelphia pennsylvania june the unmarked car commissioner kellogg had ordered delivered to the counterterrorism bureauso far as castillo could tell it was identical to the commissioners carwas moving at ten miles per hour over the speed limit as they drove i along the delaware river castillo was in the backseat miller had elbowed him out of the way to claim the front seat i really hope you can keep your mouth shut sergeant schneider castillo said you can call me betty if you like she said and yes i know how to keep my mouth shut id like that castillo said how about the boyfriend last night jesus christ charley miller said i want to make the point that i dont want you confiding in your boyfriend either castillo said ill tell him i cant talk about this she said hell be pi he wont like it but hell understand hes a cop good hes a lieutenant in highway patrol and hes not my boyfriend hes my brother betty said he was a very convincing jealous boyfriend last night castillo said i hope the international mafia thought so betty said and then asked are you now going to tell me what this is all about youll pick up more than you have to know from listening to me on the phone castillo said youre going to call him on your cell miller asked unless you happen to know where we can find a convenient secure phone castillo said as he put his phone to his ear a moment later he said i need to talk to him right now mrs kellenhamp where is he whats he doing at camp david how do i call camp david maybe it would be better if you called him there and asked him to call me on my cellular youre right itd be better to go through the white house if he calls please ask him if hes talked to me and if he hasnt to please call me right away this is important he took the cellular phone from his ear and punched another autodial number my name is castillo im secretary halls executive assistant you can verify my identity by calling mrs kellenhamp at secretary halls office you have the number hes at camp david patch me through to him please he took the cellular from his ear theyll check he announced i wonder whats going on at camp david he put the phone back to his ear and mumbled guess they didnt check then said louder yes sir sir i wouldnt normally call you there but another problem has come up sir the commissioner is being more than helpful but at fourfifteen tomorrow afternoon hes going to tell the mayor what we think may happen to the liberty bell sir he doesnt want to cause panic and he doesnt want to cry wolf hes afraid if the mayorthe mayors staffhears anything at all about this it will get leaked to the press but he cant stall indefinitely yes sir i should have thought about this i dont know why the hell i didnt yes sir fourfifteen tomorrow afternoon were on our way to talk to the people who own leaseaire sir they gave us a sergeant and a car and chief inspector kramer who runs their counterterrorism bureau is trying to make contact with somebodymaybe more than one personhe has inside the black groups who may have heard something relative to what pevsner was talking about i dont know how long that will take sir yes sir the minute i hear anything yes sir sir im sorry to be the bearer of bad news thank you sir when are we going to have word about abeche i understand sir he took the telephone from his ear and exhaled audibly he says hes going to have to tell the president about the commissioners deadline castillo said jesus miller said what is the commissioner going to tell the mayor at fourfifteen tomorrow sergeant schneider asked castillo looked toward the front of the car and saw that sergeant schneider had adjusted the rearview mirror so that she could look at him he met her eyes in the mirror and thought she had eyes that were at once attractive and intelligent that we think there is a possibilityoperative word possibility that a group of somalian terrorists who call themselves the holy legion of muhammad and who mayoperative word may have stolen a boeing in luanda mayrepeat maytry to crash it into the liberty bell my god youre serious im afraid so i knew this was important when the commissioner gave you a new unmarked car she said but nothing like that the liberty bell why would they want to do that two theories miller said one is that they think its an important symbol to america much more so than most of us think it is and the secondsort of tied in with the firstis that somebody in philadelphia told these people they should hit the liberty bell what were trying to find out is if there is some link between leaseaire and the terrorists or between anybody else in philadelphia and the terrorists castillo continued if we can do that then maybe we can find out exactly what theyre planning and when thats why were going to the airport to talk to the leaseaire people the ford suddenly accelerated miller glanced over at the speedometer we dont want to get pinched for speeding sergeant he said theres blue flashers under the grille she said if theres a highway patrol car out here hell see them or die young in a fiery crash miller said youre going almost ninety she laughed relax she said and you can call me betty too i thought i told you castillo saw her eyes on him in the rearview mirror chief kramer said you were a secret service supervisory agent she said i am you told the white house operatori assume that was the white house operator it was that you were secretary halls executive assistant i am curiouser and curiouser she said and returned her attention to the road the corporate headquarters of leaseaire inc was on the second floor of an unimpressive twostory concreteblock building attached to the end of an old and somewhat rundown hangar on a remote corner of philadelphia international airport there was a signit looked as if it had been printed on a computers inkjet printeron the steel door announcing closed due to illness in the family now what miller asked sergeant schneider took a cellular phone from her purse and pushed an autodial button jack betty she said a moment later i need a favor look in the lower drawer of my filing cabinet theres a folder called leaseaire i need the home address of a guy named terry halloran and a phone number if there is one whos he castillo asked president of leaseaire right miller asked betty nodded howd you happen to have that information castillo asked sergeant schneider the fbi came to us asking what we had on them she said wed never heard of them but captain obrien told me to have a look at them in case there was something we should know and what did you find out castillo asked she held up her hand in a signal for him to wait and then repeated the address and telephone number that jack whoever on the other end of the line gave her thanks jack she concluded and turned the phone off arent you going to write that down miller asked she returned her cellular to her purse and came out with a voice recorder its a bugger she said it bugs my cellular i turn it on whenever i make a call like that she pushed buttons on the digital recorder and from its memory chip it played back her voice reciting the address and phone number im impressed castillo said me too miller said well were not the secret service but were getting fairly civilized theres even a rumor that were going to get inside plumbing in building next year castillo and schneider smiled at each other millers smile was strained hey no offense she said the problems i have with feds are with the fbi hes worried that im going to make a pass at you castillo said jesus charley miller said betty asked castillo evenly are you from what ive seen so far i would be afraid to castillo said good lets keep it that way you were telling me what you found out when you had a look at leaseaire castillo said shoestring operation family owned the presidentsterry halloranswife is secretarytreasurer her brother name of alex macilhenny is vice president and chief and only pilot also chief mechanic he learned how to fly in the air force got out went to work for the airlinesseveral of themkept getting placed on unpaid furlough when business wasnt good got sick of that and went in business with his brotherinlaw buying and reselling wornout airliners nothing on any of them except the pilots wife had him arrested one time on a domestic violence rap that didnt hold up theyre divorced until you told me about this terrorist business i was almost willing to go along with the fbi theory that they were trying to collect the insurance you did your homework castillo said admiringly the sister and husband seem okay they checked out no prior record etcetera hes a mucketymuck in the knights of columbus i never met the pilot but i cant imagine the sister or her husband getting involved with terrorists no matter how much they needed money i think that illness in the family business is not the reason theyre closed castillo said nodding at the sign i want to talk to them she took her cellular from her purse again ill give them a call and see if theyre home she said and punched in the number from memory which also impressed castillo if theres an answer hang up he ordered she raised her eyebrows momentarily and then nodded theres no answer she said finally i still think we should go to their home castillo said its off roosevelt boulevard betty said the other side of town which means another bloodchilling ride down the interstate miller asked only if youre a coward castillo said or you can ride in the backseat betty said statistics say its safer there castillo thought i dont think there is anything more in that comment than what she said when they got to the unmarked car he got in the backseat but when she turned on the seat to back the car away from the building their eyes met again two tyson avenue philadelphia pennsylvania june twotwozerofive tyson avenue was a neat brick threestory house just about in the middle of the block the other houses built wall to wall were apparently identical differing only in the color of the paint trim and the style of awnings and screen doors there was no answer to the doorbell which played chimes the third time sergeant schneider pressed the button castillo noticed that one of the chime notes was missing no answer miller said quite unnecessarily what do we do now i dont know how the secret service does it betty schneider said but we simple cops listen for sounds of life i heard either a radio or a television i didnt castillo thought because i wasnt listening shes good well they dont want to answer the doorbell miller pursued what do we do keeping punching the bell until they do no she said yahoo what castillo asked you know she said yahoo on the internet it stands for you always have other options she went down the steps waving for castillo and miller to follow her and got behind the wheel this time castillo got in the front seat her eyebrow rose when she saw him there and their eyes met momentarily but she didnt say anything miller rested his elbows on the back of the front seat where are we going miller said can i ask harrisburg she said harrisburg harrisburg she repeated if i step on it we can probably make it in a little under three hours castillo who sensed she was pulling millers chain said nothing miller shook his head and then sat back on the seat and buckled his seat belt with a sure click she drove to the end of the block made a left turn and then almost immediately made another into a narrow alley splitting the block it was the fifth house from the far end of the block she said and castillo saw her pointing and counting she stopped the car and there they are mr terrence halloran and his charming wife maryelizabeth she said indicating the hallorans backyard each of the row houses had a small backyard with a fence separating it from its neighbors the halloran backyard had a small flower garden and a pavedwithgravel area with a gas charcoal grill a round metal table matching chairs and a twoseater swing a stocky man in his fifties with unruly white hair was sitting on the swing with his feet up on one of the chairs he was holding a can of beer and there was a cooler beside him a plump woman with startlingly red hair sat at the table with what looked like a glass of iced tea sergeant schneider stopped the car and got out and castillo and miller followed her there was a waisthigh chainlink fence separating the yard from the alley good afternoon betty schneider called from the gate in the fence she took her identification folder from her purse and held it up im sergeant schneider what the hell do the cops want now maryelizabeth halloran said unpleasantly wed like to talk to you please betty said go the hell away mrs halloran said well castillo thought that explains that sarcastic charming wife shes dealt with this woman before terrence halloran got off the swing and walked to the fence carrying his beer he pulled the gate inward and motioned for them to enter what now he asked these gentlemen would like to ask a few questions mr halloran betty said he took a closer look at them youre not cops are you no sir were not castillo said i already talked too much to the goddamned fbi he said were not the fbi castillo said were from the department of homeland security he gave halloran a calling card taking long enough to read it to confirm castillos first impression that halloran was well into a second sixpack of budweiser then halloran made a follow me gesture and walked to the table where he handed the card to his wife homeland security he says talk to them if you havent learned your lesson she said i wont okay halloran said make it quick i have a busy schedule he sat down on the swing sir miller said i dont think captain macilhenny voluntarily disappeared with the missing aircraft the goddamned fbi thinks he put it on autopilot on a course that would take it out to sea and then jumped out the rear door halloran said jesus mary and joseph i dont think thats the case sir miller said well thats what they think and thats what they told the goddamned insurance company who told us they were not going to pay up until the matter is settled mrs halloran said and then gave us thirty days to findwhat was that line terry another carrier halloran said they canceled us in other words im sorry to hear that castillo said why should you be sorry mrs halloran asked unpleasantly because its unfair castillo said well what the hell are you going to do halloran said theyre the goddamned fbi and im a smalltime used airplane dealer whos the insurance company going to believe you said mrs halloran said pointing a finger six inches from millers nose what the hell did you say that you didnt think alex voluntarily did something or other i think youre going to have to consider the unpleasant possibility that captain macilhenny was forced to fly that airplane off quatro de fevereiro miller said off where mrs halloran demanded thats the airport in luanda halloran said and then turned to miller how did you know that the full name mrs halloran miller said is quatro de fevereiro aeroporto internacional it means the fourth of february the day luanda got its independence from portugal so what the hell she replied i was there maam when the airplane took off miller said you were there she challenged yes maam he said and handed her his army identification card im an army officer i was the assistant military attache in luanda i thought you said you was from the homeland security jesus maryelizabeth put a lid on it halloran snapped he snatched the card from his wifes hand examined it and handed it back to miller major huh you said you was there when it took off i happened to be at the airport miller said i saw it take off and then when wethe embassy i meanlearned it had refused orders to return to the field i was sent to the hotel to see what i could find out about captain macilhenny the manager let me into captain macilhennys room and it was clear that he hadnt taken his luggage with him or even packed it leading you to believe what halloran interrupted i think somebody made him fly that airplane off miller said like who like someone who wanted to use it for parts maybe miller said yeah halloran said so what are you doing here major ive been temporarily assigned to homeland security to see if i can find out what really happened to that airplane and captain macilhenny so whats your theory mr assistant attache or whatever you said you are about what happened to my brother i just dont know maam miller said they got him to fly the airplane where they wanted it and then they killed him halloran said how can you even think such a thing mrs halloran challenged im facing facts is what im doing halloran said we just dont know miller said what were wondering is if theres a philadelphia connection castillo said meaning what mrs halloran demanded from behind the handkerchief into which she was sniffing meaning the airplane was there for over a year miller said maybe somebody heresomebody who works for leaseaireknew it was getting ready to fly bullshit mrs halloran said you see what hes doing terry i hope hes trying to get us to say we let somebody know the airplane was there available to get stolen they stole it and we collect the insurance thats just not true mrs halloran castillo said mrs halloran snorted we dont have many employees halloran said we contract out just about everything but thats possible i suppose all it would take would be someone who could overhear something maybe captain macilhenny saying he was going to africa saying when he expected to be back something like that castillo said about the time he was packing up to go over there we had an md in the hangar halloran said got it from delta we were cleaning it up i mean we had acsincthat means aviation cleaning services incin the hangar but what they send us is a bunch of north philadelphia blacks you know minimum wage it doesnt take a rocket scientist to wash an airplane i cant believe any of them would be smart enough to get into something like that no offense major none taken miller said but maybe if the thieveslets go with the idea there are thievesmaybe they told the airplane cleaners what to look for yeah halloran said thoughtfully have you got the payroll records of these people betty asked no he replied ascinc does all that we pay by the bodyhour and ascinc handles the security you know to get them onto the airport but theyd have a list of the names where are they castillo asked out at the airport halloran said two hangars down from ours he looked at castillo would you like me to go out there with you wed appreciate that very much mr halloran betty said well let me change clothes and get a quick shave he said could i interest you in a beer while you wait you certainly could castillo said i sure hope you know what youre doing terry mrs halloran said im doing the best i can he said as he bent over the cooler he came out with three cans of budweiser and passed them around at least these people dont think were trying to rip off the insurance company the next step castillo thought once they had the names of the work crew was to see if there was a match with any names the cops had there were several problems with that for one thing if there was a terrorist connection they would probably use aphony name or if they used the name they were born with the cops might not have it they would know john james smith as abdullah bin raghead his muslim name or if security was anywhere near as tight as it was supposed to be airport passes would not be given to anyone on the cops suspicious list that didnt rule out a bad guy who couldnt get a pass because the cops were watching him getting his brother or girlfriend who had not come to the attention of the cops a pass to look for what he wanted to know or a bad guy who couldnt get an airfield pass knew somebody who had a pass and borrowed it to get on the field it was unlikely that anyone took a close look at a work gang coming onto the airfield if they had a pass hanging around their neck that would be good enough they would have to do a check on friends and relatives of everybody who had worked in the leaseaire hangar when macilhenny had been getting ready to go to luanda that was going to take time a lot of time this was likely to be a wildgoose chase if anything was going to pop up it probably would come from the undercover cops chief inspector kramer had inside the aal african american lunatic groups but you never knew wildgoose chase or not it had to be done it wont take me long halloran said and headed for his house castillo held open the front door of the unmarked car why dont you ride up in front with sergeant schneider mr halloran halloran considered that no he said ill get in the back with the major thatll really give my goddamned neighbors something to talk about you saw the cops hauling halloran off they wont think that castillo said you dont know my goddamned neighbors halloran said and got in the backseat castillo got in beside sergeant schneider lucky you she said softly no good deed goes unpunished castillo said she smiled at him and their eyes met momentarily again as she started the car castillo wondered if chief inspector kramer had managed to make contact with one or more of his undercover cops and he wondered how long it was going to take for somebodyprobably a spook using a ciacontrolled satelliteto find out whether the was or had been in abeche all secretary hall had said was that they hoped to have confirmation one way or the other soon castillo looked at his watch it was five minutes after eleven he thought that made it five after five in the afternoon in abeche he wondered what time sunset was there not long after that certainly if the cia had not managed to get satellites over abeche by nowor say in the next hourdaylight would be gone and theyd have to rely on heatsensing techniques which were not nearly as good three aboard royal air maroc flight level feet degrees north latitude degrees east longitude june about seven minutes colonel the pilots voice came over the cabin loudspeaker starting to slow it down now ill depressurize in about five minutes ill give you a headsup lieutenant colonel thomas j davenport special forces us army a tall lithe thirtynineyearold glanced at his team of paratroopers prepping for the high altitude low opening halo jump and nodded he touched a small microphone button on his chest understand seven minutes he said how do you read loud and clear five by five the pilot replied colonel davenports mouth and nose were hidden by a black rubber oxygen mask the rest of his face and neck were just about covered with a brownish black grease he was wearing what looked like black nylon tights davenport looked at his watch it told him that heand everybody else in the rear cabinhad been taking oxygen for the past hour and eleven minutes on one wall of the cabin was a rack of oxygen bottles and a distribution system to which everybody was connected by a rubber umbilical cord which also carried current to the jump suits what looked like black tights were actually stateoftheart cold weather gear several thin layers of insulating material were laced with wirelike a toasterproviding heat the heating wire current would be activated just before depressurization of the rear cabin began timing here was critical the heating system was very efficient if the heating wire was turned on too soonwhen the cabin temperature was not double digits below zerothe jumpers would be quickly sweat soaked and suffering the effects of too much heat in theory the heat generated was thermostatically controlled and that usually worked usually presuming it did and the jumpers exited the aircraft neither sweat soaked nor frozen when the umbilical severed a battery strapped to the right leg would continue to power the heating wires similarly at the cutoff of the umbilical oxygen would be fed to the jumpers mask from an oxygen flask strapped to him in theory an hour of the oxygenwhich everyone called ohtwo because of its chemical symbolwas sufficient to drive the nitrogen from the blood of the jumpers so they would not suffer the veryhighaltitude version of the bends when the cabin was depressurized and then when they were falling through the sky flight level is in the troposphere the theory presumed that every jumper had breathed nothing but pure oxygen for an hour and that he had not taken off his mask long enough to have taken even one breath of the normal air in the pressurized cabin taking even one breath of normal air set the one hour on ohtwo timer back to zero the cabin was pressurized to protect the jumpers against the temperatures of the troposphere the temperature outside an aircraft at feet above the earth is about forty degrees below zeroon both the fahrenheit and the celsius scales interestingly colonel davenport moved a lever which changed his microphones function from presstotalk to voice actuated okay in sixfifteen we will start to depressurize balaclavas and helmets now carefully carefully the balaclava mask came from the ski slopes it was knitted of wool and covered the entire head except for the eyes the ones used by gray fox were black they were protection against cold of course but they also effectively concealed facial features holding their breath the jumpers removed their oxygen masks quickly pulled the balaclavas over their heads replaced the oxygen masks and then quickly put their helmets on the helmets had plastic face shields everybody manage to do that the way its supposed to be done colonel davenport inquired almost conversationally three yes sirs and two checks came over the earphones captain roger f stevenson special forces us army who was also lithe and a head taller than colonel davenport but whose skin did not require what he thought of as makeup to hopefully give the appearance that he was of the negroid race walked up to colonel davenport permission to speak freely sir right now anything your little heart desires roger whats on your mind with all respect sir you dont look like one of us when you take off the balaclava youll look like al jolson oh and i tried so hard colonel davenport said with a feminine lisp as he put his hand on his hip youve just ruined my whole day roger stevenson smiled but went on one look at you colonel and the sure to be unfriendly natives are going to say who dat skinny white man wit all dat black grease on his face or words to that effect i think youre trying to tell me something roger sir i respectfully suggest a that were prepared to do this job by ourselves and b your presence is therefore not necessary and c if anybody sees you that has been considered by general mcnab davenport said who has ordered me to go it doesnt mean that either general mcnab or i think you couldnt handle what has to be done you should know better than that by now did the general sir share his thinking with you can you share it with me he used the phrase if theres a change in the orders i want you there i think he thinks we may be ordered to take out the airplane if its there i know how to do that sir i know you do what i think he was really saying was that if the circumstances look like its the thing to do we should take the airplane out without orders and he wants me to make that decision you shouldnt be put in a spot like that if theres a flap all they can do is retire me ive got my twenty years you dont and gray fox needs you roger im actually getting a little too old for this sort of thing ill take my chances with a flap sir you just proved captain the wisdom of general mcnabs reasoning davenport said and now there was an edge in his voice think that over as we float silently through the african sky now go see to your men for a moment it looked as if stevenson was going to say something else but all that came over the earphones was yes sir stevenson walked toward the rear of the aircraft where four other men in black tights were checkingagain for the fourth or fifth timetheir gear with their balaclavas and helmets in place it was hard to tell by looking but two of them were african american one was a darkskinned latin and the fourth caucasian when the latter two took off their masks as they almost certainly would do sometime during the reconnaissance phase of this operation they would also look like al jolson about to sing mammy in the worlds first talking movie captain stevenson thought one of the modifications to the aircraft had been the installation of an airtight interior door about halfway down the passenger compartment this permitted the rear section of the fuselage to be depressurized at altitude while leaving the forward section pressurized the seats had been removed from the rear section the walls held racks for weapons radios parachutes and other equipment as well as an array of large bottles of oxygen the rear stair door had been extensivelyand expensivelymodified it had come from the factory with fixed steps for the on and offloading of passengers they had been designed to be opened when the aircraft was on the ground and not moving metal workers had spent long hours modifying the steps and their opening mechanisms threequarters of the stairsthe part that had been designed to come into contact with the groundhad been rehinged near the foot and fitted with a opening mechanism that when activated allowed the steps to be raised into the fuselage the original openingclosing mechanism had been modified to handle what was now a fourstep doorstep the lowering mechanism now had enough power to force open the door into the air flowing past the fuselage at or more miles per hour it had also been necessary to reinforce the door itself to stand up against the force of the slipstream and everything on the step that could possibly snag equipment had been faired over the parachutes the jumpers would use were essentially modified sports parachutes that is when deployed they looked more like the wings of an ultralight aircraft than an umbrella and they could be flown instead of falling more or less straight downward as a parachutist using a conventional canopy does the wing chutes could by manipulation exchange downward velocity for forward movement they could travel as much as thirty miles horizontally after exiting the aircraft the parachutesthe wingswere larger than civilian sports parachutes because they had to carry more weight the jumpers would take with them a large assortment of equipment including weapons radios rations water and what they all hoped would turn out to be authenticlooking clothing as worn by native chadians each jumper would carry with him a global positioning system satellite receiver connected to him by a strong nylon cord the coordinates of the field at abeche were known within feet a position one hundred yards off the north end of the runway had been fed to the device the gps device had two modes mode i showed a map of the area and the present position of the gps receiverthe jumperwith regard to the selected destination mode ii showed with an arrow the direction to the selected position and the distance in kilometers and meters in mode ii the gps device also combined gps position gps altitude and topographical mapping to give the jumpers a remarkably clear picture of the terrain onto which they were dropping all of this data would be shown on the face mask of their helmets in a headsup display very similar to that which is provided to pilots of highperformance fighter aircraft and advanced helicopters although each man on the team had been allowed to select his own weaponry for the missioncolonel davenport didnt think he should superimpose his notions of ideal weaponry on men who were almost as highly skilled and experienced in keeping themselves and their teammates alive as he waswhen he had inspected the weaponry just before takeoff he saw that they had all chosen just about the same gear everyone had a mm m carbine which was a cutdown and otherwise modified version of the standard ma army rifle these carbines had had another modification special warfare center armorers had installed suppressors they didnt actually silence the sound of firing but the sound was substantially reduced as was the muzzle flash each man had elected to carry from eight to a dozen spare thirtyround magazines everybody too had chosen to take eight to a dozen minigrenades they werent anywhere near as lethal as the standard grenades because of their small size but they were lethal up close and they were noisy they came in handy to encourage a pursuer to pursue slowly and to confuse him about the direction you were taking a relatively new very small and lightabout two poundsantipersonnel mine also served as a fine tool to discourage pursuers when activated the mines threw out a very fine very hard to see wire in five directions detonation came as a great surprise to anyone who stepped on any of the wires colonel davenports inspection had turned up twentyfour of the miniature mines among the teams weaponryin addition to the four he would jump with himself he was also carrying a silenced as opposed to suppressed caliber pistol in case it was necessary to take someone out silently davenport knew that captain stevenson was similarly armed and although he hadnt seen any during the inspection at pope afb he supposed that there were twoor moresilenced s in the teams gear there was also a variety of knives strapped to boots harnesses or in pockets colonel davenport personally was not much of a fan of the knife as a lethal weapon he had been known to comment that if you were close enough to cut someones throat with a knife you were also close enough to put a bullet in his ear and that was a lot less messy on this mission it was devoutly hoped they could accomplish what they had been ordered to do without unsheathing a knife much less using any of their other weaponry colonel the pilots voice came over the speaker im going to open it up in sixty seconds go colonel davenport said sixty fiftynine fiftyeight the pilot began to count davenport and the others moving with speed that had come only after long practice checked the functioning of all their halo equipmentthe oxygen masks and the flask that would jump with them the functioning of the headsets for their mantoman radios the gps receivers and the umbilical they would leave behind on the aircraft this was best done with the fingers only after everything had been checked and found functioning did anyone begin pulling on their electrically heated gloves five four three two one depressurizing now the pilots voice said radio check colonel davenport ordered one by one everybody checked in compartment altitude fifteen kay the pilot reported everybodys magic compass working colonel davenport inquired he got a thumbsup from everyone compartment altitude twenty kay the pilot reported airspeed fourtwofive check everybody davenport ordered stevenson who nodded compartment altitude twentyfive kay the pilot reported davenport walked to the rear of the compartment where he got into his parachute harness and then helped stevenson get into his compartment altitude thirty kay the pilot reported airspeed threezerozero okay thats it were decompressed the pilot said as soon as i can slow it down a little more ill start opening the door airspeed now twosixzero okay here goes the door slowly indicating twotwozero there was a whine of hydraulics followed by a first blast of cold air as the door pushed into the slipstream and then a steady powerful rush of extremely cold air the door acted as sort of an air brake slowing the aircraft now more quickly oneninety oneeightyfive oneeighty oneseventyfive oneseventy holding at onesevenzero the pilot reported the door step was now open davenport went to it and waited until stevenson hoisted his parachute and then connected it to him then he sat down on the floor and reaching beside him placed a bag connected to his harness on the stairs in front of him one by one the others took their places behind him the nexttolast man connected stevensons parachute to his harness and then got in line finally stevenson got in the line of jumpers everybody ready colonel davenport asked everybody checked in pilot davenport inquired about two minutes colonel two minutes davenport responded you ready colonel the pilot inquired ready fifteen seconds thirteen eleven nine seven five four three two one colonel davenport walked awkwardly down the steps and then pushed himself off and into the air the slipstream caught his body and hurled him away from the airplane it would take him five seconds maybe a little more until he could gain control of his fall and assume the positionfacedown legs and arms spreadthat he would keep until he popped his parachute the object was to get out of the deadly cold troposphere before the toaster battery ran out of juice and the ohtwo flask was empty otherwise you died as quickly as they could the others waddled under the weight of their equipment to the steps and went down them and into the night everything go all right the pilot radioed when there was no answer he repeated the question when there was no answer again he said to the copilot michael get on the horn and give them mail in the box at seventeentwentytwo then he reached for the control that would retract the stairs and door into place when the green lights came on he tripped the lever that would pressurize the rear cabin four philadelphia international airport philadelphia pennsylvania june thats him mr terrence halloran said indicating with a nod of his head a guy in a white jaguar xj pulling up to the hangar finally major h richard miller jr said softly and bitterly they had been waiting for him since quarter to twelve a very large african american in his late thirties got out of the car not without difficulty he was as tall as miller but at least fifty pounds heavier castillo had the unkind thought that this guy didnt get in the jaguar he put it on he was wearing a green polo shirt powder blue slacks alligator loafers a gold rolex and had gold chains around his neck and both wrists what the hell is so important halloran he greeted them these people need to talk to you ed halloran said mr castillo this is ed thome who owns aviation cleaning services inc im with the secret service mr thome castillo said and held his secret service identification folder out to thome thorne examined it and then pointed at miller and sergeant schneider and these two he asked im sergeant schneider of the philadelphia pd betty said my name is miller mr thorne i work for mr castillo so whats this all about we need to look at some of your personnel records mr thorne castillo said specifically we need the names and addresses etcetera of the people who you sent to work at leaseaire from may first through the fifteenth no fucking way thorne said excuse me castillo said i said no fucking way thorne said mr thorne perhaps you dont understand castillo said im with the secret service were asking for your cooperation in an investigation were conducting what kind of an investigation investigating what the disappearance of the leaseaire in africa castillo said yeah thats what i figured what are you trying to do tie me to that no sir we are not but wed like to check out the people your people who worked for leaseaire in the you didnt think i was really going to hand over my personnel records to you just like that mr thorne said and snapped his fingers what are you trying to do get me fucking sued mr thorne castillo began you got some kind of a search warrant we hoped that wouldnt be necessary castillo said we were hoping for your cooperation you get a search warrant and run it past my attorney that would take time we just dont have mr thorne castillo said you dont look stupid thorne said what part of no fucking way dont you understand mr thorne miller said courteously can i have a private word with you thorne looked at him with contempt please miller asked thorne shrugged his massive shoulders thank you miller said courteously over there maybe he asked indicating the space between two of the hangars thorne shrugged his shoulders again make this quick he said i have business to attend to ill try miller said with a smile thorne walked a few steps into the space between the two hangars and turned okay brother he said like i said make it quick two seconds later he found his face scraping painfully against the concreteblock wall of the hangar his arm was twisted painfully upward on his back what the fuck he protested and then yelped with pain didnt your mother back in the kennel try to teach you not to use that word in the presence of ladies miller asked almost conversationally let me the fuck go thorne yelped then yelped again in pain youre apparently retarded blubber belly so ill speak slowly miller said to begin im not your brother im an officer of the federal government conducting an investigation and you are not cooperating that annoys me when im annoyed i tend to hurt whoever is annoying me you understand that thorne yelped again in pain good miller said youll go to fucking jail for this thorne said he yelped again in pain theres that naughty word again miller said you really are a slow learner arent you thorne groaned as his arm was pushed farther upward say yes sir miller said there was no response until after thorne again yelpedthis time almost patheticallyafter which he said yes sir jesus christ man lets talk about jail miller said im not going to jail you are you will be charged with assault upon a federal officer which is a felony calling for five years imprisonment during the assault your shoulder was dislocated if you say fuck one more time both shoulders that smarts thorne groaned again as miller demonstrated the pain which accompanies a shoulder about to be dislocated that white man out there is a supervisory special agent of the secret service who do you think a judge is going to believe him or a fat slob wearing gold chains and a rolex who got rich exploiting his african american brothers and sisters by paying them minimum wage to clean dirty airplanes jesus christ man yahoo miller said you know what that means blubber belly thorne shook his head and moaned you always have other options miller said you understand say yes sir thorne audibly drew a painful breath then said yes sir would you like to know what your other option is say yes sir yes sir thorne said nodding we go back out there and i tell mr castillo that after talking it over you decided that you were wrong and now realize it is your duty as a citizen to cooperate with the investigation and that just as soon as we can get to your office youll give us whatever records we want you understand your other option say yes sir okay okay jesus he yelped in pain then said yes sir and which option do you choose blubber belly you cooperate or you go to the slam with both arms hanging loosely from your shoulders okay ill cooperate ill cooperate good are you going to let me go now one more thing if you say fuck one more time in the presence of that lady i will rip your arm off and shove it up your fat ass understand say yes sir yes sir thorne said i had the feeling you and i could work this out amicably between us miller said and let him go five philadelphia police department counterterrorism bureau frankford industrial complex building philadelphia pennsylvania june its going to take some time to check out all these people chief inspector kramer said tapping his fingers on the stack of daily employment records mr ed thorne of aviation cleaning services inc had somewhat less than graciously provided to them and then went on to explain i want to run them past as many people as i can not just the undercover guys i understand castillo said have you been able to contact any of your undercover people all of them kramer said but all that means is they know we want a meet the problem is setting up the meets that has to be done very carefully and that wont happen in the daytime he paused and then raised his eyes to castillo is there anything else youd like to look into like to see castillo smiled you mean that not only wouldnt we be useful around here but in the way you said it i didnt kramer said dick when was the last time you saw the liberty bell castillo asked aside from driving past it i guess i was in the eighth grade miller replied i think maybe you should have a fresh look at it castillo said good idea kramer said smiling if anything opens up ill give you a call im sure you noticed the no parking sign miller said to betty schneider as she slowed the crown victoria stopped turned on the seat and started to back up to the market street curb he was in the front passenger seat beside her not only can i read but i can tie my own shoes she said were on official police business she saw castillo smiling and smiled back tell him sarge castillo said thats a national park service sign miller argued pointing does that official police business business work on the feds on federal property market street belongs to philadelphia she said federal property begins just past the sidewalk she pointed down the open area to the structure erected over the liberty bell and to constitution hall behind it sometimes theres a jurisdictional problem really how so castillo asked she was getting out of the car and didnt reply when he was standing on the sidewalk castillo saw a philadelphia police officer walking quickly down the sidewalk toward them then the policeman took a close look at the car nodded half smiled and started walking back up market street toward city hall he sensed that betty had seen him watching the policeman how did he know you were a cop castillo asked and on official business masculine intuition is what i think they call it she said touche castillo chuckled i dont think ive been here since eighth grade either betty said as they started to walk down the plaza toward the liberty bell and constitution hall i dont remember that miller said pointing at the words cast into the bell i thought everyone knew that proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof was cast into the bell castillo said piously how many times did you say they kept you behind in the eighth grade betty smiled and shook her head concealing the fingers of his right hand from betty with the palm of his left hand miller gave castillo the finger i meant that they misspelled pennsylvania wiseass miller said only one n castillo looked so they did he said i guess they had trouble with eighth grade too it also says the province of pennsylvania betty said i never saw that before i always thought it was called a commonwealth miller walked around the bell castillo looked down the plaza toward market street what are you thinking betty asked its a beautiful day it is but thats not what youre thinking she said no he admitted i was thinking that on the tenth of september there were probably fewer than fifty people who considered suicidal lunatics crashing airliners into the world trade center was even a remote possibility and you think an attack here is likely right i wish i didnt he said and i feel a little guilty doing nothing about it but playing tourist until chief inspector kramer runs those names past everybody including the undercover people what else can you do he shrugged thats what ive been telling myself miller came walking quickly back to them think of something castillo asked my mother miller said i promised to call her when i knew if we could come to supper ive got to tell her one way or the other she really wants to see you charley castillo looked at betty do your radios work as far as bala cynwyd sure she replied and then we have this cellular phone gadget dick call your mommy and tell her the cops are bringing you home again castillo said betty chuckled and smiled at castillo can we miller asked what about kramer he calls we go castillo said were not doing anything useful here she really wants to see you charley miller repeated castillo gestured in the direction of market street and they started to walk toward the car castillo looked at his watch it was ten minutes to four here is in abeche which means its dark i dont know what the cia had to do to get satellites over abeche but they probably couldnt do it before nightfall which means theyre having to use infrared and other exotic technology which obviously hasnt worked secretary hall would have called to tell me what the cia reported one way or the other which means we dont know if that goddamned airplane is or was there and wont know until daylight when the satellites can work their photo magic which doesnt always work jesus getting a call from hall means my phone has to be working when was the last time i checked the battery he took his cellular out and looked at it there was still some battery charge left but not much he saw bettys eyes on him im going to have to charge this soon he said ive got a plugitinthelighter charger in my purse betty said inspecting the fitting on castillos phone itll probably fit your phone when they reached market street and the unmarked car castillo got in the passenger seat beside betty she fished in her purse and came out with a phone charger and handed it to him chapter xii spring one office of the deputy commander us army special warfare center fort bragg north carolina june second lieutenant c g castillo who was the aidedecamp to brigadier general bruce j mcnab the deputy commander usaswc answered the phone in the prescribed manner office of the deputy commander lieutenant castillo speaking sir whats his name the caller inquired whats whose name castillo responded so surprised by the question and the manner in which it was asked that he almost forgot to append sir the deputy commanders name the caller said brigadier general mcnab is the deputy commander sir senator frankenheimer would like to speak to general mcnab can you get him on the phone or is he too not available at the moment may i ask what this is about sir no you may not if hes there lieutenant get him on the phone one moment please sir castillo said he went quickly from his desk to general mcnabs office door rapped his knuckles on the jamb and waited for general mcnab to acknowledge his presence which he did thirty seconds later by glancing up at castillo from the sea of paper on his desk with a look of exasperation they just nuked washington right general mcnab inquired not kindly general mcnab who disliked being interrupted when he was thinking had on going into his office instructed lieutenant castillo that only if one thing happened was he to be disturbed sir i think you should take this one general mcnab considered this for at least two seconds and then pointed to one of several telephones on his desk this was an order to castillo to pick it up so that he would be party to the conversation when castillo had done so mcnab picked up another telephone general mcnab he announced you are i understand the deputy commander of the special warfare center i am i am led to believe the commander is not available at the moment if you were told that its probably the truth as we know it hold one please for senator frankenheimer the caller said senator george j frankenheimer republicannevada was chairman of the senate armed forces committee general mcnab and lieutenant castillo heard their callerfaintly as if he had his hand over the telephone microphonesay all i could get was the deputy commander senator another voice faintly said shit and then a moment later more audibly said good morning general this is senator frankenheimer im afraid i didnt get your name mcnab senator how are you this morning general very well thank you general mcnab are you familiar with the afc corporation i know the name senator they are as they like to say the cutting edge of data transfer technology mcnab didnt reply afc stands for aloysius francis casey senator frankenheimer announced the founder who also serves as chairman of its board of directors again mcnab said nothing can you hear me all right general i hear you fine senator afc has facilities all over the countryprimarily in massachusetts where they are close to mit and in silicone valley in californiaand they have chosen to establish their primary research and development laboratory in las vegas where mr casey maintains his primary residence hes a constituent of mine in other words and has been very generous in contributing to my election funds and to those of the republican party mcnab said nothing mr casey wants to come to the special warfare center general mcnab and asked me to sort of smooth his path which i am of course delighted to do what does he want to do here mcnab asked he didnt share that with me general when would he like to come mcnab asked he will arrive at pope air force base about eleven oclock in a military aircraft in his own airplane senator are you aware that pope is closed to civilian aircraft mr casey is apparently aware of this as another thing he asked me to doand i was happy to dowas ask the secretary of the air force to make an exception for him he will land as i said at pope around eleven may i suggest general that it would be in all our interests if mr casey was made to feel he was welcome i take your point general mcnab said roll out and brush off the red carpet so to speak right good talking to you general senator frankenheimer said and hung up general mcnab took the telephone from his ear held it in his hand glared at it and said sonofabitch then he looked at lieutenant castillo charley this irish sonofabitch with political connections is yours i dont know whether hes just curious or wants to sell us something but ill bet its sell us something sir what am i supposed to do with him ill buy the bastard lunch but thats all set that up at the club for one oclock get him into the vip quarters in case he wants to spend the night but keep him as much as humanly possible as far from me as you can take him on a walking tour of smoke bomb hill take him to the museum take him for a chopper ride over scenic fort bragg anything just keep the sonofabitch away from me clear yes sir two vehicles were in attendance to the deputy commander of the special warfare center outside the headquarters building one was a glistening olive drab chevrolet staff car the other a bell huf helicopter the paint of which was designed to be nonreflective the regular driver of the staff car sergeant tom fenny was conversing with that days copilot of the huey a chief warrant officer whose namekilian robertcastillo remembered only at the last second as he walked up to them sergeant fenny saluted as castillo approached chief warrant officer kilian who was ten years older than castillo did not which neither surprised nor offended castillo weve got to go pick up a vip at pope castillo announced you want me to bring the car over there fenny asked until that moment castillo had intended to meet mr aloysius francis casey with the staff car i dont think the generals going to want the huey if he does with me at pope kilian cant or at least shouldnt fly it alone ive got to occupy mr aloysius francis casey until lunch thats almost two hours the general said take him for a chopper ride maybe he wont like that suggestion should i ask the general if i should use the chopper goddammit castillo tattoo never let anything get in the way of your mission on your forehead i already told you once dont disturb me unless you get a flash they just nuked washington yeah tommy bring the car over there lieutenant castillo ordered and then looked at kilian are the rubber bands all wound up mr kilian is this vip a civilian yeah you need written authority lieutenant to haul civilians there is an exception to every rule parking on the tarmac directly in front of the base operations building at pope air force base is reserved for colonels and up and pope ground control was unhappy when castillo requested permission to park the huey there you have a code six aboard right i will be picking up a vip pope ground clears army sixtwotwo to the base operations vip area at two minutes past eleven a learjet taxied into a space beside the huey as castillo got out of the huey to walk toward the lear an air force colonel and an air force lieutenant colonelthe latter wearing the brassard of the air officer of the daycame out of the base operations building obviously headed for the lear both gave lieutenant castillo a what the hell do you want look as he saluted the door of the learjet unfolded and a very small palefaced man in a baggy black suit got out the air force colonel put on a smile and put out his hand mr casey welcome to pope air force base casey nodded and took the hand we dont know why

tour of fort bragg camp mackall and the fayetteville rail and bus stations and the airport castillo set the huey down on the helipad by the main officers club casey was already out of the helicopter

casey marched toward the main door of the officers open mess with castillo trotting after him once inside the lobby casey turned and looked at castillo with an okay where now expression on his face i believe the general will be in the main dining room sir castillo said pointing brigadier general bruce j mcnab rose when he saw the wiry irishman in the baggy suit headed toward his table with castillo on his heels mr casey he said offering his hand my name is mcnab i know who you are general casey said may i offer you a cocktail sir you drinking its duty hours mr casey i generally ill have a schlitz please casey said there was everything on the airplane but beer mcnab signaled to a waitress and ordered a bottle of schlitz and then changed his mind make that three he said i think a beer is a very good idea ill wait for you outside sir castillo said you stay casey ordered mcnab looked at him but said nothing lieutenant castillowhat is that italian texmex sir you dont look texmex casey said lieutenant castillo just gave me an aerial tour of the main post mackall and fayetteville casey said im glad you enjoyed it auld lang syne casey said can i ask you a question about him certainly whered he get that cib hes wearing in iraq ive been on patrols longer than that war casey said you think he deserves it i gave it to him mr casey mcnab said bristling a little he earned it hes a pilot right and he earned the cib on the ground mr casey mcnab said measuring his words to control what he feared was his building temper i thought on the chopper just now casey began then hesitated and then went on i remembered a guy an aviator a signal corps captain named walker he was trying to exfiltrate us up in laos do i understand that you were in sog or something like that in vietnam i was a green beanie in vietnam general casey said let me finish my story anyway his huey took some automatic weapons fire from charley on his way in and he bent the bird pretty badly getting it on the ground he wasnt hurt but the chopper wasnt going to be able to fly out of there the execthe old man had taken a couple of hits and was in pretty bad shaperan up to this walker character and said not to worry were green beanies and well get you out of here we can probably make it back in a week or ten days walker looked at our exeche was a lieutenant looked a lot like this oneand decided while he might be a nice guy and would try real hard he was no john wayne lieutenant he says let me tell you something about the structure of the us army the signal corps is both a technical service and a combat arm as the senior combat arm officer present i hereby assume command then he looked around at the rest of us anyone got any problems with that he was a great big meanlooking sonofabitch with scars on his face he didnt get shaving there was a couple of grenades in his pockets he had a shoved into his waist and he was carrying a shotguna remington model with the stock cut off at the pistol grip nobody had any problems okay he goes on first we torch my machine and then we get the hell out of here anybody got a thermite grenade it took us fifteen days to walk out of therewe couldnt make very good time bringing captain haye along with uslonger than your quote war unquote in iraqand when the colonel heard what walker had done he pinned the cib on him i heard he was the only signal corps aviator with the cib ive heard that story before general mcnab said as the waitress approached carrying a tray with three bottles of schlitz and three frosted glass mugs welcome home mr casey the men watched quietly as the waitress distributed the drinks before each then said ill be back shortly for your order and turned and left yeah casey said when she was gone i never volunteered for special forces general i mean yeah i signed the papers but the guy who recruited me was a lying sonofabitch but i was eighteen years old and too dumb to know it i was a hama radio amateurwhen i was a kid and before i got drafted i took the exam and got an fcc firstclass radio telephone license they sent me right from basic training to fort monmouth and put me to work as an instructor everybody but me was a sergeant so i spent more time on kp than instructing so this guy shows up and says if i volunteer for special forces where they really need radio guys i get to be a sergeant so i signed up what that bastard didnt tell me was that i got to be a sergeant after i got through jump school at benning and the q course at mackall does that sound familiar lieutenant castillo general mcnab asked and then explained lieutenant castillo is himself a very recent graduate of the parachute school at fort benning and the q course casey looked at castillo but didnt respond to mcnabs statement so i finished the q course he went on and they made me a buck sergeant gave me a fiveday leave and shipped my justturnednineteenyearold ass to nam which turned out to be one of the less pleasant experiences of my life i did all of my time in nam on an ateam mostly in laos but i managed not to get blown away and they sent me home a longhaired sonofabitch and his girlfriendwho wasnt wearing a bra i still remember her titsspit on me in the airport and called me a baby killer i got the same sort of shit in the atlanta airport this time the spitter looked like my grandmother and then i got here and went through separation processing i figured it was goodbye fuck you and dont let the doorknob hit you on the ass on your way out there was a final ceremony the only reason i went was because i figured the bastards were entirely capable of courtmartialing me for awol so this sergeant major lines us all up calls us to attention and out marches this feisty little green beanie light colonel take your handkerchiefs out girls he said he meant it so in a minute or so were all standing there holding our handkerchiefs all right girls this bastard said blow your noses we wondered what the fuck was going on but he was the sort of officer you did what he said so we all blew our noses okay he said put them away crying time is over i know you all feel youve been crapped on by everybody from god on down in the chain of command but the truth is youve been given a gift for one thing youre part of a brotherhood of warriors youll never lose that and you better understand that what youve been through has turned you into something special you can do anything anything you put your mind to doing youre ten steps ahead of everybody else you can be anyone you want to be i dont feel sorry for you im proud to have served with you i salute you and he saluted said dismiss the formation sergeant major and marched off casey and mcnab locked eyes there was no question in castillos mind that general mcnab had been that lieutenant colonel so i went back to boston and tried to drink all the beer in the vfw post casey went on and then my father said i had to start thinking of my future and that maybe i should take advantage of my veterans preference and get on with the city as a fireman or a cop or maybe at the post office i didnt want to deliver the mail or be a cop or a fireman and i began to wonder how much of that light colonels spiel was the real thing and how much was bullshit maybe i could do what i wanted to do it took me a couple of days to get my shit together but one day i went out to cambridge to mit asked to see a professor of electrical engineering and told him i had flunked out of high school but had learned in nam that i knew more understood more about signal radiation than most people and that i wanted to learn more there arent very many poor irish kids with lousy high school records in mit but that fall i was one of them the first year i went to mit in the daytime and to adult education at night and got a high school diploma i graduated with a bssumma cum laudetwo years after that and got my masters and ph d in three more years i was still at mit when i started up afc i gave that same thanksandsolong talk fifty a hundred times mcnab said but you meant it right mcnab nodded so at the risk of repeating myself welcome home sergeant casey mcnab said he raised one of the beer bottles in salute thank you casey said raising a bottle to meet mcnabs and now following suit castillos so what can we do for you mcnab asked its payback time casey said excuse me me to you casey said unless im very wrongwhich doesnt happen oftenyour communications gear is five ten years behind state of the art mcnab took a moment before replying youve got equipment you think the army should buy is that it ive already got some equipment i thinki knowspecial forces should have casey said but i have no intention of getting involved with the army procurement system or fort monmouth im not sure i follow you mcnab said no charge ill show you whats available take what you want ill charge it off to research and development casey said and down the road you give me your wish list and ill see if afc can make it work youre talking about a lot of equipment mcnab said you must know that i know im a richvery fucking richirishman which i know i wouldnt be if i hadnt taken the chance that you meant your speech and got my shit together and went out to mit jesus christ mcnab said no strings general casey said when i heard what you guys were doing over there in iraq i decided it was high time i got back together with my brothers so here i am before you change your mind how do we start this mcnab asked why dont you send the boy wonder here back to nevada with me in the lear casey said let him do some preliminary reconnoitering you mean now mcnab asked i think id like another beer and maybe something to eat first pack charley general mcnab ordered castillo started to stand shortly casey said motioning with his beer for charley to stay seated he looked at mcnab if you dont mind general its been too long since i last broke bread with my brothers spring two concord circle bala cynwyd pennsylvania june charley castillos cellular phone tinkled as betty schneider turned the car into the drive of a brick colonial house sitting behind half an acre of immaculately manicured lawn hello there was no reply but there was the faint hiss of a connection suggesting there was someone on the line hello there was still no reply after a moment the hiss stopped castillo pushed the call end key castillo looked out the window and saw they were close to the threecar garage there was an apartment over the garage he had stayed in it when in his last year at west point the armynavy game had been played in philadelphia he also saw major general h richard miller sr usa retired who was walking purposefully across the lawn toward a flagpole when he reached it he stopped and looked at the ford crown victoria betty stopped the car and they all got out i could use a little help here general miller called it was clearly an order major h richard miller jr trotted toward his father and the flagpole betty looked at charley and saw that he was sort of standing at attention when major miller reached the flagpole he too came to attention general miller began to slowly lower the national colors major miller put his hand over his heart when betty looked at castillo she saw he had his hand over his heart and put her hand on her breast major miller caught the end of the flag as it approached the lawn and he and his father then folded it in the prescribed manner ending up with a tightly folded triangle which he then tucked under his arm okay castillo said and started to walk toward the millers yes sir betty said and followed him good afternoon sir castillo said the colors have been lowered its evening general miller corrected him he looked at betty schneider general this is sergeant betty schneider of the philadelphia police department castillo said how do you do sergeant welcome to our home thank you sir betty replied a trim grayhaired light brownskinned woman ran across the lawn to them cried charley grabbed both of castillos arms rose on her toes kissed him and said thank you charley god bless you and then hugged him tightly helene general miller said this young woman is sergeant schneider of the philadelphia police department we finally got dick released into our company mrs m charley said but i had to promise youd keep him chained in the backyard mrs miller shook her head then put out her hand to betty im very pleased to meet you welcome thank you betty said castillos cellular tinkled again hello hiya charley how are things in bala cynwyd pa charley recognized the voice of howard kennedy aleksandr pevsners former fbi agent personal spook how nice of you to call mr kennedy castillo said major millers eyes lit up arent you going to ask how i know where you are you have friends from the old days right castillo noticed curiosity on bettys face and disapproval on general millers i dont know about friends kennedy said but youve heard im sure that money talks if he knows im here in bala cynwyd nobody knew we were coming here hes got somebody in the cellular phone business they can trace a call to the nearest cell antenna thats what the first noanswer call was all about he wanted to locate me before he talked to me so im told you want to tell me whos answering your phone in the mayflower what the hell dont lie unless you have to one of secretary halls secret service guys his personal detail my boss thought you might call and he didnt want me to miss it not somebody from the fumbling bureau of investigation charley please dont lie to me charley no as a matter of fact right now secretary halls relationship with the fbi is rather strained i would really hate to think that you were trying to set up some sort of a rendezvous between me and my former colleagues charley that would distress me almost as much as it would distress alex neither you nor he have to worry about that howard good when alex is distressed he can get very unpleasant for the moment ill give you the benefit of the doubt thank you i like you charley respect you i checked you out theres more to you than your west point poster boy image suggests i think we could become pals does he mean that or is he schmoozing me what did you want to tell me when you called the mayflower alex wanted me to tell you that that airplanes no longer where we told you it would be kennedy said no longer or never was no longer since last night how do you know and something else in addition to changing the registration numbers they took all the seats out and put in fuel bladders how do you know that well i know somebody who talked to somebody who talked to the truck drivers who took the bladders to abeche and how did somebody who talked to somebody know of your interest just between us charley a mutual friend of ours in the air cargo business flew them from mogadishuyou know thats in somalia right i even passed basic geography at west point castillo said do they grade on the alphabetic or numerical scale at west point i always wondered numeric you were saying these bladders were flown to where ndjamena thats in chad i suppose you know is it really when did our friend do this about three weeks ago and knowing our friend would be a little curious about why anyone would want fuel bladders in chad i asked the pilots to snoop around a little they found out they were to be trucked to abeche i wonder why our friends customer didnt want them flown directly to abeche putting all the little dots together are you i wondered too and putting your little dots together what did you conclude ill bet i concluded the same thing you have kennedy said i hope you understand charley that if our friend had any idea about abeche he would have declined the charter as i hope weve made clear our friend really wants to avoid the spotlight of public attention so thats how you knowactually thinkthat the airplane was in abeche no i have what the fbi would call eye witnesses to that i dont suppose you know where the airplane is now or have the new registration numbers new registration numbers and a new airline paint job no i dont wonderful but ill bet it isnt in somalia why fly the bladders from there if the airplane was going there right great minds travel similar paths got a guess where it might be not a clue but im working on that and the new identification even as we speak if i find out something youll be the first to know thank you i dont suppose you have anything youd like to share with me not now maybe tonight there was a pause before kennedy went on charley i really dont want to accidentally bump into anyone working for my former employer i understand i really hope you do ill be in touch charley the line went dead i wonder where he is probably new york because its easier to be less visible in a big city than a small one but maybe washington hell he could be anywhere and even if the agency or the fbi somehow latched on to that call and traced it it was almost certainly made over a cellular he bought at a newsstand and dumped in a trash can the moment he hung up on me i wonder what the hell he did that hes so afraid the fbi will find him castillo became aware that general and mrs miller dick and betty were all looking at him mrs miller broke the silence first come in the house charley she said everybodys here to say thank you ive got to make a call charley said i really do its important then well give you a minute general miller said why dont you come with us betty mrs miller offered and meet the rest of the family perhaps youd like to freshen up thank you castillo waited until they disappeared into the house and then looked at dick miller kennedy he said i heard the plane is not there it was they tossed the seats out and loaded fuel bladders loaded or installed hooked up he didnt say one of pevsners airlines hauled the bladders from mogadishu to ndjamena then they were trucked overland to abeche you believe him castillo nodded he has no idea where the airplane is now and is really worried that im going to flip him to the fbi is there a warrant out for him castillo shrugged go in the house dick this wont take me more than a minute miller looked at the house his older brother and his aunt belle were in the door about to come on the lawn keep me in the loop right miller said and then moved to intercept kenneth miller and their aunt belle castillo punched the autodial button that would connect him with the white house switchboard three camp david catoctin mountains maryland june the president of the united states who had been resting his hand on the king with which when the telephone light flashed he had been about to checkmate the secretary of homeland security finally took his hand away and leaned back in the pillowupholstered armchair and tried to make sense of the one side of halls telephone conversation he could hear after a moment he gave up on that too and pushed a small button under the table beside his chair a moment later a whitejacketed steward appeared yes mr president booze time the president said a little makers mark for me he stopped said matt and when hall looked at him mimed drinking a shot scotch please the secretary of homeland security said and scotch cheap scotch the secretary of homeland security is not looked favorably upon by his president at this time the steward a dignified grayhaired black man smiled one good bourbon and one cheap scotch yes sir something to munch on mr president in lieu of the hearty meal customarily offered to the condemned why not the steward smiled again and left okay charley matt hall said to the telephone keep at it let me know if anything comes of it he thoughtfully put the telephone back in its cradle leaned back in his chair and raised his eyes to the president first things first the president said pointing to the chessboard on the low table between them checkmate the secretary examined the board shit i always beat you the president said why are you surprised i was hoping your mind might be on other things hall said that was major castillo our nolongersosecret secret agent the president said i picked up on that much he just had another call from howard kennedy the exfbi man who now works for the russian arms dealer and kennedy told him the was in abeche but has left with newunknownidentification numbers and painted in the color scheme of an airline which airline no one knows nor did mr kennedy have any idea where the airplane might be now god charleycastillosaid something else kennedy knew where castillo wasmade a point of letting him know he knew charley said the only way he can think of that kennedy could know that was he has a contact with the cellular telephone people who can trace a call to the nearest antenna in other words this kennedy character can do what the fbi cant do without getting a warrant from a federal judge hall nodded castillo also said kennedy seemed very worried that we were going to tip off the fbi about him castillo said he has no idea where kennedy iswasand kennedy knows that so kennedys worries are a little unusual is there a warrant out for this fellow i dont know i told you the fbi mark schmidt himself was schmidt gave me a hard time about getting kennedys dossier i had to really lean on him to get him to promise to get it to me by nine oclock this morning he paused and im embarrassed to say i havent checked to see if he actually came up with it this morning okay try this on mark schmidt the fbi knows this kennedy is a really bad apple hes an embarrassment to them they dont want you or anybody to know how high this bad apple rose in the bureau or how much trouble he caused okay okay so maybe that doesnt justify schmidts ignoring natalie cohens memo that you were to get whatever you asked for thats a separate issue and ill deal with that yes sir but why should i be expected to believe anything this guy says your man charley castillo hes now my man is that the way it is no sorry bad choice of phrase i set this up castillo is my responsibility my major castillo tells us that the reason kennedy is being so helpful is that he wants us to stop watching him closely he sure sounds helpful when he tells us where the is but before we can do anything about it lo and behold he tells us the airplane isnt in chad anymore why should we believe that it ever was there all i have mr president is what castillo tells me he believes him and charley is very good at separating the truth from the bullshit the president snorted and what is our secret agent doing right now where is he hes at millers fathers house outside philadelphia millers father is a retired twostar general the counterterrorism people in the philadelphia police department are going to set up a meeting between castillo and miller and some police working undercover with muslim groupstwo kinds arabtype muslims and converts to islam mostly african americansto see if they can come up with a somalian connection the steward came into the room carrying a tray with two large glasses dark with whiskey together with a bowl of ice and a pitcher of water one very good bourbon for the president he said and one really cheap scotch for the secretary thank you very much hall said smiling the reason we got it cheap mr secretary is that nobody wanted to buy it can you believe that stuff sat in a barrel in scotland for twentyfour years before they could sell it now that we know where you stand jerry the president said that means that i am not the only friend matt hall has in the whole world the steward left what now mr president hall asked natalie said i should go back to washington about now maybe with your resignation in my pocket so what im going to do is wait until we hear from general naylor that the is not in chad and never has been mr president i serve at your pleasure hall said would you like me to prepare my resignation no i may have to ask for it eventually but i dont like throwing people to the wolves because of my mistakes especially when theyve done nothing but their very best to do what i told them to do four abeche chad june two men dressed in the loose cotton robes worn by inhabitants of the chadian desert sat in a small light tancolored tent three hundred yards off the end of the runway of the abeche airfield one was sergeant first class frederick douglass lewis a very tall very thin twentysixyearold from baltimore in whose home was hung a framed photograph of himself in full uniform he was shown with his arm around an africana very tall very thin watusiin a sort of a robe standing on one leg sort of supporting himself on a long spear both men were smiling broadly at the camera on closer examination one might notice both men had the same face lewis who was pretty good at screwing around with digital photographs had superimposed his face on that of the african tribesman he had also superimposed the face of his wife on a photograph of janet jackson in a very revealing costume mrs lewis whose father was pastor of baltimores second african methodist episcopal church and still carried a lot of that around with her had not been amused sergeant lewis was the gray fox team communicator he sat down with a communications device between his legs making minor adjustments trying as he thought of it to make all the lights go green it was taking a little longer than it usually did but finally all the leds were green were up colonel sergeant lewis said lieutenant colonel thomas j davenport who commanded gray fox and who was unusually in personal command of this team operation gave sergeant lewis a thumbsup signal but did not raise his eyes from the communications device on the ground between his legs it looked more than anything else like a small laptop computer he read what he had typed all well probniner bird was here until dusk yesterday recon produced a covert interrogation of fifteen natives indicates reliability eight i a big airliner here ii airliner markers were stripped and new markers painted no details on new markers available yet iii all airliner seats removed iv large rubber tents placed aboard description of same fits probfive fuel bladders v airliner was not repeat not fueled vi with exception of aircraft crew twoman who were in pilots uniforms and negroid in appearance no white men or other westerners were seen b following supporting details i have plastercast impression large aircraft tires ii purchased one threeplace aircraft seat from merchant iii have approximately one half pound of steel wool scraps from paint removal summary a a large jet transport aircraft was here b markings were removed and replaced seats removed fuel bladders placed aboard probably not installed c aircraft departed for unknown destination at dusk yesterday the first paragraphall wellcovered a lot of ground six men and all their equipment had successfully made a halo parachute descent from a jet transport at feet and landed with all their equipment and themselves intact and functioning precisely where they had intended to land they had carried out their reconnaissance mission without being detected which of course also meant that no one had been killed injured or lost the second paragraph reportedwith a probability factor of nine on a onetoten scalewhat colonel davenport believed to be the facts the rest of the message gave his reasons and his best guesses there was no address and no signature the way the system was set up at the moment the message was going to lieutenant general bruce j mcnab only and he knew that only one person could have sent it when colonel davenport pushed the send key the message would be first encrypted and then sent to a satellite circling the earth at an altitude of miles the satellitehaving been programmed to do sothen would relay the message to a device which another gray fox communicator had set for general mcnab in the vip guest quarters assigned to him at the royal air force base at medina morocco there when general mcnab typed in the sevendigit access code the message would be decrypted and displayed on the screen of what without the secret communications technology would be an ordinary laptop computer the entire process would take from three to ten seconds depending mostly on how quickly general mcnab typed in the access code colonel davenport looked at sergeant lewis who checked to make sure all the leds were still green and then gave colonel davenport a thumbsup colonel davenport pushed the send key and then straightened up and flexed his shoulders for some reason whenever he was involved in something like this colonel davenport always thought of the signaling device that had fascinated him whenthen a young lieutenanthe had first seen it in the museum at the army intelligence center at fort huachuca arizona like the signaling device he was using now the purpose was to communicate between a scouting unit and a headquarters the device at huachucawhich davenport guessed had lain in a warehouse at the old indian fighting post in the desert for maybe a century before someone had stumbled across it and decided it belonged in the museumhad never been issued it had looked as if had come from the factory in waltham massachusetts last week it was mounted on a varnished wooden tripod the legs of which were adjustable both for height and for uneven terrain on topwhere a camera would gowas a collection of simple mirrors a lever and a sighting device cavalry patrols scouting for hostile indians carried the signaling device with them and while looking for the indians also kept an eye open for high ground from which they could see their command post and on which the device could quickly be set up the transmission of data was simplicity itself the rays of the sun were reflected by mirrors toward the command post operating the lever blocked the reflected sunlight momentarily removing the blocking bar sent a morse code dot holding the lever down a little longer sent a dash sending data in this manner had been of course a lengthy process but it had been infinitely faster than sending a trooper galloping across the plains to report the hostiles had been located if the minutemen had had something like the cavalry signaling device colonel davenport thought it would have been unnecessary for paul revere to gallop out of boston crying one if by land two if by sea he also theorized that the cavalry had probably used two three or an infinite number of the signaling devices in series that is when the scouting partys device was out of line of sight with its headquarters devices were set up on hills in between so that sun flashes could be relayed from one signaling device to another that would require of course that the data sent would have to be recorded at an intermediate station and then retransmitted that would take a good deal of time of course but it was still a hell of a lot faster than having a trooper gallop back carrying the message and of course the flashing of sunlight was far faster than the indians means of longrange communication holding a blanket or deer skin over a smoky fire and sending smoke in bursts into the air for his part sergeant lewis was not surprised that all the green leds were up when he looked nor twelve seconds later when two amber leds flashed telling him the message had been delivered to the designated addressee and that decryption of same had been successful this was pretty good goddamned gear state of the art lewis knew for a fact that the army didnt have anything like it that special forces gear while good wasnt as good as this stuff which only went to delta and gray fox this stuff came right from the r ampd labs of afc inc in nevada there was a story that the guy who ran afc and who got this stuff to delta and gray fox had once been the commo sergeant on an ateam in vietnam that sounded like bullshitgod knows half the stories you heard about stuff like this were bullshitbut it was sort of nice to think it might be true thirty seconds after the amber leds flashed a yellow led began to flash sergeant lewis pushed the receive voice button and three seconds later a blue led flashed a few times and then remained illuminated stand by for voice colonel sergeant lewis said as he put a small earphone in his ear lieutenant colonel davenport put a similar earphone in place then moved a small microphone in front of his lips you reading me oneohone the voice of lieutenant general bruce j mcnab asked fivebyfive sir there was a delay of about seven seconds during which time colonel davenports words were digitalized encrypted transmitted into space retransmitted from space decrypted and played in general mcnabs ear and then general mcnabs reply went through the same process good show oneohone mcnabs voice said in davenports ear pass the word im working on getting you picked up at first light so the voice shut off abruptly encrypting and transmitting voice communication was somewhat more difficult than doing so with data and the communications equipment had certain limits seven seconds later the message resumed get sergeant lewis sober and out of the whorehouse by then bring the souvenirs more follows in one hour acknowledge scotty out sergeant lewis was known as gray foxs designated driver and his devotion to his wife was regarded with something close to awe by his peers acknowledged colonel davenport said into his microphone oneoh two i say again oneohtwo out sergeant lewis looked at colonel davenport sir the general knows that i dont use that stuff anymore and if i were you sergeant i would take the generals comments as a compliment yeah sergeant lewis said after a moment and then he asked this was your one hundred and second halo after the first one hundred they get a little easier to do colonel davenport said five office of the secretary of defense the pentagon arlington virginia june mrs teresa slater who was fortytwo naturally blond pleasantly buxom stylishly dressed and who had worked for the honorable frederick k beiderman the united states secretary of defense for half of her lifebeiderman had brought her with him from the ford motor company and quietly and perhaps illegally personally made up the substantial difference between what he had made ford pay her and what the government paid her nowput her head in his office door general withers is here sir she announced how nice would you ask the general to come in please he replied loud enough for whoever was in the outer office to hear yes sir she smiled at him she was aware that the secretary of defense regarded the commanding general of the defense intelligence as a pb who was un because he was vfg at what he did they had brought the acronyms with them from detroit too where they had been used between them to describe a vast number of ford executives they stood respectively for pompous bastard unfortunately necessary and very fucking good lieutenant general william w withers usa carrying a small leather briefcase marched into the secretarys office a moment later trailed by a lieutenant colonel and a first lieutenant both wore the insignia of aidesdecamp and each carried a heavy leather briefcase on his part general withers regarded secretary beiderman as someone who suffered from a severe superiority complex and who had proven again and again that he could be a ruthless sonofabitch but on the other hand withers had learned that beiderman said what he was thinking never said anything he didnt mean and whose word was as good as goldall attributes general withers had seldom found in other civilian officials of government and certainly not in political appointees good afternoon mr secretary general withers said good afternoon gentlemen beiderman said gesturing for everybody to sit down in the chairs arrayed in a semicircle before his desk before we get into the briefing beiderman began as he opened the cigar humidor on his desk and removed an eightinchlong very black dominican lonsdale personal curiosity did they ever find that that was stolen smoking was forbidden in the pentagon general withers had heard a storywhich he believedthat when someone had brought this to beidermans attention the secretarys response was that so far as he was concerned the vice of smoking was henceforth to be considered within the defense department in the same light as carnal relations between members of the same sex that is dont ask dont tell general withers waited until secretary beiderman had gone through the ritual of cutting off the end of the cigar with a silver cutter and then had lit it with a gold butane lighter before replying mr secretary actually thats at the head of my list that caught beidermans attention uhoh whats happening general withers made a waving gesture with his left hand the lieutenant and the lieutenant colonel immediately stood up and walked out of the office what the hell is going on withers beiderman demanded your people dont have the need to know this is a matter of some delicacy mr secretary general withers said for christs sake out with it i regret that i dont have the complete picture mr secretary general withers said jesus christ lets have what you do have mr secretary are you aware of a gray fox operation currently in progress no i am not i have information that there is such a gray fox operation authorized by whom to do what i have information that the initial foreign shores destination was the royal moroccan air force base at menara my questions were who authorized it and to do what i dont know sir did you ask i have been unable to make contact with general mcnab mr secretary hes the eighteenth airborne corps i know who he is what about his deputy his deputy referred me to central command sir and general naylori had some difficulty getting him on the phone sirfinally told me that i didnt have the need to know he said there was an operation and you didnt have the need to know or that you didnt have the need to know about gray fox operations generally general naylors comments could be interpreted either way sir secretary beiderman picked up one of the telephones on his desk and said teresa get naylor on a secure line for me and dont let them stall you general withers unzipped a compartment of his briefcase and came out with a single sheet of paper and theres this mr secretary beiderman snatched it from him what the hell is this he asked a goddamned letter of commendation yes sir it was delivered first thing this morning by helicopter sir the president sent this to you by helicopter beiderman asked incredulously and then without giving withers a chance to reply went on who the hell is major h richard miller jr and what the hell did he do of a covert nature in luanda angola demonstrating wisdom normally expected only of officers of far senior grade and experience and how the hell did the president he broke off in midsentence when a light on his telephone began to flash he snatched the telephone from its cradle is that you naylor ive got general withers in here and he tells me when he asked you about a gray fox operation supposedly now under way you told him he didnt have the need to know is that right for christs sake hes the commanding general of the defense intelligence agency and he doesnt have the goddamned need to know more to the point general what is this gray fox operation and how come this is the first ive heard of it those were your orders orders from who the president personally or someone who said he was speaking for the president and this was when and the president specifically said i was not to be informed no one was to be informed and you assumed that included the secretary of defense those were your orders huh jesus christ naylor he slammed the handset into the cradle and then immediately picked it up again teresa see if you can get the president on the line he ordered and slammed the handset down again he looked at withers that airplane was stolen from luanda right theres a connection between that and this major apparently sir which is i dont know sir you dont know beiderman snapped this little chat is becoming surreal general mr secretary major miller was the assistant military attache in luanda when the aircraft was stolen he was assigned to dia sir so he was also the cia station chief there withers said from which post he was relieved for cause by the dci when i was so informed i relieved him of his attache assignment and ordered him returned to central command i thought you said he worked for you in dia its an administrative thing sir relieved for cause what cause withers took another sheet of paper from his briefcase and read from it a security breach of the most serious nature insubordination exceeding his lawful authority and conduct unbecoming an officer and gentleman i dont know the specific details mr secretary thats what i got from the dci the dci himself or one of his senior subordinates the message was signed by the dci himself sir what the hell is the conduct unbecoming charge all about i believe major miller behaved inappropriately toward his immediate superior in a social situation sir you mean hes a fag his immediate superior is a female sir and he was fucking her or just trying to fuck her which general withers looked uncomfortably toward the office door beiderman followed his gaze mrs teresa slater was standing in a half smile on her face one eyebrow raised am i interrupting one of those mantoman chats she asked beiderman smiled at her answer the question general he said i believe the latter mr secretary general withers said the dci is trying to hang this horny major of yours and the president sends him a letter of commendationspecial delivery by helicopterfor demonstrating wisdom normally expected only of officers of far senior grade and experience id love to know what the hell thats all about i had ordered an investigation into major millers behavior sir before i received the presidents letter i i think id hold off on that for a while general beiderman interrupted and then looked at mrs salter teresa dr cohen is on the line boss she said when i insisted on speaking to the president they switched me to her beiderman snatched a telephone from its cradle natalie he began abruptly what the hell is going on secretary beiderman was a great admirer of the national security advisor and he thought the feeling was at least partially reciprocated the presidents not available at the moment dr cohen said that brings us right back to question one beiderman said will this wait until say six seven tonight never answer a question with a question didnt your mother teach you thats not nice my mother never thought i would have a job like this you dont happen to know of a gray fox operation thats currently running do you no i dont thats funny i thought the memo of understanding said that both you and i would always be advised of a gray fox operation are you sure there is one according to general withers there is are you stalling me natalie in the public interest no she said simply and he immediately decided she was telling him the truth wheres the president there was a brief but perceptible pause before she answered hes at camp david with matt hall whats that all about i cant tell you or anyone else im not even supposed to tell you where he is or whether matt is in trouble or whether matt is or is not in trouble will this wait until six or seven no it wont your call fred ill have the switchboard patch you through to camp david thank you no but you might call out there and tell them im on my way out there you cant go to camp david without permission fred what are they going to do shoot down my helicopter unless theres something else nobodys telling me im still the secretary of defense thanks natalie he put the handset in the cradle call the helipad teresa and then take general withers briefing if theres anything important call me on the chopper he looked at general withers dont tell me you didnt even suspect that teresa always listens to everything said in this office yes sir general withers said secretary beiderman didnt reply he was already through his office door six camp david gatoctin mountains maryland june well thats interesting matt the president of the united states said looking across the low table at secretary of homeland security hall the secretary of defense is on his way here in connection with this hall asked the president nodded he tried to call me at the white house natalies taking calls like that he asked her if she was familiar with a gray fox operation under way she was not and said so whereupon beiderman told her he had general withers in his office and withers said he knew there was one with some connection to a moroccan airfield oh shit natalie and the secretary of defense are always supposed to be kept in the loop about a gray fox operation and i didnt tell either of them hall said a simple oversight matt or on purpose i just didnt do it mr president hall said i suppose subconsciously i didnt want beiderman to i dont know and i guess i didnt tell nataliedidnt want to tell natalie because i didnt want to hear her clear arguments that running a gray fox was ill advised the result of which is that i now have natalie and beiderman with severely ruffled feathers justifiably ruffled feathers matt and i will have to atone for that with all respect sir youre wrong hall said he stood up natalie and beiderman know were old friends they will understand why you brought me out here to explain why i have to go they will have no reason to be angry with you i screwed this up and ill take the rap the president met his eyes but didnt say anything if youll excuse me mr president ill go find a typewriter and prepare my resignation with your permission sir i think that it would be best if im gone by the time secretary beiderman gets here after a long moment the president said softly im really sorry old pal not half as sorry as i am mr president hall said he was halfway across the room when the light on the telephone flashed the president picked it up and said hello who is this whos calling this is the president general naylor i picked up secretary halls line hes not here at the moment may i give him a message hall stopped and asked with his eyes if he should or perhaps could stay the president signaled him to come back and sit down well lets have it please general naylor thirty seconds later the president said general you probably wont understand this but this is one of those times when bad news is also good news please relay my deepest appreciation and admiration to general mcnab and all his men oh heres secretary hall general perhaps youd like to tell him what you just told me he handed the telephone to hall in the phone booth in tampa general naylor faintly heard the president of the united states say jesus christ matt talk about getting saved by the fucking bell chapter xiii one camp david catoctin mountains maryland june there was a discreet knock at the door of the presidents living room and then the door was slowly swung open the president who was sitting slumped back in a pillowupholstered armchair across a low table from secretary of homeland security hallwho was talking on the telephonewaved secretary of defense frederick k beiderman into the room and then onto a couch facing the table the president raised an index finger in a signal that could mean wait or quiet while halls on the phone beiderman sat down more than a little tensely on the edge of the couch the president gestured toward the steward and asked with a raised eyebrow if beiderman wanted anything beiderman shook his head the president signaled to the steward that he should refill his and halls glasses beiderman looked between the president and hall the president touched his ear which beiderman understood to mean that he was supposed to listen to halls end of the conversation he didnt hear much the secretary of defense just came in hall was saying ill have to get back to you charley he looked at beiderman as he replaced the handset in its cradle the president smiled at beiderman what an unexpected pleasure mr secretary he said actually matt and i were just talking about you secretary beiderman was visibly not amused all your righteous indignation should be directed at me the president said everything thats been doneor should have been done and wasntwas at my orders beiderman didnt say anything no comment the president asked mr president are you going to tell me whats going on two things of importance the president said the first and this comes from a source which so far has been right on the money is that a group of somalian terrorists stole the in angola to crash it into the liberty bell the plane made a stop in abeche chad to change its markings and install fuel bladders and nowright nowis apparently en route from there to someplace unknown on its way to philadelphia may i ask why i have not been informed mr president beiderman asked coldly the second thing the president went on ignoring the question is that the police commissioner of philadelphiawho had to be told of the possibilityintends to inform the mayor of philadelphia at fourfifteen tomorrow afternoon the ramifications of that are obvious it will be received by the public with a yawn as just another elevation of the terror threat color codeor with mass hysteria matt and i have been waiting for you so that we can set up a conference call between here and natalie cohen so that we may chew the situation over between us and decide what we should do how reliable is your source beiderman said the liberty bell jesus christ why the liberty bell thats everyones reaction frankly we really dont know why its a target matt was just on the telephone with major castillo who is in philadelphia and who hopes to have an answer to that later tonight who the hell is major castillo beiderman blurted the man i charged with finding out who among the intelligence community knew what about the missing airplane and when they knew it the president said hes matts executive assistant i dont understand mr president i know and its my fault you dont the president said im sure you may have a question or two he chuckled am i missing something beiderman snapped is there something funny here that im missing its not funny at all the president said levity flippancy is often the outward reaction of people who are terrified he paused and i am fred beiderman looked at him intently for a moment how reliable is your source mr president that someone intends to crash that airplane into the liberty bell on one hand he apparently is not the kind of source in which the cia the fbi the dia etcetera etcetera would place much credence as they have chosen either a not to tap him for information or b to ignore him hes a russian arms dealer perhaps the most infamous of that breed a fellow named aleksandr pevsner i know that name beiderman interrupted so far as ive said what hes given us has been right on the money given you how through major castillo im having a hard time understanding this mr president beiderman said whats in it for pevsner why should we trust a man like that i think wed better take it from the top the president said beiderman nodded have a drink fred hall said youre probably going to need one and when you write your memoirs id rather you didnt recall that we were drinking and you werent beiderman looked at hall and then at the president who was holding his makers mark then shrugged why not the president pressed the button that would summon the steward and then looked at beiderman when i became annoyed that no one in the entire intelligence community no one mind youseemed to be able to locate the airplane stolen in angola the president began i called in natalie and matt and two concord circle bala cynwyd pennsylvania june the yes sir that major c g castillo said to his cellular telephone was more a reflex action than a reply to secretary of homeland security matthew hall castillo had heard the click of the breaking connection a split second after hall had said ill have to get back to you charley as he slipped the telephone into his shirt pocket he saw that major general h richard miller sr had come into the corridor where charley had gone to take the call after leaving the living room i was not trying to overhear your call major the general said but i would like a word with you in private major what is he up to now yes sir of course general miller opened a door and motioned charley ahead of him inside was a small booklined very neat study there were a dozen framed photographs on the bookcase shelves one was of the generalthen a majorand colonel colin powell obviously taken in vietnam there were three photographs of dick miller one was of him in dress uniform standing with his father at west point takencastillo knew he had taken the picturejust before the final retreat parade a second showed miller getting his captains bars from general miller and the third showed general miller now retired and in civilian clothing pinning on dicks majors leaves this will do general miller said closing the door please feel free to use my office for any further calls thank you sir youll understand major that i am not asking for information that may be classified yes sir you are obviously in command here and i would like to offer to help with whatever it is youre doing thats very kind of you general but i cant think of a thing i understand general miller said thank you for your time major castillo he turned and started to open the door fuck it if you cant trust a west point twostar whose grandfather was at san juan hill with the th cavalry general now give me a minute please castillo said general miller turned around what im about to tell you sir may not be shared with anyone without my express permission castillo said mine or dicks then perhaps it would be best if you told me nothing general miller said sentiment has no place in matters of security or intelligence a lecture i should have known that was coming he still thinks of me as a cadet who almost got himself and dick booted out of west point and then not only became a special forces cowboy promoted before his time but who dragged dick from the holy family cavalry tradition into the green beanies with him on the whole were i major general miller i wouldnt like major castillo much either that was secretary hall just now general is that who you work for yes sir but on indefinite tdy i am still a serving officer may i go on sir of course excuse me secretary hall called to tell me that a gray fox team which made a halo insertion to the airfield in abeche chad has confirmed that the stolen from luanda has been in abeche where it was given new registration numbers and loaded with several fuel bladders may i ask why he thought you should be made privy to that information lowly majors especially ones promoted before their time should not even know what gray fox is right much less be privy to operational details because i gave him the initial intel sir that the airplane was probably there general miller looked at castillo for a long moment almost visibly deciding whether to believe him or not not that hes wondering if im lying he really believes that west pointers do not lie cheat or steal nor tolerate those who do its just that as a general based on his own experience he knows that i simply cant have the experience to really know what im talking about what is the connection between that missing aircraft and philadelphia general miller asked finally can you tell me that my best intel is that a group of somalians calling themselves the holy legion of muhammad intends to crash it into the liberty bell complex here may i ask where that came from the liberty bell does not seem symbolism aside to be a worthwhile target that i cant tell you general because we just dont know but the gray fox team confirmed what my source gave mefirst that the airplane was in chad that the registration numbers had been changed and fuel bladders placed aboard and second that it had left to what end major where is the aircraft now we dont know sir with the fuel bladders would it have the range to fly here thats possible sir but i think the purpose of the bladders is to have a large amount of fueleither jp or gasolineaboard as explosive material theyre trying to duplicate the effectiveness of the big birds the terrorists turned into bombs on with the smaller that being old and common is effectively off everyones radar and you believe this aircraft is headed for philadelphia yes sir and thats why youre here our source believes there is probably a connection between the holy legion of muhammad and someone here in philadelphia commissioner kelloggs trying to help us find it if there is one does kellogg know about the airplane your belief that it will be used as a flying bomb yes sir and after tomorrow hes going to tell the mayor the mayor doesnt know general miller asked surprised not yet sir hes the mayor in other words the commanding general right the decision not to tell the mayor was commissioner kelloggs sir the mayor should be informed general miller said jesus christ is that an announcement that hes going to tell him i really believe thats commissioner kelloggs decision to make sir general miller thought that over and finally nodded yes it is he said and dicks role in all this can you tell me about that centcomgeneral naylorput him on tdy to secretary hall sir were working together on this why was he relieved for cause in angola for doing his duty sir and that unjustified relief is being dealt with there will be nothing on his record about angola except that he received a letter of commendation from the president general miller considered that for a moment and then asked is there something i can do to be helpful not that i can think of sir castillo said except you may tell commissioner kellogg that i have told you what i have i dont know the nature of your relationship with him we have been friends for a very long time perhaps you might be helpful to him yes general miller said thoughtfully he was about to say something else when there was a knock on the door hello major castillo sergeant betty schneider called softly general miller opened the door ah sergeant schneider he said she ignored him weve had a call were going to meet those people we talked about in fortyfive minutes where general miller asked betty schneider looked at castillo for guidance ive been bringing general miller up to speed on whats happening castillo said a couple of blocks from the north philadelphia station she said but were going to have to change cars change cars why castillo asked because on west seltzer streetwhere well do the meeta new ford is either a fool from the main line trying to score dope or an unmarked car betty said were trying not to attract attention major i thought you agreed to call me charley castillo said now were working okay and this is my turf oddly enough sergeant general miller said i really didnt think you were from the visitors bureau the presence of sergeant betty schneider of the philadelphia police department had been explained with a rather convincing fabrication loosely based on the facts but not touching in any way on the possibility that the liberty bell was about to be the target of a terrorist attack castillo had told mrs miller and the rest of the family that the department of homeland security to which he had been assigned for some time as a liaison officer between the department and central command and to which major miller had just been assigned wanted to establish a closer relationship with the philadelphia police department in particular the counterterrorism bureau and the organized crime and intelligence unit commissioner kellogg more as a courtesy to secretary hall than to castillo or miller had arranged for the visitors bureauwhich dealt with visiting movie stars and the liketo provide them with a car and a driver sergeant schneider to escort them around and answer what questions she could castillo smiled at betty schneider you may tell him sergeant he said im with the organized crime and intelligence unit general she said and we got lucky with the commanding officer of the counterterrorism bureau general castillo explained he served with special forces he asked the commanding officer of organized crime and intelligence if he could spare sergeant schneider to help us theres one more thing major betty said chief inspector kramer strongly suggests that major miller do the meet not you and that he dress appropriately because of where youre going general miller asked she nodded and said white men like new ford sedans on west seltzer street after dark dress appropriately general miller asked work clothes preferably dirty and torn betty said i think we have what you need in the garage general miller said you said change cars castillo said where do we do that internal affairs has been told to give us whatever we want she said they have a garage full of them mostly drug bust forfeitures dungan road downtown not far from where were going is there a weapon dick can have general castillo asked is he going to need one general miller asked looking at betty schneider you never need a gun unless you really need one general she said general miller opened the center drawer of his desk and took out what looked like a cutdown model a acp semiautomatic pistol he ejected the clip racked the action back to ensure the weapon was not loaded and then handed it to betty they used to make these at the frankford arsenal he said cutting down a standard model a shorter slide five rather than sevenshot magazine etcetera they were issued to general officers the american version so to speak of the general officers batonswagger stickin other armies she examined it carefully very nice she said then raised her eyes to his i can put this in my purse and give it to him later she said why dont you do that general miller replied handing her the clip he had ejected and a second one also loaded with five rounds he pulled from the drawer and when you do please tell him that if at all possible id like it back in the same condition it is now yes sir she said but she was obviously confused by the remark that is never fired in anger general miller said three camp david catoctin mountains maryland june may i speak freely mr president beiderman asked several minutes later the president held up both hands palms upward yielding the floor until about thirty seconds ago the secretary began i wasnt buying your argument that you were justified or fair in not bringing me in on this from the gitgo i am the secretary of defense i have the right to know whats going on and what happened thirty seconds ago the president asked softly i realized that i was letting my delicate ego get in the way of reality beiderman said the two pertinent factsmaybe its only one facthere are that youre the president and the commander in chief of the armed forces of the united states the constitution lays the defense of the nation on your shoulders you have all the authority you need to do any goddamned thing you want to do that once i got past that what i had decided was the dumbest idea youve had in a long time sending a goddamned majora major for christs saketo check on how all the generals and the toplevel civilians are doing their jobs didnt seem so dumb after all it made a hell of a lot more sense than setting up one more blueribbon panelparticularly after the commissions reportwhich would have taken three months to determine that what wasnt working the way it shouldwhat was wrongwas the other guys fault and knowing you as well as i do i knew that what you had against using a commission or panel or something of the ilk to find out whats wrong had nothing to do with the otherperhaps the most significantthing that panels are good for giving your political enemies ammunition to use against you the truth fred the president said is that forming a blueribbon panel never entered my mind all i wanted to do was quietly find out who knew what and when they knew it i thought this would put us ahead of the curve using major castillo to that end seemed to be the way to do that very quietly no one was going to pay attention to a major it just got out of hand is all out of hand mr president beiderman said i dont follow that ive stirred up a hornets nest if youve learned about this gray fox operationand you were you admit furious when you didwait until the dci and the director of the fbi find out excuse me mr president and with all respect so what you found outthis major whatsisname found out castillo secretary hall interrupted major carlos g castillo among other things beiderman went on that the dci was prepared to hang another major out to dry for doing his job in angola and was far more interested in covering his ass about his connections with this russian arms dealer than getting the intelligence that was apparently there for the asking the president looked at him with a raised eyebrow but said nothing and without charley mr president hall interjected we would never have found out about kennedy schmidt damned sure wasnt going to volunteer that information about kennedy beiderman asked whos he a former fbi agent who now works for pevsner the president said we dont know how important he was in the fbi before he left but to judge from mark schmidts reluctance to come up with his dossier when matt asked for it i dont think he was a minor functionary if i were paranoid hall said and god knows im starting to feel that way id say theres a conspiracy on the part of schmidt and the dci to tell usthe presidentonly what they want him to hear thats a pretty strong accusation matt the president said what other interpretation can we put on it mr president hall responded mr president beiderman said wouldnt giving matt anything and everything he asked for as soon as he asked for it come under that memo natalie cohen sent around the president looked at him for a moment point taken fred he said more important beiderman went on major whatsis castillo has come closer to finding this airplane than anybody else and isnt that the priority neutralizing the goddamned airplane before these lunatics fly it into the liberty bell or do something else insane with it are you suggesting fred that we dont rein major castillo in the president said exactly i was about to suggest sending him to fort bragg to bring delta and gray foxwhich i submit were really going to have to use to take this airplane outup to speed on this but but what do you know general mcnab beiderman asked i mean personally feisty little bastard hes not going to listen to a major maybe i better go down there myself or at least get on the horn to mcnab charley castillo flew mcnabs helicopter around iraq in the first desert war hall said and after charley commanded one of mcnabs delta force operations in afghanistan mcnab will listen to him especially the president said after we tell general mcnab that i personally ordered him to fort bragg four the oval office the white house pennsylvania avenue nw washington dc june fifteen minutes after natalie cohen the national security advisor had telephoned john powell the director of the central intelligence agency to tell him the president would like you to come to the white house as soon as you can the directors yukon xl was passed onto the white house grounds by the secret service as he got out of the vehicle at the side door of the white house he heard the familiar sound of marine one the presidents sikorsky vhd sea king helicopter on its final approach to the south lawn he reached the outer office of the oval office before the president did natalie cohen was there natalie powell said nodding at her and then he asked wheres he been at camp david she said whats going on i think were both about to find out john she said the president came into the outer office just over a minute later john he said good youre here good evening mr president beiderman hall and powell nodded at each other but didnt speak id like a moment with the dci before we start this the president said and i just remembered natalie did you call fort bragg no sir i thought you were going to how about doing that right now the president ordered the president waved powell ahead of him into the oval office closed the door and waved him into one of the chairs before his desk the president remained standing looking out the window onto the meticulously manicured lawn as he composed his thoughts yes mr president dci powell asked after a moment the president turned and spoke i was hoping youd be prepared to tell me whether the missing is in chad or not or if its not where it might be there will be satellites over abeche at first light mr president actually there arehave beensatellites over that site for some time but the heatseeking metallicmassseeking sensors havent come up with anything we can rely on with daylight in other words you dont know the president interrupted im afraid i dont mr president i dont know where it is the president said but i know its not in abeche chad then matt halls information was not reliable mr president matt halls information was right on the money he replied meeting powells eyes we have confirmation that the airplane was there that the seats have been removed fuel bladders loaded aboard and that after new registration numbers were painted on it that it took off for an unknown destination powell shifted uncomfortably in his chair and after a moment said i have to ask mr president why you think that information is credible because i authorized a gray fox insertion and thats what they reported the president let that sink in and then went on our problem now is to find where the airplane is now something more precise than on its way to philadelphia powell raised his eyebrows but didnt respond i wasnt sure whether i should get into this with you now john but i think i will if nothing else it will clear the air between us before the others come in here yes mr president you took action based on faulty intelligence someone gave you action that i had to correct i dont think i follow you mr president what action did i take you relieved for cause your station chief in luanda the causes including a serious breach of security exceeding his authority and jesus christ conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman what the hell was that making sure the spikes held him to the cross obviously sir youre making reference to major miller yes i am my information came from his immediate supervisor sir well giving any kind of classified information to my personal representative doesnt constitute a breach of security of any kind the president said no sir of course not i was apparently misled yeah you were miller didnt make a pass at that woman she made a pass at my man if those are the facts sir i will those are the facts the president interrupted take immediate steps to rectify the situation so far as major miller is concerned that wont be necessary the president said ive done that myself and as far as rectifying the rest of it ive always found it useful to be able to trust the people who work for me the president locked eyes with powell for a moment would you ask the others to come in now please he said five west seltzer and west somerset streets philadelphia pennsylvania june castillo could see much better out of the deeply tinted windows of the fiveyearold battered and rusty bmw sedan betty schneider had selected from the cars lined up in the internal affairs division garage than he thought he would be able to nice neighborhood he said looking at litterstrewn streets and sidewalks and the rundown brick row houses many of them with concrete blocks filling their windows betty had told him she had used the car before but didnt think anyone had made it it was a forfeiture betty said but from a customer not a dealer it looks like something a less than successful dealer would drive but no dealer is going to make it or so far none has whats the drill dick miller asked he was in the backseat now dressed in a torn and soiled light blue jumpsuit a light zipper jacket and a wellworn pair of white adidas shoes he had the general officers model pistol in the side pocket of the jacket he would have to keep his hand in the pocket to conceal the outline of the pistol but there was no other place to put it his cellular telephone was in the chest pocket of the coveralls well loop through here again betty said this time when were at the corner ill stop and you get out quickly and dont slam the door the turntheinteriorlightson thingamajib in the door has been disabled when youre out walk quickly away in the opposite direction go to the corner stop look around then walk slowly back toward the corner and either lean against one of the buildings or sit on one of the stoops our guy is supposed to be in one of the buildings hell wait to see if you attract any attention has he got a name he knows your name is miller and he has a description let him make the approach you dont talk to anybody okay got it then what happens you go where he takes you more than likely into one of the brickedup buildings you tell him what you want and he may or may not be able to help you when youre finished you call hell show you how to get back on west seltzer and then go on his way you go back to the stoop or leaning on the wall and when i come by you get in got it got it if something goes wrong theres an unmarked counterterrorism car somewhere around here and a highway supervisoractually my brotherin the area probably parked near the north philadelphia station either or both can be here in a minute or so but the real name of the exercise is not blowing the cover of our guy understood understood then when we finish here theres another meet set up we hope for half past nine at north twentyfifth and huntington streets about twenty blocks from the station and maybe one more after that watch your back dick castillo said as betty slowed the bmw and approached the intersection of west seltzer and west somerset streets again you behave casanova miller said betty stopped the car miller got out pushedrather than slammedthe door closed and walked away betty made a left turn on west seltzer then a right turn on north broad street theres my brother she said as they passed the station and another highway car they wont attract attention highway is all over the city all the time not that it would bother him he takes very good care of his baby sister i saw that in the bar at the warwick i really thought he was your boyfriend and he asked me if you had hit on me she said you will recall i had not i also recall that you told me you were the catering manager for some oil company and i believed you youre a very good liar you could have been a con man ill take that as a compliment take that as a statement of fact betty said i also suspect that your not hitting on me in the hotel was the exception to your normal behavior why would you think that dick keeps warning me about you and telling you to behave trust me sergeant charley said your virtue is not about to be attacked ill bet you say that to all the girls betty said would you feel better if i got in the backseat unnecessary i can take care of myself changing the subject where are we going now im going to turn off broad in a couple of blocks and make our way back to the general area where we dropped dick off she had just made the turn when castillos cellular rang hello yes sir we just dropped dick off to meet with one of the undercover cops sergeant betty schneider of the intelligence unit organized crime and intelligence unit betty corrected him organized crime and intelligence unit i have just been corrected when he calls well go pick him up theres at least one more meet tonight probably late into the night sir this is difficult to do no chief inspector kramer made it pretty clear that dick would do much better at this than me dicks black no sir im not really needed for this fort bragg what for yes sir i dont know how long it will take me to get there probably phillyatlantafayetteville ill call you what time will it get to philly sir itll take me that long to pack and get out to the airport sir yes sir mr secretary could i stay here until dick finishes doing what hes doing maybe hell come up with something yes there is the telephone sir but its not secure and i really hate to just leave dick yes sir i understand secretary beidermans now in the loop is he yes sir ill call you when i get there if dick comes up with something while im in the air yes sir i understand as castillo put his cellular into his pocket he realized that betty schneider had pulled the crown victoria to the curb and stopped she was looking at him the secretary of defense now knows whats going on castillo said and thinks i should go to fort bragg to meet with general mcnab so im going to fort bragg right now my boss has sent his plane here to pick me up dick will be all right charley betty said we have him pretty well covered the risk is really to the undercover cops yeah he said you really are worried about him arent you i would have thought what oh i dont know macho stuff green berets can do anything but you really care dick and i go back a long way and he doesnt have any experience with anything like this and youve always taken care of him right meaning what his mother told me what you did in afghanistan no wonder she hugged you the way she did castillo met her eyes for a moment can you take me someplace where i can catch a cab i can do better than that she said and took out her cellular and punched an autodial key tom i need to transport our guest first to the warwick and then to the airport and right now she looked at castillo my big brother she said i figured okay betty said to the telephone on the south side in five minutes thanks tom she broke the connection dropped the cellular into her purse and pulled away from the curb toms sending a highway car to north philadelphia station theyll take you to the warwick and out to the airport thank you there was nothing that looked like a highway patrol car near the north philadelphia station when they got there betty drove the bmw to an unlit area stopped and turned the headlights off a moment later two cars pulled into the area beside the station theres your highway car betty said and more than likely tom betty flashed the headlights once do i go there or will they come here you start walking and when they see you youve been great betty thank you very much and ill take care of dick she said dont worry and then their faces were close and then she moved her face even closer and he felt her lipswarm and softon his not chaste castillo thought and certainly not passionate something in between tender jesus he said yeah jesus betty said softly i really didnt mean for that to happen castillo touched her cheek with the pads of his fingers but made no attempt to kiss her again go charley betty said he moved his head quickly and kissed her again she responded for a moment then averted her head go charley she said please he got out of the car and walked toward the railroad station one of the highway cars started toward him he stopped walking and waited the car drove right past him the second car moved toward him and stopped next to him castillo got in and pulled the door shut there was a barrier between the front and rear seats the upholstery in the back was of heavy plastic material a very large very black police officer wearing a brimmed cap that seemed several sizes too small for him turned in the seat as the car started to move the warwick and then the airport right he asked yes please sit back and enjoy the ride the highway patrol officer said as the car started down north broad street six the very large highway patrol officercastillo saw for the first time he was a sergeantwas leaning against the car when charley came out of the warwick with his luggage he took the suitcase from charley opened the rear door tossed the suitcase in the trunk waited for charley to get in then closed the door the warwicks doorman was obviously wondering what was going on they were five or six blocks down south broad street stopped at a light when the officers cellular telephone rang hold on lieutenant the sergeant said and turned on the seat its for you but the phone wont go through the barrier the car pulled to the curb the sergeant got out opened the rear door and handed the phone to castillo hello this is tom schneider i think weve met before charley said i really appreciate the yeah so what are you dea or something or something well listen good mr dea hotshot i saw what you was doing with my sister in her car i dont really know how to respond to that charley said it was dont respond just listen you fuck around with my sister again ill break both of your legs you understand me i hear you loud and clear lieutenant see if you can not come back to philadelphia lieutenant schneider said and broke the connection charley handed the cellular back to the sergeant who had apparently been able to hear the conversation because he said he means it you better pay attention then he closed the door got back in the front seat and the car moved into the traffic flowing down south broad street which airline the highway patrol sergeant said as they approached philadelphia international airport that subject had not previously been considered by major c g castillo whose mind had all the way down south broad street been occupied with the memory of betty schneiders eyesand then her lipson his and the multiple ramifications thereunto pertaining not an airline he said they sent a plane for me who they the department of homeland security charley said its a secret service airplane no shit is there a general aviation terminal charley asked or something like that beats the shit out of me the highway sergeant confessed let me see if i can find one of the airport guys they got sort of a district out here halfway down the line of departing passenger gates of the various airlines the highway officer driving the car spotted a policeman wearing a whitebrimmed cap and blew his horn to attract his attention when that didnt work he made the siren growl for a moment which produced the desired effect the airport detail officer trotted over to the car to the fascination of thirty or more departing passengers your name castingo the officer inquired after having been asked where a secret service airplane would be parked castillo charley said whatever close enough the arm is out for a guy who would probably ask about a secret service airplane the officer said then he looked at the sergeant they want him over at the unit the unit turned out to be a small building at the end of one of the parking lots the sergeant opened the rear door of the patrol car for charley and after charley grabbed his gear from the trunk led him into the building it was charley saw a small police station there was a deskan elevated platformmanned by a sergeant and a corporal and on one side of the room there were two holding cells the bars were made of chainlink fence but since the cells were in sight of the desk sergeant it was unlikely that a prisoner could get through them unnoticed joel isaacson the supervisory secret service agent in charge of secretary halls security detail was leaning against the makeshift desk charley walked toward him with the highway sergeant on his heels when isaacson saw charley he smiled then bent his head slightly toward the voiceactivated microphone under his lapel tom he said don juan just walked in here castillo wondered how unlikely it was that the highway sergeant when reporting the successful delivery of the passenger to the airport would fail to mention that he had been met by some kind of a federal agent probably secret service who referred to him as don juan hey charley isaacson said good timing i dont think ive been here five minutes your flying chariot awaits i didnt expect to see you joel castillo said as they shook hands the fbi came through with that dossier the boss asked for isaacson said on your new friend castillo nodded the boss wants you to read it on our way to where were going im to bring it back okay and youre in luck the suitcase you left on the airplane the last time you were on it charley searched his memory christ i left my gorightnow bag on the secretarys airplane the day i met the president and he gave me this job the day fernando picked me up in his new lear and flew me to texas to see abuela jesus id forgotten all about it how long ago was that it seems like last year but it was really only a couple of weeks ago less than two weeks thirteen days its still on the plane joel said i tagged it inspected thanks it could have been a bomb charley isaacson said youre lucky somebody didnt take it to the end of the runway at andrews and blow it up i forgot to tell anyone i left it on board charley said im not sore at you don juan thanks a lot joel the sergeant here might have missed don juan the first time egg is on my face dont tell the boss of course not you about ready to go anytime charley said he turned to the highway patrol sergeant thanks for the ride i appreciate it no problem the sergeant said and then looked at isaacson why do you call him that don juan can i ask isaacson smiled then made an exaggerated search of the room with his eyes i dont see any members of the gentle sex who might take offense so why not take a look at him sergeant nicelooking guy young not married lives very well meets a lot of interesting women would you suspect that he gets laid a lot the highway patrol sergeant chuckled i thought it was probably something like that he said seven on board cessna citation x nc flight level feet near raleigh north carolina june did you read this charley castillo asked raising his eyes from the personnel file of kennedy howard c each page of which was stamped secret in red joel isaacson and tom mcguire were in the rear of the cabin both lying nearly horizontally in fully reclined seats and both holding a bottle of beer and both nodded i decided i had the need to know mcguire said mock serious isaacson smiled somethings missing castillo said or im missing something isaacson raised his right eyebrow but again said nothing the fbis been leaning on meor the bossto tell them where he is and hes really worried that i will uhhuh isaacson agreed theres nothing in here that explains that charley said and theres nothing in here about a warrant or an indictment anything like that whats going on whys it classified secret its just a personnel record confidential maybe but secret theres a story going around that the fbi internal phone book is classified secret tom mcguire said theyre big on keeping things to themselves what does it say he did for the fbi isaacson asked castillo dropped his eyes to the file again he was assistant special agent in charge of the professional standards unit castillo read what the hell is that its what the cops call internal affairs mcguire said think about it charley you mean he was involved with dirty fbi agents there is no such thing as a dirty fbi agent isaacson said im surprised you a supervisory special agent of the secret service dont know that mcguire laughed castillo didnt think they resented his having secret service identification but sometimes they needled him castillo gave isaacson the finger what about their counterintelligence guy who was on the russians payroll they couldnt deny that one mcguire said the cia bagged him think of him as the exception that proves the rule i never said with tom as my witness what im about to say isaacson said okay okay castillo said i of course dont know what im talking about but let me throw this scenario at you isaacson said it probably goes all the way back to j edgar hoover but the basic philosophy of the fbi is protect the fbi closely followed by make the fbi look good and never do or admit anything that could in any way make the fbi look bad esta claro mi amigo castillo nodded smiling with that in mind they dont call their internal affairs unit internal affairs to have an internal affairs unit would be an admission that there was a possibility however remote that there might be from time to time one or twomaybe even threefbi agents who are not absolutely one hundred percent squeaky clean and perfect in every way on the other hand it has to be faced that there are from time to time some agents whose behavior might not meet in every detail the professional standards expected of everyone in the fbi hence the professional standards unit to root these miscreants out and do so very quietly you dont like the fbi much do you joel like every other rightthinking patriotic american i hold the fbi in the highest possible regard i am simply unable to accept any suggestion that any fbi agent would ever do anything wrong tom mcguire chuckled okay so what are you thinking joel read the file charley the fbi put your pal kennedy on the fast track from the time he left quantico he was always assigned some place importanthe was never in someplace like the cornhole kansas field office he was in new york la dallas with frequent tours in washington he was good i could tell that on the phone excuse me in your apartment when he called i answered the telephone hello he asked charley i said whos calling please and he hung up he smelled a copmaybe an fbi agentanswering your phone he called back five minutes latertime enough to leave wherever he was calling from and to get on a cellular that would be hard to trace okay charley said so again i dont know what im talking about but heres a possibility your pal kennedy was assignedas a very bright absolutely trustworthy member of the fbi palace guardto professional standards where he got to know where all the bodies are buried not all of the miscreants professional standards catches with their hands in the petty cash draweror in the drawers of somebody elses wifeget prosecuted or even canned why not the higher they are on the fbi pyramid the more embarrassing it is for the fbi to haul them before the bar of justice may i go on certainly im not sure how much of this i believe but its interesting well then fuck you charley my lips are now sealed you cant leave me hanging like this joel isaacson made him wait long enough for charley to think ill be damned he is going to stop before he went on with whatever they did hanging over their heads the powers that be can trust them to behave that works fine as long as the guyguyswho know what they did are in the fbi but your pal is no longer with the bureau is he he now works for a russian bad guy but he can still use the same lever to how do i put this gain the cooperation of a lot of people in the bureau for his ends which are not necessarily in the best interests of the fbi okay so what charley asked why is kennedy so worried that theyll be able to locate him mcguire made a pistol with his hand and said bang oh come on tom charley said accidents happen isaacson said people get run over by hitandrun drivers fall off balconies etcetera jesus christ they mean it watch your ears back there the pilots voice came over the cabin speaker i finally got cleared to make an approach to pope its going to be steep the nose of the airplane immediately dipped in his mind charley saw the altimeter unwinding and the digital airspeed indicator on the glass panel beginning to flash red as they approached maximum safe speed eight pope air force base north carolina june the copilot of the citation came out of the cockpit as soon as the aircraft was safely on the ground and stood by the door prepared to open it the moment the aircraft stopped the pilot obviously wanted to get airborne again as quickly as possible so long as the citation was transporting charley it wasnt available to secretary hall when the citation stopped on the tarmac in front of base operations the copilot immediately opened the door charley went down the steps carrying his laptop computer briefcase and the suitcase hed brought from philadelphia and joel isaacson followed him off the airplane with the gorightnow bag handed it to charley affectionately punched him on the shoulder and got back on the airplane charley hung the laptops strap around his neck picked up the two suitcases and with the laptop bumping him uncomfortably with each step walked toward the double glass doors of base operations before he got there the citation was just visible as it approached the threshold of the active runway and as charley pushed through the doors with his back he saw the citation turn onto the runway without stopping and begin its takeoff roll charley wondered again why it was so important that he come to fort bragg right now that hall had sent the plane for him the only thing he could think of was that otherwise it would have taken him forever to get here on an airline there was an air force sergeant on duty behind the base operations counter im going to need a ride over to the special warfare center charley announced you just get off that citation yes i did you military good question who am i the special assistant to the secretary of homeland security a supervisory special agent of the secret service major c g castillo of the us army or maybe a drug enforcement agency agent which is what i told bettys brother just before he offered to break both my legs yes i am charley told the sergeant ill need to see some identification sir the sergeant said and your orders where the hell is my army identification in the lid of the laptop briefcase where i put it when i went to germany and i am not going to take it out now and give the sergeant something interesting to tell the boys not possible sergeant sorry charley said would you call the duty officer at swc and tell him that major castillo needs a ride over there they expect me i really have to see some identification sir that wasnt a suggestion sergeant call the swc sir this is sergeant lefler at pope base ops i have a gentleman here who doesnt have any identification but says hes a major castillo and that you expect him fifteen seconds later after repeating castillos name the sergeant almost triumphantly turned to castillo and said they never heard of you sir let me talk to him please charley said the sergeant didnt reply instead dialing a number from memory sir i hate to bother you he said a moment later but i think you better come down here we may have an attempted breach of security a moment later he added no sir not to worry and then hung up sir would you please have a seat over there he said to charley pointing to a row of chromeandplastic chairs whats going on sergeant sir the airdrome officer of the day is on his way here he will answer any questions you might have please take a seat sir the sergeant rested his hand on the holster hanging from his pistol belt what the hell is going on here they dont expect me charley walked to the row of chairs and sat down fuck it ill give him something to talk about sergeant could i walk over there and get into my briefcase please you just sit right there please sir the sergeant replied you can talk about your briefcase to the major when he gets here sir the telephone on the desk rang without taking his eyes from castillo the sergeant answered it pope base operations sergeant lefler speaking sir sir the aod is not here at the moment he should be here in a couple of minutes sir would you like to call back sir there already has been a civilian citation in here it just left yes sir a man did get off he doesnt have any identification sir but he says hes a major i dont think id better do that sir until the aod gets here he may let you talk to him no sir i dont know who im talking to you didnt give me your name the sergeant looked stricken at the response he was given an air force major a pilot wearing the brassard of an airdrome officer of the day came into the area charley suspected the airdrome officer of the day had been catching a few winks on a cot somewhere near whats going on sergeant he asked sir i think you better take this the sergeant said extending the telephone to him its the deputy commander of eighteenth airborne corps the major took the telephone this is major treward sir the aod how may i help you sir the major looked at castillo excuse me sir are you the special assistant to the secretary of homeland security castillo nodded yes sir hes right here the major said and extended the telephone to castillo sir sergeant lefler said he told me he was an army major this is major castillo sir charley said into the telephone see he just did it again sir sergeant lefler told the aod thats me too sir charley said into the phone im assigned to homeland security yes sir i just arrived here on the secretarys plane my orders are to report to general mcnab he wouldnt show me any orders either major sergeant lefler said i asked yes sir ill be here charley said into the telephone thank you sir he handed the telephone to the air force major the general is coming to pick me up sir the security sop says nobody leaves the building without proper identification sergeant lefler announced the major looked at him but didnt respond what id like to know is how a civilian aircraft landed here without special permission and why i wasnt told it had he said to the desk sergeant the pilot filed his flight plan as secret service one charley offered that gets him clearance to land just about any place he wants to are you in the secret service the major asked actually im a supervisory agent of the secret service wanna see my badge charley chuckled it was almost a giggle i say something funny no all i am major is another major major general h v gonzalez who was about fivefootfive oliveskinned weighed no more than pounds and looked meaner than hell marched purposefully into base operations ten minutes later trailed by his aide and a full colonel both of whom were well over six feet tall they were all wearing desert camouflage battle dress uniforms bdus the deputy commander of xviii airborne corps glanced around the room and then marched to where castillo was sitting charley got up quickly as he approached youre castillo yes sir general gonzalez switched to spanish the name elaine naylor mean anything to you si senor and whats her husbands first name allan senor but we are not privileged to call him by his first name are we im not sir general naylor tells me youre a texmex from san antone who speaks pretty good spanish and works for the secretary of homeland security and that he doesnt have a clue why dr natalie cohen called me up to tell me the president was sending you here that about sum things up si senor harry the general said switching to english to speak to his aide help major castillo with his bags there was a powder blue plymouth caravan parked outside the base operations building you ride up front with me general gonzalez ordered in spanish as he got behind the wheel si senor charley replied what was that chinese fire drill back there all about gonzalez asked my fault sir i asked the sergeant to call swc to get me a ride theyd never heard of me and then i couldnt come up with my army id why did you call the swc didnt they tell you general mcnab is the eighteenth airborne corps commander unless stupidity is an excuse sir no excuse when general mcnab was deputy commander of swc i was his aide i called there not bright oh so you know general mcnab yes sir sir where is he i dont think you have the need to know that sir knowing general mcnab as i do im guessing hes as close to the gray fox operation at abeche as he can get id love to know how you heard about abeche general gonzalez said most of the people at bragg who know about it are in the backseat sir the operation was to confirm intel i developed and if youre asking sir was it confirmed yes sir it was the missing airplane was there but has gone okay if you know that much youre in the loop general mcnab is in menara morocco with some more gray fox people standing by with a c in case anything goes wrong with the extraction which is scheduled for first light as soon as he hears its wheelsup he and the backup team will return here in their c its about a fivehour flight thank you sir the problem i have right now is what to do with you sir until i talked to general naylor twenty minutes ago i expected some civilian vip the lights in the windows of the vip guesthouse are burning for you major castillo how about dropping me at a smoke bomb hill boq sir no the last thing we need is another chinese fire drill when you cant produce an id card well take you to the vip guesthouse just dont tell anyone youre a major yes sir the general drove through fort bragg for several minutes before saying anything else then he said there are a lot of lousy jobs in the army but right at the head of the list has to be aidedecamp to scotty mcnab thats probably even worse than being his deputy commander i tried to think of it as an educational experience sir general gonzalez laughed harry did you hear that yes sir write it down yes sir harry i want you to stay with major castillo give him a drink and then send him to bed he looks wornout and i suspect tomorrow is going to be very educational yes sir chapter xiv one fort bragg north carolina june the vip suite into which castillo was installed had a bedroom a sitting room with a small dining room table at one side a small office and a kitchenette it was about twothirds the size of his apartment in the mayflower it also came with a young sergeant in a crisply pressed desert camouflage battle dress uniform can i have the sergeant fix you something to drink sir general gonzalezs aidedecamp asked he was a captain his name tag said brewster he had a cib and senior parachutists wings sewn above his pocket and there was a ranger tab sewn to his sleeve above the xviii airborne corps shoulder insignia but his beret was blackas general gonzalezs beret had been castillo rememberedso neither captain brewster nor general gonzalez was special forces green beanies wore green berets of which they were justifiably proud what color beret does general mcnab wear these days black or green whatever color pleases him obviously no castillo said what you can do is point me in the direction of the booze and send the sergeant home yes sir the aide said not quite able to conceal his surprise at castillos abruptness castillo picked up on it jesus christ whats the matter with me sergeant ive had a bad day castillo said what im going to do is have one drink and then get in bed theres no sense in you sticking around for that yes sir the sergeant asked sir what are your breakfast plans nothing beyond a cup of coffee is there a coffee machine in the kitchen yes sir but id be happy is there someplace i can call you if i need you the number of the protocol office is taped to the telephones sir if you need anything thank you sergeant castillo said and smiled at him when the sergeant had gone castillo looked at captain brewster i didnt mean to snap at the sergeant castillo said im sure theres no problem sir captain brewster said i can fix myself a drink and get in bed by myself captain castillo said theres no reason for you to stick around either i can stick around outside the suite if that would make you more comfortable sir but but general gonzalez said stay with him right yes sir castillo walked into the small kitchen where he had seen a line of bottles on a counter under the closets i know how that is i been dere done dat got duh tshirt castillo said captain brewster smiled you want one of these castillo asked holding up a bottle of scotch i better not as one dog robber to another i wont tell your general dog robber general mcnab told me when i was wearing the rope castillo said touching his shoulder where the aiguillette of aidesdecamp hung from the epaulets of dress uniforms that when he had worn the rope as a young officer aidesdecamp were known as dog robbers because they were expected to do whatever was required including robbing from dogs to make their general happy i never heard that brewster said smiling then he nodded at the bottle castillo was holding okay why not thank you castillo poured whiskey in a glass and handed it to him how long were you general mcnabs aide brewster asked too long charley said twentytwo months long enough to know that when he finds out i spent the night in the vip quarters he will have something unpleasant to say brewster chuckled how about you its supposed to be for a year brewster said another two months and then castillo said handing him a glass of whiskey i suppose theres ice and water but i drink mine neat neats fine brewster said then added i put in for special forces maybe ill get lucky and make the cut castillos cellular phone rang hello there was a buzz and then a click castillo put the telephone back in his shirt pocket bad connection captain brewster asked no that was probably from a renegade fbi agent who works for a russian arms dealer who wants a to know where i am and b that i be impressed with his ability to find that out castillo nodded and said ill bet it rings again in a minute he pressed the timer button on his watch and then tipped glasses with brewster then he took the telephone out again and pressed an autodial button screw kennedy when he calls back my voice mail can answer and i bet he wont leave a message even to let me know he knows where i am yes the womans voice answered is this my favorite female law enforcement officer not now call back in ten minutes sergeant betty schneider replied curtly is something wrong castillo asked even as he spoke the words he knew she had broken the connection and he was speaking to a dead telephone what the hell has something gone wrong with dick favorite female law enforcement officer captain harry brewster asked with a knowing smile the look captain brewster got from major castillo told him he had crossed a dangerous line castillo took a sip of his drink the last thing i need is liquor my brain is already slipping gears jesus i called the swc instead of xviii airborne corps on the other hand as keyed up as i am ill never get to sleep tonight without a little sauce to slow me down and even if dick is at this moment being roasted over a slow fire by the african american lunatics in philadelphia there is not a goddamned thing i can do about it in fort bragg he took another sip and had just taken the glass from his lips when the telephone rang again he snatched it almost angrily from his pocket yeah your phone has been out of service howard kennedy said arent you going to tell me where i am that tells me you are probably no longer in philadelphia where are you somewhere over north carolina i would guess using one of those backoftheseat tendollarsaminute telephones youre not going to tell me where you are what are you doing somewhere over north carolina going somewhere cancun actually kennedy said okay now its your turn since i dont know that hes actually in an airplane en route to mexico and may have been in touch with his friends in the wireless telephone business and is entirely capable ofentirely likely to see if im lying to him its truth time would you believe the vip guest quarters at fort bragg north carolina howard of course since we have agreed to be entirely truthful with one another what the hell are you doing in fort bragg do you have something you want to share with me he seems genuinely surprised or is it that hes almost as skilled a liar as i am the answer to question one is that im here because my boss sent me here he has not seen fit to explain his reasons and no i dont have anything much to share with you millers still in philadelphia meeting with undercover cops i dont know whatif anythinghes come up with but i should hear something soon if i do how do i pass it on to you i never tried to call anybody on an airliner before neither have i kennedy said but to demonstrate my faith in your veracitytaking a hell of a big chance in other words which i really hate to doim on mexicana newark to mexico city if you hear anything give it a try charley this is the age of miraculous communication if that doesnt workand im not met in mexico city by representatives of my former employerill call you from the airport if anybody meets you i didnt send them boy scouts honor were you a boy scout certainly werent you i am now holding my pinky with my thumb the other fingers extended vertically my arm raised to shoulder level castillo said as he did so captain brewster who could not hear the conversation but as an eagle scout himself knew the gesture looked curiously at him as one boy scout to another i accept your word of honor kennedy said does that mean youre also going to tell me why youre going to cancun i thought youd never ask kennedy said do you know where khartoum is charley theres a ktown in sudan youre halfway to your world geography merit badge how about murtala muhammad international airport youve got me there charley confessed after a moment lagos nigeria write that down is there a point to this quiz a bearing the paint scheme of air surinameyou dont happen to know where suriname is do you charley upper right corner of south america not quite the upperright corner a little down the coast from the upperright corner but you got the continent right you were saying an air suriname landed at ndjamena chad after a flight from khartoum took on fuellots of fuelfiled a flight plan to murtala muhammad international airport which you now know is the airport serving lagos nigeria and took off he paused to let that register then added it never got to murtala muhammad international okay i follow but kennedy ignored the interruption and continued even more fascinating than that is the friendly folks in khartoum tell us they have no record of air suriname having visited their airfield in the last six months charley gestured almost frantically to captain brewster miming writing brewster quickly took a small notebook and a ballpoint pen from a shoulder pocket of his bdu and handed it to him so you think its the one were looking for charley said as he hurriedly scribbled air suriname and the flight number in the notebook i think it probably merits further investigation kennedy said sarcastically wouldnt you agree absolutely you dont happen to have the registration number ppapa zzero fiverzerofiverniner castillo scribbled pz in the notebook ill pass this right on he said thanks you will tell them where it came from wont you what if youre wrong ill take that chance charley hes serious about that he must believe what hes telling me or wants me to believe hes serious any idea where it really went theres any number of airfields on the west coast or africa some of them even sophisticated enough to have paved runways and navigation aids if i had to guess id say yundum international yumdum castillo blurted yundum why you en dum no bee after dum where the hell is that outside banjul you know that charming metropolis im sure come on howard how about gambia you do know where gambia is dont you west coast of africa next to senegal kennedy said banjul is maybe a hundred miles down the coast from dakar why there its a pretty good jumpingoff place if you want to fly across the ocean cross it to where castillo asked there was no response castillo thought he detected a change in the background hiss cross it to where he asked again then added you still there howard there was nothing but the hiss damn charley said and pushed the hangup key he sensed captain brewsters eyes on him cut off castillo explained and then pushed the autodial key for betty schneider again yeah her voice came matteroffactly over the cellular is everything all right charley asked there was no reply for a moment and then dick miller came on the line theres a connection miller said you all right ive decided i dont want to be an undercover cop but otherwise im fine youre sure im fine charley what kind of a connection right now i just know that theyre going to bring the undercover cop in i dont really know what that means but its apparently damned hard to do but if i get something concrete i dont want to tell you over a cellular i think you better get up here charley betty tell you where i am yeah i was ordered here dick castillo said im not sure i can come back up there not tonight anyway jesus i dont know how id get there ill get back to you if its really important call secretary hall itll wait until you know for sure you cant get up here miller said ill get back to you dick castillo said and ended the call he pushed the autodial key for secretary hall then changed his mind broke off the call and turned to captain brewster whats general mcnabs eta here brewster obviously didnt want to answer the question and when he said i really dont know sir it was equally obvious that he was lying in the van on the way over here charley snapped general whatsisname said something about everybody in the van being in on the abeche gray fox operation meaning you are i really dont have the time to fuck with you brewster now give me mcnabs eta or get general whatsisname on the horn for me brewster met his eyes for a moment then shrugged its general gonzalez major general mcnaband the backup forcewill be airborne over morocco in the globemaster at midnight bragg time thats abeche time the extraction from abeche is scheduled for daybreak abeche time twelve after midnight here if the general gets a successful wheelsup report he plans to head directly back here if something goes wrong in abeche if nothing goes wrong then he should be on the ground here at about thank you charley said and pressed the autodial key for secretary hall again charley sir im sorry im calling so late i heard you were at bragg any word about general mcnab hell probably be back here about six in the morning sir see what he has to say and call me as soon as you can yes sir there have been two developments sir lets have them i heard from my friend kennedy he believes the is headed for someplace in south america if its not already there it was in ndjamena chad took on a load of fuel and filed a flight plan to murtala muhammad international airportlagos nigeriaand took off it never landed there does it have the range to make it across the atlantic from ndjamena secretary hall interrupted it might if those fuel bladders were installed charley said i just dont know kennedy thinks it probably went to yundum international in gambia where on the west coast of africa about a hundred miles south of dakar senegal he say why there kennedy said its a convenient jumpingoff place to cross the atlantic to south america which i suspect means he knowsprobably from experiencethat they dont ask too many questions of transient aircraft he doesnt know or wouldnt tell you where the airplane is headed i think if he knew he would have told me he did tell me that its been painted with the color scheme of air suriname so it may be going there operative word may i have the new registration numbers let me have them wait til i get something to write with charley covered the microphone with the heel of his hand and turned to captain brewster when you report this conversation to general gonzalezand that had better be on your agendaim talking to my boss matthew hall the secretary of homeland security how much have you been able to overhear brewster looked uncomfortable but said most of it okay charley halls voice came faintly but clearly over the cellular lets have the numbers you said air suriname right yes sir the numbers are pas in papa zas in zero fiverzerofiverniner peezeefiftyfiftynine yes sir ill get this to the cia right away maybe now that we have the registration numbers their satellites may have a location on the plane sir i just talked to miller he said hes come up with connections plural in philadelphia he say what they were we dont have secure phones sir he thinks i ought to hear what hes got in person id like to go back up there we need to know for sure what general mcnab found out sir what i was thinking was talk to general mcnab then go to philadelphia it would take you all day to go up there and back charley and i agree with the secretary of defense that you should be at bragg whatever happens it will involve gray fox maybe all of delta you should be there if for no other purpose than staying in the loopand keeping me in it yes sir i agree and i agree going commercial wouldnt work it would take too long and were running out of time but yes we are hall interrupted at four tomorrow afternoon the police commissioners going to tell the mayor what he knows i dont even like to think whats going to happen when he does yes sir but if i had a plane i could get up to philadelphia and be back in a matter of hours i need my plane here hall said evenly answering the question he expected next thats why it barely did more than a touchandgo when it dropped you at bragg i can get a planeim almost sure i canbut what i need is permission for it to land at pope what are you talking about renting a plane yourself no sir my family has an airplane i canpresuming its not down for maintenance or somethingjust borrow it you think its important yes sir i do i also may need it to meet with kennedy where is he i dont know sir charley replied comfortable in the fact that he did not know for certain if kennedy was telling the truth about being en route to mexico city and that it was always better to pass only information that had been confirmed but i expect another call at any time im going to have to give the fbi this latest bulletin and when i do theyre going to ask where kennedy is im glad i really dont know sir okay charley ill call secretary beiderman and have him get landing clearance for you thank you wait a minute charley i just thought theres probably oneor moreof those army beechcraft king airs cs charley furnished at fort bragg i can have beiderman arrange for you to use one for that matter i can probably just as easily have beiderman get you a small air force jet sir that would cause problems starting with talk and id really rather have what the cops would call an unmarked airplane but is your familys airplane fast enough the clock is ticking yes sir its a learjet xr castillo heard hall exhale youre going to borrow your familys learjet xr every time i think theres nothing else you could tell me that could possibly surprise me you do okay charley do it your way you better give me the registration numbers jesus i dont know charley said and then corrected himself immediately yeah i do i flew it into baltimore just before i went to angola fiveohsevenfive learjet xr fiveohsevenfive hall repeated anything else charley im going to see if i cant borrow some gray fox radios charley said the secure kind i can have beiderman arrange that too if you want i think the gray fox people who have themor i hope do have themwould probably stall even him until mcnab okayed it charley said let me see how far i get by myself your call are you running into any kind of hassle with anyone down there i thought i picked up no sir general gonzalez even loaned me his aide to see that i get whatever i think i need he looked at captain brewster as he spoke okay keep me in the loop charley yes sir of course he broke that connection and pushed another autodial number maria he said a moment later in spanish this is carlos i realize its late and i hope i didnt wake you up but i really have to talk to fernando he saw the surprise on captain brewsters face at the spanish and wondered how much spanish gonzalezs aide knew he probably speaks it or at least has been trying hard to learn it a wise move considering his general is named gonzalez and he likes to speak spanish whats up gringo fernando lopez sounding sleepy asked fernando i need the lear castillo said there was a just perceptible hesitation before fernando replied as long as you deal with the lawyers and the irs gringo youre welcome to it you know that i mean i need it right now tonight the hesitation was more evident this time you want to tell me why fernando asked how soon can you find a pilot to fly it here wheres here the last i heard from you you were on your way to africa im at fort bragg welcome home gringo how was the dark continent hey im not fooling around i need you to find a pilot and have it brought up here jesus christ do you know what time it is yeah i do this is important but youre not going to tell me why and leave your jeppesen case in it im presuming youve got approach charts for mexico yeah ive got them until the lawyers screamed i was going to take the family to cozumel and call it a proficiency flight what the hell are you going to be doing in mexico just do what i ask for the third or fourth fucking time fernando this is important okay okay if you dont hear from me in an houryour cellular is up and running charley replied by giving him the number i have that number fernando said if you dont hear from me in an hour you can presume the lear is wheelsup for fort bragg which i just realized is a restricted zone and i dont think they allow civilian airplanes to land at pope air force base what to do about that the planell be cleared for the restricted area and to land at pope have the pilot give them his eta and ill meet him and get him a ride into fayetteville you better give him some money too i havent had a chance to cash a check lately jesus christ gringo this better be important i think youve just destroyed my happy marriage im sorry fernando but its important right the line went dead in fernandos ear charley turned to captain brewster were going to need wheels he said i can probably get the staff duty officers van brewster replied where do you want to go out to the stockade now sir now and i think it would be better if iwehad our own wheels major i just dont know call the motor pool identify yourself as general gonzalezs aide and tell them to send a car or a pickup a vansomethinghere right now and call delta force and have them have the senior officer present meet me at the stockade in twenty minutes major alternatively captain get general gonzalez on the phone i told you before i just dont have time to fuck with you without waiting for an answer castillo picked up his laptop briefcase and the gorightnow bag and carried them into the bedroom he was not going to try to talk the deltagray fox communications officer out of mr aloysius francis caseys latest communication jewels while he was dressed in his washington middlelevel bureaucrats grayblack suit as he unzipped the gorightnow bag he heard captain brewster on the telephone this is captain brewster general gonzalezs aide i need a van and driver right now at the vip guesthouse among other things the gorightnow bag held a very carefully folded class a uniform he hated it itand the shirt that went with the tunic and trouserswere sewn from miracle fabrics that didnt pick up unwanted creases but the byproduct of that convenience was that he itched wherever the material touched his skin if he had the damn thing on for more than six hours he could count on having a rash around his neck and on his calves and thighs and the miracle fabrics did not absorb perspiration as cotton and wool did after wearing it a couple of hours he smelled as if he hadnt had a shower for a couple of days that thought as he held up the uniform to confirm that it indeed did look amazing crisp triggered the thought that a lot had happened since he had taken a shower in the warwick hotel early that morning he took fresh linen and the gorightnow toilet kit from the gorightnow bag stripped off the clothing he was wearing and marched naked into the bathroom five minutes later freshly showered and shavedhe had shaved under the shower a timesaving trick hed learned at west pointhe replaced the razor in the toilet kit and saw the ring that testified to his graduation from hudson high with the class of he slipped it on ninety seconds after that he was sitting on the bed lacing up his highly polished jump boots and ninety seconds after that after having walked back into the bath in the unfamiliarly heavy boots he was examining himself in the fulllength mirror on the back of the door something was missing and after a moment he understood what he went back to the gorightnow bag and took out his green beret then he took one more check in the mirror he thought okay major carlos g castillo highly decorated special forces officer all decked out in his incredibly natty class a uniform is prepared to try to talk the deltagray fox commo officer out of his best radios then he had a second thought shit my id card is still in the lid of the laptop briefcase and im going to have to have it otherwise im likely to get myself arrested for impersonating an officer he had the lid open and was extracting his id card when captain brewster knocked on the jamb of the open door sir a van is on the way and lieutenant colonel fortinot will be at the delta compound when we get there good castillo said and smiled at him that was a quick change brewster said i also do card tricks castillo said two police administration building th and race streets philadelphia pennsylvania june two detectives one a very slim tall white man the other a very large african american came out of the roundhouse and walked purposefully to an unmarked crown victoria which had just pulled up to the entrance the slim white man opened the rear door and got in beside the african american in the backseat face the other door and put your hands behind you he ordered matteroffactly as he produced a set of handcuffs is this necessary major h richard miller jr asked as he complied no i just do it for laughs the detective said as the cuffs clicked closed then he put his hand on millers wrists and halfpulled halfhelped him back out of the rear seat as soon as miller was on his feet the slim detective put his hand firmly on millers left arm while the large detective put his hand even more firmly on millers right arm and they marched him into the roundhouse miller expected that he would be led into the entrance foyer of the roundhouse and then to the elevator bank as he his father and charley castillo had entered the building when theyd gone to see commissioner kellogg instead he was marched to the right through a procession of corridors through a room lined with holding cells and finally down another corridor to an elevator door guarded by a uniformed police officer you just shut the fuck up the larger detective snarled and pushed millers arm although miller hadnt said a word the cop at the elevator shook his head in understanding and put a key in the elevator control panel the door opened and miller was almost pushed inside the door closed keep to yourself whatever you want to say until we get to homicide the larger detective said conversationally you never know whos liable to get on the elevator the elevator stopped the door opened and a black woman pushed a mop bucket onto elevator looked without expression at everyone then pushed the button for the fourth floor when the door opened again miller was halfpushed off and then down a curved corridor to a door marked homicide bureau and then pushed through that inside there was a railing the slim detective reached over it pushed what was apparently a solenoid release and then pushed the gate in the railing open inside a door just past the railing was a large deskcluttered room against the interior wall were a halfdozen doors three of them with interview room signs on them miller was pushed into the center of these sergeant betty schneider and a black man wearing a dark blue robe sandals and with his hair braided with beads were sitting on a table the last time miller had seen the man who was an undercover counterterrorism bureau detective was three hours before in a room in a brickedup row house in north philadelphia there hadnt been much light but there had been enough for miller to decide the undercover cop was a meanlooking sonofabitch seeing him in the brightly lit interview room confirmed his first assessment the man with the beadbraided hair examined miller carefully what the hell why not he didnt get a good look at me either there was a steel captains chair firmly bolted to the floor it had a pair of handcuffs clipped to it one half open and waiting to attach an interviewee to the chair miller felt his handcuffs being unlocked and then removed thanks john sergeant schneider said to the black detective anybody see him everybody in detention plus a cleaning woman who rolled her bucket onto the elevator she may even have really been on her way to mop up the fourth floor the detective left the room and closed the door if you promise to behave the man with the beaded braids said we wont cuff you to the chair there was a faint hint of a smile on his face miller smiled back at him but didnt say anything the homicide detectives left the interview room schneider tells me youre an army officer a major the detective with the beadbraided hair said thats right jack britton the man with the braided hair said extending his hand aka ali abd arraziq what do i call you suit yourself where are you from miller ali abd arraziq asked here philly miller nodded you dont sound like it you sound like a reading nigger ill be a sonofabitch i have family in reading miller said coldly on my mothers side neither they or me like that term i dont even know what it means betty said sergeant schneider im disappointed ali abd arraziq said word is that you know everything about everything he paused smiled and went on to make you conversant with a little afroamerican history not usually found in history books reading was one of the termini of the underground railroad of fame and legend a number of the slaves who made it out of the south stayed there and became truly integrated they even picked up pennsylvania dutch accents started eating scrapple etcetera they went to school college started businesses joined the army etcetera etcetera and soon having made it began to look down their noses at other african americans hey miller protested the man with the braided hair raised his palm to shut him off and went on the reason i know all this is my fathers family are reading niggers ill bet the major and i have acquaintances in common you dont happen to be kin to a general miller do you hes my father miller said see britton said your father and my father are friends ill be damned betty schneider said if youre not nice sergeant the major and i will start speaking dutch and leave you in the dark you do speak dutch dont you major only what i learned listening to my mother when we went to the reading terminal market to buy stuff from the amish miller said whered you go to school the man with the braided hair asked in the german patois known as pennsylvania dutch whered you get your commission west point miller said yeah sure the man with the braided hair said switching back to english of course your fathers a west pointer miller nodded so what did you learn about islam when you were at west point what is this a quiz that was opening your mouth before engaging your brain watch it richard you cant afford to piss off ali abd arraziq aka detective jack britton before i start to tell you about the lunatics it would help to know how much you know about islam save us both time i learned zilch at the military academy miller said but after i started to read give me three minutes of what you learned the man with the braided hair said youre serious right the man with the braided hair nodded where was muhammad born for example when in into the quraysh tribe in mecca and the quran where did that come from the angel gabriel gave it to himthe first part of itin a cave on mount hira in then he started playing prophet something like joseph smith the angel moroni and the mormons right britton asked smiling i thought about that miller said smiling back whats the definition of islam submission to god miller said a muslim is someone whos done that like a bornagain baptist right you a bornagain christian miller im presbyterian pity if you were a bornagain christian it might help you understand something about how some guy raised in north philadelphia in a house like the one where we met who converted to muslim from say the holy ghost first church of christ african feels about islam miller didnt reply whats the first and great commandment for a muslim britton asked there is no god but god allah and muhammad is his prophet and the pillars of faith theres five miller said one is reciting the creedthere is no god but god etcetera the second is daily prayersformal prayers with the forehead touching the ground third is fasting during ramadan whats ramadan britton interrupted the ninth month of the muslim calendar last yearit started in october the fifth of october i think britton made a give me more gesture it lasts a lunar month miller went on no eating drinking smoking or sex during the day it starts when you can tell a white thread from a black thread by daylight and ends at nightfall with a prayer and a meal called iftar and then starts up again the next morning britton nodded at him and the fourth pillar he asked almsgiving the fifth is making a pilgrimage to mecca britton nodded again tell me about jihad he said holy war miller said to take over territories countries which are ruled by nonmuslims this is new right something dreamed up recently by belligerent ragheads and having really nothing to do with the gentle teachings of the prophet himself no it goes all the way back to muhammad by the time he died in jihad saw the muslims in control of the arabian peninsula in the next hundred years jihad had taken islam all over the middle east from afghanistan to spain okay britton said the pop quiz is over youre not exactly an islamic scholar but neither are you wholly ignorant of who youre dealing with like most people ive met in your line of work my line of work the army you mean no intelligence counterterrorism you may be a soldier but youre not here to line your troops up and march down broad street im hereas i told you in that house off broad streetbecause we have reason to believe that a group of somalian terrorists have stolen a with the intention of crashing it into the liberty bell and further we have reason to believe that there may be a connection with somehow do i say this native philadelphian muslims can we get to that you said you knew something you see the movie black hawk down read the book mogadishu miller nodded both were right on the money do i tell britton that the black hawk belonged to the th special forces aviation regiment and that first lieutenant richard h miller jr was flying black hawks in somalia for the th at the time a guy on the philadelphia inquirer wrote the book britton said so i understand he did a good job when that happened when they dragged the bodies of the american soldiers through the streets the reaction of some of the lunatics here was that it was the will of allah about time right on brother that shock you miller shook his head and right away some of the local lunatic mullahswho have no more idea where they come from in africa than you or i dostarted claiming they were from somalia pure bullshit of course to impress the brothers and then because that seemed to work they embellished the story they had contacts with somalia they said and wemeaning the mullahshave to go over there we had a series of fundraisers some of them your standard church chicken supper all proceeds to the cause and some your standard knock over the local grocery store your friendly neighborhood drug dealer and hooker etcetera and they came up with the money for the plane tickets got passports and went you tell anybody about this i turned in a report a couple of weeks later the fbi wanted to talk to me so i got myself arresteddid this routineand two guys from the fbi talked to mein this interview room come to think of itand i told them what was going down and they laughed and said one the aals couldnt get into somalia and two even if they could the somalians would not only not talk to the wannabes but would probably cut their throats and steal whatever they were carrying so what happened off the aals went they said to somalia you sound as if you dont believe they actually went what the fbi said made sense to me none of these wannabes speak arabic much less somali i figured they wouldnt get any further than kenya or ethiopia where they would find out what somalia was really like and decide it was the will of allah to whoop it up with the local hookers instead of actually going there who would know they hadnt gone or they would actually try to go there and get knocked over by some really professional bad guys so what actually happened i dont know britton said right about that time my wife was about to have our first son so i did almost a year in the pennsylvania correctional facility in camp hill excuse me i was picked up on an armed robbery charge pleabargained it down to four years and was sent to the state slam at camp hill near harrisburg when i was a bad boy which was often they put me in solitary from which i was surreptitiously removed and sneaked out of the joint in the wardens trunk that way i got two weeks with my wifea couple of times threewe had a nice apartment in harrisburgbefore they sneaked me back in the department shrink said i had suffered severe mental stress on the job so technically i was on medical leave jesus christ miller said anyway like i said it was about a year before i got back to the mosque i dont understand miller confessed the mosque hired a pretty good lawyer to appeal my conviction the sonofabitch used to come to camp hillwhich meant i had to sneak back into the prison to meet with him and then sneak back outevery other month to tell me how he was doing after about a year like i said the supreme court ordered a retrial the district attorney declined to prosecute and i was sprung you volunteered to go back miller asked incredulously britton met his eyes for a moment before replying im in pretty deep with the mullahs he said it would have been hard to get anybody else into the mosque who would have learned much you couldnt pay me enough to do what youre doing miller said yeah but like i was saying when i got back to the mosque the mullahs were quote back from somalia end quote they were watching me pretty closely they were suspicious i wasnt the only guy from the mosque by a long shot in camp hill britton said and they hadnt seen much of me while i was in there yeah they were suspicious theyre very suspicious people anyway i didnt want to ask too many questions and they werent talking much about somaliawhich i figured was because they really hadnt been to somaliaso i let it rest and then about six months ago two mullahs showed up they said they were from somalia i dont know if they were or werent but they certainly were from someplace other than here spoke english like englishmen and what they were up to i dont know they kept me out of their meetings you tell the fbi about them i told chief kramer he told the fbi and the fbi told him they had nothing on the names id given him so the chief staked the mosque out got pictures of them and gave the pictures to the fbi the chief got word to me that the fbi had run them they were pilots for an arab airlineyemen airways i thinkand were in the country legally going to some flight school in tulsa oklahoma all approved by the us government and and that was the end of it until a couple of weeks agoabout the time your airplane went missing in where luanda angola miller finished when the lunatics began talking more than a little smugly about what was going to happen when the liberty bell was no more you report that to chief kramer the fbi these people come up with some nutty idea once a week theyre going to blow up city hall or the walt whitman bridge or the benjamin franklin bridge or one of the sports arenas poison the water assassinate the archbishop its just talk i dont report muchor anyof it until i have more than hot air to go on you heard about the kid who kept crying wolf miller nodded and then you showed up britton went on and asked you if you had heard anything about the liberty bell miller said britton nodded you have to admit that flying an airplane into the liberty bell sounds bizarre britton said bizarre or not we think thats what they intend to do miller said you have the names of the two somalians theyd be in my report schneider i can get that sergeant betty schneider said but you said the fbi said they had nothing on those names what about the names the fbi put on the stakeout photos the chief never gave them to me britton said i suppose he has them he went out for coffee betty said maybe hes back she left the interview room and a minute later returned with chief inspector kramer they never gave me names he announced just said the two were on the upandup i can call there but its late and all im going to get is the duty officer wholl probably stall me until he can clear it with the special agent in charge chief miller said id like to suggest we wait until i can tell castillo about this he turned to britton how long can you stay chief kramer answered for him we picked him up on suspicion of murder we can probably keep him until breakfastsay eight oclockwithout making the aals more than usually suspicious castillo said hed get back to me as soon as he could why dont we wait for that okay with me chief inspector kramer said okay with you britton detective jack britton said with no enthusiasm whatever why not three delta force compound fort bragg north carolina june around the time the first delta force was organized the army had about finished implementing a new personnel policy regarding offenders of the uniform code of military justice someone had pointed outmany soldiers officers and enlisted thought very late in the gamethat only a very few soldiers committed what in civilian life would be called serious felonies that is to say rape murder armed robbery and the like the vast majority of prisoners in army stockades all over the world had been found guilty of offenses against the army system and most of the offenses had to do with being absent without leave mild insubordination drunk on duty and the like those sentenced by courtmartial to six months or less were normally confined to prisons called stockades on the larger military basesforts like bragg knox and benningwhere they spent their days walking around the base guarded by shotgunarmed prisoner chasers picking up cigarette butts and trash someone had pointed out that not only did this punishment not contribute much to the army but that the prisoner chasersusually one for every two prisoners sometimes one for each prisonerhad to be taken off their regular duties to perform that guard duty which was not an effective use of manpower furthermore if a soldier disliked the army so much that he went over the hill or told his sergeant to take a flying fuck at a rolling doughnut when chastised for example for having a dirty weapon or needing a shave he probably wasnt making much of a contribution to the army when he wasnt in the stockade the ideal was cheerful willing obedience to a lawful order and if a soldier wasnt willing to offer that what was he doing in the army if a first sentence to the stockade didnt serve to make someone see the wisdom of straightening up and flying right then hand him a bad conduct discharge and send him home that would do away with having to have large heavily guarded stockades with barbed wire chainlink fences guard towers and everything else that went with them all over the army and having to take a hundred or so men on each post away from their normal duties on any given day to serve as prisoner chasers it might also result in an army where most soldiers believed that cheerful willing obedience to a lawful order was really not such a bad idea the new personnel policy was implemented post stockade populations dropped precipitously all over the army including fort bragg at just about the time the new supersecret delta force was formed it was decided that delta force should have a very secure base isolated from the rest of sprawling fort bragg protected by a double line of chainlink fences topped with razor wire with floodlights guard towers and the like and that inside the fence there should be barracks a mess hall supply buildings and so on someone then pointed out that a system designed to keep people in like the fort bragg stockade would probably with minor modifications be entirely suitable to keep people out delta force moved into the old stockade most of the delta force people who were of course the cream of special forces thought moving into the stockade was not only hilarious but also had the additional benefit of keeping fort braggs complement of candyass officers from snooping around to see where they could apply chickenshit no one was allowed in the delta force compound without specific authorization and only a few senior officers had the authority to issue that authorization and as a rule of thumb they checked with delta force officers before granting it from his seat in the motor pool van major c g castillo who had done his time in the fort bragg stockade was not at all surprised to see a tall muscular lieutenant colonel wearing a green beret and a shoulder holster standing inside the outer fence of the delta force compound or that the gate in the twelvefoot razor wiretopped fence was closed floodlights pushed back the deep darkness of the north carolina night to provide enough illumination to make the signs hanging from the chainlink fence every twenty feet clearly legible they read do not approach fence restricted area absolutely no admission guards will fire without warning castillo got out of the back of the van marched up to the outer fence and saluted crisply the tall officer returned the salute casually colonel fortinot castillo asked the tall officer nodded just perceptibly sir my name is castillo stop right there major lieutenant colonel fortinot said this is a restricted area you need written authorization to enter this area do you have such authority no sir i do not lieutenant colonel fortinot pointed at captain brewster are you the officer who called the duty officer here asking that i come here yes sir youre general gonzalezs aide yes sir then you should know better than bringing any unauthorized personnel out here i think you can count on general gonzalez getting a memo for record reporting this incident good night gentlemen he turned marched toward the inner gate and made an open it up gesture colonel castillo called out before you go through that gate i respectfully suggest you hear me out colonel fortinot continued walking sir castillo called im privy to the gray fox op in progress colonel fortinot stopped turned and walked back to the fence he looked intently at castillo for a moment major i dont nave any idea what you re talking about gray fox never heard of it then he turned and made another open it up gesture toward the compound the gate began to swing inward a barrelchested very short totally bald civilianin a red polo shirt and khaki trousers and carrying a car in his handcame out goddamn i thought that was you cwo victor dalessandro usa retired called how the hell are you charley hello vic castillo called saved by the goddamned bell dalessandro marched through the inner gate made an open it up gesture over his head and marched toward the outer gate which swung inward as he approached he walked up to charley looked at him carefully for a moment said you looked better with the beard what the fuck are you doing here then he wrapped his arms around castillo which placed his face against castillos chest and lifted him off the ground presumably mr dalessandro you know this officer colonel fortinot said goddamn right colonel dalessandro said dropping castillo to the ground charley and i go way back word i had was that he was in washington trying to learn how to act like a lieutenant colonel something like that vic castillo said chuckling the major does not have authorization to be here fortinot said he does now dalessandro said and turned to charley they made me retire when i came back from afghanistan the last time charley so i hired on as a fucking doubledipper im director of security for the stockade gsfucking fifteen im an assimilated full fucking bird colonel isnt that right colonel lieutenant colonel fortinot nodded you came at a bad time charleyknowing you no fucking surprisewe got a gray fox going dalessandro said thats why im here vic castillo said i came up with the intel that set that off again knowing you no fucking surprise so what do you need have you got a link to general mcnab data imagery voice you wouldnt believe the gear your pal casey has come up with id like to talk to him castillo said no problem hes getting ready to go wheelsup in morocco with the backup team i think theres still an open link come on well see then he had a second thought and pointed at captain brewster who you be captain my name is brewster gonzalezs aide yes sir youre on the snoopy list dalessandro said then he said dalessandro coming in with two on my authority castillo noticed for the first time that dalessandro had what looked like a fleshcolored hearing aid in his right ear and that a barely visible cord ran from it into the collar of his polo shirt there was obviously a microphone under the shirt sir castillo said to lieutenant colonel fortinot may i suggest you come with us lieutenant colonel fortinot nodded just perceptibly and then followed dalessandro castillo and brewster into the compound first the outer gate and then the inner gate swung closed as they marched toward the singlestory brick building that had once been the headquarters of the us army stockade fort bragg dalessandro led them down a corridor to a door guarded by a sergeant who had a car cradled in his arm like a hunters shotgun theyre with me dalessandro said and then added to the microphone under his shirt open the goddamned door there was a sound of a deadbolt being released and then the door opened inward the room was square about twentyfive feet to a side in the center was a very large oblong table with room for perhaps twenty people there were six people sitting at it there were paper maps on one wall and video monitors showing maps of various parts of the worldincluding the area around abeche chadon another there was a row of twentyfourinch video monitors showing areas in and around the compound charley could see the van in which theyd come there was a captain sitting at the far end of the table dalessandro walked there and sat down next to him and gestured for the others to take chairs this is major castillo dalessandro said hes in on snoopy the captain is general gonzalezs aide hes on the snoopy list and you all know colonel fortinot major castillo needs to talk to general mcnab we up the captain nodded and said all green speakerphone all right with you charley dalessandro asked how secure is this connection charley asked this room dont get no more secure speakerphones fine charley said speakerphone green the captain said old fart for snoopysix dalessandro said three seconds later the surprisingly clear voice of lieutenant general bruce j mcnab came over loudspeakers castillo could not see now what vic fellow here wants to talk to you dalessandro said and gestured to castillo its charley general castillo said three seconds later mcnab asked as in castillo that charley yes sir youve always had a talent for showing up at the worst possible time whats on your mind i know what you were looking for sir and that its no longer there who the hell told you that it was my intel that set the wheels turning okay so what my boss sent me here sir to both get your report i already gave my sofar report to your uncle allan youre talking about secretary hall yes sir excuse me sir captain brewster said it was dr cohen the national security advisor who telephoned general gonzalez and said you were coming here at the personal order of the president the delay was just perceptibly a little longer before mcnabs reply came that sounded like brewster is your boss there too no sir hes in his quarters that figures hes got you babysitting castillo yes sir okay charley what do you want i think we may soon know where the airplane is sir and id like to discuss with you plans to deal with it youre in on my schedule wont that wait until im back yes sir of course but theres something else like what i need three radios like these and people to operate them jesus christ

snoopysix out the captain said secure voice gone to standby dalessandro asked incredulously these raghead bastards are going to try to crash this airplane into the liberty bell what the fuck is that all about i dont know vic castillo admitted his cell phone tinkled and he pulled it from his pocket yeah my toy against my better judgment will be wheelsup in about ninety seconds fernando lopez announced thank you marias really pissed fernando said and i mean really pissed im sorry castillo said the line went dead i guess you missed the sign on your way in charley dalessandro said what the sign that says the use or possession of personal cellular telephones anywhere in the compound is absolutely forbidden i cant do without it charley said that was word that my airplane is on the way ive got to makeand expectother calls sometimes we just smash the phones dalessandro said other times we castrate the offender i have to have it vic castillo said dalessandro locked eyes with him for a moment then finally shrugged theres always an exception to every rule he said finally general bruce j mcnab himself once told me that personally its about twelve hundred miles from san antonio here castillo said thats about two hours and fifteen minutes flight time that means we have that much time to find the radios find three communicators get them into civilian clothes have them check out the radios check me out on them and get from here to pope dalessandro looked at the captain can do im not only a green beanie vic im a delta force guy in good standing i can do fucking anything he turned to castillo itll be cutting it close sir but it can be done four pope air force base north carolina june sergeant dwayne g lefler usaf who had sincerely believed the civilian whod gotten off the citation with no id had been sent by air force counterintelligence to catch him with his security pants down was still on duty at pope base operations when castillo led the three delta force communicators and captain brewster into the building sergeant lefler eyed with some suspicion major c g castillo now attired in the class a uniform prescribed for fieldgrade officers sorry about the confusion before sergeant castillo said going to him and offering his army id card it couldnt be helped after examining the id card sergeant lefler said yes sir handed it back and then reached for his telephone and punched in a number major im sorry to get you up again but i think you better come back down here major thomas f treward usaf appeared a minute or so later took a good look at castillo and said well major back again this time were looking for a civilian lear thats supposed to be here right about now the tower just cleared him to land treward said gesturing toward the glass doors castillo went outside and looked up at the sky there were a halfdozen flashing grimes lights in the sky after a moment castillo decided which of them were making an approach to the runway and followed them with his eyes the first two aircraft in the pattern were usaf cs the third was a glistening white bombardierlearjet xr two minutes later it rolled up to the tarmac before base operations and stopped castillo saw the copilot take off his headset and then get out of his seat castillo walked toward the plane before he got there the door opened and the copilot got out carrying a small bag he was a silverhaired man in his fifties whose zippered flight jacket was adored with the fourstripe shoulder boards of a captain castillo guessed that he was exmilitary maybe retired who was on some sort of a list for people who needed a pilot for a light jet on short notice youre major castillo the copilot asked and when castillo nodded went on two questions for you he wants to know how long the airplane will be on the ground and what about transportation to fayetteville ive arranged for a ride for you to fayetteville and made reservations for you in the airport motel and on the delta feeder flight to atlanta leaving at eight fortyfive in the morning youll connect in atlanta to san antonio id like to get off the ground as soon as possible whats the fuel aboard enough for another nine hundred miles maybe a thousand theres an army captain inside base operations name of brewster hell take care of you from here on if youll ask him to send the others out ill talk to the pilot okay thanks the copilot said and walked toward the base operations building castillo went in the airplane and walked to the cockpit wow dont you look spiffy in your soldier suit fernando lopez said from the pilots seat jesus you didnt have to come fernando yeah i did gringo i seem to recall you saying it was important i made reservations for two at the motel plus two delta tickets back to san antonio lopez shrugged so now its reservations for one where do we go from here gringo and when castillo stared at his cousin considered the options then nodded slightly washington philadelphia and then back here now just you and me three guysfigure six hundred poundsand another four hundred in gear theres enough fuel remaining to make washingtonronald reagani know those approaches and its a good place to refuel okay sounds fine i dont suppose you remembered to check the weather and file a flight plan weathers fine and yeah theyre holding our clearance to washington with a fuel stop at raleighdurham i didnt know what your fuel remaining would be we can change raleighdurham once were up fernando said did you remember to give the copilot some cash indeed i did which reminds me he handed castillo an envelope whats this a thousand dollars thank you dont thank me thank abuela abuela castillo asked surprised like she says shes old but not braindead fernando said shes got a pretty good idea of what you do for a living you wouldnt believe how long that moneyand thats not all of ithas been in my bedside table waiting for you to need it theres also a couple of pistols in my jepp case you didnt tell her about this for christs sake yeah i promised her if anything ever happened i would tell her and i did she said to tell you shes praying for the both of us jesus h christ are you going to stand there blaspheming fernando lisped or are you going to see if our passengers are comfy their seat belts fastened and the no smoking light is on he pointed out the side window castillo bent over and looked out the three delta force communicators all dressed in sports jackets and slacks were almost to the airplane dragging enormous wheeled hardsided civilian suitcases behind them you told abuela he repeated jesus h christ then he turned and went into the cabin and helped the communicators load their enormous suitcases aboard raleigh area control castillo said into his microphone lear fiveohsevenfive sevenfive raleigh lear sevenfive passing through flight level twentyfive on a course of twenty true indicating five hundred knots i have you on radar sevenfive request change in flight plan to skip fuel stop at raleigh request permission ronald reagan direct at flight level threezero raleigh area control accepts change of flight plan for lear fiveohsevenfive proceed on present

washington approach control lear fiveohsevenfive sevenfive washington sevenfive is at flight level threezero on heading of twenty true indicating knots request approach to reagan i have you on radar sevenfive maintain present course and flight level report over richmond sevenfive understands maintain present course and flight level report over richmond castillo touched a small button on his headset which switched his microphone and earplug from transmit to intercom okay fernando he said tell me about abuela being old but not braindead i wondered how long it was going to take you to get around to asking me about that fernando said smiling at him come on castillo said not pleasantly it started right after we buried grandpa fernando began winter five hacienda san jorge near uvalde texas november there were still almost a dozen cars packed in the drive of the big house when fernando returned from san antonio and he remembered his grandfather saying that the only thing spanish people liked better than a wedding or a christening was a funeral well he had a big one a heart attack is a classy way to go and the funeral had been spectacular theyd actually run out space to park airplanes at the strip and even the texas rangers had sent an official delegation greatgreatgrandfather fernando castillo had been one of the original texas rangers there were lights on in his grandparents bedroom which meant abuela was still awake and he went there through the kitchen so he wouldnt have to deal with the hangerson in the sitting room how you doing abuela fernando asked as he bent over his grandmother and kissed her forehead she was sitting in one of the two dark red leatherupholstered reclining armchairs facing a large television set holding up i guess she said touching his cheek carlos got off all right yes maam i guess he really had to go the minute we walked in base operations at kelly and he gave his name a pilot came upa majorand said his plane was on the tarmac an air force lear pretty spiffy for a lowly lieutenant huh carlos is a captain now she corrected him and what hes doing is very important that doesnt sound like just the doting opinion of a loving grandmother do you know something i dont fernando asked i heard you two talking last night she said you know as much as i do so stop it i dont want to spar with you fernando your grandfather was always saying that i dont want to spar with you wasnt he yes maam he was he paused and then went on abuela the grin carlos had a couple of drinks last night maybe a couple too many he had more than a couple too many she said its a family tradition fernando when jorge was killed in vietnam your grandfather was drunk for a week and then when we finally could bury jorge he was drunk for another week he loved grandpa abuela you dont have to tell me that she said then added why dont you fix yourself a drink and then sit in your grandfathers chair when she saw the mingled surprise and confusion on his face she further added pointing to a halffull brandy snifter on the table between the chairs i poured that when you drove away ive been waiting for you to come back to drink it anything you say abuela we have to talk about carlos she said this is as good a time as any yes maam what is that cognac brandy she said argentine brandy the difference is the french call their brandy cognac and charge through the nose for it i thought you knew that story no maam we went to argentina on our wedding trip to the king ranch your grandfather was a classmate of eddie king at a ampm and hed been down there with eddie several times before we were married it was a fine place for a honeymoon and when he found out that the argentine brandy which he liked better than the french was just a couple of dollars a bottle he was as happy with that as he was with me he loved a bargain and he hated the french i know fernando said he went to a chest of drawers on which sat a tray with a bottle of brandy and another snifter on it poured the brandy and then went and sat in the reclining chair i feel funny sitting in here he said you shouldnt she said youre now head of the family your grandfather would approve she picked up her glass raised it in toast and said heres to you dear fernando go easy on god my darling hes doing the best he knows how she took a healthy swallow of the brandy and then looked at her grandson lets talk about you carlos and the family she said if youd like you will of course not immediatelybut the sooner the bettertake over for your grandfather what about carlos what about my mother my aunts your mother and your aunts have been provided for dont spar with me fernando and pretend you didnt know that you and carlos were going to get what the business he shrugged his admission that he had known and since carlos is not going be around very much abuela he interrupted maybe grandpas passing he didnt pass darling he died maybe carlos will get out of the army now thats very unlikely im afraid she said take that as a given carlos will stay in the army why are you so sure youre going to find out how important genetics are my darling as you get older we really have no control over what we are you have many of your fathers genes and your grandfathers too you have his temper among other things but your father is a businessman as was your grandfather and you have a businessmans genes carlos on the other hand has a soldiers genes he asked almost sarcastically his grandfather was a german officer way back on his mothers side there were hungarian cavalrymen including several generals on his fathers side we go back to the alamo his greatgrandfather fought as a major in the first world war and his father my darling jorge was a soldier who gave his life for his companions and was awarded the highest decoration the united states gives i think it can be fairly said carlos has a soldiers genes i didnt mean to sound flippant fernando said you did she said flatly then im sorry i dont want an apology i want you to pay attention yes maam over the years ive had many conversations with general naylor about carlos your grandfather and i did your grandfather frankly wanted carlos to get out of the army when he had completed his sixyear obligationthat would have been in and come home take his place in the business get married and produce a son to carry on the castillo name i understand general naylor who is genuinely fond of carlos said he didnt think carlos would be happy in the business not only because hes a very good soldier but because with the exception of you me and your grandfather he never really felt part of the family because were texmex youre making it sound worse than it is she said but yes because hes only half texmex and for the same reasonhes only half germanhe could not become a german even though he speaks the language as his mother tongue and has considerable property there general naylor said and your grandfather and i came to agree that carloss family is the army oh abuela jesus can i speak frankly please do i think naylors talking bull through his hat i was an officer i knew a lot of people for whom the army was home but they werent like carlos why not for one thing they didnt have people at home who loved them fernando said and for another they had nothing else to do and for another they didnt have any money those were your grandfathers arguments too but he eventually came to see that general naylor was right darling there isnt always logic in these things fernando threw his hands up in resignation may i have some more of the argentine brandy he asked of course he got out of his grandfathers chair poured more brandy raised the bottle to offer his grandmother more which she declined and then sat back down furthermore he started off the gringos sorry carlos is not really in the army he should be commanding a company at fort benning or someplace playing golf having dinner at the officers club worrying about his awol rate the next inspector generals inspection his next efficiency report and living in quarters thats the army he must be getting good efficiency reports excellent efficiency reports according to general naylor he was promoted to captain on the five percent list in other words earlier than his peers as an outstanding officer instead hes living in an apartment in washington and going to work in civilian clothing at thedo you know where at the central intelligence agency she said where he is in charge of providing special security for cia personnel in dangerous overseas areas special security means hes running around afghanistan protecting cia agents who cant find their asses with both handssorry abuela thats the words he used last nightwhile theyre looking for some arab whose name i cant even remember or pronounce usama bin laden she furnished a very dangerous man a saudi arabian who hates everything american the ciaand general naylorbelieve hes responsible for blowing up our embassies in tanzania and kenya last august the state department has placed a fivemilliondollar bounty on his head my god abuela you and naylor have been having some interesting chats havent you im getting a little tired darling she said would you be willing to take as a given that carlos will not be getting out of the army anytime soon and go from there yes of course i asked general naylor if there was anything i could do to help and he said he thought it was unlikely that carlos would come to meor go to himfor any kind of help but that he might go to you fernando exhaled audibly and then said yeah what i want from you fernando is this be there when carlos needs you give him whatever he asks for your grandfather used to say that when people tell you they need a little help they really mean money the last thing carlos will need is moneyhe has his own fortune and soon his share of the businessbut it is possible he could find himself inhow did your grandfather phrase ita cashflow problem a liquid asset shortage i think he would be uncomfortable if he had any idea i had any idea whats he doing so dont tell him i know if he does come to you i want you to tell me will you do this for me fernando met his grandmothers eyes for a moment of course i will he said finally one more thing she said just before god took your grandfather he told me that he still had one faint hope that carlos would meet some suitable young woman fall in love and decide that what he really wanted out of life was a wife and family he said he was praying for that i have been praying every night would you pray for that too fernando nodded for some reason he didnt trust his voice to speak chapter xv one ronald reagan washington national airport arlington virginia june while the lear was still slowing down on its landing roll at dca castillo punched an autodial button on his cellular telephone the call was answered on the second ring threezerosix a mans voice said those were the last three digits of the number castillos cellular phone had autodialed it was the number of the supervisory secret service agent in charge of the secretary of homeland securitys personal security detail if someone dialed the number by mistakeor even was trolling for interesting numbersthe threezerosix answer didnt give much away mr isaacson please castillo said welcome to our nations capital don juan isaacson himself replied we just landed at reagan joel you sent someone to meet us right wrong why not i myself will greet you personally at butler aviation to which ground control i suspect is directing you at this very moment the plug in castillos other ear was in fact at the moment carrying the order of reagan ground control to take taxiway b left to butler aviation to what do i owe the honor castillo said i was feeling generous isaacson said then added nice airplane don juan if he can see the airplane i should be able to see him castillo looked out the window and saw joel isaacson leaning against the door of a black yukon parked in front of the butler aviation fueling facility youre not supposed to have vehicles except with flashing lights etcetera on the tarmac but i suppose if you are a very senior secret service guy you can park just about anyplace you damned well please and all joel heard was that i was bringing some special radio he doesnt know how big or how heavy and he wasnt about to help drag a big heavy radio from butler to wherever he was supposed to park the yukon joel this is master sergeant alex dumbrowski castillo said as they all stood on the tarmac sergeant this is mr isaacson of the secret service hes in charge of secretary halls security the two men nodded and shook hands but said nothing wheres the radio isaacson asked sergeant dumbrowski pointed at the enormous hardsided suitcase thats all of it isaacson asked dubiously sergeant dumbrowski nodded ground service people walked up dragging a fuel hose fernando lopez climbed down from the lear fernando castillo called and fernando walked over castillo introduced him to isaacson as his cousin isaacson motioned one of the fuel handlers over and handed him a credit card put that fuel and the landing fees on that he ordered thank you castillo said what the hell its in government serviceyou can send us a bill for the charter mr lopezand this way no one gets to see the bills you have just made our lawyers very happy fernando said thank you isaacson didnt reply turning instead to master sergeant dumbrowski all set up how big is this thing he asked the antenna i mean sergeant dumbrowski wordlessly demonstrated with his hands the size of the expanded antenna jesus that small isaacson asked rhetorically still charley if we set it up on the roof of the oeob all kinds of questions will be asked what about nebraska avenue as oeob meant old executive office buildingalmost everything in washington seemed to be boiled down to acronymnsnebraska avenue was verbal shorthand for the nebraska avenue complex off ward circle in northwest washington originally a navy installation dating to world war ii there are thirtytwo buildings on thirtyeight acres it was now the home of the department of homeland security secretary hall had his official office there although as a practical matter he most often used his office in the oeob which was right next to the white house before charley could reply isaacson asked another question this time of master sergeant dumbrowski how far can you set up the antenna away from the working part about fifty feet dumbrowski replied it was the first time he had opened his mouth the bosss office is on the top floor isaacson said to charley its a lot less than fifty feet from it to the roof and it has secure phones and no one will ask questions about one more antenna out there make sense makes a lot of sense joel castillo said sergeant dumbrowskis also going to have to teach a couple of your people how to operate itits not that hardso that its covered all the time most important messages come in when the operator is on the john you can start with me and my partner sergeant okay dumbrowski nodded and then said almost hesitantly major joel the fewer people who know these radios exist the fewer people are going to absolutely have to have them castillo said okay for the moment charley fine but if this equipment is as good as you told the boss it is ill want to talk about getting some permanently we can talk about that later charley said but this one goes back to bragg with dumbrowski when this is over agreed agreed sergeant dumbrowski is going to need a place to stay close to the radio theres a bedroom off the bosss office so far as i know hes used it twice ill put the sergeant in there and if the boss asks ill tell him you said to do it okay you are devious castillo said talking about devious two guys who work for an unnamed federal agency and who we havent seen in years looked tom mcguire and me uppurely for auld lang syne of courseand then asked if we happened to know where they could find your friend kennedy not together they took four shots at us first tom and then me and then two hours later another guy did the same thing i guess they had a real hard time believing us when we said we didnt know anything about kennedys whereabouts and didnt think you did either thanks castillo said you want me to take this radio and the sergeant to philadelphia with us whos going to philadelphia the boss is i guess to try to keep the mayor from going ballistic when the commissioner tells him about the plans for the liberty bell you mean you didnt know castillo shook his head when first thing in the morning isaacson looked at his watch in six hours he wants to be there early leave the radio where it is im taking one to philadelphia to give to miller and youll have secure communications anyway right isaacson nodded well if thats it don juan ill take the sergeant over to nebraska avenue i wish youd knock off with the don juan i know isaacson said smiling charley looked at the lear they were almost finished fueling it and fernando was doing the walkaround charley got in the airplane and went into the cockpit two philadelphia international airport philadelphia pennsylvania june philadelphia ground control had directed them to the leaseaire hangar so castillo wasnt surprised to see as they taxied up two ford crown victorias with all the police regalia and a third unmarked victoria is that bettys unmarked car as the lear parked sergeant schneider and major h richard miller jr got out of the unmarked car miller was still wearing the ragged clothing from his fathers garage that betty had suggested he wear while meeting the undercover cops that triggered an uncomfortable thought jesus ive been telling these people im secret service andor halls executive assistant and here i am in my class as three cops got out of the police cars all were wearing the leather jackets of the highway patrol one of them was a burly man with a lieutenants bars on his jacket epaulets ah the brother whos going to break both my legs i told him or at least let him think im in the dea shit as fernando was shutting down the lear castillo took off his headset put on his beret and went into the cabin he found the delta team arranging their gear and said you guys made up your mind which of you will stay here and which will go wherever the everchanging winds of fate are going to take me sergeant first class seymour krantz who wasnt much over the height and weight minimums for the army smiled at him i was with major miller in afghanistan sir so if its all right with you youll go anywhere hes not right krantz chuckled major miller and i get along pretty good sir okay what im going to do is try to get a cop to sit on the airplane and then take sergeant sherman with us to help you get the radio set up they nodded and said yes sir almost in unison castillo opened the door and stepped down from the lear where the hell did you get the airplane miller asked by way of greeting it belongs to my cousin fernando castillo said good morning sergeant schneider good morning she said avoiding looking at him and formallyand more than a little awkwardlyshaking his hand this is my brother lieutenant frank schneider of the highway patrol lieutenant schneider was standing with his arms folded looking the opposite of friendly the other two highway patrolmen both of them large and mean looking stood behind him one of them was the sergeant whod driven him to the airport earlier and i wonder how long it took for you to tell ol break my legs that the secret service calls me don juan good morning castillo said or good middle of the night lieutenant schneider neither smiled nor offered his hand you told me you was dea he accused and you told me you were going to break both my legs castillo said one good lie deserves another right what did he say to you betty asked aghast frank damn you castillo saw sergeant krantz all fivefeetfour and pounds of him struggling to get his huge hardsided suitcase down from the lear not to worry sergeant castillo said pointing at krantz i brought a highly skilled special forces assassin along to protect me the highway sergeant chuckled at ol break my legs not at me miller recognized sergeant krantz let me give you a hand with that seymour he said and went quickly to help him castillo turned to meet lieutenant schneiders eyes she said commissioner kellogg told highway that until further notice supporting counterterrorism with whatever they want is the job chief inspector kramer ordered me to meet you and ask what you want how much else did anyone else tell you castillo asked i know about the liberty bell if thats what you mean and who else was told the highway commander and these officers schneider said keep it that way lieutenant please castillo said schneider nodded so what do you need weve got a special radio well need some place to set it up and i need someone to sit on the airplane while were here and id like to talk to the undercover guy hes at the homicide bureau in the roundhouse betty schneider said but tell me about the radio what does it need someplace preferably out of the rain sergeant krantz answered for him and someplacea flat roof would be nicenot far from the controls where the antenna will have a clear shot at the sky the satellite how bigs the antenna betty asked krantz demonstrated with his hands and arms theres a sort of porch on building she said looking at castillo you saw it would that do he called building to his memory yeah i think so fernando and sergeant sherman walked up this is fernando lopez castillo said and sergeant sherman whos going to help sergeant krantz set up the radio fernando and i are cousins this is sergeant betty schneider her brother frankie frank schneider quickly and firmly corrected him but i got another smile from the sergeant lieutenant schneider of the highway patrol schneider shook hands with fernando betty smiled at him looked a little confused and said and thats dick miller dick and i go back a ways fernando said you want to top the tanks off and get the weather and file a flight plan back to bragg id rather go with you fernando said you have a problem with that castillo thought it over a moment before answering no why not good fernando said okay so what we have to do now is get the sergeants and the radio to the arsenal castillo said and me fernando and dick to the roundhouse you said the homicide bureau whats the undercover officer doing there ill take you and major miller and mr lopez lieutenant schneider said no betty said flatly cutting him off the sergeants and the radio go to the arsenal in highway cars ill take major castillo major miller and mr lopez to the roundhouse thanks just the same sergeant schneider but im not really afraid of him castillo said you better be you sonofabitch lieutenant schneider said betty was not amused she was instead all business what lieutenant schneider is going to do is stay here until we have a couple of uniforms sitting on your airplane she said he can do that better than anybody else and then hes going to catch up with us at homicide the other highway car will take the sergeants and the radio to the arsenal ill call ahead and set it up for them and that car will stay there to provide whatever transport we need if you have any problems with that frank call chief kramer hes at homicide lieutenant schneider looked for a moment as if he was going to say something but in the end he turned wordlessly and walked toward his car which almost certainly means that chief inspector kramer has told him that bettys running this operation and that he takes his orders from her betty gestured for the others to get in the unmarked crown victoria castillo got in beside her their eyes metmomentarilyfor the first time as she backed away from the hangar why the uniform betty asked it made sense at fort bragg he said and then you dont seem surprised i picked up on thatthat youre an army officer as well as a secret service agent and the executive assistant to the secretary of homeland securityat dicks house yeah how do you know who you are at any given moment sometimes its difficult and i forgot the head of catering for what was it you said rig service rig service he confirmed sometimes i say i fly helicopters for them and is there such a company yeah there is fernando said from the backseat and among other things i do for the gringo whenever somebody calls up to check on him is say that he really is what he told somebody he is the gringo she repeated just a nickname fernando explained and even though the car interior was darkened betty knew he said it with a smile youre welcome to use it too he added thanks but how do you know what hes told them sometimes thats very difficult fernando said chuckling he started to say something else but saw that she had her cellular telephone out and had punched an autodial button sergeant schneider sir she said a moment later i just picked up mr castillo at the airport and were headed for the roundhouse i sent one of the highway cars out to the arsenal mr castillo brought some kind of special radioand a guy to set it up and work itwith him the antenna has to go someplace where it can be aimed at a satellite the porch roof of building will work is that okay with you whatever he wants schneider chief inspector dutch kramer could be heard faintly but clearly you want me to call out there and set it up that would probably be a good idea sir okay done ill see you in a couple of minutes a security guard waved them through the airport gate betty reached to the dashboard and turned on the flashing lights under the grille and the siren stepped heavily on the accelerator then turned her head you were saying mr lopez call me fernando please he replied i was wondering why your brother wants to break the gringos legs jesus christ castillo exclaimed there was another momentary meeting of bettys and charleys eyes and she shook her head charley said to dick what im wondering is what you found out from the undercover cop can we get to that please dick charley not only because i also wonder what youve done to annoy bettys brother i think youd better wait and get it straight from the undercover cop its pretty weird give me what you think i can understand charley ordered okay none of this is confirmed but i think theres a good chance the guys who stole the airplane have been here in philadelphia as mullahs visiting from somalia you mean the guys who actually stole the airplane or the guys behind the idea maybe both according to britton britton is the undercover cop castillo interrupted right when these characters showed up at brittons mosque he reported it chief inspector kramer took it to the fbi the names these two guys gave at the mosque didnt mean anything to the fbi so kramer got photos of them at the mosque the fbi got a match and said they were legitimate they were pilots for air yemen and in this country for flight training some place in oklahoma probably my alma mater castillo said what on my graduation leaveremember fernandofor reasons that now seem pretty foolish i went to spartanthe spartan school of aeronautics its been around foreverand got my airline transport rating they train pilots from all over the world from small airlines that dont have their own facilities its in tulsa okay miller said that fits and according to britton its all over the aal community that the liberty bells going to be taken out aal dick fernando asked cop shorthand for african american lunatics miller said and defined as african americanand some white guys believe it or notquote muslims end quote who are not part of the bona fide islamic community and who happen to be black i dont think i understand fernando confessed i know i dont miller said thats why i want charley to hear all this from britton i dont want to say something imply something that may not be the case but we have the namesand photographs you saidof these people castillo asked photos probably betty schneider said we tend to hang on to photos i didnt think to ask but we dont have names why not the fbi didnt give them to chief kramer andwhen this came up just nowhe said if he called down there he was probably going to get the duty officer who would stall him until the sac came to work in the morning so we decided to wait for you jesus christ castillo exclaimed you said the undercover cop britton is in homicide whats that all about betty why dont we go back to sergeant schneider she said you mean until this is over no thats not what i mean she said the reason detective britton is in homicide is because we picked himali abd arraziqup for questioning in a homicide youre talking about the undercover cop fernando asked yeah the aals like to know where every other aal is all the time and what theyre doing so when we really have to talk to themmore often when they really have to talk to uswe pick them up with other unsavory characters jesus christ i wouldnt mind taking on the fbi duty officer as a secret service agent but i cant walk into an fbi office in my uniform theyd lock me up until he banged his fist on the dashboard we need those damned names castillo said clearly frustrated no one said anything and i dont have any dates or anything he said after a moment betty when was this ill have to look it up mr castillo she said and i cant do that until we get to homicide or out to the arsenal mr castillo he parroted yeah youre mr castillo and im sergeant schneider okay whatever you say sergeant schneider well be at the roundhouse in just a couple of minutes mr castillo she said well deal with it then three homicide bureau police administration building th and race streets philadelphia pennsylvania june chief inspector dutch kramer was almost visibly of two minds when he saw major c g castillo in his class a uniform whats with the uniform he asked i never really got out of the stockade chief castillo said they sort of paroled me to the secret service so why are you wearing it now i just came from the stockade castillo said most of the guys in there think the secret service is a bunch of candy asses and theyre right theyre not as bad as the fing fbi but they also think their sh kramer remembered gentlemen dont say things like their shit dont stink in the presence of ladies and betty schneider was both one hell of a cop and a lady schneider tell you about what britton came up with he asked changing the subject i think this is good stuff chief castillo said well

castillo said but we cant check it out until i get the names what about their photos do you still have them i had one of my guys go through the files he brought them over here but no names for an answer kramer shook his head and slid a manila folder across his deskactually that of the captain commanding the homicide bureauto castillo it was labeled using what looked like a broadtipped magic marker unknown mullahs amp there were perhaps twenty eightbyteninch color photographs in the folder some showed the men wearing robes and loose black hatsthe sort of floppy berets favored by mullahsbut with creased trousers and wingtip shoes peeking out the bottoms of the robes entering and coming out of a building castillo presumed was the mosque where britton was working undercover they had intelligent faces and in several photographssome of those in the folder were blowups of their facesthey were smiling are these the guys how the hell can anybody calmly plan to fly an airplane into the ground he looked at chief inspector kramer we need their names he said well the fbi must have them i call down there the duty officerll stall me and we cant tell him why we want them or can we can

minutes during which time sergeant betty schneider looked at everything in the room but c g castillo how may i help you agent castillo on or about twelve december chief inspector kramer of the philadelphia pd counterterrorism bureau gave you some surveillance photographs he had made of two muslim mullahs he considered suspicious you ran them identified the men and told chief kramer they

sonofabitch im going to do whatever i can to burn your ass his ass and the ass of the special agent in charge over this you would be wise to deliver the message and dig out the information that i need because someone who can get you people off your candy asses will be calling shortly he slammed the phone down in its cradle they do try ones patience on occasion dont they chief kramer asked innocently charley took out his cellular telephone and punched an autodial key it was answered on the second ring threezerosix charley castillo i need to speak with joel isaacson right now hold one that took three minutes isaacson charley joel i knew i wasnt going to get any sleep whats up don juan i think theres a very good chance we have an id on the guys who stole the charley began explained why and related the details of his telephone conversation with the duty officer of the philadelphia office of the federal bureau of investigation my we do use some really naughty words when were peeved dont we isaacson said peeved is the fucking understatement of the year the fucking decade can you do anything about those bastards joel i think so yes where are you im in the homicide bureau of the philadelphia police department but call me on the cellular have they got a fax machine where you are charley looked at sergeant betty schneider i need a fax machine number he said she left the office and returned in less than a minute with the number written on a sheet of notebook paper he gave it to isaacson it was sent to you at the mayflower isaacson said marked please deliver immediately they did and my guy sitting on your apartment sent it out to nebraska avenue thinking i was still there my guy there read it to me over the phone so ill call out there and have them fax it to you what the hell is it i dont know i dont want to know its probably a mistake jesus christ joel what hes saying of course is that he thinks its from kennedy i wonder what the hell it is as soon as i do what i can about the fbi ill let you know isaacson said good job don juan he hung up your boss chief inspector kramer asked a heavyduty secret service guy good guy you think hell be able to do something if anybody can isaacson can but fighting the fbi is like punching a pillow uhhuh kramer agreed can i talk to your undercover guy now kramer rose from behind the desk and motioned for castillo to follow him theyd barely had time to introduce themselves when betty schneider came into the interview your fax came in mr castillo she said and handed it to him its addressed to somebody named gossinger but i have a hunch its intended for you castillo took the fax from her and read it snr karl w gossinger the mayflower hotel washington dc usa please deliver immediately on receipt my dear mr gossinger this is to confirm your reservation for our four day all inclusive golf and snorkeling package for two commencing june we look forward to having you and your guest in the grande cozumel beach and golf resort where we are sure you will find everything you are looking for and thank you for choosing us unfortunately there seems to be a small problem with your american express

shortly with all best wishes roberto dondiemo roberto dondiemo roberto dondiemo my ass its for me thank you very much sergeant schneider castillo said sometime when you can find time you can tell me about mr gossinger id love to ill make time castillo said and then turned to detective britton ill be right back detective britton i have to deal with this sure britton said he went to fernando who was talkingin spanishto a homicide bureau detective handed him the fax and saidin spanish i sure hope you brought your cozumel international approach charts with you what the hell is this fernando asked in english as castillo punched numbers into his cellular you said you wanted to go snorkeling in cozumel castillo said what the call went through much quicker than castillo thought it would roberto dondiemo gee you sure dont have much of an accent when you speak english senor dondiemo thank you i could say the same thing about you herr gossinger theres hardly any trace of german dare i hope youve straightened out the problem with my american express card by now indeed i have absolutely it was whats the english phrase a glitch of some kind can i take it that well soon have the pleasure of your company in the resort if i was sure i could find what im looking for i would certainly come i have a good idea where you can find what youre looking for mr gossinger i could say im almost positive i can locate it for you you wouldnt want to tell me now i suppose i really think you should come down here mr gossinger all work and no play as they say i probably will but if i do my party will be a little larger than originally planned why does that worry me it shouldnt one of the people will be my cousin and the other two will be soldiers taking sort of a busmans holiday none of whom i hope have ever heard of me none of them have ever heard of you i dont know why the hell i trust you mr gossinger maybe its that boyishly honest face you have but you do right against my better judgment tell me does the grande cozumel beach and golf resort have a flat roof now that you mention it yes it does is that important somehow and the rooms youve reserved for me are they on the top floor no as a matter of fact you can walk directly from your accommodations onto the beach weve put you into the jack nicklaus suite will that be satisfactory thats very kind but wed much prefer to be on the top floor which would give us a good view of the beach and where we could watch the waves go up and down will that be a problem not at all youll be among friends here one of whom happens to own the hotel your every wish will be our command jesus is he telling me pevsners there how nice i was about to suggest that the best way to get here probably is through miami i have a plane what kind of a plane a lear x getting there will be no problem but i always worry about getting delayed at customs put your mind at rest about customs when may we expect the pleasure of your company ill call again when i know ill be expecting your call mr gossinger when he put his cellular telephone back in his pocket he saw that betty schneider and fernando were looking at him she had a telephone in her hand her palm covering the mouthpiece this ones for supervisory special agent castillo of the secret service she said wouldnt give his name he nodded and took the telephone from her castillo something wrong with your cellular charley the secretary of the department of homeland security said sir i was talking to my new friend from vienna what did he have to say he wants me to come to cozumel hes in cozumel and doesnt want the fbi for that matter anybody but especially the fbi to know but hall has every right to know yes sir and he says hes almost positive he knows where what were looking for can be found but he wouldnt tell you where and he wants you to go to cozumel no sir he wouldnt tell me and yes sir he wants me to go to cozumel he didnt say why no sir he didnt i think id better go sir and what about general mcnab after i see general mcnab sir and presuming nothing turns up there that would shoot down cozumel thats a pretty bad choice of words charley sorry sir castillo thought he heard secretary hall exhale charley hall said when i said i wanted you to keep me in the loop i meant it yes sir i understand i will sir you didnt tell me about your runin with the fbi hall said flatly i had to hear that from joel i thought id see what joel could do first sir i didnt want to bother you bother me jesus christ charley were running out of time i understand sir im not sure you do tomorrow morning this morning when i meet with the mayor at half past nine im going to have to tell him sir i thought we had until four something in the afternoon the president said im to inform the mayor this morning he said the mayor has the right to know which means i have to askmore accurately begthe mayor for a little time before he pushes the panic button and id like to be able to tell him something more than were looking for the airplane and hope to find it jesus like i said were running out of time hall said but the reason i called when joel came to me with your yarn about the fbis intransigent stupidity taking you at your word i got mark schmidt out of bed taking me at mine schmidt seems as angry as you were he told me that he would deal with it personally you should be hearing from the special agent in charge of their philadelphia office any minute if you dont hear from him in the next fifteen minutes call me yes sir call me in fifteen minutes whether or not you hear from them yes sir four for the next fifteen minutes castillo sat in the interviewee chair in interview room sergeant betty schneider sat on the table beside detective jack britton chief inspector dutch kramer and dick miller leaned against the wall as all threebut mostly castillotried to pull from britton any bit of information that would fill in the blanks britton understood what was being asked of him and why and pulled all sorts of esoteric information about the mosque and its mullahs from his memory none of it seemed useful although castillo found what britton told him fascinating castillo had kept looking at his watch and when fifteen minutes had passed he decided to wait one more minute before calling secretary hall and telling him there had been no contact from the fbi he was actually watching the sweep second hand on his wristwatch waiting for it to go back to twelve when the interview room door opened chief one of the homicide bureau detectives said theres a guy from the fbi out here looking for a secret service agent castillo kramer looked at castillo who made a wry face and then gestured to the detective to bring him in a moment later a middleaged somewhat portly man with a plastic badge with fbi in large letters on it hanging from the breast pocket of his suit came into the room he was neatly dressed but he needed a shave he looked around the small room taking a close look at everybody hello chief inspector he said smiling at kramer kramer nodded at him im looking chief for a secret service man supervisory special agent castillo i was told he was in here kramer pointed at castillo youre castillo the man said he obviously did not expect to see a supervisory secret service agent in an army officers uniform yes i am castillo said who are you im alexander stuart the philadelphia fbi sac be right with you mr stuart castillo said as he took out his cellular and pushed an autodial key castillo mr secretary the philadelphia fbi sac just walked into the room i havent had a chance to talk to him mr secretary yes mr secretary ill get back to you just as soon as ive had a chance to talk to him he put the telephone back in his pocket and looked at sac stuart it would seem mr castillo that theres been some sort of a misunderstanding stuart said no misunderstanding i needed some information and i needed it right then your duty officer wouldntor couldntgive it to me and your counterterrorism man told me hed talk to me when he came in in the morning i couldnt wait that long so i called washington apparently it wasnt made clear to either of my agents how important this matter actually is stuart said whats it all about what this is all about is that i asked for some information and your people wouldnt give it to me i need those names mr stuart and i need them now special agent lutherberg who heads my counterterrorism section is on his way to the office if hes not there already ill have those names for you very shortly castillo grunted i need some additional cooperation from the fbi castillo said which is as soon as we have the names and the photographs i want to run themright nowpast the spartan school of aeronautics in tulsa oklahoma i need to know a if they were students there about the time chief inspector kramer gave you the surveillance photos he had made of them and b if they were students at spartan what sort of training they had specifically if they received training in boeing aircraft oh so thats what this is about that airliner that went missing in africa castillo ignored the remark now can you get in touch with your tulsa office directly send them the photos and the names over your net and have them go out to spartan or am i going to have to do that through washington i can contact them directly of course stuart said would i offend you if i suggested you call your duty officer and get that started right now stuart met his eyes that doesnt offend me mr castillo he said but the language you used to my duty officer offends me offends me very much frankly are you aware that we record all incoming calls after duty hours i didnt think that was legal unless the calling party is advised that his call will be recorded castillo said but if youve got a tape of my conversation with your duty officer why dont you send itthe entire conversation not just my intemperate language to director schmidt stuart tried and failed to stare castillo down then looked away to chief inspector kramer chief is there a telephone i can use schneider chief kramer said sergeant betty schneider with a wholly unintended display of her upper thighs slid off the table right this way mr stuart she said when the door had closed after them detective jack britton pointed to castillo looked at miller and said admiringly hey bro your white boy pal is a real hardass aint he five office of the commissioner police administration building th and race streets philadelphia pennsylvania june police commissioner ralph j kellogg walked into his outer office said good morning to chief inspector kramer majors castillo and miller detective jack britton and sergeant betty schneider who were sitting in chairs waiting for him and waved them into his office captain jack hanrahan kelloggs executive officer waited until everybody was inside then pulled the door closed both kellogg and hanrahan were shaven wearing suits and stiffly starched white shirts and were obviously fully awake although it was less than twenty minutes since chief inspector kramer had called the commissioner at his home and suggested they needed to talk okay dutch kellogg said where are we between britton and castillo commissioner and with the somewhat reluctant cooperation of the fbi weve ided the people we think stole the airplane they were here at brittons mosque is that going to help you find the airplane kellogg asked castillo but then before castillo could reply asked whats with the uniform first step in declaring martial law ive been at fort bragg commissionerand im about to go back thereto explain the uniform and i have reason to believe we have located the airplane you either have or you havent which a source which has previously been right on the money has told me hes almost certainly located it what ill be doing at fort bragg is helping to set up the operation to neutralize it what source i was afraid you were going to ask that not to go farther than this room commissioner kellogg considered that no thats over as i understand the plan matt hall will be here at eight oclock shortly after that as soon as weve compared notes were going to see the mayor i want to be in a position to lay everything on the table in front of him i now think promising to hold off telling until four this afternoon was a mistake from now on starting when hall gets here im going to tell the mayor everything i know you understand now what is the source of your information that the airplane has almost certainly been located sir youre going to have to get that from secretary hall i cant give it to you great kellogg said visibly angry commissioner chief inspector kramer said britton also tells us that theres a lot of talk at his mosque about something going to happen to the liberty bell and constitution hall you mean the lunatics know commissioner there have been no details detective britton said just nonspecific talk they must know something kellogg said which means they know more than i do and a hell of a lot more than the mayor does he paused and then went on were you able to come up with a connection between brittons mosque and the people who cleaned airplanes at leaseaire no sir sergeant betty schneider said we havent been able to find a direct connection none of the names connected so what theyre working on now is relatives and known associates most of the people at the mosque commissioner britton explained have rap sheets for drugs andor theft which would keep them from getting airport work permits but if they wanted to snoop around this airplane company leaseaire castillo furnished they could send a brother or sister or the guy next door who is clean and could get an airport work permit commissioner kellogg held up his hand to cut him off i get it he said and checking that out takes time right yes sir betty and britton said almost together we dont have any time kellogg said he looked at britton if you went back to the mosque what do you think you could find out not much sir i cant ask too many questions who at the mosque would know the mullahs and if we hauled them in what would we learn not much they know all about the fifth amendment they claim it if we ask if its raining how many mullahs theres one head man britton said abdul khatami formerly clyde matthews and then has this guy got a sheet commissioner kellogg interrupted britton answered first with his hands mimicking the unrolling of a long scroll before he converted clyde was a very bad boy britton said he was in and out of the slam from the time he was fifteen a lot of drugs but some heavy stuff too armed robbery attempted murder etcetera he was doing fivetoten in the federal slamfor cashing social security checks he foundwhen he converted so far as i know hes been clean since he sends the faithful out to raise money for the cause how many more mullahs would be likely to know something about the liberty bell three maybe fourno more than four you have their names and where we can find them yes sir but send highway to pick them all up one at a time lots of sirens lots of noise i want it known that weve picked them up keep them moving between districts no more than an hour in each district dutch you work out the details what are we charging them with chief inspector kramer asked commissioner kellogg ignored the question your people will interrogate them dutch with britton and major miller watching through a oneway glass northeast detectives is probably as good a place as any to do that chief inspector kramer nodded sir britton said if im held much later than eight in the morning and this is going to take longer than that youre not going back undercover period the commissioner said sir im the best chance we have to learn anything at the mosque britton argued whats the other guys name whos in there with you parker sir hes a good man but he hasnt been under long enough for them to trust him maybe they will start to trust him once they figure out youve been in there kellogg said and this way you get to stay alive i want you available until this thing goes down but sir thats it detective britton kellogg said flatly thats whats going to happen yes sir and this way when hall and i go see the mayor and he turns to me and asks what im doing about this i can truthfully tell him we think we know who the guys who stole that airplane are that weve rounded up the mullahs and pulled you out to interrogate them okay yes sir britton said and we might as well start on getting a judge to authorize wiretaps on the mosque and every phone that looks promising thatll take some time but we should do it commissioner wehomeland security and the secret servicehave blanket authority to tap in a terrorist situation like this all we have to do is report it to a federal judge later i didnt know that kellogg said surprised you can authorize that as a supervisory special agent sure if you were to ask for the help of the philadelphia department to help you put in your taps id be happy to oblige thank you sir kellogg studied castillo so youre a green beret major yes sir i am and a supervisory special agent of the secret service you told me you had the credentials but its on the upandup castillo said i was sworn in how do you keep who you really are straight with difficulty sir castillo said and glanced at betty schneider she shook her head when i talked to matt hall earlier castillo commissioner kellogg said he said he was going to come as quietly as he can what did he mean by that usually commissioner when he goes to a city where the secret service has an office theyll send peopleusually four to six in a couple of gmc yukon xlsto back up his personal security detail that attracts a lot of attention if he said hes coming quietly he doesnt want that attention i dont know this but what i think is that they called the philadelphia office and told them to send a carnot a yukonto meet the plane they may not have toldprobably didnt tellphiladelphia that the secretary is coming whats his personal detail two secret service guys this morning i know it will be joel isaacsonwho is more than a bodyguard and who is usually with the secretary and almost certainly his partner tom mcguire who is also more than a bodyguard are you going to the airport to meet him with sergeant schneider no sir im just about through here im going to fort bragg as i said before secretary hall wants me to be in on the planning to neutralize the airplane miller where are you going to connect with secretary hall i dont know sir miller said and looked at castillo for guidance i think you should meet him at the airport castillo said even better would be you and sergeant schneider nobodys had much sleep will you be okay with that schneider kellogg asked yes sir ill be all right okay then thats done commissioner kellogg said miller and schneider can bring him up to speed on the way in from the airport youre going to the airport right now castillo just as soon as my sergeant gets here from the arsenal he may already be here okay lets get started on hauling in these lunatics and putting in the taps we may get lucky despite what britton thinks i sure as hell hope so six in the unmarked car on the way to the airport castillo called secretary hall again sir i regret the hour but you said i should keep you in the loop whats going on charley the commo gear here has been set up and linked with the one in your office and bragg so youll have it when you get here dick miller and sergeant schneider who know whats going on here will meet your plane and be available while youre here theres nothing else i can do here so im headed back for bragg to meet general mcnab im on my way to the airport now how are you doing with the fbi the fbi here has sent the photographs and the names of the two somalians who were here over their net to the fbi office in tulsa the sac tells me they will run them past the people at spartan right away theytulsatold him they know the spartan director of security hes retired fbi so it shouldnt take much time to confirm these are the guys were looking for it may already have been done ill bet my last two bucks that its our guys were betting a lot more than your last two bucks hall said the commissioner decided to bring in the mullahs from the temple to see if we can learn something charley said to change the subject he also wanted to tap their phones and was going to start getting the necessary warrants from a judge i told him we had blanket authority to tap without a warrant do we christ you told him that and didnt know joel told me the secret service did or i got that impression i wasnt paying as much attention as i should have been ill take the heat sir i thought the tapsas soon as they can be installedwere important we have a tenday authority starting when we tell a federal judge but were required to tell a federal judge first if we can justify the tapreasonable cause to believeto the judge within the ten days we can keep the tap otherwise we cant use anything we intercept you might want to write that down charley yes sir im sorry sir joels on his way over here now ill have him call a judge yes sir thank you what the hell were you thinking charley that were running out of time sir well i cant argue with that call me as soon as youve talked with general mcnab yes sir as betty drove the unmarked crown victoria up to the lear castillo said you guys get on the plane he looked at miller and you take a walk dick i need a private word with sergeant schneider when charley and betty were alone in the car she looked at him and then away you wanted to know about karl gossinger he said its not important she said i was born in germany my mothers name was gossinger my father was an american officer who was killed in vietnam they werent married he never knew about me and i never knew about him until my mother was about to die when they heard about me my fathers family brought me to this country and i took his name not even dick knows that story fernando does but hardly anybody else but im considered a german by the germans and got a passport etcetera its useful in my line of work why are you telling me this because i dont want to go back to sergeant schneider and major castillo charley i dont even remember the last time i had any sleep i cant deal with this now and i probably wont be able towont want todeal with it when all this is over youre just too much for me you dont know who you are how am i supposed to get on the airplane do i get kissed again no you dont okay i had to give it a shot charley said i wont bother you again he got out of the crown victoria and was halfway to the lear when she called charley he turned you forgot your phone shit he said and trotted toward the car i must have missed my goddamned pocket when i put it away he patted his shirt pocket the phone was in it betty hadnt gotten out of the crown victoria but she had pushed the passenger door open he slid onto the seat she touched his face with her hand and then kissed him as she had the first time not passionately not coldly tenderly then she put her hand on his chest and pushed now get on the goddamned airplane she said and for christs sake be careful miller was standing by the door of the lear can i go back to the car now your private teteatete with the lady over not one more fucking word dick castillo said and then went up the steps of the lear chapter xvi one aboard lear sx nsl over cambridge maryland june richmond area control castillo said into his microphone the glow from the instrument panel gently lighting him in the early morning light lear fivezerosevenfive at flight level twentynine on a heading of twozeroniner true airspeed five hundred roger lear sevenfive request permission to change destination from fayetteville

gringo i thought you were going to tell me everything he looked over at castillo in the glow of the panel lights he could see castillos head was slumped forward charley was sound asleep fernando reached toward him to shake his shoulder but changed his mind two pope air force base north carolina june fernando lopez reached over in the cockpit and pushed charleys shoulder hey sleeping beauty wake up castillo almost snapped his head back then looked out the windshield they were moving down a taxiway past a long line of air force cs were down castillo said sounding surprised with no help from you sorry fernando come on gringo when was the last time you had any sleep i dunno castillo said after a moment then where we going ground control said take this until a follow me meets us fernando said castillo looked out the window again there was no follow me vehicle in sight but there was a ground handler waving his wands in the keep coming signal as castillo watched the ground handlernow walking backward toward the opening doors of a hangarmade a turn right signal with his wands when fernando turned the lear toward the hangar he immediately got the stop and shut down signals this is probably where delta keeps its castillo said confirmation of that came almost immediately a tug backed out of the hangar two soldiers wearing green berets and slinging their sidearms in shoulder holsters hooked up the lear to the tug which then pulled it into the hangar the doors immediately began to close castillo saw captain harry brewster and vic dalessandro standing by the door of an interior office in the hangar im impressed with your airplane charley dalessandro said greeting him with a handshake and a pat on the shoulder where the hell did you get it alamo rentaplane castillo responded why are we in the hangar we got an en route call from general mcnab charleyhes somewhere over the atlantic about three hours outsaying he wants to see you asap when he gets here i figured it would be quicker here than to go to the stockade the globemaster will come here as soon as it lands to offload the backup guys he say why dalessandro shook his head fernando and sergeant sherman got out of the lear and walked up to them this is my cousin fernando lopez castillo said hes driving the airplane dalessandro asked its his airplane how much did you have to tell him just about everything pity dalessandro said straightfaced now ill have to kill him then he smiled and put out his hand charley and i go back a long way dalessandro said i know fernando said he told me if you even looked as if you might give me trouble i was to shoot youtwicein the nuts dalessandro smiled broadly i like him charley he said but ill probably kill him anyway you have anything else for me vic castillo asked dalessandro shook his head captain brewster said no sir i need some sack time castillo said i passed out in the airplane and i have to change out of the uniform any problem taking fernando to the vip quarters no sir brewster said you live on the post sergeant sherman castillo asked yes sir i dont see any problem with you going home for a couple of hours give me your quarters number and be prepared to be back here on thirty minutes notice leave the radio on the airplane sir if its all right with youyou know how the wives areid rather go out to the stockade with mr dalessandro your call sergeant castillo said okay dalessandro said brewster will take you to your quarters ill take sherman to the stockade and when i get a goodsay fortyfiveminuteeta on mcnab ill call brewster and hell bring you out here okay with everybody everybody nodded captain brewster and sergeant sherman said yes sir in brewsters van on the way to the vip quarters fernando said that was sad what the sergeant said what charley asked he said he didnt want to go home because of his wife fernando said hes going off god knows where on something like this and hes having a scrap with his wife thats not what he said fernando castillo explained what happened was that he went home earlierwhen dalessandro picked him as one of the communicators he told his wife he was going operational she knew what that meant hes going somewhere to do something he cant tell her about hes delta force so she knows that means hes going someplace probably unpleasant and he doesnt know whenor ifhell be coming back special ops wives learn to deal with that its not easy but they deal with it he didnt want to go home wake her up get her all excited that he was back and then have to put herand himselfthrough the same thing again a couple of hours later jesus christ fernando said softly i dont remember the last time i had something to eat castillo said sir brewster replied theres probably ham and swiss cheese in the frig in your quarters and bread but i dont know where else youll be able to find something to eat tonight unless you want to go home with me thanks but no thanks what i was thinking was breakfast can you get that sergeant to come by say at quarter to seven with stuff to make breakfast id go find a mess hall but ill be in civvies and weve got fernando done hell be there when they went into the vip quarters bedroom charley went to his luggage took out clean linen a tweed jacket light brown trousers a knit shirt and loafers and laid everything carefully on the floor next to one of the beds what the hell are you doing gringo fernando asked i would have liked to use the other bed for my nice clothes but i took pity on a homeless wetback and told him he could use it i dont want to waste any time when we get the call in the morning its already morning fernando said with all possible tenderness and affection fernando go fuck yourself i can tell the big hand from the little hand fernando chuckled smiled and went to his suitcase and started to lay out clean clothes on the floor next to his bed charley took off his uniform and trying to ignore the body odor that the miracle fabric now gave off folded it and put it in his luggage his feet and legs felt strangely light when he walked into the kitchen without his jump boots he made ham and swiss cheese sandwiches there was neither butter for the bread nor mustard for the ham and cheese he carried one to fernando in the bedroom fernando wolfed it down commented thats a really lousy sandwich and then asked if there was any more charley made two more sandwiches and gave one to fernando as he ate the other he stripped and put his tshirt and shorts in one of the suitcases he took his toilet kit into the bathroom showered shaved and then crawled naked into bed he saw that fernando was already in the other bed lying on his side and probably asleep charley turned off the lamp on the bedside table rolled onto his side and went to sleep remembering the touch of bettys hand on his face and the soft warmth of her lips three pope air force base north carolina june major general h v gonzalez was at the wheel of the dodge caravan outside the vip guest quarters when charley castillo and fernando lopez walked out of the building captain brewster had called ten minutes beforeas charley and fernando were finishing their breakfastto tell castillo he had a firm eta on general mcnabs c iii globemaster good morning general charley said after he had loaded their luggage and gotten inside this is my cousin fernando lopez gonzalez out his hand over the back of the font seat and said bienvenida a fort bragg senor lopez thank you sir fernando replied in spanish i assume castillo general gonzalez said switching to english that you have considered the question of giving mr lopez access to classified material well fuck you general i have the authority general castillo said coldly to tell my cousin or anyone else what i think they have to know about this situation he spoke not only in spanish but in the texmex patois peculiar to the san antonio area fernando picked up on his tone of voice gave charley a surprised look and said to gonzalez in spanish i dont know if this is pertinent or not sir but im a captain in the reserve and hold a top secret clearance gonzalez grunted but did not reply when they got to the hangar at the airfield vic dalessandro was there and so was another general officer a major general and his aidedecamp a captain both wore desert pattern bdus and green berets youre castillo i presume the twostar said offering his hand to fernando im general chancey i command the special warfare center no sir fernando said and pointed at charley he is sorry general chancey said now offering his hand to castillo thats fernando lopez general castillo said hes working with me on this general chancey nodded and came up with a very faint smile not another word was exchanged until dalessandro after answering a wallmounted telephone announced the globemasters on the ground as castillo watched from inside the hangar the huge c rolled slowly down the taxiway the driver of the tug sitting just inside the hangar door started his engine the ground handler on the taxiway waved his wands for the aircraft to stop and cut its engines the airplane stopped but the two engines the pilot had not turned off continued to run a door in the side of the fuselage opened and two men got out one was lieutenant general bruce j mcnab wearing a desert camouflage battle dress uniformand a green beret castillo noticed the second man was wearing an air force flight suit he went to the ground handler with the wands and spoke briefly to him the man with the wands tucked them under his arm and gestured to the driver of the tug who revved his engine and drove out of the hangar when the tug reached the ground handler the ground handler climbed onto the tug sat down on the back of itfacing the globemastertook out his wands and made the prescribed come ahead gesture with them the tug started to move down the taxiway with the enormous globemaster following it the air force officer trotted after general mcnab and caught up with him just as he reached the hangar castillo saluted mcnab returned it forgive me for mentioning this mcnab said but youre not supposed to do that you know ive just finished telling colonel torine how honored we are to have such a highranking civilian the personal representative of the president here to guide us in the accomplishment of our assigned tasks castillo felt like a fool for salutingit had been a pavlovian reactionbut on the other hand sensed there was something in mcnabs tone of voice that gave meaningother than sarcasmto what hed said welcome home sir castillo said goddamn two senior civilians here to meet us mcnab said spotting vic dalessandro i didnt know you got out of bed this early these days mister dalessandro good morning general you got a secure place for us vic mcnab asked dalessandro pointed to the door of the hangars interior office last swept half an hour ago general okay lets go swap war stories mcnab said dalessandro torine the generals and of course mr castillo fernando looked at charley wordlessly fernando gets left out here with the aides no fucking way unless theres some reason he shouldnt id like mr lopez with me charley said yes sir of course mcnab said putting out his hand my name is mcnab mr lopez yes sir what the hell is that all about how do you do sir fernando said i may nave to kill mm general dalessandro said as they walked across the hangar charleys told him everything hold off on that until we dont need him anymore mcnab said the air force officerthe leather patch on his flight suit was silverstamped with command pilot wings and the legend col jd torine usafsmiled and shook his head when they were inside the office mcnab sat down at a desk as dalessandro closed the door for the benefit of mr castillo and mr lopez mcnab began colonel torine commands the seventeenth airlift squadron at charleston air force base south carolina before the air forcescraping the bottom of the barrelpromoted him he was in charge of our c here when general naylor laid this requirement on the th torine couldnt find enough sober air force types to drive the c and had to do it himself torine put out his hand to castillo were you really the worst aidedecamp in the army he said with a smile if general mcnab said so it must be true sir castillo said torine and fernando shook hands i like your airplane mr lopez he said thank you fernando said if you would mr castillo mcnab said fill us in general naylor being general naylor were all still pretty much in the dark whats with the mr castillo everybody knows im a major the airplane you were looking for in abeche sir waswere pretty surestolen by a somalian terrorist group called the holy legion of muhammad the name doesnt ring a bell mcnab interjected he looked at the others all of whom shook their heads who plan on crashing it into the liberty bell whered you get this mr castillo mcnab asked from a russian an arms dealer one of the names he uses is aleksandr pevsner another is vasily respin i know the gentleman by both names hes a genuine rascal mcnab said this sounds like a cia fantasy you said you got it where from pevsner in vienna whats in it for him dont tell me altruism he wants attention diverted from some of his business activities mcnab grunted anyway castillo went on the last word we had was that the airplanenow repainted with the registration numbers of air surinamewas last seen in ndjamena chad after a flight from khartoum khartoum has no record of air suriname in khartoum in the last six months that could happen colonel torine said and made a gesture with his fingers suggesting a bribe castillo didnt respond instead going on the airplane took on fuel and filed a flight plan to murtala muhammad international in lagos nigeria and never got there where do you think it is colonel torine asked kennedy thinks its in south america castillo said by way of yundum international kennedy whos kennedy general mcnab interrupted and where is yundum international in gambia a hundred miles south of dakar colonel torine answered another place where the more generous you are the fewer questions are asked about where you really came from or are really going whos kennedy mcnab pursued pevsners guy american hes exfbi castillo said first name howard mcnab asked castillo nodded hes renegade fbi if its the same guy i think it is mcnab went on a guy from the fbi was here asking that if we ran across him anywhere to please let them know right away thats a whole other story sir but ive seen his dossier he hasnt been charged with anything and im sure he gets a nice recommendation from pevsner right mcnab said castillo didnt reply where in south america mcnab asked im not sure it could make it across the drink to anywhere in south america from yundum colonel torine said or from anywhere else on the west coast of africa how is it configured it came out of passenger service with continental airlines castillo said all economy class seats that probably means the shorthaul configuration colonel torine said as he took a pocketsized computer from the pocket on the upper left sleeve of his flight suit he started tapping keys with a stylus typically that would mean a max of about there it is gallons giving it a nominal range of nautical miles thats without a reserve of course he rapidly tapped more keys on the computer with the stylus suriname isnt in here he announced but georgetown guyana is thats right up the coastno more than two hundred miles from paramaribo the only airport i know of in suriname thatll take a its nautical miles from dakar to georgetown a standard configuration just couldnt make it the fuel bladders castillo said okay lets factor that in colonel torine said rapidly tapping the stylus a standard us army fuel bladderthats another assumption well have to go with that the bladders are army bladdersholds five hundred gallons how did the get to africa in the first place if it doesnt have the range to cross the atlantic mcnab asked and then as the answer quickly came to him added sorry dumb question torine answered it anyway more than likely via gander newfoundland to shannon ireland thats the longest legabout seventeen hundred nautical miles well within the range of a shorthaul then down across france to north africa and so on castillo had several unkind thoughts one after the other the first was that general mcnabs question was in fact dumb mcnab rarely asked dumb questions well jesus hes just flown back and forth to north africa and run a gray fox operation that went down perfectly hes tired i know how that is and while im still impressed with torines pocket computer and with his dexterity in punching the keys with that cute little stylus this is a little late in the game to start figuring how far the can fly as if he had read castillos mind colonel torine looked at him and said i guess i should have done this earlier but frankly ive been working on the assumption that the was headed for mecca what did he say mecca what the hell is that all about excuse me sir castillo said torines face showed i have just let my mouth run and he looked with some embarrassment at mcnab tell him mcnab said and then before torine could open his mouth went on general naylor probably because he thought i didnt have the need to know did not elect to share with me why we were looking for the in chad but he gestured with his hand for torine to pick up the story torine looked at castillo you know who general mcfadden is general naylors deputy commander at macdill castillo replied right torine said we go back a long way when general mcfadden called me to lay on the support of the c for the mcnab mission he told me out of school that despite the current wisdom at centcom that the was going to fly to philadelphia and crash into the liberty bell he thought that there was a good chance it was going to be flown to mecca and be crashed into the kaba thereby really enraging the muslim world its an american airplane they would probably find the body of the american pilot jesus castillo said which made a lot more sense to both of us than the liberty bell mcnab said and still does general i really think philadelphia is the target castillo said far be it from me to question the judgment of the presidents personal representative mcnab said tell us about the fuel bladders torine god knows i am an expert on mcnabian sarcasm and again theres more to that crack than what it sounds like what the hell is he hinting at okay where was i torine asked consulting his computer again okay a bladder holds five hundred gallons we dont know how many bladders were loaded aboard in abeche i can find out probably when i get to cozumel castillo said but more than one so lets go with what we know two bladders gallons torine went on stabbing at his pocket computer with his stylus figuring nautical miles per gallon thats an additional miles of range plus is theyd run out of fuel miles out of georgetown factor in another couple of bladders mcnab ordered tell me how many bladders it would take to give them the fuel they need for that matter tell me how many bladders they can get on that airplane okay torine said two more bladders would give them another miles thatd get them across the drink with odd miles to spare six would get them there with almost miles to spare we better figure they had eight mcnab said what about the weight i dont think it would be a problem torine said let me check there was a knock at the door dalessandro went to it and opened it a special forces master sergeant was standing there youre wanted on the secure line mr dalessandro he said dalessandro opened the drawer of a desk and took out a telephone he spoke briefly into it and then extended it to castillo castillo dick charley major h richard miller jr said we have confirmation that the two guys who were at brittons mosque were also at spartan where they were certified in the great that pretty much settles it wouldnt you say it looks that way miller said theres something else charley okay go ahead betty schneider said to give you a message equally great what is it she said to give this to you verbatim charley miller said uncomfortably well lets have it she said don juan i should have known better signature sergeant b schneider oh shit what the hell did you do to her don juan is that all dick yeah ill be in touch castillo said and handed the telephone to dalessandro i guess that highway sergeant finally got around to telling frankie breakmylegs haha you know what the secret service calls castillo lieutenant don juan goddammit to hell castillo sensed mcnabs eyes on him that was miller sir castillo said we have confirmation that the two somalis who were in philadelphia were at spartanthe spartan school of aeronauticsin tulsa and are qualified in s well then i guess the kabas safe from these lunatics mcnab said is that good or bad i crunched the numbers for ten gallon bladders gallons colonel torine said at pounds a gallon that would be pounds that would add nautical miles of rangea total of and still leave it pounds under max gross takeoff weight so they can fly just about any place they damn well please mcnab said what about direct to philadelphia no torine said thats about nautical miles but lets be sure he stabbed at the computer with the stylus nautical miles too far not even factoring in a reserve thats miles short and even factoring in more bladders why would they want to arrive in philadelphia with nearly empty tanks good point mcnab said presuming they learned from they want to arrive with as much fuel as an explosive as possible or possiblyalways look on the dark sidewith as much trinitrotoluene as they can carry torine started stabbing with the stylus again hold off on that mcnab ordered touching his arm okay lets go with the assumption the airplane is somewhere in the upper east quarter of the south american continent maybe even in suriname im presuming the cia has been told what your friend the exfbi agent told you mr castillo they havent been told where it came from okay they already have egg on their face about this so i think we can assume theres been satellites all over that part of the globe just as soon as they could be redirected they were probably spinning their wheels during the night but at daylight i think we can assume theyre going to find it kennedy says he knows where it is and will tell me when i go down there go down where mcnab asked cozumel off the yucatan peninsula i know where it is mcnab said why wont he tell you on the telephone i dont know castillo replied but we have to play under his rules when are you going down there mcnab asked as soon as we finish here castillo said and i report to secretary hall how you plan to neutralize the mcnab looked thoughtful for a moment and then said gentlemen will you give mr castillo and me a moment alone not looking very happy about it everybody filed out of the room mcnab closed the door and turned to castillo the problem is not how to neutralize it charley he said but how quickly we can do so were back to charley im not sure i follow you sir what did you do forget everything you learned in the stockade mcnab asked not very pleasantly okay mcnab went on and looked at his watch its ohsevenfiftyfive lets assume that at this very moment analysts at langley and fort meade are going over the first of the daytime imagery downloads it would be nice if they came up with a nice clear photo of this airplane sitting on an airfield in suriname but i dont think we better count on that realistically what theyre going to come up with is half a dozen images which might beeven probably areof our but theyre not going to pass that on to the dci much less the president until theyre sure theyll direct the satellites for better pictures and if they have assets on the grounddo you think theres much of a cia operation in suriname for instance i donttheyll send him word to make a visual how long is that going to take hours charley said how long is it going to take you to fly to cozumel in that pretty little airplane of yours its nautical miles a little under two hours maybe a little less when fernando checked the weather a half hour ago there were some favorable winds aloft so what were saying charley is that you will get a location on the from his guy before the nsa and the cia finish making sure theyve found it presuming they do find it castillo nodded you trust your guy charley castillo nodded again and said yes sir during those two hours gray fox will be standing around with its thumb up its ass mcnab said im not sure i know where youre going with this general castillo said im a little disappointed this hasnt occurred to you mcnab said but lets take it from the top we can assume that when we get a firm fix on the well be ordered to neutralize it yes sir how would you do that jesus christ why lay this on me youre the guy who runs gray fox what i thought you would do sir would be send a gray fox teamwith little birds to wherever it is and neutralize it knock out the gear maybe or blow it up and when would i do that as soon as you got the word sir and whats the sequence of events you should have thought about this charley youre about to be lieutenant colonel castillo youre supposed to think ahead give me the sequence i confirm the location notify secretary halland you to give you a headsuphall tells the president andor the secretary of defense who tell centcom to lay on the operation and they give you the order and then mcnab picked it up conferring with his staff to make sure everybody agrees on what should be done general naylor orders the th special operations aviation regiment at fort campbell to prepare half a dozen little birds say four mhhs and two ahjswere not going to have to fight our way onto the airfield but it never hurts to have some airborne weaponry available and then centcom orders the seventeenth airlift squadron to send a globemaster to fort campbell to pick up the little birds and bring them here so we can load the gray fox people now i know where youre going and youre right i should have thought about this all of which is going to take time castillo offered yes it will charley you and i have been down that road together too many times before mcnab let that sink in apropos of nothing whatever mr castillo simply to place the facts before you there are ahjs and mhhs at the special warfare center for training purposes there are thirtyodd special operatorsmost of them gray foxeating their breakfast off trays inside the globemaster that just brought them home from morocco by now the c iii should be refueled you think i should ask general naylor castillo said charley i know you love him and i do too but allan naylor is not a special operator he likes toi guess has todo things by the book what are you thinking mount them up and send them to hurlburt hurlburt field in the florida panhandle near the gulf coast beach resort of destin is the home of the usaf special operations command mcnab nodded you can get to anywhere in south or central america from hurlburt a lot faster than you can from here or fort campbell without asking general naylor without asking anybody mcnab said if the special assistant to the secretary of homeland securitysent here according to national security advisor dr cohen at trie personal order or the presidentwere to suggest to me that prepositioning a gray fox team at hurlburtfrom which it could easily be stood downwas a good idea i think id have to go along castillo didnt say anything for a long moment thats a hell of a decision for a major to make he said finally when he finds outand he willnaylor is going to be furious yeah he will mcnab agreed with both of us he paused and then went on what separates really good officers from all the others charley is their willingness to order done what they know should be done and fuck the consequences your call charley after a moments pause castillo said do it mcnab nodded anything else you need here id like a c pilot to come with me i need an expert mcnab nodded again went to the door opened it and called colonel torine will you come in here please torine came into the office and closed the door i think it would be a good idea if you went to sunny cozumel with charley he needs a c expert from the look on his face i dont think he thinks thats such a good idea torine said sir with all respect youre a colonel whos an old air commando which will be handy when youre dealing with the friendly folks at hurlburt mcnab said and im a major castillo finished an old special operator mcnab said evenly knows the guy in charge is the guy in charge i dont see rank as a problem colonel torine agreed youre the guy in charge youve got civvies in your bag right mcnab asked torine nodded you better send somebody for it the sooner you get on your way to cozumel the better i already sent for it from what you told me about the worst aidedecamp in the army i didnt think id be going back to charleston anytime soon okay thats it mcnab said you two remember to duck he walked to the office door will you come in now please gentlemen as they walked up to the lear fernando asked would you like to ride in the right seat colonel i was hoping youd ask colonel torine said four minutes later pope clears lear fiveohsevenfive direct cozumel climb to flight level threezero on course twozeroniner report over columbia you are number one to go after the onethirty departing understand number one after the onethirty colonel torine replied understand flight level thirty course twoninerzero report over columbia fernando turned around in the pilots seat and looked into the cabin to make sure nobody was wandering around sergeant sherman was strapped into his seat holding a can of coke looking out the window charley was also securely strapped into one of the seats he had reclined it to nearly horizontal and was sound asleep takeoff power fernando ordered colonel torine carefully moved the throttles fully forward pope ohsevenfive rolling torine said into his microphone four office of the director the central intelligence agency langley virginia june mrs mary leonard the statuesque grayhaired executive assistant to the director of central intelligence went into the dcis office and closed the door john powell looked up from his desk mr jartmann is here boss mrs leonard said bring him in mary please he said to the female who probably knew more of the nations most closely guarded secrets than any other female except dr natalie cohen and mrs leonard added raising her eyebrows mrs wilson walked in on his heels i think she went to the beauty parlor just for you i must say she looks stunning this morning i told her quarter to eight the dci said have her wait please and curb your legendary charming hospitality no coffee not even a goddamned glass of water yes sir mrs leonard said ill deal with mrs patricia davies wilson just as soon as ive seen what harry jartmann has for me youre about to make a mistake there mrs leonard said a great big mistake i am how do you know that when you said her name just now spittle flew its burning holes in the carpet he looked at her shook his head and smiled but said nothing let me handle her between us girls mrs leonard said you really think thats the way to go mary its the only way to go you want to get rid of the problem or exacerbate it you being a lady i cant tell you how id like to get rid of the problem powell said he waited for her to smile and then went on so what do i do depending on what jartmanns got for youand i think hes got somethingwhen youre finished go out the back door with him go to photo analysis ill transfer important calls to you there and ill let you know when im through with her jesus powell said and then okay mary i again defer to your wise judgment bring harry on mrs leonard went to the office door opened it and announced the dci will see you now mr jartmann when harry jartmann a tall tweedy thin man with unruly hair came into the office she closed the door from the inside and leaned against it watching and listening good morning mr director jartmann said good morning harry what have you got for me jartmann held up a manila folder and wordlessly asked if he could lay it on the directors desk powell gestured for him to do so jartmann unwound the cord holding the folder closed took out a sheaf of photographs and spread them on the desk what am i looking at powell asked these are fresh from fort meade thats satellite imagery of the airfield at zandery suriname jartmann said at ohsevenohfive this morning thats probably the were looking for probably wont cut it harry powell said there was early morning fog jartmann said these have been enhanced but obviously theyre not what wed like to have have to have harry powell clarified what makes you think this is the airplane well its a for one thing were sure of that and while we cant read the registration numbers we made out enough of the paint scheme to compare it with the known paint scheme of air suriname he paused as mrs leonard walked across the room to the directors desk picked up a telephone and punched one of its buttons mary leonard she said softly the dci would like to see you right now come in the back door and powell said to jartmann eighty percent probability that its the same if we dont have the registration numbers all that proves is that an air suriname is on an airfield in suriname powell said very softly he looked at mary leonard hes on his way she said ten seconds later the private door to the dcis office opened and a man who could have been jartmanns younger brother came in he was j stanley waters the cias deputy director for operations whats up waters asked tell me about our assets in suriname powell said off the top of my head not very much waters said if memory serves we have a guy just out of the farm there under cover as a viceconsul sort of first assignment onthejob training what do we need theres a sitting on the airfield at where harry zandery jartmann furnished zandery suriname that waters asked thats what were trying to determine jartmann replied there was a ground fog this morning through which we cant see the registration numbers waters said right how long before we can get another satellite over zandery suriname waters asked pronouncing each syllable reprogramming has begun jartmann said probably an hour hour and a half figure another thirty minutes to get the downloads here can we get our man out there and get the numbers sooner than that powell asked how much will be compromised if i get on the telephone just tell him to get out to the airport and get us the registration numbers of any on the field we dont have to tell him why waters picked up one of the telephones on powells desk get me the american embassy in jesus what the hells the capital of suriname paramaribo powell furnished in a quiet voice suggesting to mrs leonard that he was about to lose his temper paramaribo waters told the operator put the call in to the ambassador all right the consul general but ill talk to anybody ill hold he looked at powell no embassy consulate general powell nodded but said nothing thirty seconds later waters ended the call with a stab of his finger to the switch hook and quoted furiously good morning this is the consulate general of the united states our office hours are goddammit he slammed the handset into its cradle and picked up another and punched several keys this is waters he said we have a man in paramaribo suriname i dont know his name i need his home phone number and while youre at it get me the home phone of the consul generali dont know his name either ill hold but im in the dcis office if we get cut off mrs leonard looked at dci powell he was looking at the satellite imagery ground fog he said very softly fucking ground fog mr peterson waters said two minutes and thirty seconds later my name is j stanley waters you know who i am if i told you i was calling from langley virginia would that give you a clue yeah that j stanley waters now listen carefully just as soon as you hang up the phone i want you to get out to zandery airfield and get me the numbers the registration numbers of any boeing you see sitting out there its an airliner three engines one of them in the vertical stabilizerthe big fin in the back im sure youve seen one of them now dont take pictures just get the numbers write them down go back to the consulate generaldo you have satburst capability then get on the telephone and call langley ask for me or mrs mary leonard the switchboard will be expecting your call got it good now how long do you think thats going to take you why the hell should it take two hours then break the goddamned speed limit youve got diplomatic immunity jesus h christ get your ass out to the airport and get those goddamned numbers and get them now he slammed the handset in its cradle the airport is thirtyfive miles from paramaribo waters said and theres a strictly enforced thirtyfivemileperhour speed limit mr director mrs mary leonard said why dont you go with mr jartmann and see if they cant do something to further enhance the photos we have or maybe there will be some others they can work on the dci looked at her and said very softly i think thats probably a very good idea mrs leonard he stood up and walked deliberately to the private door of his office and went through it jartmann followed him ill deal with the switchboard mrs leonard said to mr waters what that dumb sonofabitch is likely to do is take his camera with himjust to be sureand get himself arrested for photographing a suriname military installation im sure theyre concerned with terrorists in suriname hell get you the registration numbers stan mrs leonard said with a conviction she didnt at all feel waters walked to the outer office door mrs leonard walked behind him he continued to the corridor which he took back to his office mrs leonard smiled at mrs patricia davies wilson and said ill be with you in just a minute mrs wilson then she closed the door and called the chief switchboard operator and told her there would be a call probably within the next two hours from a mr peterson in suriname it was to be routed to mr waterss private line first and then to hers but under no circumstances to the dci hes got too much on his plate this morning to be bothered with this she explained then she went and opened the door to the outer office would you come in please mrs wilson mrs wilson put on a dazzling smile and walked into the office when she saw that director powell was nowhere in sight she looked at mrs leonard curiously why dont you have a seat please mrs wilson mrs leonard said waving at one of the armchairs she walked to the dcis desk and leaned against it the dci has been called away mrs leonard said sorry he asked me to deal with this for him perhaps if you had been able to get here at seven fortyfive the traffic was unbelievable mrs wilson said perhaps it would be better if i came back when the dci has time for me that wont be necessary mary leonard said this wont take any time at all and i know the dci wants to get it behind him what is it youve been reassigned mrs leonard said youre going back to analysis i dont know where theyll put you to work but somewhere im sure where youll be able to make a genuine contribution to the agency but i like what im doing i dont want to go back to analysis im sorry to hear that mary leonard said but the decision has been made i want to hear this from the dci himself im afraid thats out of the question im being relieved of my duties which to the best of my knowledge i have carried out to everyones complete satisfaction thats not exactly the case im afraid but i dont think we want to get into that do we i demand an explanation can i say youve demonstrated a lack of ability to deal with the problems youve encountered in the field and let it go at that i really dont think you want to open that pandoras box mrs wilson well you think wrong mrs wilson said flatly i have the right to appeal any adverse personnel action and i certainly will appeal this one mary leonard didnt say anything this has something to do with what happened in angola doesnt it mrs wilson asked yes it does well i may have made an error of judgment but certainly not of a magnitude to justify your major error in judgment may i speak frankly please do was in thinking you could lie to the dci and get away with it i never lied to the dci how dare you didnt you tell the dci that when you were in luanda the assistant military attache a major millerwho was also the station chiefmade inappropriate advances to you and he did of course he would deny it at the time you said you were having dinner with him during which you said he made inappropriate advances you were actually otherwise occupied werent you i dont know what youre talking about for the sake of argument if you werent having dinner with major miller when you said you were that would be dishonest wouldnt you say a lie youre going to take the word of an incompetent army officer who never should have been given an assignment like that in the first place over mine well lets see what the appeals board has to say about that she got out of the armchair and started for the door before you start the appeals process mrs wilson i think youd better take a look at something i have patricia wilson stopped and turned what is it mrs leonard walked behind the dcis desk opened a drawer and came out with a manila folder she took an eightbyteninch photograph from the folder and held it out to patricia wilson you ever see this man before mary leonard asked yes i have she said and who is he hes a german journalist his name is grossinger gossinger something like that he works for a small newspaper in germany or so he said i ordered major miller to check him out was that before or after you went to bed with him with this man what did you say i said did you tell major miller to check him out before or after you went to bed with this man i dont believe this patricia wilson said i just dont believe it this man actually said i went to bed with him and you believe him mary leonard nodded yes he did and i believe him so does the dci whynot admitting it for a minute of coursewould he say something like that well he probably decided that taking foreign journalists to bed after the most brief of associations was dangerous behavior for a regional director of the ciaa married womanand that the agency ought to know about it patricia wilson glowered at mary leonard your friend is not a german journalist mrs wilson mary leonard said hes an american an intelligence officer working directly under the president to find flaws in the intel community and he found one she locked eyes with her and let that sink in i think this conversation is over mrs wilson dont you mary leonard asked patricia wilson stalked angrily out of the dcis office chapter xvii one aboard learjet x nl degrees north latitude degrees west longitude over the gulf of mexico june i think from here on in i better stop calling you colonel fernando said to colonel j d torine usaf and you start playing the role of pilotforhire okay with you yeah sure call me jake and when were dealing with mexican customs and immigration i think it would best if you called me mr lopez and charley mr castillo sure torine said and smiled you seem to have a feeling for this line of work mr lopez the way it is jake is that fiveohsevenfive has unlimited frequent unscheduled permission to enter mexican airspace usually our destination is mexico city oaxaca or bahias de huatulco but i dont think alarm bells are going to go off when somebody reads our flight plan to cozumel he saw the look of curiosity on torines face and responded to it the family has a ranch near bahias de huatulco used to be cattle but now its mostly grapefruit i didnt think americans could own property in mexico torine said and then quickly added i dont mean to pry you goddamned yankees cant own land down here fernando explained which is why my mother happened to be in mexico when i was born that made me a mexican by birth dual citizenship fernando nodded and said so was our grandmother south of the border when charleys father came along charley screwed up the system when he got himself born in germany but two of my kids are also bona fide mexicanos we wont tell them that until we have to torine shook his head smiling in wonder why not it causes identity problems fernando said chuckling and sometimes official ones the counterintelligence corps shit a brick when they found out that lieutenant f lopez of the st armored division held mexican citizenship for a couple of days it looked like they were going to send me home from desert one in handcuffs what happened our senator told the secretary of the army whose side the lopezes were on at the alamo fernando said chuckling and that cousin charley was a west pointer and his fathermy uncle jorgehad won the medal of honor in vietnam and that he didnt see any problems about wondering where our loyalties lay general mcnab told me about charleys father torine said he bought the farm before charley and i were born fernando said but he was always a big presence around the family our grandfather hung his pictureand the medal in a shadow boxin his office its still there we knew all about him he was right up there with manuel lopez and guillermo de castillo who were they bought the farm at the alamo fernando said and then went on jake why dont you go back in the cabin and get out of the flight suit and wake up sleeping beauty i want to get our little act for mexican customs and immigration straight with him torine unfastened his harness and started to get out of the copilots seat merida area control fernando said into his microphone this is lear fivezerosevenfive im at flight level threezero indicating five hundred knots on a heading of twozeroniner international direct cozumel estimating cozumel in ten minutes request approach and landing to cozumel we will require customs and immigration service on landing the only problem we have is if customs wants a look at sergeant shermans suitcase charley said how do we explain the radio they might not want to fernando said they have the flight plan theyll know we came from the states people usually dont try to smuggle things into mexico and if they seem to be getting curious you have that envelope i gave you envelope torine asked the cashstuffed envelope jake it usually makes mexican customs officers very trusting fernando said two office of the commanding general united states central command macdill air force base tampa florida june when sergeant major wes suggins had gone into the office of the centcom commander general allan naylor usa to tell him that frederick k beiderman the secretary of defense was on the secure line naylor as he walked quickly to the phone booth had signaled for suggins to stay which suggins correctly interpreted to mean he was supposed to listen to as much of the conversation as he could overhear suggins complied by leaning on the doorjamb of the phone booth while naylor was on the horn and naylor held the handset as far from his ear as he could and still hear the secretary yes mr secretary im sure we can handle this and i will get back to you with how its going naylor said ending the conversation and thoughtfully replacing the handset in its cradle he looked at suggins im surprised that it took them this long to find it sergeant major suggins said not that it took this long after they did decide to tell us to neutralize it naylor grunted is everybody here wes yes sir i even mentioned to general mcfadden after we got the we found it message that you would probably want to see him shortly he was on his way to the golf course a sound mind in a healthy body sergeant major naylor said round em up yes sir just under five minutes later what suggins thought of as the heavy brass general albert mcfadden usaf the centcom deputy commander viceadmiral louis j warley usn the centcom intelligence officer and lieutenant general george h potter usa the j special operations officer and the heavy civilians mr lawrence p fremont of the cia and mr brian willis of the fbi were all sitting around the conference table in naylors office the civilians suggins thought privately werent really needed the cia and the fbi had done their job the stolen had been located even if that had taken a hell of a lot longer than it should have but if they had not been summoned suggins knew they would have felt left out and suggins knew how important it was to naylor that the civilians felt they were part of the team general mcfadden was even in uniform usually at this time of the morning he was dressed for the links it was his practice to come to his office early read the overnight intel and messages and then commence his physical training regimen general officers were permitted to select their own method of physical exercise mcfadden had a permanently reserved tee time rank hath its privileges ive just spoken with secretary beiderman general naylor began centcom has been tasked with neutralizing the stolen which as you all know has been located at an airfield zandery in suriname secretary beiderman made it clear that he wants this done as quietly as possible he looked around the conference table and had a sudden tangential thought ill be damned heres my chance to zing mcfadden and i almost blew it lets see naylor asked innocently whos junior i guess i am general brian willis of the fbi said but id really like to defer to someone in uniform i associate myself totally with my learned colleague lawrence fremont of the cia said there were chuckles general potter said cowards i guess youre next up on the totem pole right lou naylor asked only because the navy refuses to appropriately acknowledge my talents admiral warley said okay lou how do we handle this the first thing that occurs to me is putting an umbrella over the coast of suriname and if this plane tries to go anywhere we force it to return to suriname and if it refuses to return to suriname naylor asked take it out general admiral warley said anything else the umbrella is step one step two in my judgment would be to send mcnabs people in as backup in case the cia is unable to quietly neutralize the airplane on the ground im presuming youre already working on that right larry i dont want to give the wrong impression when i say sure we are lawrence fremont of the cia said we are but i understand we have a oneman station therehes the guy who made the visual confirmationand theres not much he can do by himself im sure help is on the way no telling frankly how long that will take thank you larry naylor said and now we will hear from the nextsenior officer general potter is there any doubt in anyones mind that he will not suggest sending in the peace corps to reason with these people there were chuckles i agree with admiral warley that we send in mcnabs people why am i not surprised naylor asked but not with his priorities i think mcnabgray foxhas the experience to deal with this sort of situation if you order it done quietly thats what youll get thats it naylor asked yes sir general potter said it looks like a nobrainer to me and general mcfadden naylor asked i really have nothing to add general general mcfadden said is he saying that because hes miffed at me or because theres really nothing to say beyond whats already been said potters right this is a nobrainer okay naylor said everyone seems agreed that we should send general mcnabs peoplewere talking about gray fox to neutralize the airplaneand as soon as possible put fighter aircraft in the areanot entering suriname airspace of course but over the atlantic outside suriname territory in case the airplane takes off whereupon they will intercept it and order it to return to zandery if they fail to comply they will shoot it down that about it he looked around the table when his eyes met those of admiral warley warley said the rules of engagement general are we going to give the pilots the authority to take the airplane down or do you want them to ask for permission and from whom general naylor looked at general mcfadden al when i heard the cia had found the general mcfadden said i ordered an e down there the nearest one was refueling at guantanamo they said it would take thirty minutes to get it in the air that was about thirty minutes ago so its probably wheelsup its about eighteen hundred miles from gitmo down there at a little better than five hundred knots figure three hours twenty minutes i also ordered up two kcs out of barksdale љ both are wheelsup one headed down there and the other to gitmo where it will be on a tenminute runway alert i also have a fourplane flight of fs on a tenminute runway alert at eglin ј worst possible scenario the takes off in the next few minutes whereupon we scramble the fs at eglin to intercept the intercept point would be about miles south of miami a little south of cuba they could either order it to land at gitmo or shoot it down the decision to do either would be in the hands of the pilot for obvious reasons thats risky but theres no other way to go until we get the e there and up and running i admit this isnt an ideal situation but the truth is we just werent set up to deal with an airplane sitting on a field in zandery suriname and the best possible scenario al naylor asked naylor was impressed with the action mcfadden had taken and felt a little guilty for having staged the junior speaks first business that would mean the airplane doesnt try to go anywhere soonin other words before we can get the e down there which will give us both a more positive means of identification and communications herein other words take the shootitdownornot decision off the pilots shoulders and hand it to you then we get mcnabs people down there and they neutralize the airplanequietly very quietlybefore it gets in the air thats possible even if we shouldnt count on it by the time mcnab can get a c little birds etcetera to hurlburtwhich obviously wont be in the next hour or twoi should have heard from the cia where he can set the c down in suriname youve asked for that intel from the cia naylor asked im told general lawrence fremont of the cia said that it will take another couple of hours to get our man out toand back froman area about forty miles from the field that we show will take a c but the datas a couple of months old and we dont want mcnab to get there and find the field is either under water or filled with lumber or scrap metal i must tell the both of you im impressed with all youve done general naylor said now lets hear what general mcnab has to say get him on the secure line and put it on the speakerphone please wes yes sir sergeant major suggins said and went into the phone booth coming out in less than a minute youre up sir he said general mcnab please naylor said speaking sir youve been made aware the has been found in suriname yes sir well heres where we stand the secretary of defense has tasked centcom to neutralize the airplane everyone here is agreed that gray fox is the way to do it backed up by air force fighters which will intercept the plane should it take off before you can get your people there and either force it to land in suriname or shoot it down in other words sir what youre hoping is that a gray fox operation to keep the airplane on the ground could be put into play as soon as possible yes you want to tell me how you would proceed actually sir it probably will be less difficult than it seems were not going to have to land on a hostile airfield for one thing and i cant imagine that they are going to have any meaningful forces defending the airplane so what has to be done is to put a halfdozen little birdstwo gunships four troop carriersin a c with thirty men wait until i know where i could sit down the cive asked dia about possible landing areas i havent heard back yetand then go do it it is defined as anything from grabbing the airplane to blowing it up you think you could take over the airplane scotty i think thats possible sir and that would be the best thing to do this operation has to be done quietly scotty you understand yes sir i do staging out of where general mcfadden said hurlburt yes sir was that general mcfadden yes it is sir id appreciate any help you could provide about someplace to sit down the c im working on it scotty the cia has someoneas we speakconfirming that a field about fifty miles from zandery is usable between the cia and the dia we should have confirmation shortly thank you sir general mcnab said scotty how long would it take you to get an adequate team of your people and the little birds to hurlburt not long at all sir how much is not long at all in hours and minutes scotty naylor asked there was a tone of impatience in his voice as a matter of fact sir as we speak im in the shade of a cs wing watching the gulf of mexico lap on the sandy beaches of hurlburt do i understand you to say general naylor asked icily that you are at hurlburt field yes sir with six little birds and thirty stalwart special operators waiting for your order to go who authorized you to go to hurlburt general naylor asked coldly furious mr castillo suggested that if i organized the team and brought it to hurlburt it would save a good deal of time sir i could not fault his reasoning sir and acted accordingly you are referring to major castillo general in a way sir but i have been calling him mister that seemed appropriate inasmuch as he was at fort bragg as the personal representative of the president sir and in civilian clothing youre a goddamned lieutenant general scotty naylor exploded and you dont take goddamned suggestions from a goddamned major and you goddamn well know it with all respect sir hes not functioning as a major the national security advisor made it quite clear on the telephone that he was coming to bragg as the personal representative of the commander in chief sir and as i said sir i have acted accordingly naylor threw his hands up in outrage and disgust and looked around the room the officers and civilians at the conference table were looking anywhere but at him sergeant major suggins was standing just inside the phone booth making signs with his hands moving them between a gesture of prayer and a gesture meaning cool off naylor tried to collect himself thinking when you are angry you make bad decisions in direct proportion to the level of your anger you cannot afford to make a decision now you will regret later that sonofabitch ill nail his and charleys balls to the wall when this is over general mcnab general naylor ordered maintain your readiness to place this operation in action on my order and only on my order yes sir and when this is over you major castillo and i have a good deal to talk over yes sir naylor looked around the table does anyone else have anything for general mcnab naylor asked general mcnab general mcfadden asked is colonel torine readily available no sir hes not he went back to charleston no sir do you know where he is yes sir and are you going to tell me yes sir he should be in cozumel about now cozumel the island off the yucatan peninsula yes sir you dont happen to know what hes doing on a caribbean island do you he went there with mr castillo sir mr castillo said he needed an expert in series aircraft and colonel torine volunteered to go with him ill be a sonofabitch general mcfadden said thank you general mcnab yes sir well be in touch general mcnab general naylor said is there any part of my orders which you are to stand ready to implement this operation at my orders and only at my orders that you dont completely understand no sir naylor out general naylor said when you have your talk with general mcnab and this castillo fellow general id like to be there general mcfadden said what the hell did he take torine to cozumel for why the hell did torine go naylor threw up his hands in a sign of frustration there is a strong element of lunacy in special operators general and its highly contagious naylor offered resignedly he looked at lieutenant general potter who was his j special operations officer i was about to say no offense naylor said but goddammit george why should i apologize for stating the obvious no offense was taken general general potter said three cozumel international airport cozumel mexico june the preparations to get through mexican customs without having to explain shermans radio and their small arms turned out to be unnecessary as the lear trailed a follow me jeep down a taxiway at the small but grandly named cozumel international airport castillo saw an offbrown mexican customs ford f pickup truck and three white yukon xlswith heavily tinted windowsparked where they were apparently being directed a tall darkhaired man wearing powder blue slacks and a yellow shortsleeved shirtdressed for the golf coursewas sitting on the hood of one of the yukons aleksandr pevsner had come to the field himself to meet them castillo didnt see howard kennedy or any of pevsners bodyguards anywhere but theyre almost certainly in the yukons thats pevsner charley said but the odds are hes not calling himself that now play along with me two mexican customs officers armed with chromeplated acp semiautomatic pistols approached the lear as the engines wound down and charley opened the door welcome to cozumel one of them said in spanish may we come aboard of course charley said in spanish customs and immigration lasted no longer than it took for the customs officers to rubberstamp fernandos certificate of permission for unlimited frequent unscheduled entry into mexican airspace they didnt even look very closely at anyone in the cabin castillo waited until they had driven off in the pickup before getting out of the airplane pevsner smiling waved at him welcome to cozumel he called in spanish thank you senor charley replied in spanish as he walked to the yukon and pevsner slid nimbly off the hood they shook hands im afraid ive forgotten your name senor charley said why not call me dondiemo alex dondiemo pevsner said whats in a name robertos cousin perhaps pevsner smiled at him something like that he said and asked and who are you today an american golfer named charley castillo senor dondiemo funny i would have thought a snorkler pevsner said switching to english snorklers are usually busy looking for something anyway charley its good to see you again and who did you bring with you my cousin fernando lopez a copilot for the airplane and a i guess you could call him a super cellular telephone technician and thats all charley nodded and who are they really fernando is really my cousin the pilot is an air force colonel an expert in aircraft and the technician is really a special forces sergeant and no old associates of howards excuse me roberto not a one he was so worried about that that he just couldnt bring himself to come out here to greet you himself pevsner said he had no cause for worry castillo said i tried to tell him that pevsner said but howard is a worrier he gestureda casual wavein the direction of the two yukons behind his doors on both immediately opened and half a dozen men got quickly out they were all holding uzi submachine pistols charley recognized two of them from vienna one of them was the large east european who had pulled his jacket down skillfully immobilizing him when he had been meeting natures call in the mens room of the hotel sacher you can put those away pevsner ordered in russian and help our guests with their luggage he turned to charley and still in russian said why dont you ask your friends to join us charley what language are we going to speak good point charley pevsner said in russian and then switched to english how about english a good hotelier like alex dondiemo would speak pretty good english wouldnt you think charley smiled at him and asked and is it senor dondiemo alex of course charley were friends right i hope so charley said and waved at the airplane fernando got off first followed by colonel torine and sergeant sherman welcome to cozumel pevsner said offering his hand im alex dondiemo your innkeeper charley and i are old friends fernando lopez fernando said jack sherman sergeant sherman said jake torine mr dondiemo the bellmen will take care of your luggage pevsner said and its hot out here in the sun why dont we go to the hotel a little breakfast is probably in order he gestured toward the yukon and then walked around the front of it when charley got in he saw that there were two more bellmen sitting in the rear seat of the yukon what did he expect that an fbi swat team was going to erupt from the airplane slap cuffs on him and haul him off to the states he didnt think that was likely to happen but it could have and pevsner stays ahead of his game by expecting being thoroughly prepared for the unexpected when pevsner started up the yukon and began to move the yukon parked behind him got in front of him and stayed there on the threemile drive along a wide white beach to the grande cozumel beach and golf resort when pevsner cheerfully volunteered we like to think our beach is much nicer that miami much nicer than any i know in europe the only one i know as nice is in the florida panhandle around pensacola charley understood that pevsner was not going to talk about the airplane while they were in the yukon he thinks we might be wired keep that in mind charley he doesnt trust you four the grande cozumel beach and golf resort was larger than charley expected the main buildingthere were cottages as wellwas a sprawling fourstorey white building right on the beach there was a very verdant golf course as charley watched a longlegged blonde whose white shorts failed to conceal much of the cheeks of her derriere missed a long putt the main building had an underground garage access to which was guarded by a muscular mexican in a policetype uniform standing by a barrier that looked like it could stop anything up to an abrams tank they had just gotten out of the yukon when the third one with the bellmen carrying their luggage pulled into the garage they didnt have time to get into shermans suitcase or did they take nothing for granted charley there was a bank of elevators guarded by another man in a policetype uniform do they guard the elevators all the time or only when pevsners here they got in the elevator and pevsner put a key in the control panel then pushed a button marked penthouse b when the elevator started to move pevsner took the key from the control panel and handed it to castillo there will be more keys upstairs he said when the elevator door opened castillo saw they were in a small lobby there was only one exit from it open double doors showed a large living room overlooking the water as they walked through the lobby there was an electronic buzz usually pevsner said that goes off only when a departing guest has souvenirs in his clothing people just cant seem to bear to part with onesometimes more than oneof our silver bowls when they leave us somewhat sheepishly fernando reached under his shirt and came out with the acp semiautomatic pistol he had been carrying in the small of his back well while i admit there are people here who regard visiting north americans as an easy source of income pevsner said youre really not going to need that fascinating detector castillo said i guess it would detect anythingsay a wireright its a very good detector charley pevsner said well now that you know were not trying to steal your silver castillo said can we get to the business at hand absolutely pevsner said but first come in and say hello to another old friend of yours he gestured for them to pass through the double doors charley went first and as he entered the room howard kennedy walked up to him smiling and put out his hand mr dondiemo castillo said mr castillo kennedy said how good to see you he looked at pevsner did i hear a buzzer just now this is mr lopez pevsner said charleys cousin he has a and thats all howard were not wired charley said kennedy ignored the remark you said something about needing a flat roof he said and motioned for charley to follow him onto an unusually wide balcony furnished with upholstered castaluminum deck furniture kennedy pushed a button on the wall as he went through open slidingglass doors there was an electric hum and the awning shading the balcony began to retract will that do kennedy asked pointing to the roof sherman castillo called and sergeant sherman came out on the balcony castillo pointed to the roof sherman looked and then nodded ill probably even have room to put it far enough from the edge so it wont attract attention from the ground sherman said do you think you could find a bellman to show mr sherman how to get to the roof and help him with his luggage castillo asked as i told you on the phone charley your wish is our command kennedy said how long is that going to take you sherman castillo asked not long sherman said he went to his enormous hardsided suitcase removed the control panel and its laptopsized computer and put them on a small desk beside the windows leading to the balcony and then closed the suitcase when he started to pick it up pevsner snapped his fingers and two of the bellmen went quickly to him to take it from him sherman looked at castillo smiled and shrugged as if to say what the hell why not and then started after the men with the suitcase sherman touched the small of his back as if adjusting a pistol in his waistband sure hes got a pistol delta force like mr pevsner tries to be prepared for anything i wonder why the detector didnt pick it up or probably it did it picked up both pistols at the same time but only fernando fessed up alex my friend your security isnt as holeproof as you think as sherman went out of the apartment two whitejacketed waiters came in each pushing a serving cart before him i thought you might need a little something to eat after your flight pevsner said but before we do that has everyone met my cousin roberto sometimes called howard everyone shook hands with howard kennedy the waiters began laying out an elaborate breakfast buffet when one of the chrome domes over a large plate was removed castillo saw eggs benedict when they had finished setting up the buffet both waiters took up positions behind the tablesmuch like parade rest with their arms folded on the smalls of their backsand waited to make themselves useful pevsner snapped his fingers again said gracias and pointed toward the door the waiters quickly scurried out now that were alone alex castillo said are you going to tell us where the is have some eggs benedict charley theres plenty of time no there is not plenty of time castillo snapped wheres the goddamned airplane the look on howard kennedys face made it clear that pevsner was not used to being addressed in that tone of voice and that he wasnt at all sure how pevsner would react a cold look flashed across pevsners face quickly replaced by a smile if you eat your eggs benedict my friend i will tell you where it is not pevsner said there was a sharp whistle and a moment later sergeant sherman called coming down everybody looked at the balcony an electric extension cord began to come down from the roof followed immediately by a heavy flat tan rubbercovered cable fernando said ill get them and walked quickly onto the balcony and caught the extension cord and cable plug the electric cord into the wall sergeant sherman said it doesnt matter if its or not we have a builtin converter ill plug the cable in got it fernando called back we have volt current pevsner said alex where is it not castillo asked coldly its not at el vigia pevsner said it was but its gone wheres el vigia castillo asked visibly surprised about fifty miles south of lake maracaibo in venezuela pevsner said what about zandery suriname youre telling me its not in suriname whered you get that pevsner asked in surprise as far as i know its never been in suriname howard did you tell him anything about suriname only that it wasnt going there oh thats right the tendollaraminute phone in the plane cut us off before i could tell you that charley didnt it jesus christ castillo said weve been working on the premise that it went from gambia to suriname why the hell did they paint suriname numbers on it possibly theyre trying to confuse you pevsner said dryly adding flatly the went from gambia to el vigia how many fuel bladders were aboard torine asked thirteen were trucked into abeche howard kennedy answered what was it doing in el vigia whats in el vigia castillo asked theres a pretty good field there kennedy said originally built as a private field by shell to service their oil fields in lake maracaibo nobody could use it without shells permission after the venezuelans nationalized the oil industry it occurred to the powers that be that having a private airfielda noquestionsasked airfield one that could handle large jetscould sometimes be useful so its still a private landing strip so whats the doing there pevsner and kennedy looked at each other id rather not tell you until im sure pevsner said why not kennedy looked at pevsner for guidance pevsner gave it with a wave of his hand well when it comes to payback time for our cooperation in your investigation kennedy said i dont want somebodymy former colleagues are very good at thissaying well yeah he did tell castillo that the plane was in chad but wed have heard about that anyway and he did tell castillo that the was going to south america but where else could it have gone and when he told castillo that the airplane was in el vigia having thus and so done to it that was absolutely untrue pevsner gave castillo nothing we couldnt have gotten ourselves and therefore we owe him nothing tell me about thus and so howard castillo said kennedy put up both hands palms outward signaling not from me charley tell me charley pevsner asked do you think the government of venezuela would admit to any knowledge of a stolen airplane possibly in the hands of terrorists having flown to a private landing strip near lake maracaibo castillo met his eyes but didnt say anything or pevsner went on that while it was there it took on new registration numbersa fresh identityand a great deal of fuel much of it loaded into fuel bladders and then took off again took off for where castillo asked softly ive got a good idea but i dont want to tell you until im sure pevsner said i have to know what you think castillo said let me run an offthewall scenario past you kennedy said with the understanding that you know that this is not what mr dondiemo and i are telling you is likely to happen just for the sake of conversation all right okay charley saw fernando walk over to inspect the breakfast buffet then he found himself a chair carried it to the table the waiters had set up and then began to help himself to the food colonel torine was apparently inspired by fernandos hunger he got a chair and pulled it up to the table and then started filling a plate from the buffet the eggs benedict here are really quite nice charley pevsner said why dont you join them maybe because i would feel i was chewing while rome burns charley replied pevsner chuckled oh to hell with it i am hungry he found a chair and put it beside fernandos and then went to the buffet kennedy picked up another chair wordlessly offered it to pevsner who smiled and shook his head kennedy then put the chair beside that of colonel torine and went to the buffet table and poured himself a cup of coffee charley on tasting the eggs benedict smiled im pleased that you are pleased charley pevsner said they are to your satisfaction no theyre fine charley said okay howard shoot this scenario needs to take certain things as given kennedy began one of them is that the people who have this airplane are considerably more skilled than those who flew the s into the world trade center these guys are pilots skilled enough to flynavigatea across the atlantic supposition granted castillo said theyre graduates of the spartan school of aeronautics in tulsa what else you know who these people are pevsner asked surprised castillo nodded we even have their names and photographs how do you know kennedy asked almost openly suspicious well what the hell he used to be an fbi agent good cops check ill admit its circumstantial two guys from somalia mullahs were in philadelphia at a muslim temple the philadelphia copstheir counterterrorism peopletook their pictures and gave them to the fbi to run the fbi ran them and hit they were legally in the states to go to flight school we have confirmation from spartan so there is a philadelphia connection pevsner said circumstantial or not that sounds solid kennedy said the one thing the bureau is good at is making ids they can do that with a computer no original thought required he paused as if gathering his thoughts and then went on and knowing this it would be reasonable to assume several more things they may not know how close we are to them but they know were looking for the airplane so how would intelligent pilots get a to philadelphia its your offthewall scenario howard you tell me kennedy had just opened his mouth to speak when there was a faint musical rendition of the opening bars of strausss weiner blut pevsner took a cellular telephone from his trousers pocket he spoke in russian yes ti thats all he got call him back and make sure thats all he got he punched the hang up key and put the telephone back in his pocket and looked between castillo and kennedy im making up my mind whether i should tell you what that was pevsner said im concerned that charley might act impulsively everyone waited while he made up his mind it took no longer than thirty seconds but it seemed longer the pilot of an aircraft that had to make an unscheduled stopa warning light on the instrument panel suggested a hydraulic pressure problemat el vigia pevsner said finally reports that while the problem was being attended to he happened to see a aircraft in a hangar registration numbers and other painting were going on unfortunately all he could see was the ti prefix he said it was still dark damn charley said whats ti mean and that they were pulling masking tape from freshly painted red white and blue stripes on the vertical stabilizer pevsner added when was this charley asked about four hours ago pevsner said he had to wait until he got to boliviala pazbefore he could call ti is the costa rican registration suffix colonel torine said this pilot mr dondiemo if you call me mister pevsner said with a smile ill think youre suggesting i call you colonel not at all sir alex how reliable is this pilot does he work for you he flies for an air cargo company with which i have a certain relationship all of their pilots are reliable as a matter of fact now that i think about it this ones an american so theyre painting red white and blue stripes on the vertical stabilizer of a costa rican so what charley said el vigra is not a maintenance facility charley kennedy said but if you want to change an airplanes identity without anybody seeing you or asking questions okay castillo said looking out the window at the ocean view then turning to the others lets go with our now flying costa rican colors how does that fit in with your offthewall scenario i think it fits in very nicely now that ive a moment to think kennedy said okay lets pick up the scenario he stopped when sergeant sherman trailed by the large east european charley thought of as the guy who suckered me in the mens room came into the apartment pretty soon major sherman said as he sat down at the table where hed put the control box and the special laptop computer he plugged in the tan cable one possibility charley kennedy went on that you might wish to consider is that these people are going to substitute the airplane theyve stolen for an airplane that can approach philadelphia without causing suspicion an airplane that routinely goes to philadelphia jesus charley said for the sake of argument lets say a belonging to a costa rican airliner all that they would have to do would be make sure that the bona fide costa rican airplane wasnt in united states airspace at the same time how would they do that castillo asked and the answer sabotage the clean airplane quietly sabotage the clean airplane came to him as he spoke how do you think a mechanic in say san jose costa rica pevsner asked slowly would react to an offer often thousand dollars to do something to an aircraft that would take it out of service for twentyfour hours not blow it up nothing that would cause suspicion just take it temporarily out of service for a day what was marlon brandos line in the godfather make him an offer he cant refuse kennedy asked in this case he would probably have the choice between taking the ten thousand doing what he was asked to or having his wife and children disemboweled castillo looked over at sergeant sherman who sat wearing a small headset in front of the control device sherman how we doing castillo asked sherman held his left hand above his head the fingers extended one by one he folded them all green sir sherman said castillo walked to him and picked up a small telephone handset are we into philadelphia he asked major millers at city hall sherman said hes on a secure line to the arsenal base get him on castillo ordered sherman pushed several buttons lines green encryption green he said sergeant schneider bettys voice came very clearly down from the satellite castillo here can you get miller on here hold one major sergeant schneider said charley miller asked a moment later right did you get the word theyve located the in suriname no they havent its not in suriname and never has been what miller asked incredulously charley just before secretary hall and the commissioner went in to see the mayorthats where we are city hallhe had a call from the ciafrom the dci himselfthat the airplanes at a field called zandery in suriname thats what hes telling the mayor well the cia is wrong again mcnab has been ordered to neutralize it miller said hes already at hurlburt about to go wheelsup listen carefully dick this is what i need from you go out to the airport and find out what airplanes regularly landi dont mean on schedule just all the timefrom costa rica and get back to me find out what costa rican airline regularly goes to philadelphia were you listening charley did you hear what i said the cia has found the airplane confirmed they even have a visual thats not the one were looking for now goddammit do what youre told now he touched sergeant shermans shoulder get general mcnab on here five major h richard miller jr looked around the small room off the outer office of the mayor of the city of philadelphia there were three other people in it sergeant betty schneider of the philadelphia police department and supervisory special agents joel isaacson and thomas mcguire of the united states secret service interesting question isaacson said dryly who do you believe the director of central intelligence or don juan ill go with don juan agent mcguire said he sounded very sure of himself sergeant schneider said don juan is always very sure of himself isaacson said which is not the same thing as saying hes always right i dont have the faintest idea where to get that information at the airport or that theyll give it to me without a lot of hassle ill go out there with you sergeant tom mcguire said maybe my badge plus my irish charm will be useful you think i should barge in the mayors office and tell secretary hall miller asked not without more to go on than what don juan told you i dont isaacson said but i think you should do what don juan wants done anytime youre ready sergeant tom mcguire said i just had a wild hair sergeant schneider said thoughtfully she took out her cellular scrolled through the names and numbers displayed on it and pushed the call button when she had found it mr halloran this is sergeant schneider betty schneider remember me this is a strange question mr halloran but please bear with me off the top of your head do you know of any airline from costa rica that comes to philadelphia frequently i dont mean a passenger service especially oh you do know one could you tell me about it please less than sixty seconds later she covered the microphone with her hand and said bingo i think youd better get castillo back dick and thirty seconds after that miller reported the channels in use keep trying sergeant schneider ordered six before you say anything charley lieutenant general bruce j mcnab said let me tell you the latest words of general allan naylor visavis you and me youre a goddamned lieutenant general you dont take goddamned suggestions from a goddamned major and you goddamn well know it he found out youre at hurlburt castillo asked but it was a statement not a question yes he did and apparently hes not nearly as impressed with your status as the personal representative of the president as i hoped he would be well ill take the heat sir i still think it was a good idea to preposition at hurlburt thats very noble of you charley but hes right lieutenant generals should not take suggestions from majors and if they do they should expect to feel the heat whats up the airplane is somewhere in costa rica its been rerenumbered and rerepainted jesus are you sure the only reason were not on our way to suriname right now is because they havent been able to find us someplace where we can sit the c down its not in suriname castillo said you got that from your friend the russian arms dealer right right my god charley fort meade has photographs of the airplane at zandery the cia guy in suriname made a visual and youre telling me they have the wrong airplane yes sir they probably have a photograph of an air suriname with the right numbers because its an air suriname the airplane the holy legion of muhammad has is probably in costa rica where in costa rica i dont know that yet have you told anybody else this no sir what ive done is send miller out to the airport in philadelphia to see what airplanes from costa rica routinely land there what theyre obviously trying to do is get into the philadelphia area without ringing alarm bells how are they going to do that mcnab asked dubiously he thinks ive lost my mind have i by immobilizing a bona fide costa rican for twentyfour hours and sending the one they have in its place youre going to have a tough time selling that to naylor he already thinks youre drunk out of your mind with authority you dont have what if im right general castillo said and im not going to try to sell general naylor anything im going to tell secretary hall i work for him not general naylor charley mcnab said softly youre an army officer assigned to centcorn j castillo didnt reply for a moment then he said general until im told otherwise i will continue to obey the last orders i havewhich are from the presidentto coordinate with you the neutralizing of the in that capacity i am recommending to you that you prepare to neutralize the in costa rica it took mcnab ten seconds to reply what the hell mr castillo in for a penny in for a pound im now going to report to secretary hall what ive learned castillo said ill let you know what he says do that mcnab said mcnab out charley touched sergeant shermans shoulder get me philadelphia again please coming up sherman said and a moment later all green encryption green miller sergeant schneider major put miller on please i think you better hear this first betty schneider said costa rican air transport makes frequent flights into philadelphia using its aircraft at least once a week sometimes two or three times jesus that was quick castillo said are you sure halloranleaseairesold them the airplane he services it when its here flowers into philadelphia and household goods into san jose flowers and household goods fresh flowers they grow them in costa rica and fly them here to sell in supermarkets and the household goods are for americans who retire down there they can bring their household stuff into costa rica without paying any duty on it jesus christ theres the connection castillo said theres more betty schneider said on the way up here they stop at tampa go through customs there drop off some flowers and then come here as a domestic flight castillo said not an international flight right and obviously there would be no questions asked when they topped off their tanks castillo said wheres secretary hall in the mayors office with the commissioner get him on here betty i dont think he or the mayors going to like being interrupted go get him castillo said chapter xviii one office of the mayor city hall broad and market streets philadelphia pennsylvania june what is it thats so important charley the secretary of homeland security said impatiently into the secure telephone leaving unspoken the rest of the question that you decided you should interrupt my meeting with the mayor castillo knew what had not been said the is not in suriname mr secretary castillo said you mean its taken off no sir what i mean is that the stolen in angola was never in suriname the dci obviously has information including satellite imagery and a visual by his station chief that youre apparently not aware of the air suriname at zandery sir is a legitimate air suriname the one were looking for with a new identity is somewhere in costa rica you have this from your friend the arms dealer right matthew hall asked half sarcastically half sadly yes sir castillo said but sergeant schneider has just made the philadelphia connection which confirms what im telling you what did she do what pevsner suggestedhes in the process of finding out morewas that the holy legion of muhammad plans to get through our security by substituting the airplane they have for an airplane that routinely comes to philadelphia schneider found there is an airplane owned by costa rican air transport that flies fresh flowers to philadelphia at least once a week leaseaire sold them the airplane and they service it when its in philadelphia this ties in with what pevsner told me that our airplane was at a private strip in venezuela getting repainted as a costa rican air transport plane secretary hall looked across the small room at sergeant betty schneider who was leaning against the wall he was aware that joel isaacson tom mcguire and major h richard miller jr were looking at him waiting for his reaction that means they know about this philadelphia connection and if they let miller burst into the mayors office they believe it i would expect miller to go with castillo theyre like brothers but joel and tom too jesus christ i just finished convincing the mayor that the national security agencys satellites found the airplane in suriname that the cia verified on the ground that its the airplane weve been looking for and the president has ordered all necessary steps be taken to neutralize it that that operation is already under way and the situation is under control and theres no reason for further concern and now im supposed to go back in there and tell him sorry a little problem has come up the first thing hes going to do is order an evacuation of center city and go on television to tell the people there is a genuine threat of an airliner crashing into the liberty bell sir are you still there castillo asked hang on a minute charley while i think secretary hall said he looked at sergeant betty schneider again you believe this philadelphia connection sergeant yes sir it seems to fit im going back in the mayors office and tell him and commissioner kellogg that i have to go back to washington immediately hall said carefully to the white house she nodded tom have them get the airplane ready hall ordered mcguire turned his back and spoke softly into a microphone in the lapel of his jacket inasmuch as i still believe the situation is under control that we will be able to neutralize the airplane i am not going to tell the mayor of this development hall said he let that sink in a moment sergeant i would like an escort to the airport i have to get there as quickly as possible ill be happy to give you an escort mr secretary betty schneider said if on the way to the airport sergeant i told you i thought it would be helpful if you went to washington with me what would your reaction be please take a moment to think over your answer betty schneider pursed her lips and exhaled audibly you understand i think what im asking and why hall added she nodded major castillo does have a way of upsetting the apple cart doesnt he she asked softly just when you think things are under control up he pops joel isaacson chuckled mr secretary sergeant schneider said my orders from chief inspector kramer are to provide you with any support you asked for if you asked me to go with you to washington im sure i would go thank you secretary hall said he put the secure telephone to his ear again charley yes sir you dont know where in costa rica no sir but according to colonel torine there are only two airports in the country thatll take a hold one sir now what hall snapped impatiently sir mr my friend tells me that he is working on a positive location and should have it shortly he said to tell you hes doing the very best he can tell him thank you hall said and then went on charley im on my way to the white house stay close by the phone i strongly suspect that our boss is going to want to talk to you sir i was about to head for costa rica and while youre doing that youll be out of touch its about seven hundred miles from here figure an hour and a half in the air and thirty minutes to shut down the radio here and get to the airport ill be out of touch for a little over two hours sir you really think you have to go there yourself cant we get the cia or meade to find the airplane for us i think it would be best if i went myself sir yeah and so do i when the cia learns that based on flawed information from them gray fox is about to violate the sacred territory of suriname and neutralize probably blow up a perfectly legitimate airplane langleys first reaction is going to be denial and way down the pike taking action maybe to fix the problem get back in touch as soon as you can yes sir of course secretary hall put the handset back in its cradle miller i want you to come with us he ordered yes sir hall started for the door to the mayors office i wont be long he said two penthouse b the grande cozumel beach and golf resort cozumel mexico june okay sherman get general mcnab again castillo ordered five seconds later sherman reported the link is down major oh shit castillo said get bragg and see if they know why already working on it sir sherman said and almost immediately im getting some green leds on general mcnab major okay sir were all up general mcnab please castillo said into the headset and now what major castillo mcnab himself answered general we have confirmation of what i told you before its now almost certain that the stolen airplane has been repainted with the color scheme of costa rican air transport which regularly flies into philadelphia with flowers from costa rica and they intend to you did say mcnab interrupted did you not major flies into philadelphia with flowers from costa rica yes sir thats what i said flowers grown in costa rica and sold in supermarkets in the states they go through customs in tampa how convenient for general naylor and centcom they can just hop in a couple of humvees drive over to tampa international and neutralize it there please sir let me finish why not where they can top off the tanks and then file a flight plana domestic flight planto philadelphia and how are they going to explain to the customs people in tampa why they are carrying so much fuel in us army fuel bladders i dont know sir castillo confessed what was secretary halls reaction to this fascinating scenario you did tell him yes sir he told me hes on his way to washington to the white house and thats all sir you probably wont have a security clearance much longer so i probably shouldnt be telling you this but for auld lang syne with warm memories of happier times i will i have received further orders from general naylor i am immediately to proceed to a field near kwakoegron suriname there to hold myself in readiness to neutralize an air suriname when ordered to do so in compliance with these orders i am presently i would estimate about forty or fifty miles south of hurlburt field over the gulf of mexico yes sir keep in touch charley mcnab out it would appear charley alex pevsner said as castillo laid the headset on the table that no one seems willing to call off the plan to neutralize the wrong airplane in suriname once something like that is started its hard to call it off castillo said the only one who can overrule general naylor is the secretary of defense hes not going to take what i think over the cia especially since the source of your information is an infamous russian criminal pevsner asked secretary hall doesnt feel that way castillo said you heard what he said and hes going to see the president and you think the president looking at nsa photographs of an air suriname on the field at zandery and with confirmation from a cia man on the ground is liable to decide thathow did that general describe you earlieran army officer assigned to special operations at central commandis right and theyre wrong especially since he knows im the source of your information when i get on the radio and say im in zippity do dah costa ricaor wherever the hell it islooking at the airplane theyre going to have to pay attention he touched sergeant shermans shoulder pack it up sergeant were going to costa rica hold it a minute castillo colonel torine said before you shut down the link what if i got on there to general mcfadden and tell him i thinkim sureyoure right he paused and added we go back a long way castillo met his eyes the most probable thing that would happen if we contacted anybody at macdill would be that you would be ordered to place me under arrest and bring me to macdill i dont want to put you in that spot but thank you sir he paused and added colonel i think the best thing for you to do is escape from this drunkoutofhismindwithauthorityhedoesnthave lunatic go to the airport and hop on a commercial flight to tampa well youre right about authority you dont have castillo youre a major as general mcnab pointed out you cant give a colonel orders colonel torine said and general mcnab said two other things he ordered me to go with you saying you needed a expert as i recall sir you volunteered castillo said that was my last order which i intend to obey torine said and the second thing general mcnab said that struck me as appropriate was in for a penny in for a pound he met castillos eyes for a moment then turned to sergeant sherman is there any way i can help you tear that thing down sergeant ive got it pretty much under control sir sherman said major do you want me to sign out of the net just turn it off sergeant castillo said before it occurs to general naylor to get on there and order us all to the states sergeant sherman leaned slightly forward pulled the power cord from the wall and reported the link is down sir aleksandr pevsner picked up the hotel telephone have the vehicles prepared to go immediately to the airport he ordered in spanish we will be in the garage immediately thank you castillo said thank you for everything alex on the contrary my friend pevsner said it is i who is grateful to you you have made every effort to live up to your side of our arrangement its not your fault that emperors czars and highranking generals have the tendency to want to kill the messenger bearing news they dont want to hear and somewhere down the road charley howard kennedy said no matter what happens someonepossibly even one of my former colleaguesis going to say thats what pevsner was trying to tell us and its even possible this will be said with the right people listening he offered his hand and charley shook it and then shook hands with pevsner and as he did thought it would be a long time before he saw pevsner again if he ever saw either of them again he was surprised when pevsner went to the basement garage with them and even more surprised when pevsner got behind the wheel of one of the yukons obviously intending to drive to the airport as they were driving down the beach road to the airport pevsner turned to howard kennedy who was riding in the second seat beside fernando and ordered write down the san jose numbersall three of themand give them to charley howard yes sir kennedy said what san jose numbers castillo asked there are three pevsner said i really hope you dont have occasion to use any of them the one with the prefix almost always knows how to get in touch with me quickly the other two are those who will have what information i can come up with about where in costa rica you will find the plane i hope to get that information to you as an inflight advisory but if that doesnt work call either of the other two numbers ask for yourself excuse me ask for charley castillo better yet ask for karl gossinger you getting this howard yes sir ask for karl gossinger and theyll give you what information they have if im unsuccessful they will not know who herr gossinger is and say so thank you castillo said please dont call any of them unless it proves necessary and if the first two have no information for you that means i havent been able to do as much as i would really like to have done pevsner said in other words there would be no point in your trying to call me i understand charley said castillo felt a hand on his shoulder and turned his head howard kennedy was extending a sheet of notebook paper to him he took it try not to lose that charley kennedy said and when the time passes and you know youre not going to use any of them why dont you burn that id really hate to have those numbers fall into the wrong hands you think your former associates would be interested in them do you oh would they ever kennedy said ten minutes later aleksandr pevsner and howard kennedy stood by the hood of one of the white yukons and watched as the learjet took off three aboard usaf c degrees north latitude degrees west longitude above the gulf of mexico june miami area control air force sixtyseveneightyeight major ellwood c tanner usaf said into his microphone go ahead eightyeight reporting my position im at flight level thirtythree estimating six hundred knots on a course of onetwofive true i have you on radar eightyeight be advised any eastward deviation from your present course may put you in cuban airspace acknowledge advisory air force eightyeight clear major tanner said and made a note of the conversation on a knee notepad got a chart i can look at major a voice asked and tanner turned to see lieutenant general bruce j mcnab standing in the cockpit between the pilot and copilot positions yes sir of course tanner said were a hundred miles off the florida coast about even with miami i saw that mcnab said gesturing in the vague direction of a cathoderay tube that showed the cs position and then holding his hand out for the chart tanner handed it to him and mcnab studied it for a moment then held it out to tanner see where im pointing mcnab asked tanner looked yes sir costa rica specifically juan santamaria international airport in costa rica general mcnab said yes sir now what you are going to do major as soon as you think cuban radar has lost interest in us is get on the horn and make an announcement that to avoid turbulence you would like to change your course to about oneseventytwo degrees which will put us on a course to juan santamaria sir if there are any questions about why youre changing course i dont want juan santamaria to enter the conversation understood yes sir if i told you that were probably going to experience mechanical problems when juan santamaria is the closest alternate then you would think i was prescient wouldnt you yes sir i guess i would good it is valuable for junior officers to believe their seniors have mysterious abilities and know things they dont major tanner smiled at lieutenant general mcnab this was not the first gray fox mission he had flown for special operations but it was the first one hed flown on which mcnab was being carried knowing this colonel jake torine had briefed major tanner and two other pilots on what they might expect from the legendary special forces officer the two cogent points of the briefing were to expect the unexpected and dont ask any questions or express an opinion unless asked to do so major tanner elected to violate one of the teachings of the briefing sir is that where the we missed in chad is mcnab looked at him coldly there is an old saying in the army major that lieutenants should not marry captains may marry and majors should be very careful about being prescient it probably has an application for the air force yes sir tanner said we usually stop getting pinged by cuban radar about here he pointed at the chart and i wouldnt be surprised if we started to encounter some upperlevel turbulence a few miles south of that point youve been warned about premature prescience major mcnab said and smiled at him general mcnab then climbed down from the cockpit and went into the cargo bay despite the size of the enormous aircraft it was crowded six little birds their rotors folded took up much of the space there were four fivehundredgallon fuel bladders lashed to the floor there were crates of ammunition and rockets and rations and perhaps thirty plastic coolers that bore the bright red legend base exchange hurlburt field home of air force special operations scattered throughout the cargo bay sitting on whatever they could find to sit on except the uncomfortable aluminumpipeandnylonsheeting standard seats were thirty gray fox special operatorssix officers twelve senior enlisted men and the twelve little bird pilots one of the pilots was a captain one a lieutenant and the others chief warrant officers two of whom were cwos whose pay was only slightly less than that of a lieutenant colonel all the pilots in addition to being carefully selected and highly trained army aviators with a minimum of a thousand hours in the air as pilot in command were also fully trained and qualified as special forces soldiers their mission once they had delivered the gray fox team to the ground was to switch roles from helicopter pilots to what everybody called shooters there were also a halfdozen mechanics whose primary function was the folding of little bird rotor blades loading the little birds onto the c and then unloading them unfolding the rotor blades and making sure they were safe to fly when the c touched down there were also two avionics technicians to make sure everything electronic on the little birds was functioning properly and two armorers to handle the weaponry the technicians too were all fully qualified special forces soldiers and when the little birds had taken off they too would switch to being shooters and establish a perimeter guard around the globemaster just about everybody was drinking a coke or a up or munching on an icecream bar on a stick or wolfing down a hot dog heated in one of two microwave ovens that were carried along routinely even if they didnt appear on any list of equipment the base exchange at hurlburt had had a good day general mcnab would not have been at all surprised if some of the plastic coolers from the exchange held six maybe eight cases of beer on ice he hadnt asked or looked nor was he worried his people were pros they wouldnt take a sip until the job was done and threequarters of the way down the cargo bay on the only upholstered chair in the bay a gray fox special operator sat before a folddown shelf that held one of onetime sergeant aloysius francis caseys latest communications devices he had just stuffed perhaps a third of a chiliandonion dog in his mouth when he saw general mcnab walking toward him he started to chew furiously as he started to stand up mcnab signaled for him to keep his seat and waited for him to finish chewing i understand were having a little communications problem sergeant kensington general mcnab said yes sir kensington replied momentarily confused at first then following everything but imagery is down i understand sergeant kensington turned to the control panel and flipped switches green leds went out as he did so yes sir nothings green but imagery well you never can really predict when these things are going to work and when theyre not can you no sir you never really can mcnab touched his shoulder smiled at him and walked forward in the cargo bay he caught the eye of one of the cwos a massivewell over six feet and two hundred poundsblack man named shine whose bald skull reflected light and was thus logically known to his peers as shiny shine and motioned him over a nobullshitthegeneral answer shine mcnab said once i give you the coordinates how long will it take you to program the computers sir thats done we can be in the air in no more than ten minutes after the door opens you never listen to me shine thats probably why youre not a general were not going to suriname general i didnt say that shine come on boss i have to know ive got a bag full of cds of approaches to south american airfields maybe one of thems what you need if so all ill need is fifteen minutes to reprogram otherwise itll take me an hour maybe a little more you got anything in your bag for costa rica by chance i dont know boss ill have to check why dont you do that and let me know yes sir keep it as quiet as you can when they see me going in the bag theyll know something is up let them worry itll keep them on their toes youre a badass general mr shine said smiling with all possible respect sir mcnab walked farther forward in the cargo bay opened one of the white plastic coolers took out a hot dog a roll put the hot dog in the roll spread it heavily with chili and chopped onions and put it into one of the microwave ovens four the oval office the white house pennsylvania avenue nw washington dc june his plate is pretty full the chief of staff to the president of the united states said to the secretary of homeland security is this going to take long matthew hall gave the appearance of someone who was annoyed had been about to say something unpleasant but had changed his mind and instead said something else is natalie cohen in there he asked if shes not send for her he then opened the door to the oval office and went in denying the chief of staff his privilege of going in first to announce him the president was sitting in one of two upholstered chairs facing a coffee table secretary of defense frederick k beiderman was sitting on the couch on the other side of the coffee table the president looked up from pouring coffee speak of the devil the president said how did things go in philadelphia do we have one highly pissed off mayor on our hands were probably going to have one mr president hall said you couldnt convince him that the problem is under control with some difficulty sir i think i did the problem is the problem is that the problem is not under control theres been a problem neutralizing the airplane in suriname i didnt think theyd even had time to get there the airplane in suriname is not the the terrorists have mr president hall said what the president asked incredulously tell that to the dci beiderman said he even has a visual from a cia agent down there i intend to tell the dci fred hall said pointedly but i thought the president should hear it first where are you getting your information matt from the russian from the russian yes sir via major castillo but theres more sir what more weve made i dont know why i said we i had nothing to do with it when i heard this first from castillo frankly i was as dubious as you mr president but then when i heard everything i became a convert what everything the president asked impatiently the philadelphia policewith the at first somewhat reluctant help of the fbihave identified the people who stole the airplane pevsner said they were somalians and they are they were in philadelphia as mullahs and the counterterrorism people there took their pictures and made a positive id made a positive id of who dr natalie cohen asked entering the room i presume im invited to this meeting youre invited but youre probably not going to like it the president said mr president hall continued ive got major miller and a philadelphia police counterterrorism officer sergeant schneider with me i think maybe if you heard all this from them it would be better than bring them on the president ordered impatiently then asked the same major miller yes sir hes been in philadelphia the president gestured impatiently for hall to bring them in hall went to the door mr president the chief of staff said the moment it opened youve got the speaker in ten minutes stall him the president ordered will you come in please hall called first sergeant betty schneider and then major h richard miller jr who was in civilian clothing entered the oval office both were visibly nervous good morning dr cohen said approaching them with her right hand extended my name is natalie cohen thank you for coming i expect you recognize the president the gentleman with him is secretary of defense beiderman the president who had risen from his chair when cohen came into the office walked to betty schneider and put out his hand were all anxious to hear what you have to tell us he said with a warm smile and added as he gave his hand to miller what the both of you have to tell us and ive been anxious to meet you major both said yes sir you take it betty miller ordered ill fill in im very sorry but i have to go to the restroom betty schneider said right now just come with me dear dr cohen said and led her through a door in under a minute the national security advisor was back nobody thinks thats funny right she challenged good okay major youre up miller exhaled audibly ill take it from the top he began from the beginning we thought there might be a philadelphia connection it came together one piece at a time starting with the fact that the is owned by leaseaire in philadelphia and then castillos russian told him in vienna castillos russian the president chuckled yes sir i regret the choice of words i shouldnt have interrupted you the president said please go on the russian national sometimes known as aleksandr pevsner miller began again this time more formally who made contact with major castillo in vienna told major castillo he believed there was a philadelphia connection although he gave no reason but as one item of intel after another castillo got from pevsnerthat the airplane was in chad for example that it had been repainted with suriname registry numbersproved to be accurate castillo began to place more credence in the philadelphia connection theory it was there but at first we didnt know where to look for it youre saying major that the information this man pevsner has provided has been both accurate and valuable beiderman interrupted yes sir everything hes told us so far has been right on the money there is just no reason not to believe the latest intel hes given us which is natalie cohen asked softly thats right you came in after the movie started didnt you the president said the last tidbit from castillos russian is that we are about to violate the sovereign territory and airspace of suriname and neutralize the wrong airplane my god cohen said wheres the one were looking for if its not in suriname somewhere in costa rica maam miller said with a new identity wow dr cohen said sergeant betty schneider came into the room im very sorry she said and more than a little embarrassed dont be silly the president said that happens all the time to matt hall every time he suspects that im displeased with him jesus hall said dr cohen looked at the president in disbelief shook her head then smiled and finally giggled betty schneider looked at her and then the president with enormous relief the major was about to tell us all right if i call you betty cohen asked yes maam betty the major was about to tell us what you think these people are going to do with the airplane and exactly how they plan to do it cohen said why dont you give it a shot betty gathered her thoughtsnot as completely as she thought she hadand began well when charley called from mexico charley being major castillo the president interrupted yes sir and whats he doing in mexico the president asked almost rhetorically he was in cozumel mr president hall said at the moment hes on his way to costa rica same purpose finding and neutralizing the airplane dumb question the president said hows he moving around cohen asked im concerned about airspace territorial violations his family has an airplane a lear xr hall said he borrowed that his family has a xr no wonder he can afford to live in the mayflower dr cohen said it also probably has something to do with his secret service code name the president said excuse me dr cohen asked don juan the president said obviously pleased with himself then he saw dr cohens face and that she was obviously not amused and looked at sergeant schneider and went on what about when he called from mexico betty when castillo told major miller and i to go to the airport and find out what airlines regularly flew into philly from costa rica betty replied i played a hunch and got lucky and called terrence halloran who owns leaseaire who owns the missing and asked him what he knew about costa rican airlines flying into philly he knew of one right away hed sold a to an outfit called costa rican air transport they fly wholesale flowers grown down there into philly at least once a week they sell them in supermarkets the somalians are going to substitute the stolen airplane for a legitimate costa rican airplane dr cohen asked right natalie hall said castillo told me the russian told him that the airplane was flown from africa to a private field in venezuela near lake maracaibo and given new numberscosta rican numbersthere castillos russian is a virtual cornucopia of useful reliable information isnt he the president said not at all pleasantly how nice if we could say the same about the cia no one said anything for a moment miller finally broke the silence theres more mr president they pass through customs at tampa on their way to philadelphia which means when they move on to philadelphia theyre a domestic flight not an international flight and theyll have clearance to approach the philadelphia airport its what we cops call circumstantial mr president betty said now having lost her nervousness no positive concrete takeittothebank proof but everything fits the president raised his hand in a signal to stop fred the president ordered call off the invasion of suriname call it off mr president secretary of defense beiderman asked a complete standdown i dont want those fs shooting down a surinamese airplane i dont care what you call it just see that its done yes mr president beiderman said and walked toward a credenza that held two telephones or the cia blowing one up on the ground the president went on as if to himself he picked up a telephone handset from the coffee table said get me the dci ill hold it took less than twenty seconds to get the director of central intelligence on the line this is the president john now listen carefully as i have time neither to repeat myself nor explain nor debate it i want no action of any kind taken in suriname none period ill get back with you shortly and explain this but right now i want you to call off whatever you may have planned thank you he hung up he exhaled looked around the room smiled at sergeant schneider and major miller and then had another thought which caused the smile to fade and how did the mayor of philadelphia react on being informed that we still have a little problem with the liberty bell he asked i didnt tell him mr president matt hall said he would have immediately gone on tv and ordered the evacuation of center city philadelphia jesus the president said well hes going to find out sooner or later how do we deal with that theres no reason he ever has to find out mr president hall said the presidents eyebrows rose in surprise and it was a moment before he asked presuming we can neutralize the real airplane right yes sir worstcase scenario the airplane leaves costa rica and makes it to tampa where we grab it on the ground hall said that presumes they wont have a change of mind en route and fly it into a cruise ship parked in miami harbor disney world or some other target that makes about as much sense we have to do better than that matt the president said shoot it down the minute it leaves costa rica beiderman said over international waters what we are going to try to do the president said is quietly neutralize it on the ground in costa rica i emphasize the word quietly is there any reason gray fox cant be trusted to do that presuming we can find the airplane in costa rica no sir gray fox is presently airborne on its way to suriname mr president secretary beiderman said i called the invasion of suriname off the president said and now there was a very nasty tone in his voice werent you here when i gave that order fred sir normally we have instantaneous communication with a gray fox transport but at the moment theres a glitch it happens sir sunspots other things you mean we are not in contact with gray fox for the moment no sir how far is it away from suriname the president asked several hours sir between now and the time it gets to suriname mr secretary of defense i want you to get word to general mcnab that he is to divert to costa rica there to await further orders in connection with his original mission jesus christ fred send fs after him and force him to turn around if that becomes necessary yes sir where in costa rica mr president general mcnab is a resourceful fellow why dont we let him decide that the door to the oval office opened mr president the speaker is here the chief of staff said well for the moment were finished here the president said but id like everybody to keep themselves available why dont we all go to my office natalie cohen said and have a cup of coffee and a danish five office of the national security advisor the white house pennsylvania avenue nw washington dc june im going to the situation room secretary of defense fred beiderman announced i feel like a schoolboy in here waiting to be called back to the principals office maybe theyve managed to reestablish contact with mcnab anyone want to go with me i will secretary of homeland security matthew hall said i thought i would take betty and major miller to the executive mess for lunch national security advisor dr natalie cohen said good idea hall said well meet you there secretary hall major h richard miller jr said may i have a minute sir shoot hall said alone sir if you would please sir you want to wait fred or should i catch up with you hall asked catch up with me beiderman said ill walk slow he went through the door ill take betty and leave you two alone dr cohen said you can hear this maam miller said i just didnt want secretary beiderman to hear it i just realized he will anyway so it doesnt make any sense neither are you making any sense major hall said its about getting through to general mcnab sir i dont think all the communication is down i dont understand hall said sir ive been on missions like this one when it gets close to doing something theres often a link that goes down i dont understand hall said i think i do natalie cohen said there is a point in time after which thank you just the same general mcnab doesnt want anyone looking over his shoulder offering friendly advice he wants to get on with the job yes ma am now you know why he didnt want fred to hear this cohen said and turned back miller you know how to get through to him usually he leaves the imagery link open miller said i dont know what that means hall said it means hes still able to receive an image some people know that miller said if its important theyll send him one an image a picture hall asked yes sir of what hall asked of a message right major dr cohen asked yes maam youre saying you can get through to him with an image of a message hall asked when miller nodded hall added well were going to have to tell beiderman that of course maybe not natalie cohen said would he take a message from you major yes maam i think he would how would that work id write the message here fax it out to the nebraska avenue place and tell the operator to send it miller said nebraska avenue castillo set up a gray fox radio out there hall said dr cohen pulled open a drawer of her desk took out a sheet of paper and handed it and a ballpoint pen to miller go she said maam have you got a felttip a magic marker i need something big coming up she said and went back to her desk drawer thank you miller said mr secretary im going to need the numbers fax and phone out there hall went into the outer office where isaacson and mcguire were waiting i need the numbers phone and fax for nebraska avenue he said by the time isaacson had retrieved the numbers from his handheld computer written them down given them to hall and hall went back into cohens office miller had already fed the sheet of paper into the fax machine on the credenza behind cohens desk he gave them to miller who immediately punched them into the fax machine the machine began to feed itself the paper did you see that hall asked cohen she shook her head no need to she said miller punched the numbers of the nebraska avenue office into his cellular this is major miller i just sent you a fax image it to general mcnabnow ill hold for confirmation of receipt the fax machine finished expelling the sheet of paper natalie cohen took it read it and handed it hall let betty read thatshes entitledand then burn it natalie cohen said burn it hall asked as he handed the sheet of paper to betty schneider theres no reason fred has to know about this natalie cohen said betty finished reading the message and handed it back to hall who read it again the white house washington dc dr natalie cohen national security advisor go all green now the president is trying to order gen mcnab to divet to costa rica you dont think beiderman is entitled to know about this hall asked entitled maybe natalie cohen said like the mayor of philadelphia was entitled to know the cia hasnt really found the airplane did you tell him matt he raised his eyebrows and shrugged his shoulders a confession that he hadnt both of these young people had to make a tough choice between two correct loyalties dr cohen said betty to come here with you without telling her superiors in the cops what she knew about the notfound airplane which some people would consider disloyal and miller had to tell you about general mcnabs selective communications setup which made him feel disloyal to mcnab both made the right choice there is not panic in the streets in philadelphia and i wouldnt be surprised if beiderman shortly can communicate with general mcnab so leave it there matt please she put out her hand anybody got a match secretary hall laid a somewhat battered zippo in dr cohens palm six aboard usaf c degrees north latitude degrees west longitude above the atlantic ocean june how very interesting lieutenant general bruce j mcnab said and handed the message back to the sergeant kensington who was manning the control panel i think you better put this in there he pointed to the burn bag tied to kensingtons shelf which was actually a small canvas bag holding three thermite grenadestwo for the radio one for messagesin case it became necessary to destroy either or both to keep them from falling into the wrong hands kensington did so then looked at mcnab who made a push em up gesture with this fingers kensington turned to the control panel and started flipping switches coming up all green sir kensington said i wonder where miller got that stationery mcnab asked knowing the major sir no telling sergeant kensington said we did not get any images right no sir we didnt the image link must have been down too see if you can get general naylor on here for me will you please mcnab asked mcnab sir we had a little communications problem so i thought i had better check in with you sir where are you general we just came out of the gulf into the atlantic sir the pilot estimates we have about four hours to go that would put us theres been a change of orders general yes sir the president directs that you divert to costa rica costa rica either to tomas guardia international on the west coast or juan santamaria which serves san joseyour choicethere to prepare to neutralize the airplane were looking for i thought it was in suriname sir that was apparently faulty intel general yes sir do you see where this is going to pose any problems general no sir i can probably be on the ground at either field in say a little over an hour let me know when you get close to the coast naylor ordered were trying to get you permission to enter their airspace if that doesnt come through youll have to practice some sort of deception yes sir i understand ill think of something your further orders again from the president general are to neutralize this airplane as quietly as possible yes sir i understand neutralize as quietly as possible well be in touch sir are you in a position to tell me where the airplane were looking for in costa rica is specifically i mean not at this time when i have that information youll get it the cia is working on it and they are in the process of moving satellites yes sir well if the cias working on it then well certainly know for sure where the airplane is wont we sir naylor out seven office of the commanding general united states central command macdill air force base tampa florida june general albert mcfadden usaf walked without knocking into the office of general allan naylor usa and stood before his desk for twenty seconds before naylor sensedor chose to acknowledgehis presence the bestlaid plans of mice and menyou ever hear that allan mcfadden asked what went wrong now naylor asked i was just talking with larry fremont mcfadden said hes been on the phone to the cia guy in san jose costa rica and the cia guy says the way the costa rican foreign ministry is going to handle our ambassadors request for permission to enter their airspace is to stall for at least a couple of days we expected something like that naylor said so we land without do what has to be done and let the state department pick up the pieces so i would interpret that to mean you believe the cia thats a loaded question al you want to shoot crap allan how about taking another chance on the cia what are you talking about you sound like you know something mcfadden laid a small map on naylors desk what am i looking at thats the golfo de nicoya okay theres nothing on the map but dirt roads and water larrys guy says there is a sandy beach about forty miles from tomas guardia international and maybe fifty from juan santamaria thatll take the c and theres nothing around it for miles except fishing villages thats too good to be true naylor said how does larrys guy know larrys guy says he heard that they were moving drugs through the area went there while sportfishing checked it out measured it did compression tests found some aircraft tire trackshe doesnt know what kind of aircraft but not large onesand thinks itll take a c based on what he read in an air force manual about c tire loadings how much credence does he place in his guy thats a little problem this guy is like the one in suriname what does that mean think of him as a second lieutenant with the varnish still on his gold bars what the agency does with their graduates is send them someplace where nothing is happening where they get to practice being a spy and working under diplomatic cover oh christ larry said to tell you this guy sounds like an eager beaver as in theres nothing faster than a second lieutenant rushing to officers call i think larry was being complimentary mcfadden said i think he liked what he heard on the phone where is larry hes trying to see if langley has anything on this beach he said i should tell you i have everything he knows and he thought his time would be better spent seeing what else he could come up with the admiral called the dia and they had nothing on suitable landing areas in costa rica naylor said do we tell mcnab or not naylor put his hands together so quickly that there was a loud pop general mcnab is not at the moment one of my favorite people naylor said and when i say yeah we have to tell him i have that in mind the decision to use or not use this beach has to be his if it wont take the c there will be a lot of dead people and the doesnt get neutralized naylor stood up and walked across his office toward the phone booth eight tomas guardia international airport liberia costa rica june ill be a sonofabitch there it is castillo said as the learjet taxied down a taxiway at another small but grandly named airfield there was a boeing aircraft connected to both a tug and a generator sitting on the tarmac in front of a concreteblock building with a sign on it reading in spanish central american aerial freight forwarding there were red white and blue stripes on the vertical stabilizer and along the fuselage that looked to be freshly painted there is a with the right paint scheme and registration numbers we wont know if its ours until we have a look inside colonel torine said youre right castillo agreed but i think we should tell macdill this ones here youre calling the shots colonel torine said tell the tower you want to box the compass fernando castillo ordered id rather stay weve been all over that castillo said there had been no inflight advisories on their way from cozumel to juan santamaria international airport in san jose advising them where the could be found in costa rica and when castillo had called the two numbers pevsner had given him both of the people answering said that he must have the wrong number they knew of no karl gossinger what are you going to do charley colonel torine had asked if its not here it has to be at the other airport tomas guardia or its not here at all youre still betting on pevsner he obviously doesnt know where it is or wed have gotten the inflight advisory or one of those numbers you called would have paid off or something happened maybe his people here couldnt find it here and he couldnt get anybody to the other airport to see if it was there or he did and theres a communications problem but he was pretty sure the is in costa rica and i think we have to go on that and if its not here then it has to be at tomas guardia how are you going to handle it colonel torine asked we go to tomas guardia fernando gets permission to box his compass we go to the threshold of a runway and sherman and i get out with the radio go hide in the grass and hope nobody sees us you take the lear to the nearest airport in nicaragua where you can call macdill and tell them where we are in case sherman cant get the radio up and then we see what happens we may get luckyand god knows im not counting on thatand actually find the sonofabitch if its there and it looks as if its going to take off sherman and i can probably disable it why dont we just park the lear and all of us get out fernando said that would give us four people on the ground because somehow we have to get word to macdill and the only way to do thatwe cant count on shermans radiois for you to go to nicaragua now that theyre this close they probably have some pretty good perimeter defense around the airplane fernando argued and special forces hotshots or not you and sherman adds up to two people what i think we should do is split the difference colonel torine said i get out of the airplane with you he looked at fernando and smiled that would make it two green beanie hotshots and one air commando hotshot the bad guys wont have a chance i dont like this gringo colonel sergeant sherman and i can handle this castillo said it doesnt take much skill to shoot holes in airplane tires but i suspect its really going to piss off the local authorities why dont you go with fernando youll be better at getting through to macdill than he will i dont know about that torine replied for one thing he speaks much better spanish than i do hes going to have a lot of talking to nicaraguan authorities to do and for another this is more fun than ive had in years ive always wanted to shoot holes in an airplane tire fernando looked between them shrugged and then spoke to his microphone tomas guardia ground control lear fiveohsevenfive ive got a compass i dont trust request permission to go to the threshold of twoeight and box my compass the problem was how to get from the lear where it sat on the threshold of the runway to a point two hundred yards north of the threshold where the builtup area leading to the threshold and the runway suddenly dropped off precipitously there was waisthigh grass on either side of the threshold the area leading up to the threshold was paved with macadam for about a hundred yards it would be easier and faster to run down the macadam and enter the grass where it ended on the other hand they would almost certainly be seen if they ran down the macadam they would probably be seen if they ran through the grassthey couldnt run bent over far enough to get beneath the top of the grassbut if they crawled through it so they would be concealed by the grass crawling through it would crush the grass leaving a visible path running through the grass if they were lucky would push the grass aside only momentarily and it would spring back in place leaving little evidence that someone or something had passed through it i think we better go through the grass castillo said colonel torine nodded sergeant sherman gave castillo a thumbsup fernando turn it so the door is away from the tower castillo ordered as soon as you stop well open the door and go youll have to come back here and close it now fernando asked now please god be with all of you fernando announced as the lear started to turn the grass was thicker than it looked and harder to push aside the ground was very damp not quite mud but slippery there was a handle on the bottom of sergeant shermans hardsided suitcasecastillo idly wondered whether it had come that way or if the bottom handle was a gray fox modificationwhich permitted sherman and castillo to carry it between them but it was a heavy sonofabitch even without the weight of the two car rifles and the bandolier of magazines sherman had taken out of it and hung around colonel torines shoulders the midday tropical heat did not help charley felt sweat break out before he was ten yards into the grass and he and sherman were soon breathing very heavily they had to stop four times and quickly swap sides as the strength of their hands on the handles gave out the last time when charley scurried to get to the other side of the suitcase his foot slipped he fell flat onto his face through the grass onto the ground where his knee encountered what was probably the only rock within five hundred yards castillo was beginning to plan for what to do when inevitably the knee andor his breath gave out and he would not be able to hold up his end of the suitcase anymore when the ground beneath his feet suddenly disappeared he lost his footing and started to slide downward there was about a fiftyfoot difference between the groundthe original terrainand the airport buildup castillo sherman and the hardsided suitcase were about halfway down it before they could stop their slide they had just done so and exchanged glances when colonel torine burst through the thick grass on his way down the steep incline he was moving headfirst on his stomach wildly flailing his arms in an attempt to stop himself sherman started to giggle and then both he and castillo were laughing although as out of breath as they were the laughing was quite painful still smiling and chuckling they pushed the hardsided suitcase the rest of the way down the steep incline until they reached level ground fuck it far enough castillo said stopped pushing rolled onto his back and put his arm over his eyes against the bright sunlight a moment later as he was still taking breaths in deep heaves he felt a nudge against his side from under his arm without moving he saw an old battered militarylooking boot oh shit if torine or sherman wanted my attention they wouldnt nudge me with a boot they arent even wearing boots he took his arm off his eyes there was a man standing over him his face covered with green brown and black grease stripes i understand that old air force fart wheezing like a rodehard racehorse lieutenant general bruce j mcnab said but you and sherman by god what are people going to think castillo didnt reply he forced himself into a sitting position his arm was nudged and when he looked mcnab was holding out a plastic quart bottle of up to him castillo took it wordlessly opened it and drank from it for your general information the air force survived his crash landing mcnab said his dignity unfortunately took a beating how long have you been here castillo asked finally getting his breath long enough were i a wagering man to lay heavy odds the is here i got a guy out there now taking a real close look im pretty sure its the one were looking for charley said we taxied past it its got freshly painted registration numbers and the red white and blue stripes on the vertical stabilizer pevsners guy saw on it in venezuela colonel torine and sergeant sherman walked up you all right jake nothing broken im fine you okay charley torine asked castillo nodded how is it that youre here sir torine asked mcnab mcfadden and naylor got me on the radio and said theyd found a sandy beach not far from here some cia guy had done compression tests and theoretically it would take a c with the fingers of both hands crossed i decided to give it a shot obviously it took the more or less we got down all right but stopped for more than a couple of minutes the globemaster starts to sink in the sand it was a hell of a job getting the little birds off we had to keep the airplane moving all the time we were unloading it looked like a chinese fire drill but youre unloaded theres two gunships and four troop carriers about five miles away did i mention that the c is taxiing up and down the beach back and forth back and forth i dont know how long thats going to work nor do i know whether or not we can get it back in the air empty you probably can torine said theres an awesome amount of thrust on a empty what am i supposed to do with the little birds torch them a tall blond sergeant first class dressed as was general mcnab in a jungle camouflage uniform came up he had a car hanging from his shoulder and was carrying what looked like a laptop computer in his hands like a tray it was open stedders in place general he said and started to hand the laptop to mcnab will you hold it please sergeant orson mcnab said castillo got quickly up careful with that up charley mcnab said this is the only one of these we have stedder reports the lear has taken off sir sergeant orson said wheres he going charley mcnab asked nicaragua to report where we are and that we think weve found the mcnab grunted and looked at the laptop computer it displayed an image of the from the side whoevers taking these must be on the roof of that building central american freight forwarding whatever the image also showed some movement there were a halfdozen security guards in militarylooking uniforms on the tarmac when they moved it was as if they did so in slow motion can he give us a closeup of the front door castillo asked mcnab typed rapidly on the laptops keyboard the screen went dark then lit up with an outoffocus view of the forward part of the aircraft which then came into focus all that could be seen was the top of the movable stairway the open door was clearly visible but nothing was visible inside the aircraft i dont suppose wed see a hell of a lot more up the rear stairway castillo said probably less major sergeant orson said the angles there are a bear dont call him major orson mcnab said we dont want anybody to know that hes one of us didnt you did see him skiing down the hill orson chuckled lets have another look at the whole airplane torine said mcnab typed on the keyboard again and a few moments later an image of the from the side appeared and this shot showed other movement an openbodied ford tonandahalf truck loaded high with thin cardboard boxes moved in jerking movements toward the airplane and two men moved jerkily toward the obviously intending to open the cargo doors well theres your flowers charley mcnab said which means theyre getting ready to go castillo said and what would you suggest we do about that mcnab asked keeping in mind the president wants this done quietly which would seem to rule out telling one of the gunships to put a couple of rockets in it why dont we steal it back colonel torine asked how would you propose that we do that mcnab asked can you fly that thing by yourself jake with charley in the right seat i can torine said and looked at castillo how can we do that quietly castillo asked quietly is a relative term mcnab said not very quietly would be to put a couple of rockets in it which would leave a burnedout airplane for the television cameras of the world to see proof of our arrogant invasion of friendly costa rica a little less quietly would be having the air force take it out after it gets in the air a lot of airplanesand who knows who elseare going to hear our pilot order the airplane to return here or get shot down how the hell are we going to be able to deny that if he has to shoot it down torine grunted mcnab added theres a flight of fs on their way from eglin by the way hell they may even be here out over the pacific theyve probably built some sort of framework over the fuel bladders castillo said what mcnab asked theres thirteen fuel bladders in the passenger compartment castillo said theyll have to be hidden from the customs guys at tampa so they will cover them with flowers hence a framework okay so mcnab said which means they will have to be placed on that framework by the guys who stole the airplane not by ground handlers who would want to know whats up with the fuel bladders major sergeant orson said when sergeant stedder was getting into position he said it looked to him as if there was a crew of four they must have brought two guys to help carry the flowers up the back stairs torine said and protect the airplane making a total of four we have to take out if were going to take over the airplane figure its going to take them forty minutes to load all those flowers six boxes at a time up the front and back stairways so thats how much time we have mcnab agreed we dont know all they have is two more guys castillo said the sergeant said he saw four there could be more and they all have to be taken out right torine asked mcnab grunted odds are we cant have a little chat with them and explain the futility of their position we have to take them out quickly and then get that airplane off the ground quickly how is gray fox equipped for snipers sir castillo asked well theres one really good one major castillo sergeant orson said if i do have to say so myself and sergeant stedder thought it would be a good idea if he took his rifle along when he went out to climb on the roof how many do you think youre going to need what im thinking castillo said and stopped when he saw the look on mcnabs face go on charley mcnab said lets see how much you remember of all that you learned with me as your allwise mentor what i was thinking sir is that i dont think the other two are pilots which means if we can take out the two pilots the airplane couldnt be flown and how do we get the pilotsor any of these peopleto obligingly line themselves up for the attention of sergeants orson and stedder a diversion castillo began thoughtfully chapter xix one tomas guardia international airport liberia costa rica june major c g castillo now wearing a black flight suit with subdued insignia that included the wings of a master army aviator and identified him as cwo bd shine lay beside a small concreteblock building hoping he was further concealed by a fiftyfivegallon drum full of aromatic waste his face was streaked with brown black and green grease he had binoculars to his eyes and wore a headset putting a small receiver in his right ear and a microphone at his lips a car lay on the ground beside him immediately to his left the other side of the reeking garbage drum was sergeant first class paul t orson who was armed with a dull black boltaction rifle based on the remington model winchester caliber hunting rifle about the only things that hadnt been changed were the caliberknown in the army as xmm natoand the action it now had a carefully chosen and tested barrel and in place of glossy walnut a matt black stock made up of fiberglass kevlar and graphite a dull black x leupold ultra optical sight was mounted on top immediately behind themliterally behind the garbage drumand also armed with a car was colonel jake torine usaf now wearing a black flight suit whose subdued insignia identified him as cwo pj lefkowitz a senior army aviator a good deal was about to happensergeant orson thought of this as all hell was about to break loose but there was no indication of this on the tarmac in front of them another openbodied ford oneandahalfton truck was pulled up close to the a man on the truck handed down four at a time long thin cardboard boxes to two men on the ground they carried the boxes to the movable stairs rolled up to the front door and to the lowered rear stairway of the airplane there they were passed to men wearing shortsleeved white shirts with captains and first officers shoulder boards and quickly carried up the stairs into the airplane castillo had recognized the face of one of the aircrew as the guy had run up and down the stairs he had seen his photographs in philadelphia he had not seen the second philadelphia mullah nor had he recognized the two men who had also carried flowers into the aircraft up the rear stairs but they had intelligent faces and he wondered if he had been wrong that everybody was a pilot how the hell can you calmly load an airplane with flowers for christs sake knowing youre going to die in it five four three two one general mcnabs voice said in castillos earpiece showtime heads up castillo said softly and a moment later realized it was entirely unnecessary sergeant orson had his eye to the leupold scope and the rifle was trained on the rear stairs of the the first thing to disturb the peace and tranquillity of tomas guardia international airport was that of artillery simulators detonated near a small concreteblock building painted in a redandwhitecheckerboard pattern to one side of the runway the simulators were intended to sound exactly like that of a mm howitzer shell coming through the air and detonating on contact and they did at precisely that moment two little birds popped up past the end of the runway where castillo sherman and torine had fallen down the hill rocket fire exploded from the left little bird and a stream of mm grenades from the other the rockets struck a fuel truck parked out of line of sight of the causing an immediate explosion and the grenades exploded in a line parallel to and a few feet the other side of the runway the face of the man near the bottom of the rear stairway was familiar to castillo through his binoculars take him he ordered there was an immediate crack as the sniper rifle fired there was no question in castillos mind that orson would hit his target i have just killed that guy as surely as if i had pulled the trigger myself this philosophical observation was immediately challenged when the man in his binocular view though obviously disturbed and surprised by what was happeninghe was now looking up the stairswas obviously still very much alive ill be a sonofabitch he missed castillo looked over at sergeant orson just as the rifle fired again castillo hastily put the binoculars to his eyes again the man on the rear stairway was now sliding facedown down the stairs there was another one farther up on the stairs sergeant orson said i figured id take him first four unarmed little birds now suddenly appeared from four different directions and rapidly approached the there were six gray fox soldiers on the outside platforms of each all dressed in black outfits topped with black balaclavas the little birds had made a fly the needles approach to the their onboard computer directed navigation systems knowing within six feet both their position and that of the had provided the pilots with indicatorsthe needleson the control panel so long as the pilots kept the needles where they were supposed beincreasing or decreasing airspeed changing direction or altitude caused the needles to moveall four of the little birds were able to arrive from four different directions at a little better than seventyfive miles per hour within seconds of one another the gray fox soldiers dropped nimbly from the benches before the skids of the little birds actually touched down some of them fired close tonot atthe security personnel which caused the defending force to immediately raise their hands fall to their knees or both one special operator dashed to the flower truck somewhat rudely removed the driver from behind the wheel got behind the wheel started the truck drove toward the central american aerial freight forwarding building and then jumped out leaving the truck on a collision course with a peugeot sedan parked in front of the building which in fact occurred some thirty seconds later during those thirty seconds two fourman teams of gray fox men rushed to the forward stairs one man ran halfway up the stairs from where he threw a whiz bang grenade through the open door a whiz bang goes off with a great deal of noise and a blinding flash but does not produce shrapnel those in close proximity to a detonated whiz bang however usually have trouble hearing and seeing and generally appear confused as soon as the whiz bang went off the man who had thrown it rushed the rest of the way up the stairs closely followed by the three other members of what general mcnab had dubbed the front door team to get into the aircraft it was necessary for the front door team to step over the bodies of two men on the stairs fifteen seconds after they entered the fuselage two of the gray fox men came back out the door went to the fallen men and unceremoniously dragged them into the airplane as soon as they had cleared the door the moving stairs team of four gray fox soldiers started to push the stairs away from the aircraft meanwhile four gray fox soldiersthe tug and chocks teamhad approached the tug one of them climbed aboard while the other three detached the tugs link to the front wheel of the aircraft and removed the wooden blocks from the aircrafts wheels as soon as that was done the tug started to move off the gray fox driver set it on a collision course with the peugeot and jumped off at the same time the ground auxiliary power team went to that generator one of them fired it up while a second made sure the cord was properly plugged into the aircraft the other two made a hasty examination of the aircraft to make sure it was not connected in any unexpected other way with the ground it was not and simultaneously the rear stair door team rushed to the rear stair doors one of them stepping over one body climbed as far as he couldhe encountered another bodyand threw a whiz bang into the passenger compartment it went off within two seconds of the one thrown through the front door the grenadier closely followed by his team members then went into the aircraft and twenty seconds later came out again he spoke to his microphone clear no apparent damage this fucking thing is full of flowers what the hell is that all about the team who had entered the aircraft through the front door began to descend the rear stairs master sergeant charles stevens who was in overall charge of both the front door and rear stair door teams and had accompanied the latter suggested to them that assisting in taking the bodies on the stairs aboard would be a nice thing for them to do he didnt use those words but they took his point as castillo and torine ran toward the aircraft they saw a halfdozen brilliant yellow vehicles of the tomas guardia international airport fire department racing across the field toward the blazing fuel truck so far no one seemed to be paying much attention to what was happening near the not even to the four little birds sitting there with their rotors slowly turning apus up and running sir master sergeant stevens said to colonel torine well stick around until you get it moving you stick around until i get one engine running colonel torine said then disconnect the apu and get out of here theres nothing more that you can do yes sir good luck colonel you too major he saluted as castillo and torine went up the stairs which were slick with blood colonel torine got in the pilots seat adjusted it to accommodate his long legs strapped himself in and then looked around for something he finally found on the shelf over the instrument panel he handed it to castillo checklist charley he said as he reached for the master buss switch one gear lever and lights castillo read down and check torine responded two brakes castillo read parked three battery on starting number two torine said which was not the next step on the checklist castillo looked over at torine there was a whining sound as the pratt amp whitney jtd turbofan in the vertical stabilizer came to life youre going to have to go back and close the stair door charley torine said thats supposed to be done before you start the checklist yes sir the controls on the left bulkhead yes sir castillo said and hurriedly got out of his harness and went through the cabin he had to step over all four bodies again to reach the stair door control panel his foot slipped in a pool of blood when he looked downhe had not intended tothe sightless eyes of the man whose death he had ordered looked back at him he opened the control panel door found the raise stair switch threw it and waited until a green light came on he felt the vibration as torine started the other two engines he started back to the cockpit and found himself looking again at the sightless eyes he took another step forward then stopped the whiz bangs had displaced tour or five flower boxes one or them was ripped open castillo scooped out its contents turned and laid them not very gently on the dead mans face then he went as quickly as he could back to the flight deck pick the checklist up at taxi charley torine ordered yes sir the was moving charley wondered if you were supposed to move before you started the taxi portion of the checklist one flaps and runway he read flaps check colonel torine responded runway that one he pointed out the window castillo saw a wind cone indicating that torine was headed in the right direction to make a right turn onto the runway into the prevailing wind he also saw the tomas guardia international airport fire department fighting without any apparent success the fire on the blazing fuel truck and he saw a little bird six gray fox operators hanging on to it fly right on the deck over the runway threshold and then drop out of sight he looked around and saw no others two he read from the checklist takeoff data in a manner of speaking torine said i already did

later colonel torine said well the thrust reversers seem to work now lets see if the brakes do the second half of the runway was lined with vehicles bright yellow firefighting vehicles ambulances wreckers bulldozers and humveesa large number of humveesall equipped with caliber machine guns all of which were trained on costa rican i expect this is the modern version of the tumultuous welcome roman legionnaires got when they returned to rome after having vanquished the savages in faroff places torine said as the began to slow very suddenly torine threw the master buss switch i wonder if it will ever fly again he asked the last flight of an airplane is always a little sad why wont it fly again castillo asked then do you think we should try to get this crap off our face before we go out there and wave to the fans jesus i forgot all about it hell no leave it on itll give them something to talk about he unstrapped himself and stood up and then gestured to castillo to precede him from the cockpit when castillo opened the door now waving torine ahead of him movable stairs had been rolled up to the front door when he stepped onto the platform at the top he saw that their reception committee consisted of three highranking dignitaries the secretary of homeland security the honorable matthew hall general allan naylor usa the commanding general of central command and his deputy commander general albert mcfadden usaf behind them was about a platoon of air police half of them mounted in humvees colonel torine saluted as he went down the stairs naylor and mcfadden returned it jake is that thing liable to blow up anytime soon general mcfadden called it may collapse of old age sir torine replied but blow up no sir i dont think so castillo followed him down the stairs as soon as his feet touched the runway one of the air police a major headed for the stairs i dont think you want to go in the airplane just yet major castillo said and stepped into his path the air police major gave him a withering look examined castillos flight suit and snapped please step to one side mr shine charley remembered that in addition to the grease on his face he was wearing shines flight suit since i was before this happened a major promotable i probably outrank you you pompous shit but fuck it he made an after you gaston bow to the major and stepped out of his way the air police major ran up the stairs castillo saluted generals naylor and mcfadden they returned it i cant tell you how delighted i am that you pulled this off matt hall said welcome home charley colonel torine the president has asked me to convey his congratulations to you both general naylor said he is also concerned with collateral damage to the airport i therefore think we should go somewhere where you can make a preliminary afteraction report and then see about getting you cleaned up a fuel truck sir burned at the airport colonel torine said thats about the sum of it there were no casualties naylor asked surprised none on our side sir castillo said and none on the bad guys that we left at the airport i dont understand naylor said the air force major came down the stairs looking a little pale he walked quickly to generals naylor and mcfadden and softly told them there are four bodies on the airplane sir castillo said may i respectfully suggest that you get colonel torines afteraction report first i dont believe i will have anything to add to that sir and i really need thirty or forty minutes in the black hawk right now what for charley matt hall asked i dont think you want to know sir castillo said yes i do hall said theres a few details i have to clean up sir those bodies hall asked matt i dont think you want that question answered general naylor said colonel torine if youll come with us major castillo will join us just as soon as he can he gestured toward an air force dodge caravan major general mcfadden said to the air police officer im sure you were mistaken when you thought you saw bodies on the aircraft hey charley the pilot of the th special operations aviation regiment black hawk said after the helo was loaded and its wheels left the ground where we going sightseeing tom castillo said how about someplace along alligator alley where i could see some really hungry gators the more the better i know just the place the pilot said and banked the bird

anything happen what was on the phone the first was elaine naylor we were expected for dinner five minutes ago all is apparently forgiven by uncle allan so get dressed and the second that was isaacson to tell us hes on his way here to pick us up thats all there was one more fernando said let me think oh yeah it was the president i said you were in the shower oh fuck you i say that with all possible respect and affection you mean you dont believe me fernando asked innocently charley gave him the finger and started to get dressed the telephone rang again major castillo charley said somewhat abruptly the startled voice at the other end replied one moment please major charley i understand you were in the shower the president of the united states said a moment later yes sir mr president i was youll have to wait until he gets off the phone fernando said five minutes later to supervisory special agent joel isaacson hes talking to the president okay isaacson said he seemed neither surprised nor impressed but when charley came out of the bedroom two minutes later he immediately asked so what did the president have to say none of your fucking business joel okay if youre going to be a hardass i wont tell you what i know that the world isnt really flat a new addition to the secret service who while you two were flitting around the caribbean soaking up the sun the boss sent me to philadelphia he was concerned that betty nice boobs schneider was really going to have her ass in a crack for coming to washington with us and wanted me to see what i could do which was i went to chief inspector kramerone cop to anotherand asked him he said he didnt think she would have any problems the mayor was never going to find that out but he was worried about ali abd arraziq aka detective jack britton oh yeah charley said he said there was a very good chance the aals would try to whack himand that was before you stole the airplane back which is really going to piss those people off whack him or his family and could i offer him a job somewhereanywhereout of philadelphia and you did i actually had to sell him on the secret service but yeah and i put a couple of guys in the philadelphia office on the aals until we get him and his family out of town i wonder if hell spot them probably that guy is one hell of a cop im really glad to hear that joel thank you hell earn his keep isaacson said im sure he will and i figured what the hell since i was already there and i know the boss was really impressed with her i asked sergeant schneider if she was interested in moving up in the world of law enforcement and was she charley asked his heart jumped yeah sure once i told her how much a special agent makes you know how little the cops get paid thats very interesting charley said im sure shell be an asset who the hell do you think youre kidding gringo fernando lopez asked laughing your nostrils are flaring
