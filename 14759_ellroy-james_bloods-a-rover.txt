per our phone conversation and your preceding memo confidential a memorandum requesting an update on rumors pertaining to the m l king homicide circulating at the grapevine tavern st louis the following may warrant your attention electronic surveillance equipment perhaps of bureau manufacture was discovered on the premises at the grapevine tavern in early to midjune of this year confidential bureau informants frequenting the tavern have reported that the apparatus was discovered by convicted felons and tavern habituйs and the acknowledged leaders of several other tavern habituйs all convicted felons active in numerous farright paramilitary organizations the discovery of the apparatus has led to growing conjecture among the above mentioned ie that the apparatus was part of a monitoring process developed to lure accused king assassin into a fbimandated king assassination plot while obviously preposterous it should be noted that this rumor might prove to be damaging to the bureaus prestige given mr hoovers many recent derogatory comments about king and given that rays brother is a part owner of the tavern this office had no part in installing electronic surveillance apparatus if indeed it was bureaumanufactured equipment that was discovered on the tavern premises if some other bureau field team installed the equipment i did not know about it personally nor was such equipment installed by any agent under my command according to statements made by the abovereferenced tavern habituйs there was frequent discussion of a bounty on king allegedly to be paid by a cabal of wealthy segregationists to any white race warrior who would buck lbjs liberal hegemony to off martin luther coon this preposterous line of talk was frequently indulged by numerous tavern habituйs in the months preceding kings death the fbi hit plot rumors are growing in both virulence and frequency alarmingly confidential sources within the st louis office of the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms have informed me that the tavern will soon be placed under atf surveillance pertaining to evidence of gunrunning taking place on the tavern premises proper the abovereferenced tavern habituйs are not gunrunning suspects but i find atfs proximity to the tavern disturbing given the virulence and frequency of the antibureau rumors amp part ownership of the tavern respectfully sac wilton j laird st louis office los angeles herald express article still a baffler the big heist and the cop still obsessed tuesday february it was chilly in los angeles with storm clouds hovering the early morning silence was shattered by the collision of a milk truck and a wells fargo armored car carrying a multimilliondollar cargo of us currency and priceless emeralds the quiet corner of th and budlong streets became the scene of a holocaust and within minutes four armed guards and two members of a daring robbery gang were deadthe latter obviously betrayed and shot by a fellow gang memberand the robberymurder case has remained unsolved for four and a half years now not exactly sergeant robert s scotty bennett stated at pipers coffee shop its been four years five months and two days one does not quibble with sergeant bennett on anything pertaining to the case he has worked on so hard and for so long he has been the lead investigator since that bloody morning and his determination to crack the case has become legend within the los angeles police department the man all sixfootfive of him is a legend himself he has killed armed robbers in the line of duty and commemorates the lapd record with small s embroidered in the scottishplaid bow ties he always wears when asked about those shootings he replied when you let that buckshot go theres no taking it back its a funny line with a harrowing truth behind it detectives working the lapds headquarters robbery squad go up against armedanddangerous criminals routinely and they are a determined breed of man proud to be wearing tie bars the number noting the california penal code designation for armed robbery the heist as its known around the robbery division squadroom is a nearconstant topic of speculation and scotty bennett addresses it with great relish it was planned down to a t he said the fake milktruck collision was very forceful and potentially fatal which obviously convinced the guards that it was real the robbery gang knew what the armored car would be transporting and weve never determined exactly how they got that information more importantly weve never determined whether the heist gang was comprised of white men or negroes sergeant bennett sipped coffee and continued the heist was conceived and executed boldly he said and i believe that the leader of the gang decided beforehand to kill his underlings at the scene and obscure their identities and their races by burning their bodies past recognition all fine and good but obscuring racial identification requires more than burning the surface of the skin and the man first dosed the bodies with a chemical accelerant that greatly enhanced the tissue damage of the burning weve never been able to identify the chemical that he used which is another reason why the heist has remained such a baffler some other reasons well sergeant bennett said we know that many of the cash stacks stolen from the armored car were wrapped with inkexploding bands and ink spill was found at the crime scene also inkstained bills have surfaced periodically in south los angeles so im convinced that there was at least a partial negro component to the gang also the origin of the emeralds remains undetermined it was a very valuable cargo and intermediaries for the consigner and the consignee signed secrecy waivers with wells fargo which has impeded the investigation and the persistent rumor that the emeralds hailed from central america or the caribbean sergeant bennett said just that a rumor entirely unsubstantiated and the rumor that blackmilitant organizations plotted and executed the heist scotty bennett laughed heartily why mince words black militants are grandstanders who always claim credit for their deeds the panthers and us are informantinfiltrated and we would have picked up leads by now weve got two rowdy militant groups causing woowoo in la now the black tribe alliance and the maumau liberation front but for the life of me i cant see them executing anything more complex than a liquorstore job or a purse snatch and the leader of the gang the ruthless mastermind who killed his own men at the scene scotty bennett laughed even more heartily tell him this he said when i let that buckshot go theres no taking it back internal fbi memorandum marked reading to director hoover from sa dwight c houy sir the following states the design and goals of our aimed at discrediting and disrupting the blackmilitant movement at large and more circumscribed and localized blacknationalist groups in specific pending your approval i have named the program it is a nod to our lessthansuccessful and ironically celebrates the negro verbal tic of using bad to mean good male negroes often address each other as brother which i thought you might appreciate as im sure you know a negro extremist group called the black nationalists of new libya precipitated racial violence in cleveland ohio this past week that left eleven dead including three white policemen this is the perfect time to initiate a physically smallscaled that may well achieve largescale national results it is my firm belief that both the bpp and the us are too well known and well infiltrated already i believe that our goals would be better served by operating the los angelesbased bta and mmlf our could put them on the map and wholly discredit them concurrently by controlling the public perception of two lesserknown groups at the outset we would also discredit the blackmilitant movement as a whole i have studied the initial bureau intelligence reports on the bta and mmlf that you sent me and have requested intel division dossiers on their members from lapd i firmly contend that they are perfect targets and that their destruction should be the ultimate goal of i believe our goal should be accomplished in this manner both groups are rumored to be considering the sale of narcotics as a means to finance their activities which might provide us with avenues to exploit their inherent criminality and publically underscore the point that criminal activity and subversive political activity are one and the same thing we must find a highcaliber confidential informant who will ingratiate him or herself with one or both groups and report back with assiduously detailed briefs on their political activities i believe that a female informant would be the most effective a woman schooled in leftwingrevolutionary jargon would have a greater chance of eliciting confidences and inspiring indiscreet conversation and would most likely be better able to maneuver between the two maledominated groups without creating rancor toward the end of recruitment i have confidential bureau informant assisting me the linchpin of the incursion should be the placement of a male negro infiltrator mandated to uncover and report the criminal activities of the bta and mmlf ideally the infiltrator should have had police experience also ideally but much more unlikely he should possess a past history of racial animus for whites toward that possibility i have requested a wide array of police agency personnel files and am currently seeking to secure a viewing of the hatemail subscription lists of the late wayne tedrow sr and bureau confidential informant dr fred hiltz wayne tedrow jr has refused to grant me access to his fathers lists but i will persist with him pending your consent i would move to los angeles and establish a fulltime temporary residence there along with a cosmetically obscured front office for per initial operating expenses i would request in cold funds in conclusion i strongly believe that the and offer us an unparalleled opportunity to disrupt and discredit the subversive designs of the

years old a twotime convicted burglar and a reputed drug addict the reverend cedric d hazzard was years old and was the pastor of new bethel baptist church in north las vegas a stalwart of the negro community in the queen city of the desert he was as respected as pappy dawkins was disdained yet the two men were friends of sorts they would often meet at dawkins unkempt little house in west las vegas and talk until the wee hours about all manner of things now in its grief las vegas negroes are wondering what the topic of conversation was right before it all went so terribly wrong on the night of august we dont really know what precipitated this horrible tragedy lieutenant byron fritsch of the las vegas police department told reporters we only know that pappy shot the reverend hazzard and then turned the gun on himself horrible tragedy indeed for many members of the reverend hazzards congregation have movingly described their late pastors diligent efforts to bring the word of god to pappy dawkins and to help him restore his moral equilibrium ced was just that kind of a guy kenneth s wilson a deacon at new bethel baptist church said ask anyone who knew him my late husband was a brave and true man who led with his heart the reverend hazzards widow mary beth said he was committed to goodness and social justice mrs hazzard is the lead steward for the las vegas hotel workers union and has spearheaded many charitable drives in the local negro community she is doubly bereft now in december of her son reginald then vanished and was never seen again reginald was a former straighta student at seminole high school and had won sciencefair awards in chemistry the trials of job have visited themselves upon mrs hazzard but she remains optimistic yes my son is long missing and my husband is dead she said i considered cedrics mission to reform pappy dawkins to be rash and imprudent however heartfelt but he died in the act of dispensing compassion i revere him for that as for me no i will not succumb to defeat or despair i have duties to discharge and i will not be deterred the reverend hazzards funeral drew over mourners an estimated in floral tributes was received at

continue regardless of the outcome in november this entry and any other entries i may write during the convention will be ascribed here in my second journal the one i hide at school and that dwight must never see its the names i might record mr hoover and dwight by extension is filehappy and thinks that everyone in the movement knows everyone else and has thus colluded across a wide spectrum of political activity of course thats not true love affairsusually brief and passionate and doomed by factional issuesmay occur that pervasively but not prosecutable political conspiracy paranoia defines the right although dwight tends to eschew it and occasionally critiques it with sardonic humor and the left as well everyone knows everyone else and suspects everyone else and needs everyone else as well political agendas and personal agendas shift along those lines which certainly defines the inimical worldviews collusive agendas and deep comradeship of dwight and me god dwight chalfont holly and comrade in a single sentence chicago is going to be bad danny t and sid f have called with advance news they are marxist nixonites in their determination to fuck up hubert humphrey and elect the man who will instill greater repression and provide a clearer shot at revolution at some ambiguously perceived later point of course lives will be shattered and lost in the process and only utilitarians like me and dare i say it dh understand that purely destructive folly dwight can talk me into almost anything if he can convince me that it will divert destruction and death in the moment chicago feels like a widely willed moment of sincere outrage and horrible hatred that is politically and spiritually mandated beyond all utilitarian considerations which is what scares me the conventionhall fence is topped with barbed wire and riot troops have been flown in with more on call whn who secretly and ghoulishly loves weaponry said that maury w saw boxes of rocket launchers being unloaded at ohare theres a taxicab strike in progress a large bus drivers local stands ready to strike the ibew began striking on may and thus telephone service within the city and environs is a complete mess whn predicts a radical or radicalaligned largely fool mischiefmakers of the counterculture and fatuous left presence of people it is going to be bad because its overdue to be bad and the statement needs to be made at a horrible and horribly attentiongetting cost which makes the whole thing all the more complexly deplorable to me so i will pray for peace and feel eleanora grow within me and make love with dwight who knows many of the things i do but cannot confront them because the moment of moral explication would drive him insane as always i will marvel in the aftermath of my prayers and ponder how much or how little quantifiable good our odd comradeship of conflicting ideology gives to the world mutual benefit it sounds viciously capitalistic but it is wholly egalitarian within that compromised context dwight needs an informant to work the bta and mmlf hes got me halfconvinced that both groups are viciously selfserving ideologically unsound and destructive should i

the dropfront and preliminary operating funds secured police agency paperwork on our target groups and their members assessed and our infiltrator selected and ready to be placed in an operational context both plausible and provocative bureau informant has supplied me with the name of a potential confidential informant female and i have requested her bureau file from central records and will study it thoroughly before any attempt is made to facilitate a meeting bta and mmlf occupy the identical political and criminal universe which i will summarize along with criminalpolitical summaries of the groups leaders as previously stated the groups are criminally inclined staffed with career criminals and are determined to achieve their goals through criminal means they are political rivals and as such our goal must remain fixed to create intergroup dissension that will result in criminal charges and serve to discredit the entire blacknationalist apparatus both groups operate along nearidentical lines they employ storefront offices that serve as recruitment hubs social clubs and gathering places for local negroes and visiting radicals thus photo surveillance may prove useful at some point both groups distribute antiwhite antilos angeles police department literature and hate literature besmirching rival blackmilitant groups most often vulgar pamphlets in the comicbook style both organizations recruit on campus at local high schools and junior high schools both organizations extort local merchants for food to deploy in their feed the kiddies programs and liquor for their weekly paytoattend political mixers in reality drunken parties that often result in brawls both organizations have female followersie groupies who act as prostitutes and donate most of their earnings to the cause both organizations are rumored to have safe houses where visiting radicals and members fleeing criminal proceedings are allowed to hide out unlike the and there have been no known instances of and violence directed at police officers i will direct both our infiltrator and informant to notify me immediately should they learn of any such planned provocations both organizations are rumored to be planning excursions into the narcotics trade although i seriously doubt that they possess the expertise required to be successful at it they are both to date smalltime in their organized criminal designs although their individual leaders and followers quite often possess major felony records members are suspected of burglarizing a series of pornographic bookstores in the

put on me in april of a year before i joined the lapd i provoked that beating by passing several inkstained bills from the robbery and i provoked this beating of scotty and my subsequent beating by his lapd comrades under the flag of special agent dwight c holly on both occasions i assumed the dual roles of victim and provocateur two events with two and a half years between them the defining event of the robberymurders now four years and eight months in the past two confrontations fueled by one motive i want to solve the robberymurder case anonymously and keep the remaining cache of money

truly feasible that moment is now i could have described my immersions in leftwing organizations for clyde duber where i learned the acting skills dissembling skills and poise that brought me to this point but im pleased that i did not indulge that level of selfcongratulation ive always enjoyed being an underestimated black man and now im a locally famous and somewhat overpraised and overscrutinized black man this is the adventure that i want to describe and dissect as i live it this current confluence of events is surely the one story i have to tell i was severely beaten by somewhere between twelve and sixteen of my brother lapd officers and spent four days at central receiving hospital my broken nose facial lacerations and asymmetrically bent ears have enhanced my rather bland good looks and have added to my incipient blackmilitant cachet i have mr holly to thank for that mr holly sensed my gameness and willingness to play and i will reward him with hard work and a very commanding performance as i pursue my own goals within the context of this operation the local newspapers radio and television picked up the story of the horrible fracas between a black and a white policeman at a convivial watering hole frequented by lapd personnel mr holly served as the unseen publicity director for this event the lapd launched an internal investigation andof courseall the eyewitnesses lied stating that i sexually accosted the barmaid and attacked sergeant robert s bennett proactively scotty got a broken nose and one weeks compassionate leave i was bound over for an interdepartmental trial boardie a kangaroo court mr holly hired me a jabbery and flamboyant black lawyer reminiscent of algonquin j calhoun of amos n andy fame the lawyer spouted more racially charged malapropisms than the worst mailorder black preacher ever to bang a pulpit for power and profit i was hosannaed as the black jesus scotty bennett was excoriated as the white judas iscariot i was of course summarily fired from the los angeles police department mr holly later told me that the lawyer was a defrocked minister with a sinecure as a public defender in visalia county gorgeous blackandwhite collusion white judges and prosecutors hire this man to assure the convictions of black clients they need to get off the streets i then became an oracle of racial bias memorizing the blindingly articulate scripts that mr holly wrote for me withering critiques of institutional racism and the authoritarian mindset full of indignation social rigor and righteous fury all penned by a white lawyer cop with roots in the ku klux klan mr holly read me through the scripts well in advance of my speaking them i was astonished and almost swoony mr holly is a big handsome man and a powerful public speaker i got the uncanny feeling that he actually believed the words he wrote as he was speaking them mr holly is a very difficult man to decipher he understands racial bias and says jungle bunny routinely i was invited to a fundraising party for senator hubert h humphrey at a big home in beverly hills mr holly told me to go so i did i was quite the center of attention until some movie stars arrived and eclipsed me natalie wood made a fuss over my facial wounds and slipped me her phone number harry belafonte shook my hand numerous liberals boohooed the recent passing of senator kennedy and dr king people looked to me for expressions of political outrage i had none to give them because i now require mr hollys scriptwriting services in order to sound properly enraged i will soon be a wonderfully apostatized blackmilitant convert because a klansmans son will fuel my anger with his radical perceptions leaving me to wonder at their origins and marvel at the man himself all over again mr holly gave me in cold fbi funds and told me to move farther south into the congo i should start frequenting the jig joints where my soul brothers congregate to see what kind of shine action i draw mr holly calls me a shit magnet and i think hes rather suspicious of me id like to indulge the bent right now but i cant mr holly might be having me spottailed i have to keep my personal pleasures on hold until i feel more secure in my role i have an entirely new life now my mother is dead my father is elderly and living in chicago i have no real friends and my relationship with mr holly is mutually usurious i now have a dauntless and implacable enemy in scotty bennett im sure that i know more about scotty than scotty knows about me i have read the sanitized official reports on the eighteen armed robbers scotty has killed in the line of duty they were all black men they were all summarily executed per the unspoken lapd mandate that armed robbers must die the policeman in me condones this sanction there is a large body of empirical data that states that most armed robbers take innocent lives and must be preemptively interdicted it is the ghoulishly cherrypicked male negro armed robbers that makes scotty so unique other hardcharging robbery cops have a middling equalopportunity mйlange of white and mexican kills not our scotty oh no last august two university division officers shot it out with four black panthers the officers survived but the panthers did not two days later chief reddin sent scotty down to the panther headquarters with pizza beer and a pound of confiscated marijuana scotty was by all accounts courtly the panthers welcomed him with apprehension and seemed befuddled by his gifts scotty advised them not to shoot at los angeles policemen again should they do so reprisals would be instantaneous and brutal for every la cop shot at wounded or killed lapd would kill six black panthers scotty walked out then he did not take questions or linger for a slice of pizza and an icecold brew my admiration and hatred of scotty bennett run roughly equal he was there on february he has no idea that i was there too i was nineteen i had graduated dorsey high school two years earlier and was living with my parents at th and budlong the sky was the first thing i saw there were weird prisms of color and a gas stench in the air i stood on the roof of my house and saw streams of police cars approaching the siren noise was near deafening i saw a crashedup armored car and a milk truck and dark shapes emitting fumes on the ground i saw a very tall man in a tweed suit and bow tie drive up and survey the scene my father made me abandon my perch three dozen policemen roped off the street rumors soon flooded the neighborhood the dead robbers were white the dead robbers were black the bodies were scorched past recognition and were racially unidentifiable the absence of the robbers vehicle meant that at least one man got away two men got away i know this as fact scotty bennett may know it as well i cannot prove scottys knowledge i simply sense it lapd was out in brutal force scotty was running viciously indiscriminate roundups of local suspects at th street station the local citizenry was outraged i was outraged i went roaming the alleyways behind my house a kid looking for adventure coveting my proximity to history that is when i saw the second man he was hiding behind a row of trash cans he was young in his teens or early twenties and he was black his face was chemically scalded but extra precautionary gauzing a mouthpiece and a bulletproof vest had saved his life i took the man to an elderly doctor neighbor he was in shock and refused to discuss the robberykillings at all the doctor treated the mans burns fed him morphine and let him rest scotty continued to steamroll his investigation detained and released suspects came home bruised and pissing blood the doctor decided not to turn the wounded man over he had saved the mans life and could not now condone physical abuse that might well result in his death the man left the doctors house after two days of care and never divulged his identity he left the doctor with in inkstained cash the doctor deposited it in the peoples bank of south los angeles and told the manager lionel thornton to leak it back to the community in charity donations if it could be done safely with no harm to the recipients thornton somehow found a way to partially obscure the ink markings the bills surfaced sporadically in southside los angeles scotty bennett tracked that money assiduously he detained and leaned on the innocent people passing the bills in his unique and uniquely persistent manner the case remained unsolved the racial identity of the heist gangs leader and the other dead heist men has never been determined scotty had become obsessed with the case and so had i the doctor died in the inkstained bills continued to circulate through southside la i maneuvered my way into a menial job at the peoples bank learned nothing substantive and quit scotty bennett fascinated me i wanted to test my courage by going up against him and to see if he would reveal information within the brutal context of a backroom interrogation i had pilfered a stack of inkstained twenties from the bank and began passing them scotty found me toot sweet the room was ten by ten feet and walled with soundproof baffling to keep screams at a dull roar i protested my innocence scotty was genial when he wasnt beating me he deployed a phone book and a rubber hose he loosened my teeth and decimated my kidneys i stoically asserted my innocence scotty revealed no inside knowledge of the case i refused to scream after two hours i got my pro forma phone call i called a friend the friend called his friend clyde duber clyde made some calls of his own and got me out clyde liked me clyde had his own fixation on the case its a hobby for him no more its a consuming quest for scotty and me i entered clydes kidprivateeye world and began infiltrating leftwing groups for his rich and richly paranoiac rightwing clients i became a fine actor prevaricator dissembler spy and snitch i learned how to improvise extrapolate and work off of clydes rough scripts i have never had a role as demanding as the one dwight holly has prepared for me and i have never had a scriptwriter as brilliant as mr holly i joined the los angeles police department in scotty tried to quash my appointment and failed the case remains unsolved i remain determined im convinced that the answer resides in southside la i choose to believe a persistent ghetto legend here and there black folks in trouble receive a single very valuable emerald anonymously in the mail i think scotty knows more about the events of than the rest of the lapd combined i think he wants the money and the lovely green stones for himself i view as nothing but a godsend despite mr hoovers draconian intent i have the perfect southside cover now people will tell a radically reconfigured black militant things that they would never tell a cop i must be very bold and very cautious and work my way around mr holly with the utmost circumspection los angeles spot tail marsh bowens pad th and denker lacecurtain niggertown it was night dwight holly hired him through clyde duber clyde was unsure of big dwights motive maybe bowen

it easy ill take that as a personal complim heres the compliment youve been so persistently anxious to receive you have acquitted yourself brilliantly to this point chiefly because your altercation with scotty bennett had mo muthafuckin soul than i ever could have hoped for and as such you are the heroic black man of the la ghetto moment which allots us a very short interval for you to be recruited by the bta andor the mmlf you cannot join up officer your actions must draw them to you or you will arouse an undue level of suspicion youre an actor officer you have the actors instinctive need to ingratiate so you require stern direction to shape your performance i doubt that you possess a moral core so let me bypass the idea of that sort of compass to guide you you must appear bold and exercise great caution you must judiciously rat out your new friends and benefactors and make sure that there are other snitch suspects for the information you have proffered use your discretion pertaining to any lowdown you might have on major crime pending no homicide no armed robbery no sex shit on women or children and do not give your former brethren in the lapd a context in which to kick yo black ass because they most assuredly will marsh swiveled a telescope and looked southbound he always made his face blank and rode out confrontations he always did offhand shit to hide his

campaign los angeles times article murder of hate merchant still unsolved the victim himself called his palatial beverly hills home the house that hate built so its no surprise to many that dr fred t hiltz former dentist former golf professional and alleged fbi informant should come to a horrible end in that very place itself on september of this year dr hiltz was shotgunned in his backyard bomb shelter and the crime has remained unsolved there are suspects a robbery gang who held wealthy families hostage in brentwood and newport beach but some local journalists and many assassination buffs take issue with that dr hiltz was a wellknown purveyor of viciously worded hate pamphlets that attacked caucasians as well as racial minorities was rumored to have a backyard hideyhole stuffed with cash had been married numerous times and allegedly indulged in scores of liaisons with provocative women beverly hills police captain mike gustodas told reporters dr hiltz had volatile relationships was in a dirty business and cut our work out for us thats for sure yet its the los angeles fbi office thats doing the bulk of the work on the hiltz investigation and that fact is what so intrigues certain journalists and conspiracy theorists captain gustodas had no answer to address that issue he simply stated that the fbi had usurped bhpds case for national security reasons john leahy specialagentincharge of the fbis los angeles office told reporters yes its a politically sensitive case and there is a national security aspect albeit a minor one im not at liberty to divulge the details just yet but there will be a full recounting when and if this agency makes an arrest an especially persistent rumor is that dr hiltz was murdered by members of a blackmilitant group as a political statement sac leahy had no time for that theory i think its ridiculous he said no blackmilitant groups have claimed credit and i also think that the danger of black militancy has been

chicago was a disaster not because it secured nixons victory but because it made the left appear rancorous petty vicious divisive and buffoonish the sin of selfindulgence i must take note of my selfindulgent tendencies and i should begin by classifying them as misconduct and thus drawing a clear moral line to interdict their practice dina has started asking me the inevitable brightlittlegirl questions about dwight and whn and my relationship to the two men of course i cannot tell her that whn and i are politically compatible but not comrades and we have never had a fully passionate relationship but are friends in certain shared ideals and the business of parenthood whn knows about dwight but never mentions him the prescient and tooworldly dina never mentions dwight to whn because she knows it would hurt him and because she understands that it might adversely affect my relationship with dwight dina will become a compartmentalizer as i am and maywill inherit my penchant for dramatic and dubious men dina likes dwight more than she likes her father because he is fierce with the world but very soft with her because he carries a gun because i am demonstrative with dwight in a way that i am not with her father and it makes her feel properly loved as a child and thus feel safe andbrilliant girlshe understands something that i just figured out that dwight and i truly are comrades its our lovers passion and the tender barter of our antithetical roles and ideals its that we both want something beyond each other very deep and pure and that i have a language for it while he does not i keep thinking of troikas dwight my largely absent husband and i are one and i now form the spark point of dwight and joan klein im not jealous but dwight is powerfully compelled by her i have been less than truthful about my relationship with joan because i did not know how much of joans various real and rumored histories i should reveal to a man who is at days end a police officer and a rightwing thug dwight told me early on informants and operators withhold information to ensure their own safety and the safety of those close to them that idea guides me in my lies by omission joan was an fbi informant at one time but i dont know her operators name or if he redacted her file i have known joan deeply for many years politically i do not trust her any more than i trust dwight im somewhat worried about dwight hes losing weight is sleeping evermore poorly and mumbles in his sleep i keep jokingly asking him if i can blow up mount rushmore and he keeps halfjokingly telling me yes hes giving me too much latitude is it out of guilt i keep thinking there must be some immeasurably horrible deed weighing on him that i must never know about lest it destroy my love for him or make me love him that much more i wonder how old dina and ella inside me will be when they discover that truth of women and men dwight and i have our barters i wonder what form dwights barters will take with joan our shared world is humanly unquantifiable and ideologically confused which one of them is capable of implementing the most recognizable harm or good extract from the journal of marshall e bowen south la november it was my second beating at the hands of my formerand future once this operation has concludedlapd brethren i fared better at my first one for mr hollys script had prepared me mr holly failed to witness this second encounter and my wounds will have healed by the next time we meet facetoface i may or may not tell him of the incident critique my spontaneous performance and request that he not discipline the officers involved i may or may not tell him that the incident resulted in my making some wonderful new friends my unlikely rescuer was jomo kenyatta clarkson propaganda minister for the preposterously named maumau liberation front along with his friends shondell and bobby jomo is garrulous and recognizably psychopathic and continues to break the worlds land speed record for use of the word motherfucker in a single sentence his arms bear selfinflicted machete scars as a tribute to the real jomo kenyattas slaughter of british settlers in kenya circa jomo and friends took me to morningside hospital where a friendly white doctor who treated jomo for his most recent gunshot wound treated my wounds and injected me with demerol the injection dulled my pain lifted my spirits and allowed me to stop replaying the words scotty bennett sends regards in a nearcontinuous loop i wanted to go home and rest then jomo wouldnt hear of it he decided we should go pubcrawling we visited a series of afterhours clubs i met numerous black males in the allblack attire that mr holly has urged me to purchase found it fetching on them but decided that it wasnt really my style i witnessed a live lesbian sex show at raes rugburn room and was generally shown off by jomo at sultan sams sandbox mr mitchs another world and nats nest i geared up and performed mr holly would have been proud of me i repeatedly described my beating by the lapd pigs and never had to mention my expig status because i am a local celebrity and my former occupation subtextually preexists in the ghetto spiritus mundi i kept saying ridiculous things like tell it like it is and right on brother and never once burst out laughing the rest of the night following day and night are blurry jomo took me by his place of employment the black cat cab company where i watched the very fat owner eat an entire gallon of ice cream i started to fall asleep at one point jomo forcefed me several spoonfuls of cocaine which got me talking it felt like an outofbody experience spawned by alcohol drugs sustained shock and many weeks of barely controlled stress excitement and wonderment all filtered through what mr holly has described as my innate actors instinct and flair i critiqued the institutional racism of the lapd specifically and white racist america in general and was conscious that i was shucking jomo and his friends as i did it as i concurrently believed it and did not believe it as yet another part of me was off at another level of bifurcation directing the performance and goofing on the whole thing i cant recall exactly what i said but i do know that i was speaking at the limits of my mental capacity and powers of articulation in retrospect it felt like demagoguery social analysis and apostalic fervor all rolled into one and the amazing thing to methat mr holly would not find amazing at allis that i dont know whether or not i believe a word of it black cat cab was followed by a visit to jomos crib on east th street many people all black were there i heard six dozen hatethefuckinlapdpigs stories told that many myself and met two men whose armedrobber brothers were shot and killed by king pig scotty bennett jomo tried to pass a shapely toffeecolored girl with a tinted afro off on me but i excused myself with something about my main bitch jomo ensconced me in a room festooned with revolutionary wall posters and filled with stacks of fatuous polemics and i fell asleep for a very long time my dreams were my standard ones and easily explained given my lifes overweening fixation there were the shapeless waves of green representing the emeralds and the odd spatial doublings and triplings of prone shapes my persistently unconscious urge to discover what truly happed on th and budlong that day at one point i thought i saw a white woman with dark graystreaked hair looking in on me but sheit was just a wisp two dozen people were sitting in jomos living room when i stumbled out however many hours later they gave me a standing ovation it was a superlative reward for my performance ive moved to a dingy crib on the watts border ive started spending time at black cat cab my mmlf andor bta recruitment is imminent but i am not rushing into anything i want this performance to last its my circuit back to february every

klein felt that she should return her percentage he told her to keep the money she thanked him it was all so fucking gorgeously decorous they sparred and talked politics he paved roundabout queries on her past life and associations joan rebuffed them with occasional brusqueness and a harsh humor the cop part of him was all over her the rest of him was a faltering half step behind joan had run safe houses they had to have been upscale and well camouflaged she had avoided prison time there should be more police paperwork on her he scoured for paperwork on her leftwing ancestors and found none

refill the bta and mmfl are clowns theyre not worth working they couldnt find their ass on a toilet seat dwight shook his head i disagree why theyre career criminals with a valid grievance a fair segment of this society condones their actions theres a rule of thumb to organizations like these the most forceful psychopath assumes leadership and creates the agenda and the bta and mmlf have some doozies scotty smiled you talk like a lawyer i am a lawyer and you know about psychopaths because youve spent twenty years doing strongarm jobs for mr hoover dwight raised his drinktouchй its that valid grievance line im not buying come on sergeant were both white cops we didnt create the world but we both know how it works and we both know you cant let pissedoff coloreds cash in and fuck up the world because their people got a raw deal and some hoppedup white kids think theyre cool scotty cracked his knuckles if bowen goes bad on his own or in a context you placed him in i will not hesitate to take him down for it that means any and all criminal actions that means ill go in unilaterally without fear of you mr hoover chief reddin or anyone else involved in this operation dwight cracked his knuckles his shirt cuffs were exposed they were bloodsoaked will you keep quiet about this operation yes will you refrain from entrapping marsh bowen or going after him proactively yes

chief reddin scotty smiled you wont do that we both know where it would take us dwight smiled lets step back and give each other one concession scotty said ill go first will you inform me of any pending armed robberies to be performed by bta or mmlf members yes my operating parameters are very strict on that bowen will inform me of pending robberies and i will inform you and if bowen has no knowledge and i learn of pending robberies on my own dwight raised his glass then embellish your reputation and kill the motherfuckers with my best wishes scotty raised his glass whats my concession talk up your hatred of bowen to cops your informants anyone wholl listen to you the more you hate him the more clout hell have with the brothers scotty shrugged thats not much of a concession im doing

vegas mary beth wore his christmasgift sweater to bed it was way too big she tucked her chin under the turtleneck and goofed on him she pulled the cuffs over her hands theres no guarantee that youll find my son but youre determined to spend all that time and money anyway the bedroom drapes were open the nixon signs were down the hotels were hawking yuletide cheer now the green bulbs reminded him of that emerald it was like a dream revived theres no guarantee that ill find him but my instincts keep telling me la im building an informant network there so theres always the chance that something will pan out have you done something like this before wayne rolled away from her he smelled her shampoo on the pillow he took a breath of it she said you found wendell durfee didnt you wayne looked at her yes i did and you killed him yes she pulled the pillow over and got their eyes close she did that a lot she said they both had these green flecks sweetie i already figured that out los angeles the bureau kept a suite at the downtown statler karens baby was just born four blocks away joan wore a red dress dwight wore his mostfed gray suit christmas lights blinked on wilshire the prior tenant left a bottle of ten high joan saw dwights ratched hands and dosed them with bourbon on a washcloth it stung dwight held tears back he thought of thomas f narduno and wondered what joan knew about everything he thought of karen and eleanora joan said save your hands youre fiftytwo years old how do you know that im not telling you what do you want from all this tell me what all this means the job the oper joan touched his lips im here because i want to be i would have asked you if you hadnt asked me his hands burned some tears leaked joan stood on her tiptoes and kissed them off his cheeks the outside lights shaded them weird colors they fell on the bed joan held his head and kissed him her breath tasted like cigarettes and dry wine she wiped off his tears with her thumbs he held her in with his arms his hands were useless he wanted to grab her hair he knew it would kill his hands he couldnt stand this weteyed thing if he touched her hair hed hurt himself and never want it to stop she pushed his head back she kissed him she leaned over him and pinned his wrists and let her hair fall on him he nuzzled the dark parts and bit at the gray streaks and forced her legs apart with his knees she pulled his arms up and pinned his wrists above his head lights played over her underarm stubble and her knife scar she saw that he wanted it she let his wrists go and let him roll into her sideways she held her arms up and let him kiss her there he heard himself gasping and saw them both naked and knew hed lost track of the time she said things they werent quite words she might have said his name she held him softly she took his hands softly and let them brush here here and here he kissed all the places his hands touched she held his hands and held his head there every moment she spread her legs for him to touch and taste and be held there she gasped as he gasped and his eyes burned from all the tears and his hands didnt hurt at all extract from the journal of marshall e bowen january im being courted the pace is slower than mr holly would like both the bta and mmlf have found me along with the panthers and us eldridge cleaver invited me to lunch he brought with him a dubious literary agent who wanted me to write a memoir entitled brother pig an excop tells it like it is within the genocidal lapd i declined mr cleaver looked at me suspiciously the ghetto rumor is that mr cleaver is a very wellplaced informant himself and reports to cutouts at various federal crime commissions that no longer trust mr hoover to rationally assess information brother cleaver had the look of informantarriviste and i think he may have seen it in me ive nixed the panthers and us my relationship with jomo clarkson has me leaning toward the mmlf jomo is rumored to be heisting liquor stores if i come across anything more specific on that ill report it to mr holly the southside clubs are the chief recruiting arms of both organizations if one spends time at sultan sams sandbox raes rugburn room nats nest mr mitchs another world the snooty fox tommy tuckers playroom and the carolina pines on imperial highway one will be approached by btammlf brothers who will speak injudiciously suck up a bit and urge you to attend rallies and other planned activities these men love to talk and describe their criminal actions i have met pimps ticket scalpers the burglars of pornographic bookstores a bta member fed me proof liquor from his basement still and took me to a lakers game with counterfeit tickets bta kingpin ezzard jonesreplete with bogus divinity degreesolicits funds with limited success at southside churches and complains that his girlfriend is getting it on with that persistent white woman joan benny boles cruised me at a bta barbq and pushed all my danger buttons he has an armed robbery conviction and alledgedly killed a maleprostitute lover in leander jackson is charming with his haitian lilt vexing with his voodoo talk and hard to picture as an arms dealer former member of the tonton macoute haitian secret police and heavy conduit to leftist groups in the caribbean j t mccarver runs dice games for the mmlf is a reputed pharmacy burglar and deals goofballs to jordan high school students while claude cantrell torrance the mmlps minister of finance and minister of extortion deals to the manual arts student body note the mmlf are manual arts football fans the bta are jordan high fans and both groups push hatewhitey and killthepigs pamphlets on and off the two campuses both groups front programs to feed wholesome breakfasts to impoverished ghetto children white liberals find this fetching and donate money that the mmlf and bta spends on hatelit supplies guns and dope the breakfasts are homey affairs often written up and photographed by a doting media the breakfast food is extorted from local merchants and the children are fed sugarpacked concoctions like fruit loops cocoa puffs trix crispy critters and puffandstuff pals sunday breakfasts are often followed by media mixers featuring bloody marys soul food and reefer these are hilarious mixedmessage mixedrace moments yeah we wants to kill all de pigs and destroy de white power structure but we thinks you cool and these dumb white motherfuckers think they are cool and these dumb white motherfuckers feel exalted in the presence of swinging black militants so the bta and mmlf are rivals and i bop between both groups and keep my eyes open individuals are viciously bad within both groups but i do not see a percolating or slowly assertive group viciousness in ascent both groups have guns stashed in safe houses joan klein allegedly holds guns for bta members but both groups are primarily in love with guns for their implied statement of masculinity and rarely carry them for fear of lapd street rousts there is much talk of dealing heroin to finance revolution but revolution is a comicbook racistpolemic pipe dream to these people and i doubt if they could put together the seed money necessary to buy heroin in significant quantity so its pamphlet sales parties pub crawls rallies and big talk in great quantity both groups peddle bootleg editions of maos little red book and franz fanons the wretched of the earth ive read both books they both contain wisdom given my life in los angeles my parents horrible tales of life in the south my own lapd experience and my two auspicious beatings by lapd i empathize as much as my compartmentalized psyche and soul will let me but revolution accomplishing anything other than a glancingly ephemeral social good these people are lost in the overall puerile selfish ridethezeitgeist game of it things will go wrong in the end and my efforts of suppression and interdiction may provide my own brand of glancingly ephemeral social good i can only allot social good a smidgen of ink im here for the adventure and to solve the armoredcar heist case and accrue all financial benefit im being courted im listening im learning i think ill be specifically recruited for criminal enterprisesbased on misreadings of my excop statusbefore too long i see scotty bennett out cruising sometimes we always wink and wave at each other because were both addled by the notion of stoicism and acting cool while you harbor big emotion and hate scotty bought me the key to the ghetto and im grateful to him for that ive got both beatings in perspective now i think i sense that they are bringing me closer to the money the emeralds and the secrets of mr holly and i continue to talk via phone drop every third or fourth day hes looking for a cutout to work me on a more regular basis while he continues to run the operation ive indulged the bent at queen anne park a few times since christmas and i must remind myself to be more cautious and discreet i had coffee with joan on christmas eve she seemed to be coming on to me sorry no saleand working me on some level i either dreamt of her or saw her that night i slept at jomos crib which is odd in itself women are by and large difficult for me and i find joan unsettling and a little frightening i may write up my perceptions and get them to mr holly mr holly continues to trouble me i find myself thinking about him much more than i should extract from the privately held journal of karen sifakis january eleanora is squalling and keeping me up all night and im realizing that the joy of dina as a fullfledged child and a developing moral being had blunted me to the debilitating regime of new motherhood this time at age fortythree im not sleeping whn is staying in la fulltime to help his constant presence hinders my internal life and in no way compensates for the assistance hes giving me with ella i havent seen dwight since ella was born whns presence has effectively quashed that dina misses dwight and asks about him when whn is out of earshot i assure her that hell be back soon to tell her wonderfully sanitized tales of his adventures with the fbi she was asking me questions about j edgar hoover last night her father had told her too vividly stories of hoovers cowardly actions during the red scare dina asked me again out of earshot of whatshisname why her father hated hoover so much while dwight held him in such high regard i did not tell her that dwight and hoover share a complex moral history that her father is an intractably aggrieved ideologue and that dwight is punchdrunk behind all his conflicting notions of authority and considers it best to tell little children comforting tales dina wouldnt get it and i wouldnt blame her i keep wondering just how far dwight has gone to appease mr hoover in repayment of the debt he carries for the man i have brought eleanora into a chaste and duplicitous marriage and into a troubled world with richard nixon poised to assume the white house dwight will be buying her odd stuffed animals soon like the alligators he bought dina and she will grow up thinking that predators like dwight are soft and cuddly at some point she will point to me for confirmation of this if i am the least bit candid i will concede my great love for the man which will in some small way explain why the teddy bears her father bought her hold no great emotional sway i miss dwight im going to boot whatshisname out of town soon so we can spend time together and dwight can meet ella hes fixated on joan kleini can sense it as always i pray that my maneuverings and the connections that i facilitate cause more good than harm washington dc we have endured a long night of the american spirit but as bur eyes catch the dimness of the first rays of dawn let us not curse the remaining dark let us gather the light they had boxed seats for the big speech they had preferred paraderoute passes they had tickets for six inaugural balls the new prez soaked up applause froggy said he is a bland man we must circumvent his lack of commitment to the cuban cause crutch touched his lapel pina solid gold he took the scalps and kept his lunch down froggy bought him the pin it honored his closerangekiller status he still had nightmares per that eye socket our destiny

him to bring in a union maintenance crew and toss the scab crew out thornton fumed wayne told him to square the debt to his employees credit union thornton pounded his desk wayne told him the mail

master file i know about scotty bennett your work with clyde duber and the operation to date and your assessment i disapprove of the heroin aspect but its viable within the overall context dramatically viable like your racial baggage in plain view for the brothers to see wayne smiled tell me some things rumors perceptions how you see it so far marsh tried to cross his legs the car tray stopped him he almost looked uncool both groups are courting me i doubt that they can score narcotics so that strategy may prove problematic theres been a series of southside liquorstore robberies with attendant rumors of blackmilitant suspects but nothing more substantive than that you know about those hate cartoons its either the panthers versus us or vice versa although my more conspiracyminded brothers think its the fbi mr holly has assured me that it is not a carhop skated by and waved at marsh she looked like a younger mary beth wayne said theres an outing tonight lets

chaos while a subjectvictim is hexed horror house last summer the markings there the symbols here the derivation expressed call it gretchencelias pages were a paper curse and a voodoo book of the dead extract from the journal of marshall e bowen los angeles it was a minor knife fight with major political implications for two extremely minor political groups but i facilitated it and it occurred on wayne tedrows first day as my cutout jomo suffered minor lacerations and leander received chest bruises when jomos knife blade snapped off wayne got jomo to daniel freeman hospital he was stitched up and released within a few hours i got leander to morningside hospital he confounded the doctors by swallowing several haitian herb pills in the emergency room the placebos calmed him down somewhat jomo is mmlf leander is bta which way do i jump my personal dilemma certainly as always i abut that maddening disjuncture the viable construction of black identity and the dubious construction of revolution as implemented by criminal scum seeking to cash in on legitimate social grievance and cultural trend i now sense this mr holly knew i would succeed as his infiltrator because i am too smart to accede to the rhetoric of revolution and too hip to buy the simpleminded reactionary response mr holly understands that ambivalence shapes performance and that actors are in the end selfcentered and solely concerned with their performing context hell let me walk a thin ideological line and actually risk a blackmilitant conversion because he knows how selfishly motivated i am brilliant mr holly a nonpareil talent scout with a superb eye for acting ensembles casting wayne tedrow as my cutout plays to my strengths and waynes strengths and has paid off immediately an excop with enormous racial baggage is overseeing tiger kab the brothers think hes rogue and rather dig him and nobody suspects that hes fbiadjunct both men are pressuring me wayne wants me to align myself unilaterally with either the bta or the mmlf mr holly wants me to somehow facilitate the dopepushing arm of an aspect of my duties that wayne disapproves of with almost galvinistic fervor heroin is scarce around here i credit some form of black consciousness for its relative scarcity if not black militancy itself thus i cannot rat out bta or mmlf members for the procurement or sale of it anytime soon there have been more southside liquorstore robberies replete with rumors of blackmilitant suspects but my subtle queries on that topic have yet to turn up names im hoping the jomoleander fracas will fester among the btammlf leadership and produce some exploitable discontent in the meantime im making the scene i have partycrashed a mйlange of political poseurs they are recreating a dank form of new york cafй society circa el morocco the stork club and then sultan sams sandbox the scorpio lounge and raes rugburn room now the skin tone has darkened the fashions have changed the cultural bar has been vulgarized and revitalized these people love to see and be seen ezzard donnell jones joan klein benny boles joe mccarver and claude torrance clubhop most evenings i always rate a right on or hey brother because i am a celebrity martyr and prized commodity in one package they sense that i want to be one of them and i think they see my lack of onegroup allegiance as a sign of coyness and of understandable reluctance we gots to let the brother choose sheeeeit brother was a motherfuckiri pig just a few months ago there has been an unsettling barrage of hate cartoons flooding the southside for the past several weeks the chief targets have been the panthers and us along with streetart salvos directed at bta and mmlf my cartoonist and hatetract writing friend jomo ridicules the artistry and has convinced me it did not spring from his handnot my style brother this is mr hoovers work for goddamn sure mr holly disputes thatconvincinglybecause hes given to blunt confirmations or denials sees me as a brother cop on his side and would not try to disingenuously assert that the bureau is above such tactics dwight chalfont holly social realist a man who calls a spade a spade and sometimes a spook shine dinge coon jungle bunny or smoke the master of the mixed message a critic of the lapds vilely abusive conduct on the southside a man who sadly admits that suppression never works expresses a rather haunted respect for martin luther king and enjoys making me the straight man in impromptu amos n andy routines i despise the hackneyed expression a piece of work but that is mr holly denned the same phrase applies to his tortured aidedecamp and quasikid brother wayne tedrow perhaps even more so how odd that wayne is the true killer of the two how odd that he seems to be much less driven by racial animus and appears to be more capable of sustaining equitable relationships with blacks i like wayne ive enjoyed the several cutoutoperatee meetings that weve had ive spread the word on how he killed the three black junkies and psycho rapist wendell durfee of course the brothers loved it wayne has become the stuff of ambiguous ghetto lore already ooooh that wayne the baaaaad and something else i arrived early for one of our meetings wayne was caught unprepared i saw him looking at a photograph of a black woman wayne was quite obviously embarrassed he put the photo down and gave me a look that brusquely stated dont ask i didnt ask wayne i asked mr holly who replied wayne goes deep with you dark motherfuckers and cut the topic off there i did some las vegas newspaper research and identified the woman as a union steward named mary beth hazzard shes a decade older than wayne and is the mother of a longmissing son named reginald reginald hazzard is the young man in the photograph that wayne showed me on the day we met wayne has been showing the photograph to almost everyone he encounters on the southside and seems determined to find the young man come hell or high water my newspaper research also revealed this a west las vegas dope addict killed mrs hazzards minister husband last year then killed himself astonishingly the dope addict was posthumously indicted for the murder of waynes father in june of more astonishingly the vegas rumor is that wayne and his late stepmotherlover killed wayne senior themselves wayne and mr holly absorb me on several levels they are not rogue cops а la scotty bennettthey are rogue authoritarians and wayne miraculously entered my life just as all my subtle queries on the armoredcar heist had panned out fruitlessly and i found myself once again at the startover point in that moment i meet wayne he casually asks me if ive heard stories of black folks receiving emeralds anonymously he shows me a photograph of the young black man hes looking for the young man vaguely resembles the burnedfaced man i met on i feel like im entering a serendipitous dream state what does all of this mean verbatim fbi telephone call transcript marked speaking director hoover special agent dwight c holly jeh good morning dwight dh good morning sir jeh wayne tedrow and the sullen negress mary beth hazzard i would be remiss in not expressing my horror and delight dh yes sir jeh guilt assumes many forms mrs hazzard is not a comely negress in the lena home mode she is undoubtedly given to phrases like power to the people and predisposed to the music of archie bell and the drells dh yes sir jeh you are being deliberately obtuse this morning dwight you went through a spell like that when i deported emma goldman in dh yes sir jeh sirhan sirhan is on trial and the formal james earl ray proceedings should begin in april would you say the bureau is covered there dh yes sir jeh and the dr fred hiltz homicide dh again sir were covered jack leahy has the case buried jeh jack leahy is the alger hiss to my huac and the costello to my abbott he is a traitor and an unfunny nightclub comedian who has ridiculed my penchant for antiques dh yes sir no one has ever quite figured jack out jeh he was your partner in you worked the milwaukee office with him dh yes sir i remember jeh im appalled by those hate cartoons circulating in south los angeles i want you to determine their origin immediately and send me copies of all such works of filth extant dh ill get on it sir jeh wayne tedrow as marshall bowens cutout do you still defend the choice dh vehemently sir jeh why pray tell because the dusky widow of the preacher he killed has imbued young wayne with a surfeit of soul dh yes sir in part jeh and our congolese cuties the bta and mmlf will they cooperate with our agenda and push heroin sooner or later dh i think they will sir jeh and the infant daughter of informant dh lively and healthy sir jeh

smith tjsmc retired president iss security limited santo domingo dominican republic marked dear mr tedrow this letter follows up your colleague jeanphilippe mespledes recent trip to the dr to view casinosite locations and to discuss the possibility of building said hotelcasinos in this country i am pleased to tell you that president joaquin balaguer is very anxious to have your businesses here and has pledged considerable resources in an effort to convince you to come a brief history will give you a sense of the dr and our island neighbor haiti and will above all convince you that this is a safe place for american tourists and your overseers and their hotelcasino personnel the dr comprises the eastern twothirds of the island of hispaniola and santo domingo discovered by columbus in is considered to be the oldest city in the western world innumerable coups involving spain france and holland led to the current dominican secession from spain numerous battles between indigenous negroes and the french resulted in independence for haiti relations have remained strained between the dr and haiti this stands as the case today haiti however exists in a state of dire poverty while the dr is developing into the very model of a safe and sane prous anticommunist republic the haitian border is heavily patrolled by dominican forces assisted by agents of president balaguers personal intelligence unit la banda in collaboration with my security firm informant networks have been recruited by the above agencies the haitian population of the dr and illegal haitian immigration into the dr has been well interdicted and suppressed the haitians are a primitive race of people heavily reliant on their practice of voodoo and made tractable by their addictive use of klerin liquor and mindaltering herbs the president of haiti franзois papa doc duvalier came to power as a voodoo proponent and keeps his people suppressed by allowing voodoo to flourish his private police force the tonton maeoute are recruited from voodoo societies and enforce voodoo as president duvaliers chief means to retain the societal status quo and keep himself in power under dominican president trujillos rule there were several dominican army slaughters of unruly haitian йmigrйs on june a castroite group called the movement staged a failed invasion of the drs shores the brief civil war was in fact a farce sternly resolved when president johnson sent in a marine contingent to restore order to a nation seeking to establish free elections a leftist named juan bosch was fraudulently elected and held power briefly a truly free election was held in bosch was deposed and prous president balaguer was honorably elected the last official marine unit withdrew from the dr on president balaguer is no flamboyant rafael trujillo but president balaguer knows how to keep dissent at a low roar and understands the importance of maintaining a tidy nation that american and european tourists will want to visit he is on superbly good terms with the military should crackdowns or cleanups of haitians or leftwing insurgents be required and president balaguer is willing to proactively invest in your hotelcasino foray by pledging land free of charge for casino sites in santo domingo proper and outside of it see addendum report for structural studies and soilcomposition studies he will grant hughes air the exclusive flight rights to reserved vip landing strips at the santo domingo airport will build extra runways for the increased air travel free of charge and will supply unskilled haitian and dominican peasant workers for the casino build a construction company that he is part owner of will supply building materials at a reduced cost and my security firm and la banda stand ready to provide hour security for the building sites i am recommending four cuban menas casinosite work bosses they are cuban mercenaries spanish and englishfluent and have preexisting work relationships with the operatives in my security firm and the agents in la banda again i will stress the threat of revolt or the shenanigans of leftwing gadfly groups will pose no threat to the casino build and the presence of unruly haitian йmigrйs and dominican peasants will be curtailed before it can reach the point where it might upset visiting tourists as of this writing president balaguer is preparing an addendum incentive package as his way to say bienvenidos to you and your investors group in summation i can only state that you and your people would be well advised to say sн to our proposal you will be welcomed to a country with a stable political climate a solid economy and a leadership anxious to lend a helping hand sincerely ivar s smith usmc retired las vegas the clark county sheriffs sent more

perpetrate a containable chaos dwight is committed to furthering the fbis shortterm ends i want to create the illustion that the operation has reached its logical and successful point of termination dwight believes that this conclustion will derail the blacknationalist movement i believe that the blacknationalist movement will be only momentarily discredited dwight will have done his job and will have seen his assignment through to a cosmetically vouched end the rebuttal to that nonend will be a continuous and continuously growing level of disbelief moral horror and unofficial censure that will lead in time to an asyetunimaginable plane of liberation the fbi wants the bta and mmfl to move heroin they believe that it will expose black nationalism as inherently criminal and reveal black people at large to be inherently depraved the fbis shortterm goal is a sedated black populace its longterm goal is the perpetuation of racial servitude i want the bta and mmlf to move heroin i will risk the shortterm probability of squalor in fervent hope that the sustained depravity of heroin will lead to a rich expression of racial identity and ultimately to political revelation and revolt in that sense i see honor hope and beauty where dwight does not our goals are both inimical and fully synchronous we diverge and cohere in equal measure we are devout union and misalliance i have begun a

issue say her name then accuse me of something give me the chance to confirm or deny karen lit a cigarette her hand trembled dwight held eleanora while she smoked mr hoover called bayard rustin a prehensiletailed night creature at the american legion dwight said i know his remarks regressed from there i know jack leahy showed me a copy of the speech eleanora kicked dwight rocked her back to sleep the awning leaked water dripped near their feet karen said theres a safe house near cal riverside ive been in it theres a closet with four pump shotguns and a box of hand grenades a man with a

reached for eleanora karen pulled her back dwight walked out into the rain three pills and drinks failed him his circuits sparked and kept him awake adrenaline ate through the sedation he got dressed and drove to eagle rock it was midnight the courtyard was quiet the rain brought red flashes and thunder peals dwight picked the lock and let himself in he hit the lights the pad looked identical he walked to the bed and tossed the pillows he found the same gun and diary he opened it and found new sheets my shortterm aims and dwights shortterm aims have blurred i have come to share dwights view of the bta and mmlf they are criminals driven by personal animus at the expense of political consciousness dwight credits them with no consciousness i credit them with dawning consciousness blunted by the selfserving pathology of angry males in groups these men must push heroin and facilitate a definable squalor it must be the contained chaos that dwight and i both desire the dawning of consciousness must be provoked through the application of moral terror dwight and mr hoover believe that the stimulus of heroin will prove overpowering to black militants their followers and the uncountable black people moved by their rhetoric their mass capitulation will confirm vile racist caricature discredit black radicalism and suppress its emerging mainstream appeal i believe that the dawning of political consciousness will serve to confront and transcend this obstacle reinvent the formerly criminal and cast them in the hero roles they now so selfishly and fatuously seek this controlled chaos will not conclude in political dissolution the chaos is too steeped in the horrifying context of white neglect and injustice to be anything but liberating i have seen and done horrifying things in my long revolutionary struggle my deployment of heroin in algeria in prooved ambiguous i sternly trust that any and all conflicts in thsi journey will resolve in my favor not dwights and that no human beings will die dwight reread the pages he skimmed and jumped and hopscotched the text the printing blurred the booze and pills kicked in late he saw spots and ink wisps the floor rolled he lay down and shut his eyes the bed rolled the floor dipped he didnt know if he was awake or asleep or someplace in between he drifted it was scary and peaceful his head and limbs felt funny he went blank for a while he opened his eyes and saw joan she sat on the bed one leg was cocked her knee brushed his hip she wore boots over black nylon stockings full of runs her hair was tied back how did you find it the cartoons you had printed you left an easy trail the cartoons were a bust it wont happen again who drew them an old freedom school student of mine dwight sat up dizziness slammed him down joan squeezed his knee dwight traced her stocking runs and found some bare leg to touch she said heroin they cant score it they wont be able to deal it for ten seconds without getting popped i could help them ill consider it joan laced up their fingers dwight tore out a stocking run and cupped her whole leg how many of these places do you have im not telling you you left the diary out for me to find did you get the idea from karen sifakis karens a maildrop friend i dont actually know her did you leave the diary out for me to find joan nodded dwight said nobody dies joan took his face in her hands the dizziness faded out he felt his body again her hands steadied him joan said what do you want dwight said i want to fall and i want you to catch me on the way down santo

meaning he stared at the book for nine straight hours his brain jumped to this repetition meant banality it meant boredom on gretchencelias part she spiced her narrative up to amuse herself and to confuse potential readers the symbols did not bode portent they were innocuous his second jump they were abbreviations his third jump the explicated text would be coherent but shorthanded gretchencelias cursive writing was fevered she was anxious she composed in haste the code work absorbed her energy his fourth jump the symbols were substitutes for and the and to he crossed the

angeles the tattoo the skin color the locationdate its that night its horror house its the night he saw joan and gretchencelia kiss extract from the privately held journal of karen sifakis march eleanora rules my days she is a mighty empress and imperious ruler of my heart as well as an exhausting bundle of ceaseless energy and need she focuses me and deflects my actions and thoughts not directly related to her my husband is back in philadelphia now his monthslong presence here amounted to indentured servitude as well as assisted me in the prosaic tasks of new motherhood and kept me away from dwight now i am alone with eleanoraand in fact besieged by herand dwight is back with a besieging force our fight at echo park was horrible i have no right to question his actions with joan for our very union is duplicitous and a grave misdeed in and of itself one difference between dwight and me adultery is hardly as onerous as spawning political chaos another difference i wish to skate by with my misdeeds while dwight harbors the buried urge to be punished for his that is a succinct primer on my love for him i see political misdeeds escalating and find myself reflexively attributing them to the fbi mr hoover and by extension dwight two panthers were shot and killed at ucla in january the killings allegedly derived from a longstanding pantherus grievance and came to a head over the creation of an afroamerican studies center on campus i know that the bureau has double agents in both organizations and is committed to spawning intergroup discord a panther spokesman called the killings political assassinations carried out by us on orders by the pig power structure i have come to hate the word pig as much as i hate the word nigger and find myself damning dwight for his perception of ingrained criminality in the blacknationalist movement indictments are pending against numerous panthers in new york city for an alleged plot to dynamitebomb the perm central tracks at rush hour are they insane dont they know black people would have been killed i bomb monuments and have never physically damaged a human being am i insane to be doing this under dwight hollys sanction what horrible price will i pay for my role in assuaging this mans guilt and where does that guilt specifically come from mr hoover seems determined to go out in a psychotically hateful blaze of glory and he has found an unrelenting minion in dwight who now has joan klein to aid and abet and perhaps comfort him i am afraid that dwight will passively permit or actively suborn the bta and mmlf in the sale of narcotics and that he has found a willing accomplice in joan joan understands the concept of narcotics as a tool of revolution and has deployed it before i fear that joan and dwight seek the same physical end for antithetical political motives they want to bring the bta and mmlf to a point of public censure and blithely underestimate the human cost ive told joan intimate things about dwight she knows that dwight has burgled my home on occasion and that i leave a much less candid and controversial journal out for him to peruse im afraid that expressions of my troubled love for dwight have pushed joan toward him in the effort to further her own political goals joan has been to dauntingly dangerous places of revolution and has committed deedsand yes misdeedsthat i am both thankful and regretful i am incapable of i do not doubt her sincerity or utter commitment and have seen her in moments of frank goodnessour shared teaching duties at the freedom school in was one instancebut i utterly fear her fury and will she and dwight possess a blindsiding likemindedness and emotional hunger i pray that it will not supersede their utilitarian instincts and cause dire harm extract from the journal of marshall e bowen los angeles im in trouble the incident last night may get back to scotty bennett the consequences may fuck up the balance of my personal life and the operation and thus my search for the armoredcar money and emeralds mr holly has been pressing me for snitchouts and wayne has been pressing me to fall in with either the bta or mmlf exclusively when pressed i vacillate and consider my options rarely do i vacillate to the point of stunned inaction last night i did wayne has become a southside regular hes been buying cocktail lounges and afterhours clubs and has been making the scene at tiger kab of all people wayne has brought exheavyweight champ and selfdescribed chump sonny liston into the tiger kab fold sonny is a boozing pillpopping whorechasing fool the brothers are afraid of him and afraid to admit that they dig him sonny is very rightwing he hates muslims and militants and grooves richard nixon and the vietnam war his two losses to muhammad ali combined with his chemical intake have stretched his brain cells thin he is however funny unlike tiger kab kokaptain milt chargin who will go to any and all degraded lengths to make black people laugh and to appear cool tiger kab is now trиs au kourant the krew is picaresque working on combustible we are riding the blacknationalist zeitgeist the panthers get the headlines while the bta and mmlf make the scene with the fervor of stork club nobodies seeking out walter winchell please notice us were black were violent were trying to score dope and were cool i vacillate and visit both the bta and mmlf headquarters i endure constant lapd surveillance and three or four street rousts a week my exlapd status enrages southside bluesuits theyve taken to calling me boy and detaining me for twentyminute spells while they run radio warrant checks i always turn up clean they always release me with jabs in the chest and parting epithets i am quietly enraged and say nothing i cant exercise the bent im afraid to im speciously famous now any assignation might result in a roust or a phone call to lapd i have to put my intimate urges on hold while i assess while mr holly and wayne press me while the bta and mmlf brothers tap their blackbooted feet impatiently and urge me to choose sides i have subtly pumped every southside acquaintance fool and boon companion i know and spontaneously meet for information on the heist and have learned nothing i see scotty bennett around the southside constantly he always doffs his blackstyleconscious porkpie hat and winks at me scotty knows a great deal about the heist i know that hes the brilliant lead detective with five years of knowledge stored i strongly sense that hes hoarding knowledge from the lapd at large its as if scotty is taunting me and pressing me as mr holly and wayne taunt me and press me with their powerfully masculine and obdurately circumscribed wills i keep thinking of mr holly with women and what it would look like until the images begin to vex me and hurt wayne is guilttripping with a black woman and providing me with a similarly erotic picture show hes looking for the womans missing son who bears a minor resemblance to the surviving robber from the heist i dont consider it a true lead the robbers face was badly burned and reginald hazzard was a mere nineteen then its more like an affirmation of the dreamstate aspect of my life now with all the new figures weaving through and beckoning benny boles has been cruising me quite boldly hes as out as i am euphemized and will probably pounce if i go with the bta hes a murderer and recognizably psychopathic which may account for his confidence in his masculinity i see joan klein at the clubs regularly she quite consciously beckons shes a voraciously sensuous dancer concurrently in and out of sync with her male and female partners she glimpses me in the shadows bestows eye contact and acknowledges me without ever losing the musics beat its as if shes telling me things about myself that shes gleaned from her dream state ive found myself bringing fantasies of joan and mr holly to bed with me they dont know each other in the real world but i know them both there and theyve converged within my psyche and jomo hes certainly scum but i have been charged to fraternize with and entrap scum and i like him anyway weve been spending time together at tiger kab mmlf and the clubs jomo has gotten more at ease with me since his knife fight with leander jackson hes been talking up a significant roll that hes accrued and ive been very cautiously grinding him for details to give to mr holly i was at that task up to moments before the incident last night we had been on a grocerystore extortion run it was connivance and implied threat

shivered and jammed her hands in her pockets word will spread marsh handed up jomo we certified marsh and got jomo off the street in one go its why i let the mmlf store guns in a bta safe house the bta and mmlf will take it from there you knew marsh was my infiltrator joan nodded off a fight with scotty bennett it was so fucking bold that it had to be you dwight shivered nobody dies remember theres some guns that wont hurt anyone it might not be that simple which should not impede our actions two cops walked by dwight stepped toward joan he took her hands with his cop world in view why this and why now we both have blood on our hands maybe ive got more than you what do you mean joan said theres things i know about you extract from the privately held journal of karen sifakis los angeles april the outside world infringes on the quiet home life ive tried to create for my children the newspaper lands on my door every morning and i cant help but look then dwight knocks on my door and tells me what the newspapers have omitted two panthers were charged with nonfatal assaults on two police officers in brooklyn legal actions against the panthers are proceeding in a dozen cities dwight thinks the panthers are selfdestructing they are riddled with fbi and municipal police informants who are creating internal discord which leads to intragroup violence which gets largescale publicity which leads to largescale public censure which leads to more publicityseeking violence the panthers and occasionally us get the headlines while dwight continues to hammer at the lowly bta and mmlf because he considers their antics to bode as a fully contained media event that he can orchestrate at whim in that sense he is the quintessential man with a job and the job appears to be getting to him the newspapers tell me that blackmilitant firebrand jomo kenyatta clarkson who admitted to a daring series of liquorstore holdups committed suicide while in custody at the los angeles county jail the incident has sparked a revitalized hatred between the bta and mmlf ive heard street talk about this its considered gospel expoliceman marshall bowen now an avid bta supporter ratted off clarkson for the robberies i came to a realization belatedly bowen must be dwights infiltrator dwight has never named the man he protects the identities of his cutouts infiltrators and informants he has done that with me although mr hoover in his declining state has spoken injudiciously about my relationship with dwight mr hoover is a celibate homosexual prone to crushes on rugged and assertive men my intimate accord with dwight suffused with conflicting ideology must confuse and appall the old man no end the clarkson matter weighs on dwight the machinationwhatever went down with clarkson and bowenhad to have been at dwights instigation perhaps with joan kleins involvement ive seen dwight twice recently we made love but he seemed to want the consolation more than the sex he kept bringing up the topic of heroin and how leftist radicals view it as a political tool i smelled joan all over that construction dwight sleeps even more fitfully now i can feel him twitching his way through nightmares when he awakens he peers at me almost suspiciously its as if hes wondering what i know about him and what ive told other people weve burgled each others homes hes read my much less candid journal ive seen his checkwriting kit and have mentioned it to him elliptically my blackbag jobs are a subtext of our relationship one that dwight accepts ive often wondered about the specific nature of dwights debt to mr hoover last week i did some checking and came up with an answer of sorts i recalled the starting date of dwights check ledger spring i knew the check recipients names mr and mrs george diskant of nyaek new york i did some newspaper microfilm research then and learned the story it was january a man traveling north on the merritt parkway hit a center divider he was drunk the collision killed mr and mrs diskants two teenaged daughters the man was not named nor was he ever criminally charged i can only assume that mr hoover pulled strings i would also be foolish to assume that dwights horrible bond with that man was shaped by a single incident and no more joan has told me that she knows things about dwight she leaves it at that i wonder if she knows more about him than i do despite their shorterterm dealings i may be granting joan a prescient quality that she does not really possess still i swear that i can smell her on dwight extract from the journal of marshall e bowen los angeles its may day im standing on the roof of my building observing traffic jams on the san diego and harbor freeways and an antiwar march downtown the bta and mmlp are passing out leaflets along the march route i declined to participate i expect that there will be skirmishes and that i will be viewed as the cause im very frightened its an escalating feeling that has me coming out of my skin it started last month when wayne told me to confront jomoill tell the world that youre a faggot if you dont oh yes the threat worked i confronted jomo and jomo is dead and im a direct link in the cause and effect if wayne knows who else knows and how did they find out does mr holly know do scotty bennett or the lapd at large know does the fbi know do men within the bta and mmlf know how did i reveal myself was it the absence of women in my life that led wayne to an informed supposition i am not in the least effeminate and have always gone to great lengths to rid myself of the affect that men with the bent generally possess do i swish do i assume handsonhips poses unconsciously do i lisp are my shitkickingblack male mannerisms butch queer in some codified manner has some twosecond anonymous trick out of my very circumspect past come forth to recognize me as a local celebrity and rat me off for police favors do people simply sense auras in the sexually chargeddreamstate world i inhabit all of this frightens me the upshot of the jomo situation is much more perilous scotty bennett popped jomo for that liquorstore spree that i suspected him of mr holly who appeared oddly shocked by the incident told me that scotty beat jomo halfdead at th street station and sent him to morningside hospital with severe kidney damage jomo hung himself in his cell several days later that latter part of the story made the papers and got brief coverage on tv mr holly told me the story that never received public exposure that jomo confessed to a series of highstakes residential robberies and the dr fred hiltz murder of last year the crimes netted an estimated and were committed with a partner in no way aligned with the bta or mmlf the man blew all of the money on cocaine gambling and prostitutes in las vegas jomo learned of this killed the man and bodydumped him in the desert mr holly interviewed jomo in the la county jail the day before he killed himself jomo told mr holly that his half of the robbery take was earmarked for a buy heroin fund for the mmlf vicious and hapless criminal fools jomo pulls daring highline jobs and clouts liquor stores jomo trusts his whorechasing dopefiend partner the mmlfs dope seed money is squandered i beat up jomo jomo gets popped tangentially and offs himself i should be grateful that scotty busted jomobecause jomo would have come after me sooner or later jomos dead all the better unfortunately its playing out much differently the word is out i gave jomo up to scotty it isnt true everyone who counts believes it anyway my new bta brothers are glad right on brother marsh that nigger jomo was stonebaaaad and stoneantibta im covered with them and uncovered everywhere else i told wayne i didnt snitch jomo he said he believed me but im not sure he does i told mr holly i didnt do it mr holly said he didnt believe me but his disbelief was not fully convincing scotty knows im not the informant but he came by tiger kab yesterday and hugged me in full view of the crew scotty wants people to think it ive lost all sane track of what wayne and mr holly want people to think ive been hung out to dry i dont know who did it i dont think scotty simply attributed the snitchout to me as a means to avenge mr hollys staged beating somebody did this to me i dont know who but it has to be politically motivated nobody knows im a plant except wayne mr holly and a very few people in the fbi and on lapd it could be any blackmilitant street fool or fool ideologue it could be some marginalized or factionalized bta or mmlf fool with a fools gut instinct ive started wearing a bulletproof vest the mmlf allegedly has a bounty out on me some mmlf fools saw me on central avenue and tossed brimfull maltliquor cans at me im frightened i wear that vest and spend hours standing in front of my bedroom mirror perfecting mannerisms have i betrayed the bent unconsciously i am not in the least effeminate did someone prescient within my overall dream state simply discern the bent in me ive stopped making queries on the armoredcar heist my lust for the money and emeralds has been subsumed by a survivors instinct im sitting still for now but wayne and mr holly are demanding results mr holly has been talking up the bta as a heroin conduit he wants me to proffer the notion to my bta brothers who are too motherfucking dumb to score heroin at a yard sale at a poppy farm in thailand which mr holly cant quite grasp im scared im sitting still im waiting im wearing that vest im studying deadstraight men and practicing their moves and masculine craft in my mirror per deadstraight theres one bright spot in my life right now my crazy haitian friend leander james jackson leander loves me but hes stone straight so tough luck there he had that knife fight with jomowhich wayne and i provokedso he loves me for my alleged snitchout which resulted in jomos death i told leander that i didnt do it leander laughed and said baby boy i dont believe you leander loves rum and reefer and enjoys recounting his days in la belle haiti he tortured dissidents for the tonton macoute practiced voodoo and took a sharp left turn he assisted a group of rebel invaders and fled the island one step ahead of the noose i wish i could tell him baby boy im frightened so im sitting still these days i have one friend many nameless enemies and two enemy friends hovering close wayne knows that i have the bent i dont want mr holly to know it or to know that pictures of him and that strange woman joan haunt

speaking director hoover special agent dwight c holly jeh good morning dwight dh good morning sir jeh your telex implied that you have bad news tell it like it is as president nixon often states in his fawning efforts to sound au courant with longhairs and insurrectionseeking negroes dh yes sir jeh theres also can you dig it and are you cool with it which are new favorites of the white radio personalities who have taken up the chant that i am too old for this job dh yes sir jeh right on brother is an expression that is considered in the groove these days i addressed vice president agnew in that manner last week he gave me a clenchedfist salute i was deeply gratified it was akin to receiving the french legion of honor dh yes sir jeh youre stalling dwight dh chief reddin called me sir he told me that he had taken marsh bowen off roster hes been fired from lapd so lapd is in no way accountable for his actions the firing was clandestine which protects us at least so jeh must not be derailed or in any way diverted bowen must not know that hes been fired why did this occur tell it like it is dh i think scotty bennett went to reddin and offered a rationale for the firing i believe that bennetts personal animus precipitated this action jeh bennett has favored us in at least one regard he did not expose the late jomo kenyatta clarkson and his late crime partner as the killers of the late hate merchant dr fred hiltz which has spared the bureau a great deal of apeinspired scrutiny dh yes sir jeh jomo kenyatta clarkson has fucked pat nixon on numerous occasions a confidential informant in the hollywood community informed me of this fact they were under the influence of the drug quaaludes commonly known as ludes dh yes sir i was think jeh there will be bureau raids on black panther offices in denver chicago and salt lake city during the first week of june i am grateful for it but it lacks the illuminating pizzazz of our operation which is a fully formed explication of negro criminality and indigenous moral sloth i want the bta andor the mmlf to sell heroin the public has been numbed to death and charmed to sleep by the panthers they need evil apes they can sink their teeth into i assure you that i am telling it like it is dh yes sir jeh the honorary negro wayne tedrow lay it on me brother dh hes status quo sir he was in the dominican republic nec jeh dick nixon is peeved at wayne once removed wayne pulled the plug on a plucky little group of anticastro brigands that bebe rebozo was bankrolling bebe is determinedly anticommunist i respect him for that dh ill be speaking to the president tomorrow night sir ill advise him on the wayne matter as you advise me jeh do what you like tell it like it is because im cool with it dh yes sir jeh nixey boy has never learned the rudiments of achieving a close shave i use wilkinson sword blades my personal file on nixon would ruin him the files in my basement would create armageddon instantaneously dh yes sir jeh the bta andor the mmlp must push heroin we must create a properly controlled chaos dh yes sir jeh i dream of martin lucifer king quite often he invariably wears a reddevil costume and carries a pitchfork dh yes sir jeh do you dream of him dh frequently sir jeh and how is he attired dh he always wears a halo and wings jeh abrupt and muffled commentphone transcript terminates here closed file

dwight i enjoy these talks of ours and wayne has been instrumental in facilitating our arrangement with the italians but bebe is bebe and wayne fucked with him dh may i make a few blunt comments mr president rmn tell it like it is dh wayne tedrow is a very competent man given to the occasional extravagant gesture the foolishness that he interdicted may have proven detrimental to the casino build in the dr mr rebozos pet exile group is composed of dubious farright ideologues with a giant oozing hardon to depose fidel castro and as you once told me sir the fucker is here to stay i would describe mr rebozos exile comrades as heedless and whimsical at best gratuitously psychopathic at worst wayne did the prudent thing sir rmn youre absolutely correct dwight moreover the dr is a shithole the boys may take a bath on their hotels and joaquin balaguer is solidly antired and a good deal more tractable than rafael trujillo that cocksucker was a nightmare you wouldnt believe the cia file on him the shit he pulled with his socalled bitter rival papa doc duvalier was horrific they looted land smuggled emeralds and foreclosed banks and split the profits while theyre doing this the goat is slaughtering haitian refugees and papa doc is fucking half of his girlfriends dh strange bedfellows sir rmn on that note lets talk about youknowwho i was listening to the radio today a disc jockey called him gay edgar dh the media has been unkind lately sir rmn do you think he takes it up the keester dh i think he finds the closet too confining for that sir rmn a little schlong would make him less uptight dh yes sir rmn hes losing it right dwight dh yes sir but again hes utterly dangerous and should be handled delicately rmn and hes got those goddamn files dh he does sir rmn and theyre wildly revealing and impolitic dh not as much as this conversation sir rmn dwight youre a pisser its fun to belt a couple and jaw with salty guys like you dh sir i enjoy our chats very much

parttime theres the voodooshack epiphany hes zombified his brain broils as his body is bokurbound and immobile emeraldscelia laurentjean jacqueauamericachanged name his mind melts and morphs to the armoredcar heist he tracked the epiphany and validated it he b amped the la banda ops office and found some paperwork it was cryptic and written in spanish he took minox pix developed the film and pidgin englishtranslated an emerald shipment left santo domingo destination la the sender and recipientnot listed no mode of transport listed no names to latch on to the paper trail deadended there he tried to track tonton turncoat laurentjean jacqueau he took as his disappearance date and extrapolated he checked outbound emigration records he got nothing he checked incoming us йmigrйs and got nothing he started with jacqueaus real name that didnt work he tried his initials that didnt work he expanded from there he checked intake sheets on all negro caribbean males and got nothing all he got was scuttlebutt and oral history the goat and papa doc were emerald fiends he got that and no more likewise emeralds and laurentjean jacqueau likewise emeralds celia reyes and joan rosen klein he raided three file troves the cia la banda and ivar smiths group he saw no target names listed he got no green fire leads rotation he made sixteen cuban runs and eight dope runs all top secret all accomplished in defiance of wayne t wayne paid ivar smith to surveil tiger krew and report back to him ivar told froggy this froggy and ivar countermanded wayne ivar doubledealt wayne for a cut of the dope biz they developed a warning system ivar preannounced waynes visits the dope biz and cuban runs were curtailed then tiger krew anticastroized and dopedealt while wayne was gone tiger klaw launched from seclusion the puerto rican runs were clandestine the tonton spooks ran the conduit to portauprince his deadcommie count stood at twentyfour now the coastal runs entailed torpedo lobs tiger klaw slipped in and bombslathered the coast moored boats went down with scorched reds on board the scalp runs got to him more the body counts were lower and high nightmare quotients resulted all the runs were nerveknocking he fueled up on voodoo herbs froggy and the cubans never suspected le poudre zombie almost killed him the heist revelation issued from that altered state he trusted the moment and kept trying to recapture it most voodoo herbs were brainbracing and benign he logicked that one out he snuck into haiti and scored herbs to rev him and calm him the shit worked it buttressed his balls and got him to cuba and back it never revived revelations per his case it helped with his nightmares electric chair the hands and feet the eye bad dreams kept him up he dosed himself with voodoo herbs and went peeping it wore him out woman imagery subsumed his dreams most nights he dug on voodoo he didnt believe in it he hexed wayne a million times anyway he grooved the ritual wayne was too big to fuck with voodoo had a power beyond his volition he grokked that aspect of it his life was work the casino build was go go go twelve floors were up at all four locations heavy rains slowed things down slaves died from overwork and required replacement froggy and the cubans bossed the work crews la banda goons assisted ivar smith warned them of waynes visits froggy brought ringer work crews in wayne brought bribe and construction cash crutch steered clear of him and hatehexed him froggy and the cubans oozed mock innocence they hated wayne wayne required bigtime connivance and kid gloves rotation crutch worked in the dr and la his case was bifurcated the maria rodriguez fontonette snuff and the armoredcar heist celia blew in and out of santo domingo he couldnt track her down he ran more paper checks he surveilled the known safe houses on the la banda list he tailed commie punks from cia dissident lists in the dumb hope that they knew her it was futile he got diverted by random women window glimpses swerved him for days at a pop he had to find celia she was his spark point to joan rotation crutch lied to froggy he laid out clyde duber needs me in la tales froggy said sure he flew to la and prowled he read clydes heist file a dozen times got the gist and no more he called wells fargo he tried to track the emerald shipment and got rebuffed he went back to clydes file scotty bennetts obsession with the case was confirmed that was old news the new news scottys filed reports were threadbare omissions a paper dearth he knew scotty they bullshitted at the wheelman lot scotty showed him reports on minor heistsalways detailpacked his reports on slight by comparison he tried to pump scotty he came on suuuubtle but scotty did not reveal shit he didnt tell scotty that hed hotwired marsh bowen scotty would slam bowen at the proper time a ripe rumor rippled bowen snitched a spade named jomo for some liquorstore jobs jomo offed himself in jail scotty told crutch that he was spreading the rumor safe bet bowens queer ass was cooked rotation the island was a zombie zone la was a safe zone he dropped by the wheelman lot and brought beer and pizza he went by his pad at the vivian and his downtown file pad he read his mothers missing person file it helped smother his nightmares his mother sent him five bucks and a christmas card this one was postmarked kansas city she split in she sent her first card that year she sent a card for christmas it was now she was still alive like celia and joan like dana lund and all the hancock park girls in windows his case was stalled scotty had to have more paperwork dana lund had new gray hair she wore the cashmere sweater hed bought her at christmas danas gray streaks looked like joans it was all a fucking knife to the heart las vegas los angeles the dominican republic haiti dream state it was bowens stated concept it was his life now it was unquantifiable it reminded him of his early chemistry studies some experiments brought assured results many did not he took greater risks and became more attuned to uncertainty a world existed beyond his comprehension the notion drove him and consoled him then and now his herb trips clarified his dream state they brought him an unforeseeable hope they dulled his sense of risk more he flies to the dr and detours into haiti he hires tonton thugs to protect him as he chemically dallies he brings money for celia and joan he tells celia to deploy the money and spare him the details she has pledged to leave the building sites alone he has donated the results are unquantifiable dream state he liquidated his fathers estate and reimbursed balaguers construction firm that covered his first impromptu tithe he became an embezzler then the boys trusted him with quickly tallied and unvouchered cash they knew he loved power and gave little thought to financial remuneration he skimmed skim off dracs hotels he diverted payments from teamsterbook buyouts he cooked the books at tiger kab and the southside clubs he quickwashanddried funds through the peoples bank he delivered monthly stipends to balaguer and nearequal funds to celia he asked to speak to joan it pertained to a young man she knew at one time celia said under no circumstances and please dont ask me again he refrained from further requests he chased joan and the ghost of reginald hazzard back to la dwight refused to discuss joan wayne submitted a federal file request through a friend on lvpd joans file was missing from central records the bureau had no file on joans colleague karen sifakis dwight pulled both files he was sure of that he ran a nationwide pd check on both women and got nothing that second little click kept clicking him he did antiredaction work on joans file his memory clicked and stalled out there he scoured south la he couldnt find joan he built a partial joanreginald time line the freedom school the jail bailout he scoured files in the dr joan tied to celia reyes and embroiled in dominican revolt joan one file photo the invasion and a younger woman with a fist raised late reginald studies haitian herbs and hardleft politics joans a renegade professor its a wild tutelage the haitian connectionjump then to now joan is btatight the bta armorer haitian hellion leander james jackson brother jackson had a knife fight with the late jomo clarkson wayne and marsh bowen provoked it jackson was allegedly extonton macoute wayne tried to run a tonton records check on him the tonton kept no written records more file checks more dead ends no file on leander james jackson no immigration files on men with those three initials no fed or munipd files extant jackson most likely unrelated to reginald and joan he considered bracing bowen on jackson and decided against it bowen would probably doubledeal confidential information dream state he cruises southside la he looks for people who arent there hes got tiger kab and the clubs as information hubs nobody knew reginald then or knows reginald now hes handchecking lapd and sheriffs station files hes looking for one name in millions of words i will find reginald hazzard just as i found wendell durfee i will impart mercy as i once imparted death his dream state imposed clarity it seamlessly bridged la and the dr the hotelcasinos were going up it was a controlled experiment with quantifiable results he was tithing revolution at a consistently opposing rate ivar smith was watchdogging tiger krew the fucks were abstaining from cuban runs and had scotched their dope biz that was quantifiable that controlled experiment worked he visited tiger krew he soaked up their hatred and fear the red borders of his uscaribbean junkets blurred the boys loved him he hated them and sucked up to them and bilked them the boys knew he was with a black woman they kept quiet because they needed his skills he spends time with them he fraternizes with queer black militants hes riding his dreamscape through a zeitgeist with an offred flag aswirl marsh bowen was fulltime wired wayne checked the listening post every third day marsh and his pals talked revolutionary shit and never did shit to create revolution they cant score heroin half of them dont want to score heroin a few have tenuous moral qualms most just fear the fuzz chicago cops killed two panthers in december the panthers shot it out with lapd the same month it was a nonfatalletoffsteamcouldhavebeenus moment whew heroin brother im not sure it frustrated dwight it delighted wayne he smoked weed with marsh once they again discussed the dreamstate concept marsh didnt know he was wired marsh didnt know that lapd bagged his ass they stood in the tiger kab lot wayne got this nutty idea ill tell him i killed martin luther king and see how he takes it dwight didnt trust marsh dwight was righthes a timebuyer and a favordoer lost in compliant calculation marsh bailed ezzard donnell jones out of lockup twiceth street and university stations marsh was afraid of mmlf reprisal and bta whiplash marshs mindscape was all stasis and circumspection dwights brainscape was all machination he was losing weight he was boozing to suppress his nerves and notch some sleep dwight said mr hoover was reaming him for results wayne said how dwight mimicked a junkie shooting up the pantomime was spooky wayne got chills dwight said son you cannot fuck with me on this dream state he did not tell mary beth about his tithing she would consider it stealing she would critique his guilty conscience she would disapprove of his herb trips she would view his experiment theory as a fatuous riff of the times her resentment was an indictment she brought it to bed with them he brought images of joan for fire and consolation she considers his quest to find her son grandiose and selfserving she cannot comprehend the scope of his debt los angeles the dominican republic shes gone she left him with nineteen file cards and no goodbye note she left a lipstick smear on her pillow the cards listed snitchouts gleaned from the bta joan gave up six armedrobbery teams two kidnap gangs and eleven mailbombing leftists dwight attributed the work to marsh bowen it bought the timebuyer more time and wowed mr hoover the old girl ordered the federal raids herself a brief return to form followed by more slippage dwight those prehensiletailed creatures must sell heroin i fear that they will not accomplish this in my flickeringout lifetime he mollified the old girl the old girl responded with a daily telex barrage racist doggerel and hate cartoons sent through the fbi mail flow pat nixon pulls a train for archie bell and the drells slippage verging on breakdown he walked away from it he tried to find joan phone checks records checksnothing subtle probings with karenno go wayne nailed that freedom school lead it proved that joan and karen lied to him wayne redacted joans file he told dwight that a little click kept eluding him dwight knew what it was wayne stripped inked paper and got the name thomas frank narduno the man knew joan they were comrades dwight and waynes gang killed narduno at the grapevine tavern it begged the biggest questions of their lives what does she want what does she know why have we let her in dwight printdusted the eagle rock and altadena pads no prints no diary notes no guns under pillows shes gone his nerves are stripped gears he stares at the dropfront walls and lets time evaporate he takes more pills with more booze and sleeps worse commensurately he filled the joan void with karen joan gave him nineteen snitches he gave karen the quid pro quo benefit he bailed her friends out of jail in record numbers karen pulled more quaker woowoo than ever before he has dr king nightmares karen gets a monumentbombing chit the next day he keeps thinking of silver hill the doctors told him not to think he stared at the walls and thought anyway shes gone hes got more time to think and stare at walls and wait for the walls to speak back operation baaaad brother was in a soul coma the bta and mmfl brothers were losing their fire fast october the panthers ambush two la cops one cop is wounded one panther is wounded one panther is dead december the big pigpanther shootout at panther hq woundings no deaths lapd reprisalsprobably most likely implemented by scotty b marsh bowen was useless the wire was useless the talk was revolution for burrheads and dupes his new marsh vibe the fuck had an agenda the fuck was lying in wait he should have produced more or plain rabbited from the jomo thing scotty weighed on him scotty had an agenda scotty got lapd to fire marsh scotty put out the word no reprisals on marsh he snitched jomo i dont care dont fuck with him or ill fuck with you the sweatbox room the hose shots the q ampa why the grilling on that armoredcar heist suspicion it kept aging cops up nights their brain compartments seeped they saw shit that wasnt there and missed the shit that was he had phone chats with president nixon and mr hoover president nixon feared mr hoovers file stash mr hoover feared president nixons soft line on black militants and commies mr hoover was obsessed with waynes black girlfriend and feared that coonkiller wayne had gone red nixon sent dwight on a scouting trip to the dr he wanted dwights take on the midget he wanted to make sure his mob deal wouldnt boomerang dwight dipped down to santo domingo the casino build was going strong the midget gave good lunch la banda gave good oppression he called the prez and told him the dr looked kosher suspicion he called mr hoover and reported the trip mr hoover was suspiciousdwight did nixon talk about me dwight said no sir he didnt mr hoover was aghast and relieved he told a fourteenminute joke about dr king and lassie he told a sixteenminute joke about the prez and liberace suspicion he had downtime in santo domingo he hobknobbed with tiger krew and felt shit percolating his hunch they were moving smack behind waynes back he didnt tell wayne why promote chaos the dr felt creepycrawly la felt good on the rebound shes gone his birthday was last week he turned fiftythree the prez called and requested a dr backup trip karen bought him dinner at perinos he got a plain white envelope in the mail it came to the dropfront his name and address were typed on there was no return address he opened the envelope inside a little red flag on a stick extract from the privately held journal of karen sifakis los angeles my daughters are playing in the next room fouryearold dina is watching fifteenmonthold eleanora steady herself on a large rubber beach ball and teach herself to walk at some point shell become jealous of ellas rapid progress and push her to the floor ella will cry get up and keep going it will be the third or fourth time this has happened i reprimanded dina the first time she blamed dwight for her actions she had overheard dwight telling me that ella was quickly becoming the dominant little girl and dina had better log some payback while shes able i should have reprimanded dwight for the statement he said those words some months ago and its too late for reprimands now im looking back at the past years journal pages and feeling disparate events cohere dwight has been affording me greater and greater latitude in my political actions and has been bailing out my politically jailed friends at an everaccelerating pace the matchup of dates makes it all the more evident dwights remarkable generosity begins the moment he tells me that joan has disappeared of course they are lovers of course i could not tell dwight that joans vanishing acts are very well established because i have lied to him about the breadth of my friendship with joan dwight asked me about joan and the usc freedom school several months ago of course i lied about it of course dwight knew i was lying we are in far too deeply with each other to issue reprimands or otherwise revise the rules of a duplicitous usurious and compartmentalized union the odd thing i find myself approving of dwight and joan as lovers i love dwight more than i ever have because joan has served to instill doubt in him dwight is beginning to erode i pray that the process will extend and change him gently and not take him to grief and madness a very real fear attends this prayer offering i am more fully realizing that joan manipulated me into a meeting with dwight toward what end this prayer must include all other persons who inhabit their hellishly selfwilled orbit i had lunch with joan shortly before she went away she hinted at a tropical destination and told me she had left dwight some paperwork she said that she hoped it wouldnt go bad like and i did not ask joan to embellish her statement i mentioned dwight and his penance money and hinted at his personal catastrophe in joan told me that she knew the story but refused to tell me how she knew and in that moment i knew that joan loved dwight sans all political agendas i cried a little joan hugged me and gave me a beautiful emerald extract from the journal of marshall e bowen los angeles fear time its fear time now and its been fear time for a while ive been fearful for so long that its become almost banal im now hyperalert to the signs of panic expressed by my body months of general fear have made me more sensitive to acute and justified fear ive been surviving and buying advantage moment to moment an anonymous informant bought me time with mr hoover and mr holly a nineteensnitch package graciously attributed to me it bought mr holly time with mr hoover im sure of that it validates which buys me more time to pursue armoredcar heist leads the mmlf has lost interest in me over time mmlf members see me at the clubs alone or with my bta brothers they avert their eyes spit on the floor or make obscene gestures there are shoving matches as both groups coopt space at peace marches im apprehensive more than fearful in those contexts i monitor my body for signs of panic and realize that ive been granted time time liberates me and constrains me a friend on lapd told me that lapd had secretly terminated my employment mr holly and wayne obviously knew this and never told me this makes me a federal operative with no police sanction and no assured position within law enforcement once my assignment concludes last week i found bug wires in my apartment i did the prudent thing i let them sit it had to have been instigated by wayne and mr holly they do not trust me their distrust is fully justified i have been very careful in whom i talk to in my home and what i talk about in person and on the telephone the discovery of the bugtap apparatus vouched my justified paranoia and confirmed me in my role of apostatized excop black militant i assumed that role the moment i rented this apartment and have embellished it with greater and greater flair every moment since men with the bent have to be cautious i behave as if i do not have the bent and have done so since wayne made his faggot remark in my heart i feel like a radicalized excop weighing his options in all arenas my actors sense of time and identity has proven invaluable here wayne and i have smoked dope a few times we discussed the oddly different and oddly similar metaphysical states of our lives it was in many ways the most beguiling interchange of my life time has been bestowed on me i am probably ghettosafe because scotty bennett wants me ghettosafe the revised ghetto word is that i may be a police informant this is scottys protracted vengeance on me im sure the worrisome thing is that i see no vindictive punch line or conclusion in sight scotty greatly enhanced his ghettolegend status late last year in the process he dealt a severe blow to black nationalism in los angeles and bought me more time on the scoreheroin front there were pantherpig dustups in october and december both incidents received wide publicity a full dozen panthers have now disappeared six per incident scotty fulfilled his promise of august reprisal deterrent vengeance enacted and time purchased for me the upshot more bta bewilderment fear and indecisiveness the growing notion that smack is heat we dont need ive got the sense that mmlp is reacting similarly and nuggets of gold in with the dirt more and more rankandfile brothers think that dealing smack is wrong with gifts of time handed me i stepped up my queries on the heist i must have said say man you remember that armoredcar job back in a million times and received a million dumbstruck looks and bullshit answers i have mentioned reginald hazzard and described his tenuous resemblance to the burnedface robber an equal number of times with the same results then two things clicked independently i was engaged in a routine phonedrop talk with mr holly he casually mentioned scottys brutal grilling of jomo clarkson scotty asked jomo a string of pointedly non sequitur questions pertaining to the heist mr holly found this confusing it sat with me for weeks aaah scottywhat do you know and what arent you telling us shortly after that i bailed ezzard jones out of jail twice the first time was a drunkdriving beef i pulled ezz out of th street station and took him out drinking from there a week later ezz was popped for drunkanddisorderly i filled out paperwork in the university station squadroom was left alone briefly and took advantage of it i checked the unsolved file cabinet and found a routing sheet for the heist i memorized the divisional record number called lapd r ampi and impersonated a cop the clerk consulted the master file and came back on the line she said im sorry officer no such dr number exists and i knew then scotty had a private file stash he was pulling filed reports in from throughout the lapds geographical divisions and was hoarding the information for himself i am certain of it there can be no other explanation jarabacoa heavy rain stalled out work the thirteenthfloor framing dragged all four sites dipped behind schedule a few slaves escaped la banda reacted they combed the crews and drew torture lots hateins lashings and slaves screaming in the rain crutch watched the latest a monsoon just passed over the ground was ankledeep mud the site was packed with sodden lumber and equipment it was all miasma and muck the la banda guy used a tassel whip little bulbs supplied extra pain crutch bopped behind voodoo herbs it focused him and zoned the ugly shit out the slave was strapped to a bulldozer his shrieks boomeranged the lashtolash echoes overlapped the whip man was good the tassels cut down to the rib bone the slave crew watched crutch shut his eyes the slave collapsed a la banda guy bugsprayed his wounds for added hurt and disinfection the slave ate mud it muffled his screams a horn honked crutch looked over froggy had a new cadiblack it was de rigueur striped froggy called it tiger kar the cubans were crammed in with tommy guns canestel pointed northtiger kove now crutch got queasy tiger kar ran rough roads on soft suspension he was squished between morales and saldivar his brainpan popped he kept checking the rearview mirrors hed had this surveillance vibe he couldnt validate it hell hound on my trail they hit tiger kove at dusk tiger klaw was gassed to go the storm had passed over residual chop pushed them east the north shore and the mona passageone big whitecap they made point higuero early they smoked weed to kill time the puerto rican spies trusted them now froggy called them their tiger kompaсeros crutch heard onshore movement the spies popped out of the brush they lobbed the dope suitcase on board gomezsloan lobbed the cash suitcase at them it was kwick and kompanionable the krew unmoored the klaw and sailed away kovebound whitecaps bucked them crutch launched a torpedo for kicks it hit a shitflecked atoll and exploded they moored and draped tiger klaw with camouflage netting they took tiger kar back to santo domingo crutch dozed off his dope jolt mosquitoes buzzed into his mouth and woke him up periodic it was dawn the krew decamped at the el embajador froggy told crutch to hold the suitcase the tonton guys would shag it to portauprince tomorrow crutch yawned and elevatored up to his suite he opened the door he recaught the vibe he smelled cigarette smoke he saw a tip glowing the light snapped on theres dwight holly on the couch theres some shit on the coffee table a paint can and a paintbrush a syringe and a morphine syrette crutch shut the door and dropped the suitcase dwight pulled out a pocketknife how much are you holding three pounds thatll do his mouth dried up his bladder swelled the walls loopdelooped dwight said take your shirt off man you cant im not saying it again youre taking your shirt off im taking the suitcase i wont stop you from running out the door ill call wayne and rat out your dope business the moment you do crutch pulled his shirt off his sphincter almost blew dwight opened the paint can and dipped in the brush the paint was bright red he walked the walls and pulled off the artwork he painted above the couch he redipped his brush he painted above the wet bar he redipped his brush he painted death to yanqui dope peddlers beside the door crutch prayed and tried not to cry dwight popped the syrette and plungered the syringe crutch held his arm out dwight clamped his biceps and brought up a vein crutch squeezed his saint chris medal it snapped off his neck dwight poked the vein and geezed him up he went looseygoosey his bladder blew he didnt care his eyes rolled back dwight flicked his lighter and warmed up his knife crutch braced his hands on the door dwight carved on his back las vegas wayne linked boxes his wall graph was op art boxes and arrows off at odd angles boxes and arrows reginald to joan to the haitian herb man graph boxes and boxed carbonslapd and the la county sheriffs his lvpd contact secured them call it a dim long shot occurrence reports fieldinterrogation cards the la cops hardrousted black kids

i dont want you to find my son he doesnt want to be found if hes alive he made that decision of his own free will and i will not dishonor him by forcing a reunion wayne jammed his hands in his pockets voodooherb residue made his eyes run mary beth stepped close whatever youve done in the past ill forgive you whatever youre doing now ill forgive you ill forgive you for not trusting me because you dont want to be forgiven you just want to create more risk and intrigue and buy yourself more punishment wayne lefthooked the wall he dented the molding his knuckles bled his wristwatch face shattered mary beth said who have you hurt what have you done he walked to the safe house santo domingo looked different the visit was adlibbed he didnt call ivar smith or the boys he just wanted to see it felt

tore up and out they screamed and went spastic on fire the ammo on their belts blew up pieces of them exploded extract from the journal of marshall e bowen los angeles blackmilitant summit savor the concept i was to be the facilitating agent leander james jackson would represent the bta and joseph tidwell mccarver and claude cantrell torrance would negotiate on the mmfls behalf this august event was couched as an afternoon barbq at joe mccarvers crib there would be ribs chicken greens booze reefer and sweetpotato pie joes backyard would be festively decorated his fouryearold daughter and sixyearold son would provide diversion and perhaps serve to squelch overuse of the word motherfucker i had possession of the dope i would be in charge of negotiating the btammlf percentage cut and the ultimate splitting of profits most importantly this was where i would shift my allegiance from mr holly to scotty the plan resulted from bowenbennett summitry at tommy tuckers playroom we determined that immediate action would be required the dope split would be accomplished the bta and mmlf fools would leave the pad holding big poundage scotty would swoop down for the bust it meant betraying my fbiinfiltrator status prematurely thus shafting mr holly and mr hoover with hopes of getting back on lapd in a flash if the plan meshed both the bta and mmlf would be fully discredited the feds would get their indictments and i would be reinstated to lapd mr hoover and mr holly would be furious i had unilaterally terminated the operation with scottys assistance resentment would simmer and then dissipate scotty and i would then be free to pool our information on the heist we would form a powerful twoman team to go after the money and emeralds would be considered a success this wild swath of my young life with all its attendant mindscapes would assume an entirely new dimension i asked scotty how he knew of my fixation with the heist enough so to brace me on it scotty told me he had picked up tips that i had been making subtle queries going back months on instinct he did a background check on me bingo my th and budlong address showed up on an old drivers license joe mccarver owned a small stucco house off th and slauson the day was warm the backyard was comfortably strewn with lounge chairs the kids splashed around in a wading pool scotty was parked in an unmarked unit two blocks away he had a twoway radio with dialin capacity all i needed was four seconds with joes bedroom phone this be good like a motherfuuuuucker claude torrance said as we sat down the dope sat in the middle of a long picnic table as if it were an altarpiece intergroup tension needed to be brooked before we began the negotiation so rum and spikelaced grass was served i partook sparingly the other three men consumed a full bottle of the rum and smoked several reefers joe attacked the food i prepared the opening remarks of my mediation then claude started fucking with my head brother an i calls you brother with a big muthafuckin grain of salt let me ask you brother whyd you rat out brother jomo kenyatta clarkson to the muthafuckin pigs last year i said something neutral i did my conciliatory hey brother be cool thing leander stepped in im sure he considered my response sissified he said listen to me baby boy i put a knife in jomo and saw him bleed weak blood he was anemic from weak thoughts and a strong appetite for evil i put a hex on his nigger soul and he die the next day i have connections to bizangosect bokurs and the ghost of baron samedi they make jomo off himself they send legions of red ants up the hole in his dick to eat out his eyes and his brain that is the pure truth baby boy i held my breath joe put down a chicken wing and cracked his knuckles claude said baron samedi sucked my big black dick and spit on leanders shoes then leander pulled a gun joe pulled a gun claude pulled a gun there was the briefest of pauses where they might have stepped back a strong wind whipped through the backyard a bottle toppled the noise rang loud that did it all three men had fatclip automatics they all fired at once as i ducked under the table it was very close range the noise was horrible leander shot and killed claude joe shot and killed leander leander shot and killed joe as he was going down the three men were on the ground by the table they were technically dead but still twitching they kept firing and sending shots out the children screamed and tried to run stray shots and ricochets hit them i saw the little girls brains blow back into the wading pool i curled up covered my head and waited for more shots or deaththroe noise there was none i looked around and saw the three dead men and two dead children it was over in less than ten seconds i had an epiphany it was instantaneously realized mindscaping i immediately prepared a tableau for my heroic trialbyfire redemption the house and backyard were flanked by vacant lots on three sides which gave me both privacy and time to work calmly i pulled my gun and shot the dead claude cantrell torrance in the head just as calmly i shot the late joseph tidwell mccarver and leander james jackson finishing up i took the three guns out of their hands and fired off random shots i smudged the grips then calmly placed the guns back in their hands surethey fired on each other but i assumed control and took them all out too bad about the kids i tried to sweep them to safety but ricochets caught them first i walked through the yard and stretched the bodies out in convincing crossfire positions i wiped up the drag marks with paper towels and checked out the scene i ran into the house and stiffed a fauxpanicked call to scotty his siren kicked on instantly i heard it from two blocks away i walked slowly back to the yard los angeles herald express article blackmilitant blastout two days ago a backyard barbecue in south los angeles erupted into violence and three men and two children lay dead initial news reports attributed the killings to a highstakes narcotics deal gone bad it now appears to be much more than that the three adult victimsleander james jackson age joseph tidwell mccarver age and claude cantrell torrance age were rabid blackmilitant activists lapd sergeant robert s bennett told reporters at a press conference the two murdered childrentheodore and darleen mccarver ages six and four were mccarvers two offspring with his commonlaw wife sergeant bennett went on to reveal that there was a sixth person in joe mccarvers backyard former lapd officer marshall e bowen you may recall officer bowen from an encounter he had with me on october sergeant bennett said officer bowens actions resulted in his being fired from lapd in reality the encounter and the subsequent firing were just a ruse to allow officer bowen to convincingly infiltrate the black tribe alliance and maumau liberation front two deadly blacknationalist groups intent on selling heroin to finance their subversive activities officer bowen assumed the microphone jackson mccarver and torrance had extensive criminal records and communist ties he said i had been gathering evidence against them since my fake firing from lapd a year and a half ago the purpose of the barbecue was a dope summit meeting and the culmination of my work as an fbi infiltrator regrettably a verbal argument escalated into a gunfight i ran in and attempted to lead the two children to safety but stray bullets got to them first at that point i entered into gunfire with jackson mccarver and torrance as they were firing at one another fbi director j edgar hoover praised officer bowens brilliant work in throwing a monkey wrench into the activities of two communistaligned organizations newly

article odd rumors from dominican republic the dominican republic has been comparatively peaceful since the civil war a brief military engagement that ended nearly five years ago the us marines satisfied at the quashing of potential communist revolt on the island had left an interim leftist dictator had been deposed and centristreformer joaquin balaguer has been in power since but for the past several weeks dire rumors have resounded from within the dr as it is popularly known none of the rumors have been factually substantiated but they have been persistently similar leading some american journalists to wonder if the events are connected there has been a rash of demonstrations by leftwing groups in santo domingo most particularly the castroite movement government sources have said that this is not unusual free speech is encouraged within the dr and thus the demonstrations are in no way anomalous the sites of four hotelcasino buildings financed by us interests were rumored to have been sabotaged two weeks ago which government sources also denied add on the murder of an american man by members of an antidominican voodoo sect and the discovery of the charred bodies of one french man with radical rightwing ties and four cuban exiles allegedly backed by wealthy americans in the miamibased exile community and you have the stuff of great conspiracy talk cia station chief terence brundage told correspondents its just that talk and nothing else youve got a bunch of unrelated rumors and no more this assessment was seconded by a spokesman for president balaguer all poppycock he said the casino sites were not sabotaged structural flaws brought them down and we are back in discussion with our american investment group which is anxious to start rebuilding soon

a ladder rung i havent seen you since the hiltz case and the startup of baaaad brother well two times lucky and two times unexposed yeah but at some goddamn price dwight shook his head id rather not talk about it i dont blame you the old girl thirdrate militants and scotty bennett in one go id have called in a rest break before you did can it jack its old news now jack coughed well shit you know the drill you monitor the general dirt files and supplant them with informant pieces youve got cops criminals who want favors newsmen bug men waiters doormen wheelmen repo men hotel clerks barflies and the aggrieved great unwashed of the universe try to underpay for your dirt the old girl wants the shit but she wants it at bargainbasement prices dwight sneezed the file room was overcooled dry

before you know it the dukes upgraded to the penthouse too bad its hotwired the dukes a crossdresser by the way he wears a sizefiftysix extralong muumuu dwight laughed anything else i should know half the fruit bathhouses in la are wired the old girl caught a city councilman at a joint on la cienega once so shes running nine listening posts fulltime dwight plucked a file and skimmed it johnnie ray sucks dick in ferndell park the suckee is an fbi informant lana turner dives dark sisters circa a snitch calls from sultan sams sandbox jack said hows the old girls health i saw her in dc last month she looked positively spectral i had an informant once named jean the mean queen she had to be the old girls longlost sister liberaces allboy cathouse scopophile danny thomas nympho peggy lee

joan at the statler later the fallback was a plotters den living room kitchen bathroom mattress for naps he pulled a chair out to the terrace he pointed his bausch amp lombs south karen walked across her yard dina and ella chased cats karen looked haggard his offer stunned her she knows its an adjunct op she knows the main op is big he cant tell her the gist were going to kill mr hoover and frame marsh bowen for it theyll manipulate a convergence marsh will be preindicted by forged document trails they will lead back to the year zero and extend beyond theyll recruit a pro shooter bob relyea shot mlk he should shoot again the assassin is a homosexual black policeman he kills the eras prime symbol of white authority and ends his own life immediately planted paperwork reveals public policy gone bad marsh bowen has been consumed by a politically incubated madness the fbi suborns him and sends him undercover he undergoes a radical transformation he concurrently attempts to exploit his situation hes beset by sexual demons that induce a harrowing shame the blackmilitant blastout leaves two children dead marsh bowen resumes his police career with honors derived from innocence slaughtered mr hoover created the overall context special agent dwight c holly implemented it they will create a marsh bowen diary it will detail a brilliant black mans rising tide of conversation and psychic disjuncture entries will describe his odd friendship with special agent holly agent holly unburdened himself to marsh bowen he laid out the fbis war on the civil rights movement and described mr hoovers rabid racial animus the king hit plot would not be mentioned it would eclipse the shock of mr hoovers death and spawn apocalypse the fictional hollybowen friendship would be deeply etched it would encompass a world of guilt and hope the diary would form a syllabus it would bring readers to a copious glut of preexistent fbi paper the paper would form a narrative of banal minutae that would attenuate into horror grand juries would indict marsh postmortem conspiracy talk would engulf the body politic every real and concocted trail would lead back to mr hoover and his legacy of hate mr hoover was partially discredited now his antiking salvos had become public fare they were negligible compared to this they lacked hardcore shock value this would be a huge event it would spawn waves of disbelief and tragically resigned acceptance he would be the trigger man he would sit in committee rooms and grandjury chambers he would stand on the us senate floor he would describe his exploitation of marsh bowen he would detail his own lifetime of racial rancor minutely outline his blackmilitant faux pas and chart the human cost he would reveal his friendship with marsh and paint a vivid picture of a white man and a black man as mirrortwinned souls in duress he would embrace marsh with forgiveness and the distanced love you feel for those you refract he would tell the story of his crackup he would resign himself to an invasively scrutinized life karens house was a stones throw dwight trained his binoculars ella threw building blocks at dina big sister laughed and ran he told joan the plan they were in bed they rented a guest house near silver hill she trembled the way he trembled routinely he struck the awe in her that she had always struck in him hed go to prison four to six felt right protective custody tennis courts fedinformant perks there might be some animals he could care for joan said take these theyll help you sleep two brown herb capsules they didnt put him out they put him in between joan guided him places she put her hands on his chest and made him breathe in sync she started out in french and spanish he caught most of it caphaпtien cotui pico duarte puerto plata saintraphaлl el guyabo breathe through im here youre safe now ill tell you what we did with waynes gifts it was the statler he knew that they had bureauvouchered digs joan covered his eyes and told him to go where she said every dime went to the struggle we refurbished four safe houses and bought blackmarket medicine celia painted the walls balaguer planned to turn tiger klaw into a pleasure yacht four comrades dynamited the hull in dry dock we airlifted food and medicinal herbs to the slums outside dajabуn a small sect there has canonized wayne tedrow they wear newspaper photos of him attached to pointed hats a dream myth exists about wayne now people believe that winged men murdered and martyred him be still now i know you see it i know you loved him we honor the dead through imagery belief works that way celia ran an arms funnel we purchased weapons in cuba and shipped them to portauprince i bought inmates out of la victoria prison and got them forged id cards and guns money went to converts in la banda they left jail doors open and shredded documents a young man whom wayne rescued from harm repaid his debt in full he killed six la banda torturers at a whorehouse in borojol celia blew up the torture chamber under el prйsidentes golf course we lost some of ours random reprisals were inevitable and cost us dearly el jefe muzzled published and broadcast accounts of our actions word spread through printed leaflets and secretband radio many of the slaves wayne freed have joined us some of them wear his picture around their necks there have been skirmishes on the north dr coastline a demolition team blew up tiger kove many voodoo sects hold the building sites to be sacred ground many people refuse to walk across them we shotgunned two tonton macoute leaders and three vicious bokurs on a golf course near villebonheur celia is lost somewhere in the dr or haiti she has been unreachable for months i cannot find her and cannot conscionably continue my search with our work still to do if you have seen some of this or all of this and my pictures have guided you you should now try to sleep the statler supplied guest robes one size fits all his fit too small joans engulfed her she was up first room service had come and gone dwight poured coffee joan examined paper stock the roomservice cart was a workbench the couch was a study perch how do we age the documents two runs in a convection oven you chemically treat the paper and cook it you add the ink or type the text on later how do we differentiate the printing and cursive styles we cut stencils and print or write longhand within the boundaries joan lit a cigarette her eyes were redlate nights and heavy smoking the diary is the big thing its our basic text so it has to be found dwight sat on the couch we have to be sure that he doesnt already have a diary weve got to locate it so that we can snatch it and replace it right before the convergence typed right we dont want to handforge a document of that length dwight sipped coffee right if he has a typewriter well purchase an identical one and go from there ill get a typeface sample on my first b ampe joan took his hands scotty bennett hes tight with marsh now dwight shrugged scottys a wild card hes a decorated cop on the one hand a brutal fuck on the other the important thing is that he densifies the overall text hes killed eighteen armed robbers and at least a dozen panthers and it will either come out or be stonewalled to the extent that it looks very goddamn bad for lapd joan smiled how were your dreams dwight smiled vivid while you were talking a little raw after that joan pointed to a matchbook pile fruit joints all the tradesman the jaguar the falcons lair marsh cruises hollywood marsh keeps amylnitrate poppers in a hideyhole he might have a lover who would contradict our profile dwight shook his head hes a loner hes discreet hes especially circumspect now that hes celebrated hes on the cover of ebony magazine this month joan stubbed out her cigarette who shoots a klansman ive dealt with before competent yes the hard part will be putting them together dwight sipped coffee it killed a headache tapping in marsh has to be secluded it wont work unless he fires from a distance the shooter can fire kill marsh and plant the throwdown its all about manipulating a proper convergence and rigging a workable line of sight joan nodded its all pretext its giving marsh a reason to be there dwight said yes and la would be the best location one marsh is here two lapd would be working the case fulltilt as it tries to bury anything that might embarrass them jack leahy would roll out for the bureau and jacks a mordant piece of work with a weird take on mr hoover joan rubbed his temples she kneaded a bulging vein flat its going to take months its all about creating the levels of subtext we have to layer in misinformation at the start incoherence will inspire a more rigorous scrutiny and a greater degree of paranoia and a more desperate mass desire to make it all fit joan said that precipitating event have you thought about it dwight cracked his knuckles ive gone ahead the bureau has a records center in media pennsylvania theres surveillance files stored there its an easy blackbagger joan smiled a publicized b ampe yes a preannouncement hopefully it creates a public expression of outrage and becomes a primer on file work that will serve to make our event that much more accessible the more people go to the files the more theyll see and wont see they wont really know what theyre looking for so theyll study harder and the process will fracture and attenuate dwight stretched his neck hurt hed slept curled into joan karen dwight said yes shes taking the team in joan pulled her hair back well shes very good yes you cannot tell her what were doing i know that theres two sets of ethics at work here i know joan lit a cigarette dwight studied her face more stress lines more gray hair than dark now who redacted your file im not telling you tell me how things have gone wrong for you tell me how you got through it and how you got it up for all this im not telling you dwight cracked his thumbs you knew tommy narduno he was killed at the grapevine tavern joan stared at him yes he was im sure that you and your colleagues killed him just as he was sure that you ran the king operation dwight stared back tell me how he knew he saw you in memphis two days before he knew what you were to mr hoover he saw you distributing envelopes to some memphis cops dwight blinked smittys barbq a cop spits tobacco juice a cop fans cnotes a cop wolfs burnt ends what else karen said you were in bad shape that whole spring the freedom school you and karen go back joan leaned into him he was sweating his robe was full wet karen and i go back further than you know and you manipulated her in order to meet me yes why because i just knew thats not an answer because i sensed a shared agenda because i thought you might help me kill mr hoover dwight stared at her she touched his leg wayne smiled from somewhere look ma no fear joan said we came up with the same idea independently ive wanted to kill him since i was a child and i wont tell you why extract from the privately held journal of karen sifakis los angeles december of course im going to do it ill entrust the job to my closest and most prudent comrades no one will be hurt in the performance of the act dwight has gotten me a schematic drawing of the records center and has convinced me that the building will be unguarded the alarm system is outmoded and the building itself is fairly secluded bill k saul m and anna bw have agreed to take part dwight calls it a feat of explication in and of itself of course hes being disingenuous of course he knows that an opportunity to fully expose the fbis illegal surveillance practices is too great for me to resist hes set the date of march the muhammad alijoe frazier boxing match takes place that night dwight thinks the local cops will be popping into taverns to listen to it on the radio and watch it on bootleg tv so their powers of concentration and will to proactively seek out unusual occurrences will be diverted my comrades are committedly nonviolent i cannot say that wholeheartedly about dwight he suffered a nervous collapse in the wake of the blackmilitant madness and feels complicit i see it in his evermoretender regard for my children should i reveal a certain secret there two children died in the course of that drug deal that particular shock seems to drive him i see him doing what i do i compartmentalize my children and work assiduously to assure their safety as i comport myself with considerable recklessness in the world i exemplify hubris in a manner that dwight does not his recklessness is traumatically defined while mine is cloaked in spiritual trappings and may even be considered a puerile lifestyle choice ella is almost two now she carries the stuffed animals that dwight bought her everywhere she goes like dina she now knows that she has two parttime fathers and has hit the jackpot in the delighted dad department when theyre older theyll ask me to explain it ill say it was a wild time and feel like a fool this is my first journal entry since last march in it i described my lunch with joan and her gift of the beautiful emerald ive been more and more frequently recalling our conversation of that day joan spoke of dreams as an interconnected state of consciousness a virus that passes between likeminded people who cannot concede their likemindedness for fear of the forfeiture of self it made sense to me although the mystical aspects seemed very unjoan many strange and strangely surreal things make sense these days because its a wild time in that regard both joan and i are dwights dream guides i attempt to bring him the dream of peace and i am jealous that joan may have brought him the dream of a fiery conversion of thought and thought to dwight always results in action my husband left town four days ago dwight has been coming over on alternating nights im sure hes sleeping with joan on the nights were not together and hes calling up to talk politics at least once a day he tries to sound utilitarian but idealistic perceptions keep creeping in ive been noticing binocular glint at all hours coming from a high summit on baxter street i backtailed it to a small bungalow and snuck in i recognized the clothing in the closet it was dwights and joans of course i noticed documentforging tools on a table and boxes full of chemicals and paper i pray that my dreams of peace may intersect with their dreams and keep them from creating more harm extract from the journal of marshall e bowen los angeles december i rousted a black street fool for vagrancy last week he had misdemeanor warrants in the system and possessed no visible means of support i was about to arrest him when he screwed his face up in recognition he smiled and stated quite flatly you the man he was right i am the man i am a highly decorated ranking officer on lapd i am according to ebony magazine an icon of the new black masculinity and oddson for chief of police one day political office should not be ruled out nor should a career in television journalism i am a magazine cover boy ebony and jet with sepia soon to follow i am permitted to be magnanimous given the new bounty of my life so i told that street fool youre right brother i am the man and cut him loose im working the hollywood division detective bureau i drive a nightwatch kcar and coordinate felonylevel investigations at their inception i get awed looks and resentful looks from criminals of all stripes and awed and resentful looks from my brother officers im twentysix years old with three years on lapd im a sergeant working a prestigious detectivedivision assignment im the heroic black man who went undercover and broke the backs of two vicious dopedealing blackmilitant groups who were really antiblack at their core i am no longer a downscale brother slumming for cosmetic effect ive moved from a dingy crib in watts to a nice house in baldwin hills allow me to say it again i am most assuredly the man i cashed in on the blackmilitant zeitgeist the biggest and the best the blacknationalist movement is in disarray its a nationwide cavalcade of indictments trials convictions and sundry legal hassles the result of years of police infiltration and intergroup squabbles eldridge cleaver is hiding in algeria the panthers and us have exploded behind petty turf wars general ineptitude and native fractiousness the bta and mmlf are kaput my testimony put my dopesmoking boozeguzzling whorechasing comrades in

holly we havent spoken since that last time before the blastout he knows the sanitized version of events that day and that ive profited from them he doesnt want to see me nor do i want to see him mr holly reminds me of the football coach i had a crush on at dorsey high i feared him and craved his respect and affection i entered an arc of selfrecognition and outgrew him over time mr holly adieu

sweet marsh was twentysix he had a year to live tops room service brought new york steaks and a toofat bordeaux he was drinking less joan was drinking more their sleep stints had reversed they ate in their robes fat rain drummed the windows they burned a synthetic log in the fireplace joan said i dont like the breakin its precipitous youre worried about the convergence yes i am its the one thing we cant force they have to be voluntarily in the same place at the same time dwight slouched in his chair the same city with the perch preestablished it should be in la hes stayed at the beverly wilshire the last six times hes been here he always requests a suite with a northwindow view youve got seven two and threestory buildings directly across the street two have officerental signs up the other buildings are boutiques and restaurants they have second and thirdfloor storage rooms facing the hotel joan lit a cigarette keep going tell me what youre thinking im thinking we should find a black kid about marshs age a close resemblance is crucial he should rent an office and we should decorate it its where he goes to fuck boys use drugs and hoard guns ill steal semen tubes from a hospital well lay in the fluids gradually marsh is cracking up his drug use is escalating ill have the shooter skinpop him full of coke on his way out ill show him how to boot toxins into his liver to approximate longterm drug abuse joan blew a smoke ring you are so astonishingly gifted comrade dwight took her hands youre worried about celia i dont want to talk about it shes always understood the risks i could make a few phone calls i dont want you to dwight smiled when i connected you to tommy narduno i thought you were coming after me joan smiled i considered it tommy thought he could reveal the grapevine aspect of your operation and create a media ruckus he was always naive that way he was a muckraking journalist at heart he was wearing a wire on the night you killed him dwight trembled joan pointed to the wine dwight shook his head what convinced you to pass on it karen convinced me she implied that you were ready she quoted goethe at one point the phrase she used was the fall upward dwight opened a window hailstones brushed his face jomo and the thing with marsh what was your reasoning a gust shook the panes joan turned her chair and let the wet hit her there were your ends and my ends they were both synchronous and inimical i knew that marsh had to be your plant your pathology showed itself in your choice it was bold grandiose and selfdestructive i spent time with marsh and found him to be weak and almost fawningly selfserving he cruised men when he thought i wasnt looking which was true actors faux pas dramatically unsound and narcissistic so i called scotty bennett and revealed his inclination so i called scotty again and mediated marshs betrayal of jomo clarkson it was a twofold strategy i wanted to put marsh in jeopardy and force him into allegiance with the bta i considered jomo to be evil and i was fairly sure that scotty wouldnt be able to resist killing him wind tossed the tablecloth and dumped the bordeaux dwight pulled joan out of her chair puckett mississippi six trailer parks and nine klan kampgrounds bob relyea ran the exalted knights klavern he pandered to the local cops and snitched to atf he sold magic mushrooms and hate tracts he robbed gas stations bob was extiger krew he pushed heroin in saigon and worked with wayne tedrow he shot martin luther king it was kool and klear the kampground konsisted of a korrugated bunkhouse and a k kennel four fucks stood around the shooting range the targets were departmentstore dummies they wore eldridge cleaver masks bob saw the car pull up dwight braked and stopped short of the kampground bob jogged the rest of the way dwight popped the passenger door and the glove box a cnote roll rolled out bob caught it and tucked it under his sheet and thats just for talking thats right dont tell me if i shoot somebody theres lots more where that came from dwight said thats right bob said wooo boy dwight lit a cigarette you get fifty thousand you take out the target and the fall guy right there its two easy shots that part doesnt worry me at all its bringing the two together ill abduct the fall guy and position him if i have to but id rather not bob picked his nose the target guys a big deal dwight winked bob said talks gonna bubble i want it to theres a subtext here whos the target dwight laughed youll know him when you see him extract from the privately held journal of karen sifakis los angeles february im going through with it whatever it abuts facilitates or foreshadows on joans and dwlghts end i am taking the risk of implementing violence i feel loyal to joan and am grateful to her for the change she has created in dwight we have traveled a long road together it would not be bragging for me to assert that my pacifism has mitigated joans violent actions over the years it is surely true that her brash being has sporadically brought me closer to god and nonviolent confrontation she is of me and i am of her and dwight is of both of us there is deep alchemy in where we connect and where we diverge i continue to trust in our dialogue as much as i fear potential outcomes my horrible fight with dwight has forced me to admit the arrogance and speciousness at the core of my moral logic the fire of his conversion has convinced me of the necessity of this risk dwight now knows the length and breadth of my relationship with joan if not the specific details joan has laid hints or has revealed the friendship in looks and asides that the brilliant and brilliantly paranoic dwight has seized upon and brought to mental certainty i have lied to dwight by omission i am now certain that joan used me in order to get to him now dwight and joan lie to me by withholding the details of their operation i am fully culpable for the creation of the dwightjoan bond i should have told dwight that joan has deployed fake identities and that they have cloaked much of her subversion i should have told dwight that joan had planned a series of armed robberies back east i should have told him that we were in algeria together and that i held a prayer vigil for the french paratroopers that joan and her comrades ambushed outside bйchar i should have told him that i was part of the invasion in a nonviolent planning role i did not tell him these things because i ghoulishly desired the conflagration of them because i wanted to unleash them to fulfill some buried rage in me to inflict them on the circumspect ideologically compromised radically chic and eversocareful world i live in with the unique fury i knew they would evolve now i must live out my creators role in this play my supporting part damn the vicissitudes of radical lifestyle as i pray for peace i will break and enter steal files explicate the filehoarding practices of an oppressive bureaucracy and hope that a muchanticipated boxing match between two gifted black fighters does not push my actions to backpage status irony dwight has called the breakin a media event the records center is in media pennsylvania the fight with dwight took place here in my home dina and ella heard the flareup and stormingout conclusion it was an altercation i spawned from my own hubris i overestimated my influence on dwight and belittled joans influence i was shrill petty jealous and philosophically unsound dwight came at me with a converts and converted lovers fury you blow up things you destroy symbols you attack sympathetic portrayals of institutions forty fucking times removed he said to me it allows you to feel smug while people suffer and die youll continue to do it until a chunk of exploding plaster from a confederate monument puts out a black kids eye then youll come back here and mope and pray and figure out something spectacular and quakercorrect to do to put yourself back in the game you so dearly love which is violent by its own basic nature and he was right and then he said and do not ever patronize joan rosen klein because you gave her to me and he was right and so i will go forth with the task that he and joan have assigned extract from the journal of marshall e bowen en route to boston i have been traveling and tracking potential leads since my last meeting with scotty my accumulated workleave time has served as a cover i have allegedly been on a crosscountry auto trip i have now laboriously handchecked the passport acceptance files and reject files in new orleans st petersburg and milwaukee with lynn massachusetts upcoming these are the cities that scotty has deemed to be the most lax permissive and incompetent in their passportissuing practices i have indulged the bent in those cities and have reveled in the freedom of cavorting in nonlocalceleb locales reginald hazzard was not issued a passport in those cities and was not to be found in the reject files his photographwith and without medically addressed burn scars was not attached to any of the thousands of application cards i have scanned so ive been traveling and enjoying my time outside of la ive been calling scotty every few days to report no luck ive been mindscaping having very vivid dreams and pondering scottys cherchez la femme remark a great deal it was a woman who ratted me out to scotty dwight holly reacted strangely when scotty mentioned that fact to him im becoming convinced that the woman is joan rosen klein joan cultivated me in late and early i was dwight hollys infiltrator and i knew that mr holly had an informant in play joan was very worldly and seemed overqualified for the lowrent blackmilitant world she was very persistent in her approach of me she may have been trying to seduce me but her finely tuned predators sense told her shed have no luck there it all felt mindscapingly right to me up until the moment i ran into junior jefferson shortly before i left on this trip junior was gobbling chicken and waffles at tommy tuckers playroom and was grousing about the fate of tiger kab first the boys buy black cat cab away from him and rename it after that faggoty animal then the late wayne tedrow embezzled all the tiger kab cash and the boys sold the biz to freddy otash so freddy fires him and s him from the premises now tiger kab is the swingingest place on planet earth theyre showing the alifrazier fight on closedcircuit tvand he cant come we continued to commiserate we talked up the blastout with a certain wonderment junior said you was a fuckin fbi pigsnitch the whole time i admitted that was true junior said he was cool with it and very casually mentioned that he saw dwight holly and that joan jewcommie babe holding hands at a chink joint on pico last week cherchez la femme lynn is a dingy shoefactory town amid scores of dingy towns of the same size and i found the customs office to be dingy as i walked in a florid

from southside robberymurder complex portrait of victim emerges from investigation lionel d thornton the president of the peoples bank of south los angeles died a horrible death monday night returning from a viewing of the alifrazier boxing match at a popular local taxicab stand he was waylaid outside the bank and forced inside he was subsequently robbed of his cabstand receipts tortured and killed preliminary investigation by the los angeles police department has revealed that the robberkiller or killers went through the bank in a fit of rage perhaps looking for a hidden vault or perhaps currency secreted by mr thornton on the premises sadly the crime may have derived from neversubstantiated rumors pertaining to mr thornton himself ive got nothing but good things to say about mr thornton the lead investigator sergeant robert s bennett told reporters at a hastily called press conference tuesday afternoon hes been a mainstay of the local black community for many years as one can feel in the outpouring of grief over his death and in the number of glowing tributes we have heard since the news broke this morning sergeant bennett is overseeing six fulltime detectives charged with solving the case and bringing the suspect or suspects to justice i personally believe mr thornton to have been a blameless individual he told reporters that stated i believe that this crime stems from the longheld southside rumor that perhaps mr thornton had organizedcrime ties and was hoarding laundered money on the banks premises i do not believe the rumors i believe that the crime stemmed from persistently held misinformation the tragedy is that mr thornton gave his life for in cab receipts and that the suspect or suspects killed him and decimated the bank interior in a search for something that was not there the investigation continues sergeant bennett and his sixman team will spearhead the drive to apprehend the slayer or slayers of lionel d thornton a backup investigation will be fielded by the los angeles office of the federal bureau of investigation supervised by specialagentincharge john c leahy verbatim fbi telephone call transcript marked speaking director hoover

less curious the operation was theirs its brutal scope was their bond the media breakin worked karen and her team stayed anonymous she leaked files through a series of cutouts the washington post hit on march the new york times and village voice followed a hue and cry escalated karen attributed the leaks to the citizens committee to investigate the fbi joe public got a gander at bland surveillance files jane public got hip to cointelpro mr hoover made flabbergasted remarks the prez was relieved the files revealed only prenixon chicanery it worked joan conceded the point the event faded in and out of public play lefty journos kept teething on it cointelpro was subtextually planted the event would etch the concept in blood work was tense the operation sustained him ideologically the operation drove joan in a wholly vindictive manner she saw it as a vendetta she would not reveal the origin of her journey of revenge she was running haggard lionel thorntons death disturbed her he was a money washer at worst and a political bagman at best joan wouldnt talk about it she always said what she always said im not going to joan slept with him in hotel suites and worked with him at the fallback she stayed in safe houses the nights he slept with karen she was worried about celia she was making phone calls and trying to find celia in the dr she refused all his offers to help shed sit by herself on the terrace shed sip tea and take herbal capsules he stole a few and had them analyzed they were haitian fertility potions joan was almost fortyfive and was trying to get pregnant her child his childit astounded him there was no chance of conception he knew it he never said it he never mentioned the potions he watched her face recast itself as she tried to will her body he reveled in the mad task and in her obduracy karens house was down a steep hillside he trained his binoculars and watched the girls play karen debriefed him on media and told him no more they formally terminated their snitch relationship he accepted it karen described media as a debt to joan and him and respectfully asserted that she had paid it he said she had she never returned to the fallback he carried the picture of her with the girls she sent him coded night messages shed sense him on the terrace and blast beethoven string quartets shed leave a kitchen light on to pinpoint the sound the music invaded his dreams wayne replaced dr king crocodiles and rivers in haiti explosions in the dr and gaunt black men with wings the operation proceeded convergence remained the one obstacle he flew to mississippi four times bob relyea remained committed bob was training bob would keep his mouth shut bob would not know the target until hit day he b amped marsh bowens house six more times he searched for a hidden diary and found none joan was certain that marsh kept a candid daily journal his actors selfabsorption fairly screamed it their fake diary was the deus ex machina of the operation they had to be certain that a real diary would not be found marsh worked nightwatch shifts and gave motivational speeches dwight blackbagged him and prowled trash runs desk and drawer runs fakepanel taps numerous art books and haitian travel brochures no diary yet the file section was now securityfitted it was a postmedia precaution it didnt matter he was an fbi agent he had fileshelf keys marsh bowen was now deeply fileinserted sergeant bowen was injudiciously promiscuous sergeant bowen was politically unstable going back years he spent late nights at the office he chatted with the mordant jack leahy jack was fixed on the old girl in gasping decline media was a pisser jack considered it predictable he was pensionsecure and raucous by nature he didnt seem to give a shit dick

hoover raged for reassurance amid mental gaffes both men found the enforcer consoling he was the gunslinger back from a crackup his consolation marshs diary hes creating a world of troubled men in extremis he attributes his dreams to marsh marshs discourse is shaped by his discourse with karen and joan marshs diary feels almost utopian it rebuts the world that is and prophesies the world that could be the entries cover the inception of baaaad brother and run to the present marsh carries guilt for exploiting the blackmilitant blastout he is determined to kill j edgar hoover his copactors role won him glory and spawned death his moral confusion counterpoints his tortured inner life and daytoday indulgence of perversion hes added details from his own breakdown marshs crackup is his crackup hyperradicalized hes created a hollybowen bond that did not exist the two men discuss crackup as a call to violent arms and the means to transcend selfserving pathology he portrays public policy as private nightmare and vehicle of atonement what its like to have to do something so you wont go insane his story and marshs story regained hes come to care for marsh he wont regret killing him los angeles frustration fucking ceaseless day by day the county grand jury nailed the bostitch boys posthumous scotty breathed easy then the brothers snuffed mr clean and formed a suicide pact

loose end would unfurl federal bank examiners tossed the peoples bank scotty went with them and jack leahy they tore the walls floors and roof to shreds they found the vault from mr cleans drawing inside a dope stash and catspaw longterm stopgap a hedge against possible exposure the money and remaining emeralds were stashed elsewhere thornton was smart he didnt give up the vault he played the i dont know card he knew he was dead anyway theory the money and gems were in the vault the heist guys knew it they pulled them before the bank team went in wheres reggie whos the woman wholl disburse

were all off in prison he couldnt brace them there his visits would be noted stray talk would disperse the case was all her the woman with the graystreaked hair was everything extract from the privately held journal of karen sifakis los angeles november media was eight months ago my comrades and i have remained unapprehended no one has broken ranks the fbis illegal surveillance of political organizations civic groups and protestinclined individuals has been revealed in a flurry of news reportage angry editorials and television and radio airtime the revelation has come and gone the concept of the has been introduced to the american people who have largely chosen to ignore it the fbis more draconian undercover operations were not mentioned in any of the released files dwight and joan seemed pleased by this i am quite capable of discerning dwights unspoken thoughts hes happy that the fbis specific war on the civil rights movement and blackmilitant groups has not been preemptively placed under the umbrella i dont want to know what joan and dwight are planning i suspect that i will learn of it in the public arena and am beginning to nurture a sense of it as a grandiosely large event media was a diversionary tactic andor a setup the ramifications of my one proactive salvo for dwight and joan will become apparent over time i dont want to know they know that and withhold their plans from me i have prayed over this and have made a vow to continue to love them regardless of any horror and chaos they may perpetrate we never meet as a group of three joan has resurfaced in my life we meet for coffee or lunch two or three times a week always here in silver lake or echo park we discuss politics incessantly nixon vietnam labor issues and the blackmilitant movement in decline can engross us for hours joan is gaunt and speaks in nervous yet fully coherent bomb bursts of invective with perceptive flows of political monologue mixed in the lovely and defining gray patches in her hair are turning white and are streaking through the overall black im afraid shes becoming paranoid she says shes had an intermittent sense of being followedand she often speaks of her lovercomrade celia out of touch in haiti or the dominican republic celia once told joan not to try to find her should she go missing how many times has joan told lovers or lovercomrades the same thing now joan is the one bereft and it is her bond with dwight chalfont holly that has taken her to this point where she cannot suppress grief joan smokes constantly and drinks pots of selfbrewed haitian herb tea she swallows haitian herb capsules with all her meals at precisely timed moments of the day i asked her about it she said she was trying to get pregnant she wanted to have a child i didnt question her motive i knew not to ask why joan would simply say im not telling you a woman her age cannot will a child joan doesnt seem to know how improbable it is it continues to remain unspoken albeit ineluctably true she wants to have this child with dwight joan and i have always withheld from each other we are individually compromised and duplicitous we live in a mendacious world we have been morally charged to undermine and subvert i could tell joan the one thing i have never told dwight it might or might not hurt her i know what it would do to dwight i fear the further breakdown that it might engender and the deep resolve it would certainly create extract from the journal of marshall e bowen baldwin hills i thought the murder would hurt me more and would more hurtfully invade my body and mind it hasnt i assumed the role of murderer and behaved in the manner of a firsttime killer determined to survive it took a few days for my mental equilibrium to adjust i mindscaped the possible upshot of my actions as scotty took care of business i met him for a series of latenight dinners at ollie hammonds we boozed a bit and ate steak sandwiches scotty preached in the end youll survive you did what was necessary youll do it again if you have to feel better now i did then i do now i have the upper hand in the partnership i know two things that scotty doesnt reginald hazzard and the emeralds are in haiti the woman is joan rosen klein my life is a series of shadow plays and non sequiturs i work the detective bureau at hollywood station i go to moviebiz cocktail parties and enjoy the ambivalent responses that my presence there provokes three years ago i was a policeman who had been beaten ostracized and converted to the blackmilitant faith that inspired filmbiz cachet now i am a policeman revealed to have been a planted informant a policeman who extolls authoritarian values in prestigious speaking engagements and stands tall in lapd dress blues the filmbiz folks would love to hate me as a sellout but they cant i won the game and i look too good ive been partyhopping and meeting people including the very attractive actor sal mineo who starred in several notable angry teenager films in the s sal has the bent and has determined that i share it sals tweaked on me we run into each other we talk on the phone flirt go out for coffee but dont do it sals very persistent and hes a sweetheart but my plate is too full to accommodate a parttime or fulltime squeeze its funny its mindscape i talk to sal and hang up scotty calls five minutes later scotty took care of the thorntonbostitch brothers business with great panache and leaked a series of intelligence division files showing mr clean to be in fact a mob stooge crusading journalists picked the story up articles have appeared in los angeles and have gotten prominent nationwide ink scotty slanders our dead as we grasp for leads on our living weve considered making an attempt to grab thorntons fedsnitch file but scotty thinks its too risky ive thought about trying for an independent look but havent figured out how im holding back reggie in haiti and the woman as joan shes dwight hollys lover that makes her unapproachable dwight holly fucked with could blow our deal skyhigh mindscapes feints jabs withholdings and deceptions im holding back from scotty ive made stabs at getting full customs files on reginald hazzard and have failed access requires legal warrants my holdbacks are motivated by pure hubris and pure race hate i learned some things from kudos to mr holly i did in part transcend my selfserving actors pathology i did become radicalized scotty bennett represents the white world out to level me with indifference i cannot let that be scotty is the white oppressor and i will not knuckle down to him scotty will not split the money and emeralds i must get to them first and kill scotty before he kills me ive made three trips to haiti ive synced them to scottys boozy weeklong fishing trips with his cop pals sal had been to haiti on a film shoot and shared his knowledge of that wondrous and atavistic place i flew to portauprince i toured haiti as a middleclass frenchfluent black man i displayed my reggie hazzard photograph and asked questions i learned nothing substantive and smelled the obvious fact that reginald had to be here haiti was primitive and seductive i felt like i was regressing it was an actors immersion process i visited voodoosect taverns and drank klerin alcohol i dreamt of armless men with wings i attended a few voodoo ceremonies and ate handfuls of herbs i came out of trances and found myself dancing with woodenmasked men i awoke from an herb trip and saw that i had blood on my hands the man in bed beside me said i had eaten a freshkilled chicken my shapeshifting personality served me well in haiti i pretended to be a french tourist which assisted me in my queries on reginald nobody knew reginald many people told me tales of the late wayne tedrow and his brave prohaitian acts what would poor wayne say to that people walk around with photographs of him attached to their necks i heard the story of waynes death twenty or thirty times the details varied several people told me that winged men came for him wayne and i shared the dreamstate concept he related it to chemistry it was all about fated souls in

transposition he was a sandkicking klan kid marsh was a sandkickedintheface black boy he was building a sympathetic portrait he was creating marshs nonexistent crush on agent holly himself it was distorting marshs work on operation baaaaad brother he knew nothing of the marshscotty relationship the diary must etch scotty with verismo the scotty sections must withstand public scrutiny and

on a new kandinsky it fucked up the northwall symmetry dwight prowled it was b ampe futile repetition cop workhe loved that shit he tapped panels he opened drawers he reached under couches and rugs he saw dust leak from a ceiling beam the beam was smoothfinished that shouldnt be he pulled a chair over and stood on it he squinted he saw faint markings on one side of the beam the dust leaked from a nearinvisible seam he pushed against it the wood piece opened inward a tiny hinge and runner squeaked the door was near invisible and rectangular the dimensions were eight by ten paper scent right offthe very first thing he reached in it was leatherbound stylish marshrawcut pages he pulled it out and stepped off the chair he prepped his minox he carried it to marshs desk and read he knew marsh the diary confirmed it straight off their narrative styles were similar they both knew how smart they were they both had the same dry wit they both worshiped ruthlessness marsh was new to it and in awe of it oh you kid oh my brother you dont know what it costs it was he had twelve rolls of film he could shoot most of the text it was cumbersome fold the pages aim the camera shoot he got in close and read as he snapped it was all there it was his world and brother bowens world combined the heist as holy grail his kid crush on d c holly his duplicitous union with scotty b wayne tedrow and longlost reggie reggie as heist survivor and emerald conduit the lionel thornton snuff the three haiti trips marsh ids joan as the woman he withholds it from scotty he shot seventythree pages he ran out of film he memorized most of the text he replaced the diary and cleaned up the dust he left the room pristine his migraine was gone the operation was in jeopardy he felt calm and light and something else the fallback was dark joan was out karen played the grosse fuge at full volume he walked to the terrace karens bathroom light was on the music roared from a bright little square the darkroom was fully equipped joan developed film better than he did he knew the basic drill he redlit the space filled the trays and unfurled his film rolls it was four full hours work he cut film strips dunked them and pinned them up he watched words on paper appear he took a break and called peeper the punk never got a word in he dropped hints about emeralds joan klein and the heist do nothing dipshit do you understand peeper gulped and said yes dwight went back to work he finished the film dunks he clotheslined all the photos and let them drip dry he pulled them and carried them into the living room lets create a narrative lets expose it eye level lets shape a scanandread he pinned the photos it told marshs story and their story he told it in three aroundthewall strips the photos were slightly dark and buckled it didnt matter the living room lights were fine he walked out to the terrace karens bedroom light was still on he trained his binoculars dina ran into the room crying karen picked her up and held her dear child bad dream the lights went out he waited for the bathroom light and more music he didnt get it skyscraper lights blinked downtown a key went in the frontdoor lock the door swept and slammed her footfalls were too light she didnt hurl her handbag he waited he scanned the sky and saw city hall it was lapd was headquartered there he saw a young cop manhandle a suspect sixfive crew cutscotty b presaged he saw her shadow and smelled her hair he leaned into the terrace rail she walked up and leaned into him i havent ever lied to you or betrayed you i know that marsh has put a good deal of it together dwight turned toward her she embraced him his chin brushed the top of her head i recruited reginald hazzard jack and i have been friends for many years we planned the robbery together reginald has been in haiti for a very long time dwight touched her hair last weeks black was gray and gray was white the heist gives this a whole new dimension scotty knows that marsh is not the loneassassin type its a level of scrutiny we cant afford scotty will know that were behind it in a heartbeat joan said i disagree dwight shook his head theyre shafting each other scottys pulling a sex shakedown on marsh marsh knows your name and knows that you were my informant they killed lionel thornton marsh is not going to walk into a snipers perch with all this going on joan said i disagree dwight balled his fists joan cupped them and placed them on her chest it densities every level of our subtext it indicts scotty bennett and facilitates the need for an lapd coverup which will extend the paper trail and greatly increase the degree of public exposure we can combine the diaries we can remove the references to jack leahy reginald hazzard and me we can edit out the references to lionel thornton so that his people dont get hurt think of this as a social document that unfailingly takes us back to mr hoover and every evil thing that hes done the heist will muddy the trail and enhance the overall readership and scholarship the bennettbowen friendship explicates every point about hatred and greed that ive ever wanted to make dwight pulled away karens bathroom light went on he strained his ears no music played tell me about lionel thornton he was a comrade of sorts he laundered the money for you and jack yes jack went in with the bank examiners he got the basic sum out beforehand he left some money behind to be found joan said yes youve got all of it but theres the thing you havent said and the question you havent asked dwight looked at her i dont blame you for any of it given what ive done i simply cant and the question the question is who got the money the answer is its all been going to the cause the music started low dissonant strings it was very late she wanted them to hear it soft joan said i dont want to lose this dwight strained for the music a low wind obscured it marsh knows about you scotty could learn about you youd be in danger then and your name would be revealed in the end joan shook her head scotty doesnt know about me marsh wont tell him or anyone else hes a greedy covetous little man he wants everything for himself you saw the diary pages no one else did ill be kept out of it and no one will believe anything that scotty says about you hes the faggot niggers white cop buddy and youre the

not telling you hunt was late it pissed him off karen and the kids were here dwight sipped coffee and scanned the restaurant ronald reagan walked in he got ooohs aaaahs and jeers hed worked three days straight with joan they combined the fakediary excerpts with marshs reallife text it was now seamless they deleted the lionel thornton murder it would throw huge heat on scotty and induce him to talk the omission might convince him to stay silent joan had been close to lionel thornton the omission would spare his family the new text revealed marshs heist fixation he partnered up with the equally fixated scotty and pursued fruitless leads marsh was now all greed and perversion he came to political grievance late he was pawn and puppetmaster his psyche had disarticulated sixteen million ways cops took him in and gave him an identity cops told him to retain it while he assumed an antithetical one the search for the money and emeralds went nowhere he didnt know who he was where he was or

two big guys ushered in a frail old man he shuffled his clothes fell off him his glasses slipped down his nose liver spots palsy slack neck halfinch mincing steps the old man looked over and saw him he had filmy dark brown eyes nothing clicked outward dwight blinked and refocused mr hoover deadeye stared the bodyguards eased him to a table it took three minutes to walk fifteen yards he looked around the restaurant unfocused nobody noticed him people tablehopped around him a waiter brought precooked food out dwight had him headon a short space stood between them he stepped away from the bar he built a big simple frame mr hoover looked over dwight waved mr hoover stayed blank one bodyguard cut up his steak one bodyguard fed him ted kennedy noticed him and looked away ronald reagan smiled and waved his way mr hoover deadeyed it saliva dripped down his chin dwight walked three steps closer it built a clearer frame mr hoover coughed saliva pooled on his plate a waiter pounced and snatched it dwight stepped forward he hovered now mr hoover was very close he looked straight at dwight and never saw him the girls skipped around the monument dwight and karen held hands on a bench have you told them washington was the father of our country karen smiled your american history is not my american history i might dispute that now given recent events i might concede the point the lawn was full of nannies with strollers and kids kicking balls a little boy saw dwights belt gun and grinned karen said weve been together for seven years i know youll be fortyseven in february take me somewhere for a weekend im bracing myself all the time youre doing something irreparable i want a few moments with you first dwight tucked a knee up and faced her karen looked at him he held her face some tears rolled he brushed them off with his thumbs im not doing it karen leaned away from him her tears rolled crazy she took off her sweater and blotted her eyes the mauve cashmere cardigan his first christmas gift shed said what you didnt buy me reef why dwight said nobody dies he had a big suite at the willard bureauvouchered digs the bathroom featured a walkin shower room service sent up a bottle of bourbon it made him salivate he carried his briefcase and the jug into the bathroom he dumped the diary pages in the shower and poured the bourbon on top he lit a match and dropped it the shower stall contained the blaze he let the flames leap way up the nozzle dangled outside the stall he kicked on the water and sprayed it all out the pages crackled down to black muck a wall phone was clamped above the toilet dwight dialed the fallback direct he got three rings and yes were pulling out i cant do it joan said no and hung up extract from the journal of marshall e bowen i always know when something has ended i opened my door saw that silly boy on my porch and realized that many threads of my life had fully run their course i did not ask him to elaborate on his statement i did not tell him that i had glimpsed him here and there enough to know that he had to be a deft surveillance artist with considerable knowledge of me his car was parked in my driveway i walked over to grab the days newspaper off my lawn and saw that the boy had photographs of joan rosen klein taped to the dashboard in that instant i knew it is over he drove off i grabbed my journal from its hiding place liquidated my bank account packed a bag and flew here i doubted that scotty would come here or risk exposure of our many crimes by siccing the lapd on me instinct told me that the money was in los angeles and reginald and the emeralds were here thus i got on an airplane and flew to portauprince it is very black i am a frenchfluent black man an american a policeman i have the gifted actors flair for assimilating language i could never pass myself off as purely haitian but i have become proficient in kreole french native people feel honored when foreign rubes attempt to speak their tongue and actually succeed at it my proficiency and natural charm have given me carte blanche to indulge and observe i travel by foot and bicycle and stay in small hotels i ask questions about reginald hazzard in french and english wherever i go i describe the young black man with the burnscarred face i sometimes display my police credentials many people recall having seen reginald but no one knows where he is i have all the time in the world to find him i am not going back to america the tonton macoute has surveilled me on many occasions and has interrogated me four times my americancop status flummoxes them they are all rogue cops and sense that i am one as well they have seen me distribute cash for tips on reginald i am certain that they know who he is and perhaps where he is now tonton men have told me the cautionary tale of another american policeman who felt compelled to explore rural haiti wayne tedrow was white and lacked my protective coloration the tonton men have never threatened me they have implied that black americans with financial resources can buy their way into anonymous security and live safely in haiti as long as their money holds out they have further implied that this may be the case with reginald hazzard and have yet further implied that perhaps i should go home im staying the tonton men accept it with some reluctance because haiti is a dangerous place im a black cop who speaks their language with no small flair and because they seem to like me a tonton man told me that lapd had queried them about my whereabouts the tonton had not yet responded it had to be a secondhand query initiated by scotty i gave the man some money and told him to rebuff the query he told me he would i am always jaunting about portauprince the larger nearby towns and more remote villages i drink klerin and trip on all manner of haitian herbs i herbtripped and retraced waynes last day on earth a bokur mixed me a potion named after wayne it is the most breathless mindscape i often see faces out of my past in entirely altered forms i think of my life as a middleclass black kid a leftwing poseur a policeman a homosexual a faux black militant and a killer i live in a contemplative and unburdened state february and everything i have done to claim profit from it feels entirely irrelevant i occasionally think of scotty i think of wayne frequently and mr holly most of all i loved him in the manner that the morally afflicted love those people who most exemplify their complex will to assert and to survive i think we knew each other in the end it led to nothing more than that given who i am he is and we are it was a bond of some solvencyand on my part affection i am oddly nurtured by it now rural haiti compels me it is akin to a roughtrade zone in east hollywood i have attended a number of voodoo ceremonies i have seen men and women zombified groups of men follow me sometimes but i never feel threatened i think of wayne and our discourses on the dream state i want to be physically immobilized so that i can be utterly still and devoid of the will to summon conscious thought and reaction i have a stash of wildly powerful herbs and blowfish toxin that ive been saving for a special occasion i carry it with me at all times i seek stimulation and stimulation seeks me i want to be chemically prepared to enhance any state of revelation that i may find myself in i often recall my first conversation with mr holly it was during the chicago police riot of summer i was in a soutliside lockup a racistcop casualty who also happened to be a cop mr holly was in the early stages of entrapping me for he quoted a very wise woman whom i later learned was his quaker leftist girlfriend take note of what you are seeking for it is seeking you mr holly said to me it was an immediate recognition of my life to date and a spellbinding prophecy of my future i was sitting on the bench at cayesjacmel yesterday i was mindscaping that very thought and looking out at the caribbean it was sunny and not quite hot a vendor had sold me a shavedice treat laced with klerin liqueur it was fruitsweetened with a bitter aftertaste reginald hazzard walked up and sat down next to me i recognized him from that day nearly eight years before waynes photograph was a flat predisfigured image this man was the man my doctor neighbor and i rescued from the robbery and the vicious police aftermath we said hello to each other reginalds burn scars had faded and had left his dark skin blotched pinkwhite he thanked me for saving him and told me he had heard rumors that a policeman had been asking questions i was pointed out to him three weeks earlier he had been following me since that time he knew who i was at once it took a long period of study for him to determine that i meant him no harm he had a bottle of klerin we passed it back and forth i did not press him for details on the robbery he did not press me for details on my police career or my recent hometown celebrity he knew a great deal about me i sensed it readily and knew it would be ungracious to seek affirmation or in any way pry i asked reginald if he felt safe in haiti reginald said that he did but added that he missed his mother a great deal i did not mention his fathers death in the summer of with wayne tedrow very much in its orbit i did not mention wayne as haitian folk hero i did not mention waynes union with mary beth hazzard or his quest to find the boy who so easily found me he knew all of it none of it part of it or most of it i understood that and again behaved decorously the sun fell low on the water we sat silently much more than we talked reginald asked me if i had met joan i said that i had reginald placed an emerald in my hand and told me it was the very last one i thanked him he got up and walked away from me i bicycled into the haitian interior villages were scattered along low mountain ridges and brushcovered plains fallen branches and sharp rocks shredded my tires i continued on foot the night grew darker i sensed groups of men following me the moon gave me sight at odd moments i got glimpses of farranging crocodiles and bloodmarked trees i felt the groups behind me expanding i came up to a small village with a very small hotel car lights strafed me i waved to the driver he was wearing a white wooden mask i swallowed my special stash of herbs and entered the village a dog wearing a pointed hat ran up and bit me i walked into the hotel and spoke french to the desk clerk he rented me a secondfloor streetfacing room it was lowceilinged and narrow with just a sink a chair and a bed i turned the lights off i held reginalds emerald and stood in front of the window the herbs took effect the moon made the green stone a prism people passed in and out of the rays and said astonishing thingsto me a group of men is forming outside now they are looking up at me there are three of them they are carrying machetes in scabbards they have left arms and wings where their right arms should be im becoming immobilized my thoughts are dispersing as i start to form them i will drop the pen i am writing with in a moment the winged men are entering the hotel now i have left the door unlocked for them los angeles he got the word late it knocked him down it sent him sideways hed spent weeks running one way it sent him running back and running out and sitting still to think he missed him more than anything he had a friend in this the friend fucked him and ran he missed him anyway marsh got snuffed in haiti he knew that hed fled there he stiffed an lapd query and got a late response he couldnt go there his whitepig status would deepsix him extradition was out marsh was awol but marsh was clean ia cops searched his house they found fruitbar listings in his address book they interviewed scotty you and marsh clashed in tell us about it he tattled marshs fedplant deal the ia guys

spiel she put her hand on the window ledge she clicked as offkilter then she raised a little snubnosed revolver she shot him six times in the face extract from the privately held journal of karen sifakis the following pages will serve as my confession should it come to that i am not going to run i am not going to lie if i am officially confronted i am not going to offer personal or political justifications for the horrible thing that i did i did it because i loved dwight holly to the bottom of my soul and because the other woman he loved lacked the will to do it i am determined to survive without dwight and pray for the strength to do so in our childrens name i performed the act in a state of rage i did not pause to pray or summon moments of reflection i walked to dwights little bungalow and found a single throwdown gun in a box i killed in the spirit of wanton apostasy i refuse now and will always refuse to abdicate my personal responsibility for this act dwight scuttled his operation and spared a life my persistent preaching of nonviolence influenced his decision his deeply sure rebuke of his own vile deeds compelled me to violently acknowledge the price he paid to revoke his past and seek transcendence i could not have lived with myself had i not formed a circle back to that brave man and the woman i sent forth to teach him the bond of the three of us must continue to flourish within me my action was an attempt to settle all debts and hold us together with one of us now incapacitated and one of us dead i see through the grandiosity and speciousness of these statements even as i write them i am past caring at this moment i will always stand by what i have done i feel the urgency of dwights patrimony now i will not dwell on whether i should have told him earlier he knew for a conscious flicker and he will know in the world that follows this one i will change our daughters names to holly at an appropriate time dwight cared more for marshall bowen than he ever admitted bowen died in haiti a few months ago i am going to have his body shipped to the states and interred with dwights i will be sure that they are laid to rest near some tame goats los angeles she was inside she never left hed been watching for days he talked to clyde last night scuttlebutt was raging dwight holly was dead some heist men shot scotty clyde ran down all the theories they were bogus he had xray eyes only he knew what it meant she stayed inside he slept in his car and watched the windows he saw her once two days ago she looked in the closet where the boxes used to be she wore frayed jeans and one of dwights suit coats he started counting the days since he first saw her he stopped at one thousand he looked at the dashboard pix and got all raw he ran up and jiggled the door it swung open she was sitting on the floor her face was blotchy and tearstreaked shed twisted some strands of her hair out her wrists were bloodcrusted a knife was stuck in the far wall she wrote the word no in blood beside it he almost stepped on her glasses she squinted at him he picked her glasses up and walked over she pushed herself away from him and braced her back on the wall he handed her the glasses she put them on her eyes focused past her tears she looked up at him miss klein my name is donald crutchfield ive been following you for a very long time and id be grateful if youd talk to me part vi comrade joan march may joan rosen klein los angeles shed seen him he was a popup face and a blur persistent it was intermittent he felt like a shapeshifter hed go away and reappear changed so ill tell you its the story i should have told him she cleaned up and bundled into dwights tweed coat she made them a pot of tea clouds rolled in low a spring storm hovered it began with the stones green fire green death colombia midsomething spanish settlers conquer the muzo indians and rape their emerald mines the spanish become colombians the muzos become slave labor the tradition extends to now mining companies rape the itoco mountains theyre near bogota her grandparents were germanjewish йmigrйs they came to america and settled in new york isidore klein traveled to south america and became immersed in green fire lore he was a borderline mystic he was every inch a red red bandits hit the muzo valley mines the men called themselves quaqueros it meant treasure hunters they dug tunnels into the mining companies tunnels and dug out stones for themselves they warred with company goon squads they looted emeralds routinely and were routinely trapped tortured and killed there were dozens of quaquero bands some were politically identified isidore klein bought his emeralds exclusively from them he earmarked a portion of his ultimate profits to south american insurgent groups he sold his emeralds in fine jewelry stores throughout the united states he grew wealthy he gave away small fortunes to anarchist cabals and leftwing labor organizations he lived comfortably he lived more modestly than other immigrant arrivistes his rise to wealth matched a young lawyers rise to power the mans name was john edgar hoover he was a justice department drone he was brilliant and sensed opportunity in wildly unfolding events the postworld war i red scare granted him history the attorney generals home was bombed hoover took it from there the red raids civil liberties suspended abrogated quashed interdicted suppressed first amendment rights shat upon political roundups false imprisonings deportation at whim a concurrent resurgence of nativist groups and the klan john edgar hoover saw the force of fear and exploited it his power grab succeeded commensurately isidore klein had one son his name was joseph he was born in isidore raised him red joseph married helen hershfield rosen in helen had been raised red their daughter joan was born on halloween night her parents and grandfather raised her red the fbi was recently chartered the old bureau of investigation had been deemed moribund j edgar hoover took over he was an organizational genius and a pr whiz his mandate was smother dissent he honed his techniques during the madcap boom decade he understood the metaphysical value of the enemy he knew that reds could serve in that capacity gangsters were picaresque touchstones for the public imagination they lacked the pervasive force of the reds the boom became the depression the american left mobilized hoover sensed an insurgent shift and reacted he stepped into the public arena with flair he preached an antired message and ignored organized crime he made himself a national hero he unleashed a tidal wave of illegal surveillance official scrutiny and false arrest isidore klein took full notice of him the name hoover reigned ubiquitous he recalled the name spoken by savaged comrades in he began to study hoover he developed a sense of hoover as his personal enemy he acted in the public arena he utilized the stones he bought subversives out of stir small and large emerald gifts unlocked jail doors emeralds supported joseph helen and the child joan they camped in socialist meeting halls and distributed leaflets in bread lines they housed and fed fugitive leftists they skirmished with goons on picket lines and endured three and fourday detentions they fought their war isidore klein fought an increasingly recognized war against j edgar hoover his weapon was words emeralds bankrolled the clandestine publishing of antihoover tracts isidore klein pushed the tracts in significant quantity mr hoover took enraged note of it and began a lockstep surveillance isidores printing operations were repeatedly raided and isidore was repeatedly jailed emeralds bought him out of custody the stones were trinkets talismans keepsakes and bribes the depression raged a small emerald carried a cops family for months green fire was the flame of magic and revolution mr hoover knew it he failed to interdict the flow of the emeralds and thus the flow of the tracts he believed that isidore klein held an emerald stash at his home on east rd street he ordered a squad of new york city agents to ransack the house and steal them it was joan rosen klein was ten years old the squad was led by special agent thomas d leahy he was a widower with a sixteenyearold son named john the squad tore isidores home apart they found twentythree pounds of the highest quality muzo emeralds and stole them isidore arrived later that night he discovered the theft and suffered a fatal heart attack joseph and helen klein were now without resources they knew that hoover directed the burglary and told joan the story in full detail hoover kept the emeralds he dispensed small quantities to his toadies as quid pro quos the quaqueros found less controversial gemstone importers hoover emeraldgifted strikebreak captains and subversivegroup infiltrators he hoarded the sum of the stones for himself isidore kleins death devastated tom leahy he became horrified of mr hoover his fear and revulsion ran equal with his guilt and selfdisgust a gear clicked the wrong way or the right way inside him he became radicalized he covertly assisted leftwingers and warned them of impending fed raids he acted with great caution and covered his tracks agent tom became a cherished secret of the leftist underground the kleins had heard of him no one knew that hed led the emerald raid hoover had quashed all public mention of it agent tom confessed the deed to joe and helen klein and their daughter joe and helen forgave him a deep friendship evolved agent tom took their forgiveness to heart it spawned inspiration he was a gifted lawyer and criminal investigator he knew how to log information and build information to the indictment stage he decided to build a massive file on j edgar hoover and take it public he queried other agents hoovers minions lawenforcement colleagues and rivals he took depositions from witnesses to hoovers negligence and planned obfuscation the file grew to several thousand pages it catalogued covetousness pettiness the largescale violation of civil liberties and rampant power abuse joe and helen klein read the file the young comrade joan read the file and became enraptured and enraged it was now fall joan was fourteen tom leahys son jack was now almost twenty tom leahy was a red with an fbi badge he was grooming jack to become a cop revolutionary mr hoover was fortyfive years old he had the emeralds he was ascendant he possessed the power he had always craved he had created a myth newsprint and radio waves spread it for him he adroitly read the times he lived through he created a tale of moral sureness and his own supremacy it was tailormade for the depression and the onset of world war ii it posited the unseen other as epidemically everywhere it vouchsafed the fbi and his stewardship for as long as he could render the myth real hoover had informants everywhere he learned of red toms betrayal and the antihoover file he heard that leahy was off taking depositions leahy was isolated at a leftist campground in the catskills the moment was perfect he paid off a squad of new york state troopers they were expedited with parcels of emeralds no cash the troopers raided the campground several inhabitants resisted the troopers rounded them up and burned down the womens bunkhouse joseph and helen klein resisted they were arrested and severely beaten at a state police jail near poughkeepsie they died from their injuries joan was home in brooklyn that weekend a veil of rage and horror fell over her new york city agents stormed tom leahys apartment they found his file hoover read it and burned it his informants helped him build a sedition case against tom the war was newly raging hoover played a trump card national security he had tom leahy arrested and tried sub rosa tom was convicted by a hastily impaneled judge and jury he was sentenced to six years at sing sing tom leahys file was comprehensive it was diligently annotated and superbly constructed it begat mr hoovers devouring file lunacy fbi paperwork accrued to ten tons yearly tom leahy died in prison in he drank himself dead on rotgut toilet brew he had been repeatedly beaten the guards who beat him all wore emerald rings toms son jack disappeared and lived anonymously he attended college and served in the us navy he entered notre dame law school he was wholly and committedly red and equally committed to sustained vengeance he laid out a paper trail of obscure name changes and came all the way back to the defiant john leahy the trail was built from his dateclose birthday up his fathers file taught him how to build paper his fathers access to hoovers files taught him to build paper fraudulently he got through the fbi backgroundcheck process he was appointed to the bureau in special agent john c leahyred he worked routine bureau assignments he kept up with his fathers subversive friends he covertly redacted his comrades files and diverted fbi interference jack leahy fed toady by day jack leahy red provocateur by night jack reconnected with joan she had gone underground and gone criminal her sense of vengeance had gone scattershot she had remained fixedly red she recruited on college campuses she proudly retained her own real name much as jack did the sporadic use of aliases muddied her trail she met karen sifakis their deep friendship began a floating dialogue defined it karen advocated nonviolence joan nearly always disagreed a strikebreaker pulled a gun on her she hit him with a twobyfour she sustained a scarring knife wound two legionnaires cornered her at that paul robeson concert she took a savage beating she waited nine years she shot and killed the two men in their sleep she loved the thrill of armed robbery she planned the jobs and steered clear of the jobs as events she was conscious of herself as a woman she crouched in certain shadows as she raged red jack fed her inside scoop on payroll jobs and bank vaults she always donated her heist takes to the cause joan and jack became comradelovers they shared a family story and a family hatred they moved together and in circles overlapping joan became williamson goldenson broward and faust and always returned to klein jack remained a gman under his real and entirely fictive name jack got joan out of jail jack utilized municipal pd contacts for criminalrecords deletes joan conceived two textileplant jobs in la and dragnets caught her up jack got her out and blitzed file reports joan conceived a heist in dayton ohio jack bought off key investigators and got most of the paperwork expunged joan roved and toured revolutionary hot spots it was a breathless errand and a blood duty of great urgency her dialogue with karen sifakis curtailed her worst urges a lust peaked and sent things bad only karen knew the details only karen knew the price she paid to continue at her mad pace she moved heroin to finance leftwing coups she fomented revolt in algeria and cuba she was heedless reckless vindictive and in many ways ideologically unsound the death of her great love dwight holly taught her things her arc left matched his arc right in hate and specious rigor she should have told him that before she ran from him she roved she ran from and toward j edgar hoover she thought about the emeralds near constantly she heard out rumors and cribbed lore and supposition she exerted common sense and followed the trail jack followed it with her they shared information and came to this hoover sold the stones to a paraguayan fascist after the war it was greed and political payback el jefe hid nazi scientists the us wanted el jefe knew brilliant gemologists they knew of the stones and had their own designs they studied the emeralds their findings comprised a thesis on exploitative mining techniques a straight borethroughrock technology evolved it was successfully employed and brought an end to the quaquero raids el jefe was afraid of overt quaquero vengeance and ordered massacres scores of quaqueros were slaughtered the borethroughrock technology caused massive worker layoffs enhanced emerald profits financed rightwing coups throughout south america and the caribbean green fire served to sustain rafael trujillos power the goat became obsessed he had to own the initial muzoklein stones outright the provenance consumed him he wanted the story to end with him trujillo hoarded dominican money and grabbed haitianowned land papa doc duvalier had been emeraldfinanced and wanted the gems for himself trujillo and duvalier hated each other trujillo murdered haitian refugees duvalier enacted reprisals the two fьhrers discovered their mutual longing they decided to trust each other on the acquisition of the stones and nothing else joan tracked the arc of the emeralds to this point and no further she went to the dr in early she found a country ripe for revolt she found celia a leftist network supplied the introduction celia was a gonebust united fruit heiress she was half american half dominican all old money she used her fathers surname of farr and her mothers maiden name of reyes interchangeably gretchen and celia came and went at whim joan preferred the latter name celia was a casualty of revolution left and rightwing castro nationalized the cane fields and bankrupted her father the goat robbed her mother in a recent land grab celia was a nationally ranked polo player and a bunco artist extraordinaire she was omnivorously intelligent and not quite brilliant joan considered her ripe for conversion one thing told her this the emeralds celia was crazed over them they became comradelovers celia was headstrong and tractable independent and willfully submissive to the concept of revolt celia was a mystic joan was not celia dabbled in eastern philosophy and more than dabbled in voodoo celia believed in the spiritual force of the emeralds joan did not they reconciled their differences and traveled to castros cuba they began plotting the invasion the invasion failed a rebel named maria rodriguez fontonette betrayed the cause a tonton macoute man named laurentjean jacqueau assisted the cause jacqueau secretly emigrated to america and changed his name to leander james jackson joan and celia were captured imprisoned and bribed free joan had stashed a robbery take in an la bank vault jack leahy tapped the cash and found the right officials joan and celia flew to america the goat was assassinated juan bosch and joaquin balaguer succeeded him they were repressive and much less garish rulers balaguer inherited the goats emerald fixation he was then a government lawyer eyeing the presidency papa doc remained in power and remained emeraldfixed the men found each other they collaborated and cut a side deal they learned the identity of the paraguayan el jefe they gave him a down payment on the muzoklein emerald stash el jefe was nearbroke and in poor health he wanted to sell it was december fate intervened and fucked it all up balaguer had a financial setback papa doc had a financial setback they lacked the cash to outright buy the stones they looked for a rich american to consign them to the rightwing grapevine supplied a name dr fred hiltz he was a hate pamphleteer and an emeraldmyth worshiper they contacted dr fred he paid off eljefe with a bank draft the stones were messengered to santo domingo balaguer and papa doc met there just to touch them they did not trust messengers to handdeliver the stones dr fred insisted on an armoredcar drop a haitian man was hired to fly the emeralds to la it was now he could not leave until balaguer and papa doc enjoyed the delay they got to touch the stones more suddenly a tonton macoute thug learned of the shipment he contacted his old tonton frиre leander james jackson leander knew his old comrades joan and celia serendipity celias brother richard farr worked at wells fargo in la jack leahy ran the fbis la office richard knew the armoredcar route richard predicted the cash take along with the stones jack knew expendable criminal scum to leave dead at the scene the greatest hurdle was obscuring their ids joan knew a brilliant chemist named reginald hazzard she had mentored him at the freedom school she had bailed him out of jail the month before the plan was developed reginald concocted a bonedeep burning solution jack recruited an expendable klansman named claverly and an expendable hood named wilkinson the plan was now fully formed but reginald wanted to be there he told joan and jack this joan and jack conferred and tried to dissuade him reginald insisted he thought his chemical expertise marked him invaluable and immune to deceit he was right and he was wrong joan and jack argued jack argued for compliance as joan argued for termination jack won reginald would go in and reginald would survive the plan was now fully formed but reginald feared a double cross reginald harbored a hurtchild resentment his comrades trusted him to develop deepburning compounds but not to be there he was there that day he impulsively popped a bank tab and let loose jets of ink jack impulsively shot him his flameretardant precautions saved his life softpoint bullets hit him regardless his chemical compounds worked erratically the palliative pellets in his mouth circumvented damage the antiflame chemicals enhanced flames paradoxically so he lived so marsh bowen and the doctor saved him he grabbed handfuls of inked cash as he went down he gave them to the doctor he hid in east los angeles scotty bennett led the lapd task force jack worked fbiadjunct the newspaper accounts and crimescene reports shocked him there were two dead robbers at the scene jack wanted to find reginald and kill him joan told him no the debate raged for days comrade joan won she searched for reginald and found him she begged for his forgiveness he told her he wanted to live in haiti and study herbal chemistry she gave him the emeralds and told him to serve the cause joan and jack now possessed millions of dollars a dozen ink bindles had leaked stains rendered the cash unpassable for some time they waited jack heard a rumor pilfered heist cash had been laundered through the peoples bank he told joan she asked around about lionel thornton she learned that he was mobbed up she learned that he came out of the detroit labor struggle circa she arranged a meeting with him the meeting went well it was instinctively collaborative a level of trust built both ways thornton was politically versed and selfinterested joan got dirt on him as an insurance policy she gave him the stained and nonstained cash reginald developed a compound to obscure the ink markings she let thornton trade the money up down and sideways the base sum grew in a hidden bank vault she let him implement reginalds emeralddisbursement plan the green stones formed a circuit back to isidore klein and his struggle that gave joan a bare semblance of peace thornton did his job and kept his word scotty bennett and marsh bowen killed him he did not reveal jacks name or hers reginald remained in haiti he was still there his exact whereabouts were unknown he forgave joan and jack he was nineteen he was eager he was easily led he was passively complicit and as guilty as they were he bought revolution unblinkingly and never saw through to the cost joan understood a bit of that now she was thirty years in the game the heist aftershocks subsided joan rode the s zeitgeist jack stayed with the bureau he disseminated information he redacted and misplaced their comrades files joan kept up with karen sifakis karen described her love affair with a rogue fed named dwight holly dwight did terrible things for mr hoover dwight was deadwrecked in the spring of tommy narduno sensed the fbi behind the king hit tommy saw dwight in memphis a few days before joan kept tommys thoughts from karen karen said dwight was planning a he needed an informant joan knew it had to be her entered the planning stage a non sequitur clash occurred jack called joan and reported rumblings it was dr fred he put together some leads on the heist gleaned from clyde dubers file he wasnt looking for revenge balaguer and papa doc had refunded his money he wanted a second shot at the stones hiltz wanted to run his heist leads by mr hoover he was a trusted cbi and a hoover phonechat pal joan summarily acted she knew about dr freds bombshelter stash leander knew of jomo clarkson via the blackmilitant grapevine joan cutoutworked jomo and fed him the plan steal dr freds money dont hurt him scare him into silence per hell fold off that she didnt want more death she got it anyway jomo and his partner killed dr fred the partner absconded jomo found him and killed him went forth joan became dwights informant and lover the wildcard clash of marsh bowen and scotty bennett occurred joan and dwight did not know the extent then marsh and scotty wanted the money and the emeralds they colluded and betrayed each other and died for their cause dwight and joan colluded and conspired she betrayed him only by her silence they had crafted an operation that would serve to right all their wrongs dwight pulled out unilaterally their paperwork was stashed at a comrades house shell honor dwights decision to abort their plan she lacks the requisite will celia was lost on that island la banda and the tonton had xmarked her the warrants derived from her work with wayne tedrow celia was past reason in some regards maria rodriguez fontonette was almost certainly murdered in la several years back celia felt complicitous she had hexed tattoo it was preposterous voodoo was barbarous capitalism cloaked in magic celia thought otherwise it didnt matter celia was courageous beyond ideology belief works that way she should have told dwight the story one thing hexed her still her last word to him should not have been no the clouds broke and spilled rain the boy looked different the length of her tale matched the breadth of his surveillance that popup face always there i know you

tartan buntingdraped and lit up joan had gotten a second wind and riffed before he left she told him about the blacklist and all the people hoover trashed he memorized their names he wanted to touch her scar and show her the scar on his back he cut east he parked in front of the fallback and walked up the steps the buzzer didnt work he knocked a bunch of times loud the lock was too lame not to

those casinos built in my country joan and i thought we could shape that event to benefit the cause crutch poured coffee i know that part i know about the hex you placed on tattoo and how you wanted to revoke it what concerns me is the specific details of that sum i was wild she was wild we were caught up in large things together i had summoned a curse on her because i believed in those things then we reconnected that summer it was a dangerous time in the world i wanted to hurt tattoo and save her all at once she had made a pornographic film with a voodoo theme a sleazy realtor arranged for screenings of it around the time tattoo disappeared things connected the realtor knew the man who worked for howard hughes it all felt mystical joan humored me and allowed me to rent a house from the man tattoo was crashing in a house nearby joan had told her about the place it stayed vacant for long periods joan and some comrades had used it as a safe house years before convergence confluence coincidence arnie moffett horror house the commie meeting notes a time loop to the realtors name was arnold moffett yes that sounds right he had a vague connection to the caribbean i think he was
