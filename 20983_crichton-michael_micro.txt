michael crichton micro richard preston minute creatures swarm around usobjects of potentially endless study and admiration if we are willing to sweep our vision down from the world lined by the horizon to include the world an arms length away a lifetime can be spent in a magellanic voyage around the trunk of a tree e o wilson introduction what kind of world do we live in in the famous naturalist david attenborough expressed concern that modern schoolchildren could not identify common plants and insects found in nature although previous generations identified them without hesitation modern children it seemed were cut off from the experience of nature and from play in the natural world many factors were held up to blame urban living loss of open space computers and the internet heavy homework schedules but the upshot was that children were no longer being exposed to nature and no longer acquiring a direct experience of nature it was ironic that this should be happening at a time when there was in the west an ever greater concern for the environment and ever more ambitious steps proposed to protect it indoctrinating children in proper environmental thought was a hallmark of the green movement and so children were being instructed to protect something about which they knew nothing at all it did not escape notice that this was exactly the formula that had led to wellintentioned environmental degradation in the pastthe deterioration of american national parks being a prime example and the american policy of forest fire prevention another such policies would never have been instituted if people really understood the environments they were trying to protect the problem was that they thought they did one can argue that the new generation of schoolchildren will emerge even more certain if nothing else school teaches that there is an answer to every question only in the real world do young people discover that many aspects of life are uncertain mysterious and even unknowable if you have a chance to play in nature if you are sprayed by a beetle if the color of a butterfly wing comes off on your fingers if you watch a caterpillar spin its cocoonyou come away with a sense of mystery and uncertainty the more you watch the more mysterious the natural world becomes and the more you realize how little you know along with its beauty you may also come to experience its fecundity its wastefulness aggressiveness ruthlessness parasitism and its violence these qualities are not wellconveyed in textbooks perhaps the single most important lesson to be learned by direct experience is that the natural world with all its elements and interconnections represents a complex system and therefore we cannot understand it and we cannot predict its behavior it is delusional to behave as if we can as it would be delusional to behave as if we could predict the stock market another complex system if someone claims to predict what a stock will do in the coming days we know that person is either a crook or a charlatan if an environmentalist makes similar claims about the environment or an ecosystem we have not yet learned to see him as a false prophet or a fool human beings interact with complex systems very successfully we do it all the time but we do it by managing them not by claiming to understand them managers interact with the system they do something watch for the response and then do something else in an effort to get the result they want there is an endless iterative interaction that acknowledges we dont know for sure what the system will dowe have to wait and see we may have a hunch we know what will happen we may be right much of the time but we are never certain interacting with the natural world we are denied certainty and always will be how then can young people gain experience of the natural world ideally by spending some time in a rain forestthose vast uncomfortable alarming and beautiful environments that so quickly knock our preconceptions aside not finished michael crichton august the seven graduate students rick hutter ethnobotanist studying medicines used by indigenous peoples karen king

studying plant hormones jenny linn biochemist studying pheromones the signaling scents used by animals and plants danny minot doctoral student writing a thesis on scientific linguistic codes and paradigm transformation prologue nanigen october pm west of pearl harbor he drove along the farrington highway past fields of sugar cane dark green in the moonlight this had long been an agricultural region of oahu but recently it had begun to change off to his left he saw the flat steel rooftops of the new kalikimaki industrial park bright silver in the surrounding green in truth marcos rodriguez knew this wasnt much of an industrial park most of the buildings were warehouses inexpensive to rent then there was a marine supply store a guy who made custom surfboards a couple of machine shops a metalworker that was about it and of course the reason for his visit tonight nanigen microtechnologies a new company from the mainland now housed in a large building at the far end of the facility rodriguez turned off the highway drove down between silent buildings it was almost midnight the industrial park was deserted he parked in front of nanigen from the outside the nanigen building appeared like all the others a singlestory steel facade with a corrugated metal roof in effect nothing more than an enormous shed of crude cheap construction rodriguez knew there was more to it than that before the company erected that building they dug a pit deep into the lava rock and had filled it with electronic equipment only then did they erect this unprepossessing facade which was now covered in fine red dust from the nearby agricultural fields rodriguez put on his rubber gloves and slipped into his pocket his digital camera and infrared filter then he got out of his car he wore a security guard uniform he pulled his cap down over his face in case there were cameras monitoring the street he took out the key that he had taken from the nanigen receptionist some weeks before after her third blue hawaii had put her out cold he had had it copied then returned it to her before she woke up from her he had learned that nanigen was forty thousand square feet of labs and hightech facilities where she said they did advanced work in robotics what kind of advanced work she wasnt sure except the robots were extremely small they do some kind of research on chemicals and plants she said vaguely you need robots for that they do yes she shrugged but she also told him the building itself had no security no alarm system no motion detectors no guards cameras laser beams then what do you use he asked her dogs the receptionist shook her head nothing she said just a lock on the front door they say they dont need any security at the time rodriguez suspected strongly that nanigen was a scam or a tax dodge no hightechnology company would house itself in a dusty warehouse far from downtown honolulu and the university from which all hightech companies drew if nanigen was way out here they must have something to hide the client thought so too thats why rodriguez had been hired in the first place truth be told investigating hightech corporations wasnt his usual line of work mostly he got calls from lawyers asking him to photograph visiting husbands on waikiki cheating on their wives and in this case too he had been hired by a local lawyer willy fong but willy wasnt the client and he wouldnt say who was rodriguez had his suspicions nanigen had supposedly spent millions of dollars on electronics from shanghai and osaka some of those suppliers probably wanted to know what was being done with their products is that who it is willy the chinese or the japanese willy fong shrugged you know i cant say marcos but it makes no sense rodriguez had said the place got no security your clients can pick the lock and walk in any night and see for themselves they dont need me you talking yourself out of a job i just want to know what this is about they want you to go and find out whats in that building and bring them some pictures thats all i dont like it i think its a scam probably is willy gave him a tired look as if to say but what do you care at least nobodys going to get up from the dinner table and hit you in the mouth true willy pushed back his chair folded his arms over his ample belly so tell me marcos are you going or what now walking toward the front door at midnight rodriguez felt suddenly nervous they dont need any security what the hell did that mean in this day and age everybody had securitylots of securityespecially around honolulu you had no choice there were no windows on the building just a single metal door next to it a sign nanigen microtechnologies inc and beneath it by appointment only he put the key in the lock and turned it the door clicked open too easy he thought as he glanced back at the empty street and slipped inside night lights illuminated a glasswalled entry area receptionists desk and a waiting area with couches magazines and company literature rodriguez flicked on his flashlight moved to the hallway beyond at the end of the hallway were two doors he went through the first and came into a new hallway with glass walls there were laboratories on both sides long black benches with lots of equipment stacks of bottles on the shelves above every dozen yards there was a humming stainless refrigerator and something that looked like a washing machine cluttered bulletin boards postits on the refrigerator whiteboards with scribbled formulasthe general appearance seemed messy but rodriguez had the overwhelming sense that this company was real that nanigen was actually doing scientific work here what did they need robots for and then he saw the robots but they were damned strange boxy silver metal contraptions with mechanical arms and treads and appendages they looked like what they send to mars they were various sizes and shapes some the size of a shoebox and others much bigger then he noticed that beside each one was a smaller version of the same robot and beside that was a still smaller version eventually they were the size of a thumbnail tiny highly detailed the workbenches had huge magnifying glasses so the workers could see the robots but he wondered how they could build anything so small rodriguez came to the end of the hall and saw a door with a small sign tensor core he pushed it open feeling a cool breeze the room beyond was large and dark to the right he noticed rows of backpacks hanging on hooks on the wall as if for a camping trip otherwise the room was bare there was a loud ac hum but no other sound he noticed the floor was etched with deep grooves in a hexagonal shape or perhaps they were big hexagonal tiles in this low light he couldnt be sure but thenthere was something beneath the floor he realized an enormous complex array of hexagonal tubes and copper wires dimly visible the floor was plastic and he could look through it to see the electronics that had been buried in the ground rodriguez crouched down to look more closely and as he peered at the hexagons below he saw a drop of blood spatter on the floor then another drop rodriguez stared curiously before he thought to put his hand to his forehead he was bleeding just above his right eyebrow what the hed been cut somehow he hadnt felt anything but there was blood on his gloved hand and blood still dripping from his eyebrow he stood the blood was dripping onto his cheek and chin and onto the uniform he put his hand to his forehead and hurried into the nearest lab looking for a kleenex or a cloth he found a box of tissues and stepped to a washbasin with a small mirror over it he dabbed at his face the bleeding had already begun to stop the cut was small but razorsharp he didnt see how it had happened but paper cuts could look like that he glanced at his watch it was twelve twenty time to get back to work in the next moment he saw a red gash open across the back of his hand from his wrist to his knuckles the skin spreading and starting to bleed rodriguez yelled in shock he grabbed more tissues then a towel hanging from the sink he ripped a strip off and wrapped it around his hand then he felt a pain in his leg and looking down saw that his trousers had been sliced halfway up his thigh and he was bleeding from there too rodriguez wasnt thinking anymore he turned and ran staggering down the hallway back toward the front door dragging his injured leg aware he was leaving enough evidence to identify him later but he didnt care he just wanted to get away shortly before one am he pulled up alongside fongs office the light on the second floor was still on rodriguez stumbled up the back stairs he was weak from loss of blood but he was all right he came in through the back door not knocking fong was there with another man rodriguez had never seen before a chinese man in his twenties wearing a black suit smoking a cigarette fong turned what the hell happened to you you look horrible fong got up locked the door came back you get in a fight rodriguez leaned heavily on the desk he was still dripping blood the chinese guy in black stepped back a bit said nothing no i did not get into a fight then what the hell happened i dont know it just happened what you talking fong said angrily you talk stink man what just happened the chinese kid coughed rodriguez looked over and saw a red arc was sliced beneath his chin blood flowed down his white shirt the kid looked shocked he put his hand up to his throat and the blood seeped between his fingers he fell over backward holy crap willy fong said he scurried forward looking at the kid on the floor the kids heels were drumming on the ground he was in spasm did you do that no rodriguez said thats what im telling you this is a fucking mess fong said you have to bring this back to my office did you think about it because cleaning this up is blood sprayed up the left side of fongs face the cut artery in his neck pumped in spurts he threw his hand over the wound but it spurted through his fingers holy crap he said and sagged into his chair he stared at rodriguez how no damned idea rodriguez said he knew what was coming he just had to wait he barely felt the slice at the back of his neck but the dizziness came quickly and he fell over he was lying on his side in a sticky pool of his own blood staring at fongs desk fongs shoes under the desk and he thought bastard never gave me my money and then darkness closed around him the headlines read three dead in bizarre suicide pact it was splashed all over the honolulu staradvertiser sitting at his desk lieutenant dan watanabe tossed the paper aside he looked up at his boss marty kalama im getting calls kalama said kalama had wireframed spectacles and blinked a lot he looked like a teacher not a cop but he was an akamai guy knew what he was doing kalama said i hear theres problems dan with suicide watanabe nodded you bet big problems makes no sense at all if you ask me so whered the papers get it where they get everything watanabe said they made it up fill me in kalama said watanabe didnt have to consult his notes days later the scene remained vivid in his mind willy fong has an office on the second floor of one of those small buildings on puuhui lane off of lillihi street north of the freeway wooden building kind of ratty got four offices in it willys sixty probably you knew him defends duis for locals small stuff always been clean other people in the building complain of a smell coming from willys offices so we go up there and find three deceased males me says dead two to three days cant estimate closer than that airconditioning was off so the room got ripe all three died of knife wounds willy got a cut carotid bled out in his chair across the room is a young chinese guy no id yet he might be a national throat cut both jugulars bled out quick third vic is that portugee with the camera rodriguez the one who photographs guys out cheating with their secretaries thats him kept getting beat up anyway hes there too and hes got cuts all over his bodyface forehead hand legs back of the neck never seen anything like it test cuts watanabe shook his head no examiner says no too the injuries were done to him and done over some period of time maybe an hour we got his blood on the back stairs and his bloody footprints walking up blood in his car parked beside the building so he was already bleeding when he walked in the door then what do you think happened i got no idea watanabe said if this is suicide its three guys without notes and nobody ever heard of that plus no knife and we turned the place upside down looking i can tell you plus it was locked from the inside so nobody could have left windows were closed and locked too we dusted around the windows for prints anyway just in case somebody entered by a window no fresh prints around the windows just a bunch of dirt somebody flush a blade down the toilet kalama asked no dan watanabe answered there wasnt any blood in the bathroom means nobody went in there after the cutting started so we got three dead guys slashed to death in a locked room no motive no weapon no nothing now what that portugee pi came from somewhere he already got cut up somewhere else i figure try to find out where that happened where it started watanabe shrugged he had a gas receipt from kelos mobil in kalepa filled the tank at ten pm we know how much gas he used so we can get a radius of where he could drive from kelos to his destination and then back to willys big radius must cover most of the island were chipping away theres fresh gravel in the tire treads its crushed limestone good chance he went to a new construction site something like that anyway well run it down it may take us a while but well get that location watanabe pushed the paper across the desk and in the meantimeid say the papers got it right triple suicide pact and thats the end of it at least for now chapter divinity avenue cambridge october pm i n the secondfloor biology lab peter jansen twentythree slowly lowered the metal tongs into the glass cage then with a quick jab he pinned the cobra just behind its hood the snake hissed angrily as jansen reached in gripped it firmly behind the head raised it to the milking beaker he swabbed the beaker membrane with alcohol pushed the fangs through and watched as yellowish venom slid down the glass the yield was a disappointing few milliliters jansen really needed a halfdozen cobras in order to collect enough venom to study but there was no room for more animals in the lab there was a reptile facility over in allston but the animals there tended to get sick peter wanted his snakes nearby where he could supervise their condition venom was easily contaminated by bacteria that was the reason for the alcohol swab and for the bed of ice the beaker sat on peters research concerned bioactivity of certain polypeptides in cobra venom his work was part of a vast research interest that included snakes frogs and spiders all of which made neuroactive toxins his experience with snakes had made him an envenomation specialist occasionally called by hospitals to advise on exotic bites this caused a certain amount of envy among other graduate students in the lab as a group they were highly competitive and quick to notice if anyone got attention from the outside world their solution was to complain that it was too dangerous to keep a cobra in the lab and that it really shouldnt be there they referred to peters research as working with nasty herps none of this bothered peter his disposition was cheerful and evenhanded he came from an academic family so he didnt take this backbiting too seriously his parents were no longer alive killed in the crash of a light plane in the mountains of northern california his father had been a professor of geology at uc davis and his mother had taught on the medical faculty in san francisco his older brother was a physicist peter had returned the cobra to the cage just as rick hutter came over hutter was twentyfour an ethnobotanist lately he had been researching analgesics found in the bark of rainforest trees as usual rick was wearing faded jeans a denim shirt and heavy boots he had a trimmed beard and a perpetual frown i notice youre not wearing your gloves he said no peter said ive gotten pretty confident when i did my field work you had to wear gloves he said rick hutter never lost an opportunity to remind others in the lab that he had done actual field work he made it sound as if he had spent years in the remote amazon backwaters in fact he had spent four months doing research in a national park in costa rica one porter in our team didnt wear gloves and reached down to move a rock bam terciopelo sunk its fangs into him ferdelance two meters long they had to amputate his arm he was lucky to survive at all uhhuh peter said hoping rick would get going he liked rick but the guy had a tendency to lecture everybody the person in the lab who really disliked rick hutter was karen king karen a tall young woman with dark hair and angular shoulders was studying spider venom and spiderwebs she overheard rick lecturing peter on snakebite in the jungle and couldnt stand it she had been working at a lab bench and she snapped over her shoulder rickyou stayed in a tourist lodge in costa rica remember bullshit we camped in the rain forest two whole nights karen interrupted him until the mosquitoes drove you back to the lodge rick glared at karen his face turned red and he opened his mouth to say something but didnt because he couldnt reply it was true the mosquitoes had been hellish hed been afraid the mosquitoes might give him malaria or dengue hemorrhagic fever so he had gone back to the lodge instead of arguing with karen king rick turned to peter hey by the way i heard a rumor that your brother is coming today isnt he the one who struck it rich with a startup company thats what he tells me well money isnt everything myself id never work in the private sector its an intellectual desert the best minds stay in universities so they dont have to prostitute themselves peter wasnt about to argue with rick whose opinions on any subject were strongly held but erika moll the entomologist whod recently arrived from munich said i think you are being rigid i wouldnt mind working for a private company at all hutter threw up his hands see prostituting erika had slept with several people in the biology department and didnt seem to care who knew she gave him the finger and said spin on it rick i see youve mastered american slang rick said among other things the other things you wouldnt know she said and you wont she turned to peter anyway i see nothing wrong with a private job but what is this company exactly said a soft voice peter turned and saw amar singh the labs expert in plant hormones amar was known for his distinctly practical turn of mind i mean what does the company do that makes it so valuable and this is a biological company but your brother is a physicist isnt he how does that work at that moment peter heard jenny linn across the lab say wow look at that she was staring out the window at the street below they could hear the rumble of highperformance engines jenny said peter lookis that your brother everyone in the lab had gone to the windows peter saw his brother on the street below beaming like a kid waving up at them eric was standing alongside a bright yellow ferrari convertible his arm around a beautiful blond woman behind them was a second ferrari gleaming black someone said two ferraris thats half a million dollars down there the rumble of the engines echoed off the scientific laboratories that lined divinity avenue a man stepped out of the black ferrari he had a trim build and expensive taste in clothes though his look was decidedly casual thats vin drake karen king said staring out the window how do you know rick hutter said to her standing beside her how do you not know karen replied vincent drake is probably the most successful venture capitalist in boston you ask me its a disgrace rick said those cars should have been outlawed years ago but nobody was listening to him they were all heading for the stairs hurrying down to the street rick said what is the big deal you didnt hear amar said hurrying past rick theyve come here to recruit recruit recruit who anybody doing good work in the fields that were interested in vin drake said to the students clustered around him microbiology entomology chemical ecology ethnobotany phytopathologyin other words all research into the natural world at the micro or nanolevel thats what were after and were hiring now you dont need a phd we dont care about that if youre talented you can do your thesis for us but you will have to move to hawaii because thats where the labs are standing to one side peter embraced his brother eric then said is that true youre already hiring the blond woman answered yes its true she stuck out her hand and introduced herself as alyson bender the cfo of the company alyson bender had a cool handshake with a crisp manner peter thought she wore a fawncolored business suit with a string of natural pearls at her neck we need at least a hundred firstrate researchers by the end of the year she said theyre not easy to find even though we offer what is probably the best research environment in the history of science oh how is that peter said it was a pretty big claim its true his brother said vin will explain peter turned to his brothers car do you mind he couldnt help himself could i get in just for a minute sure go ahead he slipped behind the wheel shut the door the bucket seat was tight enveloping the leather smelled rich the instruments were big and businesslike the steering wheel small with unusual red buttons on it sunlight gleamed off the yellow finish everything felt so luxurious he was a little uneasy he couldnt tell if he liked this feeling or not he shifted in the seat and felt something under his thigh he pulled out a white object that looked like a piece of popcorn and it was light like popcorn too but it was stone he thought the rough edges would scratch the leather he slipped it into his pocket and climbed out one car over rick hutter was glowering at the black ferrari as jenny linn admired it you must realize jenny rick said that this car squandering so many resources is an offense against mother earth really jenny said did she tell you that she ran her fingers along the fender i think its beautiful in a basement room furnished with a formica table and a coffee machine vin drake had seated himself at the table with eric jansen and alyson bender the two nanigen executives placed on either side of him the grad students clustered around some sitting at the table some leaning against the wall youre young scientists starting out vin drake was saying so you have to deal with the reality of how your field operates why for example is there such an emphasis on the cutting edge in science why does everybody want to be there because all the prizes and recognition go to new fields thirty years ago when molecular biology was new there were lots of nobels lots of major discoveries later the discoveries became less fundamental less groundbreaking molecular biology was no longer new by then the best people had moved on to genetics proteomics or to work in specialized areas brain function consciousness cellular differentiation where the problems were immense and still unsolved good strategy not really because the problems remain unsolved turns out it isnt enough that the field is new there must also be new tools galileos telescopea new vision of the universe leeuwenhoeks microscopea new vision of life and so it continues right to the present radio telescopes exploded astronomical knowledge unmanned space probes rewrote our knowledge of the solar system the electron microscope altered cell biology and on and on new tools mean big advances so as young researchers you should be asking yourselveswho has the new tools there was a brief silence okay ill bite someone said who has the new tools we do vin said nanigen microtechnologies our company has tools that will define the limits of discovery for the first half of the twentyfirst century im not kidding im not exaggerating im telling you the simple truth pretty big claim rick hutter said he leaned against the wall arms folded clutching a paper cup of coffee vin drake looked calmly at rick we dont make big claims without a reason so what exactly are your tools rick went on thats proprietary vin said you want to know you sign an nda and come to hawaii to see for yourself well pay your airfare when whenever youre ready tomorrow if you want vin drake was in a hurry he finished the presentation and they all filed out of the basement and went out onto divinity avenue to where the ferraris were parked in the october afternoon the air had a bite and the trees burned with orange and russet colors hawaii might have been a million miles from massachusetts peter noticed eric wasnt listening he had his arm around alyson bender and he was smiling but his thoughts were elsewhere peter said to alyson would you mind if i took a family moment here grabbing his brothers arm he walked him down the street away from the others peter was five years younger than eric he had always admired his brother and coveted the effortless way eric seemed to manage everything from sports to girls to his academic studies eric never strained never seemed to sweat or worry whether it was a playoff game for the lacrosse team or oral exams for his doctorate eric always seemed to know how to play things he was always confident always easy alyson seems nice peter said how long have you been seeing her couple of months eric said yes shes nice somehow he didnt sound enthusiastic is there a but eric shrugged no just a reality alysons got an mba truth is shes all business and she can be tough you knowdaddy wanted a boy well eric shes very pretty for a boy yes shes pretty that tone again feeling around peter said and howre things with vin vincent drake had a somewhat unsavory reputation had been threatened twice with federal indictments he had beaten back prosecutors both times although no one knew quite how drake was regarded as tough smart and unscrupulous but above all successful peter had been surprised when eric first signed on with him vin can raise money like nobody else eric said his presentations are brilliant and he always lands the tuna as they say eric shrugged i accept the downside which is that vin will say whatever he needs to say to get a deal done but lately hes been wellmore careful more presidential so hes the president of the company alysons the cfo and youre vice president in charge of technology eric said is that okay its perfect i want to be in charge of the technology he smiled and to drive a ferrari what about those ferraris peter said as they approached the cars whatre you going to do with them well drive them down the east coast eric said stop at major university biology labs along the way and do this little songanddance to drum up candidates and then turn in the cars in baltimore turn them in theyre rented eric said just a way to get attention peter looked back at the crowd around the cars works yes we figured so you really are hiring now we really are again peter detected a lack of enthusiasm in his brothers voice then whats wrong bro nothing come on eric really nothing the company is underway were making great progress the technology is amazing nothings wrong peter said nothing they walked in silence for a moment eric stuck his hands in his pockets everythings fine really okay it is i believe you they came to the end of the street turned headed back toward the group clustered around the cars so eric said tell me which one of those girls in your lab are you seeing me none then who nobody at the moment peter said his voice sinking eric had always had lots of girls but peters love life was erratic and unsatisfactory there had been a girl in anthropology she worked down the street at the peabody museum but that ended when she started going out with a visiting professor from london that asian woman is cute eric said jenny yes very cute she plays on the other team ah too bad eric nodded and the blonde erika moll peter said from munich not interested in an exclusive relationship still forget it eric but if you i already did okay whos the tall darkhaired woman thats karen king peter said arachnologist studying spider web formation but she worked on the textbook living systems kind of wont let anybody forget it a little stuckup just a little she looks very buff eric remarked still staring at karen king shes a fitness nut martial arts gym they were coming back to the group alyson waved to eric you about ready honey eric said he was he embraced peter shook his hand where now bro peter said down the road we have an appointment at mit then well do bu later in the afternoon and start driving he punched peter on the shoulder dont be a stranger come and see me i will peter said and bring your group with you i promise youall of youyou wont be disappointed chapter biosciences building october pm returning to the lab they experienced that familiar environment as suddenly mundane oldfashioned it felt crowded too the tensions in the lab had been simmering for a long time rick hutter and karen king had despised each other from the day they had arrived erika moll had brought trouble to the group with her choice of lovers and like so many grad students everywhere they were rivals and they were tired of the work it seemed they all felt that way and there was a long silence as they each returned to their lab benches and resumed work in a desultory way peter took his milking beaker off the ice block labeled it and put it on his shelf of the refrigerator he noticed something rattling around with the change in his pocket and idly he took the object out it was the little thing hed found in his brothers rented ferrari he flicked it across the bench surface it spun amar singh the plant biologist was watching whats that oh it broke off my brothers car some part i thought it would scratch the leather could i see sure it was a little larger than his thumbnail here peter said without looking at it closely amar put it in the flat palm of his hand and squinted at it this doesnt look like a car part to me no no id say its an airplane peter stared it was so small he couldnt really make out details but now that he looked closely it did indeed appear to be a tiny airplane like something from a model kit the kind of kits hed made as a boy maybe a fighter jet to glue onto an aircraft carrier but if so it was like no fighter jet he had ever seen this one had a blunted nose an open seat no canopy and a boxy rear with tiny stubby flanges no real wings to speak of do you mind amar was already heading for the big magnifying glass by his workbench he put the object under the glass and turned it carefully this is quite fantastic he said peter pushed his head in to look under magnification the airplaneor whatever it wasappeared exquisitely beautiful rich with detail the cockpit had amazingly intricate controls so minute it was hard to imagine how they had been carved amar was thinking the same thing perhaps laser lithography he said the same way they do computer chips but is it an airplane i doubt it no method of propulsion i dont know maybe its just some kind of model a model peter said perhaps you should ask your brother amar said drifting back to his workbench peter reached eric on his cell phone he heard loud voices in the background where are you peter said memorial drive they love us at mit they understand what were talking about peter described the small object he had found you really shouldnt have that eric said its proprietary but what is it actually its a test his brother said one of the first tests of our robotic technology its a robot it looks like it has a cockpit with a little chair and instruments like someone would sit there no no what youre seeing is the slot to hold the micropowerpack and control package so we can run it remotely im telling you peter its a bot one of the first proofs of concept of our ability to miniaturize beyond anything previously known i was going to show it to you if we had time butlisten id prefer you keep that little device to yourself at least for now sure okay no point in telling him about amar bring it with you when you come to visit us eric said in hawaii the head of the lab ray hough came in and spent the rest of the day in his office reviewing papers by general agreement it was considered poor form for the graduate students to discuss other jobs while professor hough was present so around four oclock they all met at lucys deli on mass ave as they crowded around a couple of small tables a lively discussion ensued rick hutter continued to argue that the university was the only place where one could engage in ethical research but nobody really listened to him they were more concerned with the claims that vin drake had made he was good jenny linn said but it was a sales pitch yes amar singh said but at least one part of it was true hes right that discoveries do follow new tools if those guys have the equivalent of a new kind of microscope or a new pcrtype technique then theyre going to make a lot of discoveries quickly but could it really be the best research environment in the world jenny linn said we can see for ourselves erika moll said they said theyd pay airfare hows hawaii this time of year jenny said i cant believe you guys are buying into this rick said its always good karen king said i did my tae kwon do training in kona wonderful karen was a martial arts devotee and had already changed into a sweat suit for her evening workout i overheard the cfo say theyre hiring a hundred people before the end of the year erika moll said trying to steer the conversation away from karen and rick is that supposed to scare us or entice us or both amar singh said do we have any idea what this new technology is they claim to have erika said do you know peter from a career standpoint rick hutter said youd be very foolish not to get your phd first i have no idea peter said he glanced at amar who said nothing just nodded silently frankly im curious to see their facility jenny said so am i amar said i looked at their website karen king said nanigen microtech it says they make specialized robots at the micro and nanoscale thats millimeters down to thousandths of a millimeter they have drawings of robots that look like theyre about four or five millimeters longmaybe a quarter of an inch and then some that are half that maybe two millimeters the robots seem very detailed no explanation how they could be made amar was staring at peter peter said nothing your brother hasnt talked to you about this peter jenny asked no this has been his secret well karen king continued i dont know what they mean by nanoscale robots that would be less than the thickness of a human hair nobody can fabricate at those dimensions youd have to be able to construct a robot atom by atom and nobody can do that but they say they can rick said its corporate bullshit those cars arent bullshit those cars are rented i have to get to class karen king said standing up from the table ill tell you one thing though nanigen has kept a very low profile but there are a few brief references in some business sites going back about a year they got close to a billion dollars in funding from a consortium put together by davros venture capital a billion yeah and that consortium is primarily composed of international drug companies drug companies jenny linn frowned why would they be interested in microbots the plot thickens rick said big pharma behind the curtain maybe they expect new delivery systems amar said nah they have that already with nanospheres they dont need to spend a billion dollars on that they must be expecting new drugs but how erika shook her head puzzled theres more karen king said from the business websites not long after they got the funding nanigen was challenged by another microrobotic company in palo alto saying nanigen had made false representations to raise money and they didnt really have the technology they said they did this other company was also developing microscopic robots uhhuh what happened the threatened lawsuit was withdrawn the palo alto company declared bankruptcy and that was the end except the head of their company was quoted as saying nanigen did have the technology after all so you think this is real rick said i think im late for class karen said i think its real jenny linn said and im going to hawaii to see for myself i am too amar said i dont believe this rick hutter said peter walked down mass avenue with karen king toward central square it was late afternoon but the sun still felt warm karen carried her gym bag in one hand keeping the other hand free rick gives me a pain she said he acts like hes being ethical when hes really just lazy how do you mean staying in the university is safe karen said a nice life comfortable and safe except he wont admit that do me a favor she added and walk on the other side of me okay peter moved to karens left side why so my hand is free peter looked at her right hand she held her car keys in her fist the key shaft protruding from between her knuckles like a knife blade hanging from the key chain was a canister of pepper spray close to her wrist peter couldnt help smiling you think were at risk here the world is a dangerous place mass ave at five in the afternoon they were in the heart of cambridge colleges dont report the actual number of rapes in their communities karen said its bad publicity wealthy alumni wont send their daughters he kept looking at her clenched fist the key poking out what will you do with the keys youre holding that way straight hit to the windpipe instant crippling pain maybe puncture the trachea if that doesnt take him down spray full in the face closerange kick down hard on the kneecap break it if you can by then hes down and hes not going anywhere she was serious almost grim peter suppressed an urge to laugh the street before them was familiar mundane people were getting off work heading home for dinner they passed a harriedlooking professor in a wrinkled corduroy jacket clutching a stack of blue exam papers followed by a little old lady with a walker a group of joggers up ahead karen reached into her purse pulled out a small folded knife flipped open the thick serrated blade got my spyderco knife i can gut a bastard if it comes to that she glanced up saw his expression you think im ridiculous dont you no he said its justyoud really gut someone with a knife listen she said my halfsister is a lawyer in baltimore shes walking to her car in the garage two oclock in the afternoon and shes attacked by some guy knocked down hits the concrete loses consciousness beaten and raped when she comes to she has retrograde amnesia she cant remember anything about the attacker how it happened what he looks like nothing one day in the hospital and they send her home so theres a guy in the firm a partner he has scratches on his throat and she thinks maybe its him some guy in her own firm followed her out and raped her but she doesnt remember she cant be sure and shes just so uncomfortable eventually she leaves the firm moves to dc has to start again at a lowerpaying job karen held up her fist all because she didnt carry her keys like this she was too nice to protect herself bullshit peter was trying to imagine whether karen king would really stab someone with the key or gut them with a knife he had the uneasy feeling that she would in a university setting where so many people just talked it seemed she was ready for action they came to the storefront martial arts studio the windows papered over he could hear shouts in unison from inside well this is my class she said ill see you later but listen if you talk to your brother ask him why drug companies put up so much money for microbotics okay im curious and she went through the swinging door into the class peter returned to the lab that evening he had to feed the cobra every three days and he usually did it at night since cobras were by nature nocturnal it was eight pm and the lab lights were low when he lowered a squirming white rat into the cage and slid the glass shut the rat scampered to the far side of the cage and froze only its nose twitched slowly the snake turned uncoiled and faced the rat i hate to see that rick hutter said he had come up behind peter why so cruel everybodys got to eat rick the cobra struck burying its fangs deep in the rats body the rat shivered stayed on its feet then collapsed thats why im a vegetarian rick said you dont think plants have feelings peter said dont start rick said you and jenny jens research involved communication among plants and insects via pheromones chemicals released by organisms to trigger responses the field had made enormous advances over the last twenty years jenny insisted that plants had to be seen as active intelligent creatures little different from animals and jenny enjoyed annoying rick its ridiculous rick said to peter peas and beans dont have feelings of course not peter answered with a smile its because youve already killed the plantheartlessly dispatched it for your own selfish meal you just pretend the plant didnt scream in agony when you killed it because you dont want to face the consequences of your coldblooded plant murder absurd speciesism peter said and you know it he was smiling but there was truth to what he was saying peter was surprised to see that erika was in the lab and so was jenny few of the graduate students worked at night what was going on erika moll stood at a dissecting board carefully cutting open a black beetle erika was a coleopterist meaning an entomologist with a special interest in beetles as she said that was a conversationstopper at cocktail parties what do you do i study beetles but in fact beetles were very important to the ecosystem a quarter of all known species were beetles years ago a reporter had asked the famed biologist j b s haldane what could be deduced about the creator from the creation and haldane had answered he has an inordinate fondness for beetles what have you got there peter said to erika this is a bombardier beetle she said one of the australian pheropsophus that sprays so effectively as she spoke she returned to her dissection shifting her body so she was touching his it seemed to be an accidental contact she gave no indication that she had even noticed but she was a notorious flirt whats special about this bombardier peter said bombardier beetles got their name from their ability to fire a hot noxious spray in any direction from a rotating turret at the tip of their abdomen the spray was sufficiently unpleasant that it stopped toads and birds from eating them and it was toxic enough to kill smaller insects immediately how bombardier beetles accomplished this had been studied since the early s and by now the mechanism was well understood the beetles produce boilinghot benzoquinone spray she explained which they make from precursors stored in the body they have two sacs in the rear of the abdomenim cutting them open now there you see them the first sac contains the precursor hydroquinone along with the oxidant hydrogen peroxide the second sac is a rigid chamber and contains enzymes catalases and peroxidases when the beetle is attacked it muscularly squeezes the contents of the first sac into the second where all the ingredients combine to produce an explosive blast of benzoquinone spray and this particular beetle it adds something more to its armamentarium she said it also produces a ketone tridecanone the ketone has repellent properties but it also acts as a surfactant a wetting agent that accelerates the spread of the benzoquinone i want to know where the ketone is made she rested her hand lightly on his arm for a moment peter said you dont think the beetle makes it not necessarily no it might have taken on bacteria and let the bacteria make the ketone for it that was a fairly common event in nature making chemicals for defense consumed energy and if an animal could incorporate bacteria to do the work on its behalf so much the better this ketone is found elsewhere peter said that would suggest it was of external bacterial origin in several caterpillars yes by the way he said why are you working so late we all are because i dont want to fall behind she said and i assume ill be gone next week in hawaii jenny linn held a stopwatch while she watched a complex apparatus leafy plants under one large flask were being eaten by caterpillars while an air hose connected the first flask to three more flasks each with more plants but no caterpillars a small pump controlled air flow among the flasks we already know the basic situation she said there are known species of plants in the world and species of insects and many of them eat plants why havent all the plants vanished chewed down to the ground because all plants long ago evolved defenses against insects that attack them animals can run away from predators but plants cant so they have evolved chemical warfare plants produce their own pesticides or they generate toxins to make their leaves taste bad or they release volatile chemicals that attract the insects predators and sometimes they release chemicals that signal other plants to make their leaves more toxic less edible interplant communications thats what we are measuring here the caterpillars eating the plants in the first flask caused the release of a chemical a plant hormone that would be carried to the other flasks the other plants would increase their production of nicotinic acid im looking to measure the rate of response she said thats why i have three flasks ill be cutting leaves from various places to measure nicotinic acid levels in them but as soon as i cut a leaf from the next plant that plant will act like its under attack and it will release more volatiles right so the flasks are kept separate we know the response is relatively rapid a matter of minutes she pointed to a box to one side i measure the volatiles with ultra highspeed gas chromatography and the leaf extraction is straightforward she glanced at her stopwatch and now if youll excuse me she lifted the first flask and began cutting leaves from base upward setting each aside in careful order hey hey hey what is going on here danny minot entered the lab waving his hands redfaced and rotund he was dressed in a tweed sport coat with elbow patches a rep tie and baggy slacks and looked for all the world like an establishment english professor which was not far wrong minot was getting a doctorate in science studies a melange of psychology and sociology with liberal doses of french postmodernism thrown in he had degrees in biochemistry and comparative literature but the comparative literature had won out he quoted bruno latour jacques derrida michel foucault and others who believed that there was no objective truth only the truth thats established by power minot was here in the lab to complete a thesis on scientific linguistic codes and paradigm transformation in practice it meant he made a pest of himself bothering people recording conversations with the other grad students as they did their work they all despised him there were frequent discussions about why ray hough had let him in the lab in the first place finally somebody asked ray about it and he said hes my wifes cousin and nobody else would take him come on people minot said nobody works this late in this lab and here you all are waving his hands again jenny snorted disdainfully handwaver i heard that minot said meaning what jenny turned her back on him meaning what dont turn your back on me peter went over to danny a handwaver he said is somebody who hasnt worked out his ideas and cant defend them so when he presents at a colloquium and he comes to the parts he hasnt worked out he starts waving his hands and talking fast like the way someone waves their hands and says et cetera et cetera in science handwaving means you dont have the goods not what i am doing here minot said waving his hand the semiotics are completely garbled uhhuh but as derrida said technotranslation is so difficult i am attempting to indicate all of you in a gestural mode of inclusiveness whats going on dont tell him rick said or hell want to come of course i want to come minot said i am the chronicler of life in this lab i must come where are you going peter briefly told him the entire story oh yes i am definitely coming the intersection of science and commerce the corruption of golden youth oh definitelyill be there peter was getting a cup of coffee from the machine in the corner of the lab when erika walked over what are you doing later i dont know why i thought maybe i could stop by tonight she was staring right at him something about the directness of her manner put him off i dont know erika he said i might be working here late thinking i havent seen you for three weeks since the last time im almost finished myself she said and its only nine oclock i dont know well see it doesnt appeal to you my offer she was still staring at him scanning his face i thought you were seeing amar i like amar very much he is very intelligent i like you too i always have maybe well talk later he said pouring milk in his coffee and moving away so quickly that it spilled a little i hope so she said trouble with your coffee rick hutter said glancing up at peter and grinning under a halogen lamp rick was holding a rat upside down measuring its swollen rear paw with a small caliper no peter said i was just uh surprised at how hot it was uhhuh id say surprisingly hot is that a carageenen prep peter said changing the subject carageenen was the usual method to produce edema in the paw of a lab animal it was a standardized animal model for edema employed in labs around the world to study inflammation correct rick said i injected carageenen making the paw swollen then i wrapped the foot in an extract from the bark of himatanthus sucuuba a mediumsize rainforest tree and now we arehopefullydemonstrating its antiinflammatory properties i already demonstrated it for the trees latex himatanthus is an extremely versatile tree it heals wounds and cures ulcers the shamans in costa rica say this tree also has antibiotic antifever anticancer and antiparasite qualities but i havent tested those claims yet certainly the bark extract has reduced this rats swelling remarkably fast you determined what chemicals are responsible for the antiinflammatory response researchers in brazil attribute it to alphaamyrin cinnamate and other cinnamate compounds but i havent verified that yet rick finished measuring the rat set it down in the cage and typed in a measurement and time in his laptop tell you one thing though extracts from the tree appear to be completely nontoxic one day you might even be able to give this to pregnant women huh look at that he pointed to the rat as it moved around the cage its not limping at all anymore peter slapped him on the back better be careful he said or youll have some pharmaceutical company beating you to your results hey im not worried if those guys were really in the business of developing drugs theyd already be working on this tree rick said but why should they take the risk let the american taxpayer fund the research let some graduate student spend months to make the discovery and then they swoop in and buy it up from the university and then they sell our discovery back to us at full price sweet deal huh he was starting to wind up for one of his tirades i tell you these goddamned pharma rick peter said ive got to go oh sure yeah nobody wants to hear it i know i have to spin down my naja venom no problem rick hesitated glanced over his shoulder at erika listen its none of my business thats right its not but i hate to see a good guy like you fall into the clutches of somebody who iswellanyway you met my friend jorge who does computer science at mit if you want to know whats really going on with erika call this number he handed peter a cardand jorge will access her phone records including voice and text messages and you can find out the truth about her uh promiscuous ways is that legal no but its damn useful thanks anyway peter said but no no keep it rick insisted i wont use it you never know rick said phone records dont lie okay it was easier to keep the card than argue he slipped it in his pocket by the way rick said about your brother what about him you think hes on the level about his company yeah nanigen i think so peter said but to be honest i dont know a lot about it he didnt tell you hes been pretty secretive about the whole thing but you think its innovative yes i think its innovative peter thought peering through the scanning microscope he was looking again at the white pebble or microbot or whatever the thing was trying to account for his brothers explanation that it wasnt a cockpit but just a slot for a micropowerpack or a control unit it didnt look like a slot for anything it looked like a seat facing a tiny highly detailed control panel he was still puzzling over this when he became aware that the lab around him had become absolutely silent he looked up and saw that the microscope was also displaying on a large flatpanel screen mounted on the wall everybody in the lab was staring at it what the hell is that rick said i dont know peter flicked off the monitor and were not going to find out unless we go to hawaii chapter maple avenue cambridge october am one by one all seven of the graduate students decided to take vin drake up on his offer they collected data they wrote out descriptions of their research and they sent letters and information to alyson bender at nanigen one by one they were informed that nanigen would fly them to hawaii and for simplicity they would travel as a group as october ran to its end their days were devoted to preparations for departure all seven had a lot to dofinishing experiments getting their research projects in shape to leave them for a while and of course packing they planned to leave early on a sunday morning out of bostons logan airport with a connection through dallas arriving in honolulu that same afternoon they would by general agreement stay four days returning toward the end of the week early on a gray cold saturday morning the day before the flight peter jansen was in his apartment working at his computer erika moll was there too cooking bacon and eggs and singing take a chance on me peter abruptly realized that he had forgotten to turn on his phone that morninghed turned it off the night before when erika had unexpectedly shown up he turned on the phone and placed it on his desk a minute later the phone buzzed it was a text message from his brother eric he stared at the message was this a joke had something happened he typed back he watched the screen but there was no answer after a few minutes he dialed erics number in hawaii but got his voice mail eric its peter whats up call me from the kitchen erika said who are you talking to nobody just trying to get my brother he scrolled to the message from his brother it had come in at pm so it had arrived last night which had been afternoon in hawaii peter dialed his brother again but again got voice mail he hung up breakfast is almost ready erika said he brought the phone to the table set it beside his plate erika wrinkled her nose she didnt like phones at meals she was scooping eggs onto his plate saying i followed my grandmothers recipe with milk and flour the phone rang he grabbed it hello peter a womans voice peter jansen yes speaking its alyson bender she said from nanigen he had an image of the blond woman with her arm around erics waist listen she said how soon can you get over here to hawaii were scheduled to fly tomorrow he said can you come today i dont know i its important well i can check the flights actually i took the liberty of booking you on one that leaves in two hours can you make it yes i thinkwhats this about im afraid i have some disturbing news peter she paused its about your brother what about him hes missing missing he felt dazed he didnt understand what do you mean missing since yesterday alyson said there was a boating accident i dont know if he told you that he bought a boat a boston whaler anyway he did and he was out yesterday on the north side of the island and he had mechanical difficultiesthere was big surf crashing against the cliffs the engines lost power the boat drifted in peter felt lightheaded he pushed the plate of eggs away erika was watching him her face pale how do you know this he said there were people on the cliffs they saw the whole thing and what happened to eric he tried to start the engines he couldnt the surf was high the boat was going to be smashed on the cliffs he dived into the ocean and swamfor shore but the currentshe never made it to shore she took a breath im very sorry peter erics a good swimmer peter said strong swimmer i know and thats why we continue to hope hell return she said but uh the police have told us that wellthe police would like to talk to you and go over everything with you as soon as you get here im leaving now he said and hung up erika had gone to the bedroom and brought his bag already packed for the following day wed better go she said if youre going to make that flight she put her arm around his shoulder and they headed downstairs to the car chapter makapuu point oahu october pm i t was said to be a tourist spot makapuu point high cliffs on the northeastern tip of oahu with a spectacular view of the ocean in all directions but once there peter was not prepared for the barren desolation of the place a harsh wind whipped the scrubby green brush at his feet and tugged at his clothes forcing him to lean forward as he walked he had to speak loudly is it always like this the policeman beside him dan watanabe said no sometimes its very pleasant but the trades kicked up last night watanabe wore raybans he pointed to a lighthouse off to the right thats makapuu lighthouse he said automated years ago nobody lives there anymore directly ahead they looked down the black lava cliffs at surging ocean two hundred feet below the surf boomed smashing against the rocks peter said is this where it happened yes watanabe said the boat ran aground over there he pointed to the leftbut the coast guard got it off the rocks this morning before it broke up in the surf so his boat was somewhere offshore when it got into trouble peter looked out at the ocean which was rough high swells and whitecaps yes he was drifting in the water for a while witnesses said trying to start the engine yes and drifting toward the surf and what was the mechanical difficulty peter said i understand it was a new boat yes couple of weeks old my brother was experienced with boats peter said my family always had a boat on long island sound we were out there every summer these waters are different watanabe said youre looking at deep ocean he pointed nearest land out there is three thousand miles away the mainland but thats not the point its pretty clear what got your brother in trouble was ethanol ethanol peter said state of hawaii puts ten percent ethanol into all the gas thats sold here but the ethanol screws up small engines theres cutrate gas dealers who put way too much ethanol in their gasup to thirty percent it clogs fuel lines and anything rubber or neoprene can turn to gunk its caused a hell of a mess on boats people have to put in new steel fuel tanks and lines anyway we think thats what happened to your brother the carburetors were clogged the fuel pump might have failed whatever it was exactly he couldnt restart the engines in time peter was staring down at the water below greenish nearest the shore then farther out deep blue with whitecaps blown by wind how are the currents here he said depends watanabe said a good swimmer can manage on most days the problem is finding a place to get out of the water without getting cut up on lava ordinarily youd swim west try to make it to makapuu beach over there he pointed to a sandy strip half a mile away my brother was a strong swimmer peter said so i heard but the witnesses said they couldnt see him after he dived in the water there was big surf that day and he disappeared into the foam they lost sight of him right away how many people saw him two there was a couple picnicking right by the edge of the cliff there were some hikers too and some other people but we havent been able to locate them what do you say we get out of this wind he started back up the hill peter followed i think that finishes our work here watanabe said unless of course you want to see the video what video the picnicking couple shot some video once they realized the boat was in trouble they recorded about fifteen minutes of tape including the jump from the boat i didnt know if you wanted to see that or not i want to see it peter said they were on the second floor of the police station looking at a tiny screen on a video camera it was noisy in the station and busy and peter had difficulty focusing on the screen the first images showed a man of about thirty sitting on the green grassy hillside eating a sandwich then a woman of roughly the same age drinking a coke and laughing waving the camera away thats the couple watanabe said grace and bobby choy first part is them horsing around goes about six minutes he pushed the fastforward button then paused the video and said its timestamped the stamp in the screen showed the time was pm now here you see bobby pointing offshorehes spotted the boat in trouble the camera panned to show the ocean the white hull of the boston whaler bobbing against the blue horizon the boat was still a hundred yards offshore too distant for him to make out his brother the camera panned back to bobby choy who now was looking through binoculars when peter next saw the boat it was much closer to the shore now he could make out the figure of his brother bent over intermittently appearing then disappearing again i think he was trying to clear the clogged lines watanabe said thats what it looks like yes peter said the camera now showed grace choy shaking her head trying to place a cell phone call then it panned back to the boat closer now to the white surf then back to grace choy shaking her head as she talked on the phone you dont have good cellular reception up there watanabe said she called but couldnt get through for a while the call kept breaking up if shed gotten they wouldve called the coast guard right away the camera work was jerky but peter saw something thathold it what pause it pause it peter said quickly as the image froze he pointed to the screen whos that in the background the screen showed a woman dressed in white standing on the hill a few yards above the choys the woman stared intently offshore and seemed to be pointing at the boat thats one of the other witnesses watanabe said there were three joggers as well we havent been able to identify any of them yet but i doubt they would give us more information than we already have peter said does that woman have something in her hand i think shes just pointing at the boat i dont know peter said i think she has something in her hand watanabe said ill get the av evidence guys to look at it you might be right what does this woman do next peter said the tape started again she leaves right away watanabe said goes up the hill and out of sight you see there she goes now shes hurrying looks like maybe shes going for help but nobody ever saw her again and there were no more calls logged to moments later on the tape eric jumped from the boston whaler into the roiling surf it was difficult to be sure but he appeared to be about thirty yards offshore at the time he didnt dive but rather jumped feetfirst vanishing into white foam peter watched closely to see if he emerged but he did not seem to and eric had done something jarring even disturbing he had not put on a life jacket before he jumped eric knew enough to put on a life jacket in an emergency my brother wasnt wearing a life jacket peter remarked i noticed watanabe commented maybe he forgot to bring it on the boat it happensyou know did he send out a mayday call on the radio peter asked the police officer erics boat had certainly been equipped with a vhf marine radio eric as an experienced boater would have sent out a distress call on channel the channel always monitored by the coast guard coast guard didnt hear anything that was very strange no life jacket no distress call had erics radio broken down peter continued to stare at the heave and pulse of the blank ocean in the videoan ocean that showed no trace of his brother after another minute he said turn it off watanabe stopped the camera he was lost in the boneyard the what the boneyard its that churning wash after the waves break where all the foam slick is boiling he may have hit rocks in the boneyard there are some outcrops that are only five six feet below the surface we just dont know he paused do you want to see any of it again no peter said ive seen enough watanabe flipped the screen shut turned the camera off that woman on the hill he said casually do you know who she is me no she could be anybody i wonderedyou had such a strong reaction no sorry i was just surprised byit was like she just suddenly appeared thats all no idea who she is watanabe was very still youd tell me if you knew he said sure of course yes well thanks for your time watanabe gave him his card ill get one of the detectives to drop you at your hotel peter said little on the drive back he wasnt inclined to talk and the detective didnt press him it was true the images of his brother vanishing in the surf were disturbing but not as disturbing as the woman on the hill the woman in white pointing at the boat with some object in her hand because that woman was alyson bender the cfo of nanigen and her presence at the scene changed everything chapter waikiki october pm i n his hotel room peter jansen lay down on top of the bed experiencing a sense of unreality he didnt know what to do next why hadnt he told watanabe who alyson bender was he felt exhausted but couldnt rest the video kept running through his mind he saw alyson holding something in her hand in the video while watching erics death as if it meant nothing to her and then she had hurried away why he began thinking about something rick hutter had said to him about erika moll how to check up on somebody he took out his wallet and began going through it pulling out cards money there it wasthe card rick had given him back in the lab more than a week ago it had rick hutters handwriting on it just the word jorge and a number the guy who could access telephone records the mit phone hacker it was a massachusetts area code he called the number it rang for a while and rang some more there was no voice mail so peter just let it ring finally it was answered sort of with a grunt yuh jansen identified himself and explained what he wanted im a friend of rick hutter can you get me a list of recent calls to and from a certain phone number yuh why rick told me you could do it ill pay whatever you ask money doesnt work i only do something if itsintriguing a faint latino accent a soft voice peter explained the situation a woman may be involved in my brothersmy brothersdeath death it was the first time hed used the word in connection with eric there was quite a long pause listeni have the phone number that the woman used to call me can you find out who else she talked to on that phone im assuming its her phone he read out alysons number there was an emptiness on the line a silence that extended peter held his breath finally jorge said give me pausea couple of hours peter lay back on the bed his heart pounding he could hear traffic going past on kalakaua avenue for his room faced mauka inland across the city and toward the mountains the day lengthened the sun began to go down the room filled with shadows maybe eric had reached shore maybe he was suffering from amnesia and would turn up in some hospital maybe there had been some terrible mistakepeter had to hope had to believe that maybe eric would turn up somehow somewherethere was always a faint chance or had eric beenmurdered finally he couldnt stand being in his room any longer and he went outside he sat on the beach in front of his hotel watching the red streaks of the setting sun darken to black over the ocean why hadnt he told the police officer that he recognized her in the video it had been a kind of instinct to say nothing but why what had made him do it when he and eric had been younger they had looked out for each other eric had covered for him he had covered for eric there you are he turned to see alyson bender approaching in the evening light she wore a blue hawaiian print dress and sandals looking quite different than she had in cambridge when shed worn a business suit and pearls here she looked like an innocent young girl why didnt you call me i thought you were going to call me right after you were done with the police how did it go it went okay peter said they took me to that pointmakapuu pointand showed me where it happened uhhuh and is there any news i mean about eric they still havent found him or the body and the boat what about it did the police check the boat oh i dont know he shrugged they didnt say she sat on the sand beside him put her hand on his shoulder her hand was warm im so sorry you had to go through that peter it must have been awful for you it was difficult the police had a videotape videotape really did you see it yes and was it helpful had she really not seen the video camera in the hands of the couple seated just below her on the hillside was it possible she was only looking at the boat her eyes scanned his face in the twilight he said i saw eric jumpbut he never came up how awful she said softly her hand moved to squeeze his shoulder rub it he wanted to tell her to stop but he didnt trust himself to speak the whole thing was incredibly creepy and what do the police think she said about what about what happened i mean on the boat they think it was a clogged his cell phone rang he fished it out of his shirt pocket flipped it open hello this is jorge one moment he stood said to alyson excuse me a moment i have to take this he walked some distance down the beach stars were starting to come out in the darkening sky above go ahead jorge i have the information you want for the phone number you gave me the number is registered to the nanigen microtechnologies corporation of honolulu attached to the number is the employee name alyson f bender he looked back along the beach alyson was a dark shape on the sand go on he said at three fortyseven pm yesterday afternoon local time she called the number three times in a row whose number is that its an unassigned number for one of those junk phones you can buy and use until the prepayment runs out she called three times yes but very brieflythree seconds then two seconds then three seconds okaymeaning she didnt think she was getting through no she clearly got through no answering message it went right to the beep she knew she connected two possibilities either she kept calling because she was expecting the person to pick up or she was triggering a device of some kind a device yup you wire a cell phone to set off some device when theres an incoming call okay so three calls in a row what then at three fiftyfive she called another number at nanigen assigned employee name vincent a drake you want to hear that call sure ringing then the click of a pickup vin yes alyson breathless its me vin yes alyson listen im worried i dont know if it worked or not there should have been smoke or something vin excuse me alyson but im worried vin let me stop you there alyson you dont understand vin yes i do understand now listen you are on the phone i need you to speakmore exactly alyson oh vin you understand what i am saying alyson pause yes vin okay now where is the object alyson pause not available vanished vin okay then i dont see a problem alyson i am still worried vin but the object did not reappear alyson no vin then i suggest there is no problem we can discuss this further in person but not now are you coming back now alyson yes vin all right see you soon click jorge said there are two other calls want to hear them maybe later okay ive emailed them to you as wav files you should be able to listen to them on your computer thanks peter looked back at alyson and shivered can i take this to the police no way in hell jorge said you need a court order to access this stuff you take it to them you ruin any chance of prosecution illegal search and seizure alsoyoull uh put me in a jam then what should i do hmyuh jorge grunted i dont knowget them to confess how sorry cant help you there jorge said but if you need more phone records call any time and he hung up peter walked back to alyson feeling a cold sweat on his body it was getting dark now her expression impossible to read she sat very still on the sand he heard her say is everything all right yes fine in fact peter felt as if he was drowning overwhelmed by onrushing events all his life he had been a student and until now he felt his life experiences had given him a cleareven cynicalsense of his fellow human beings and what they were capable of over the years hed had to deal with cheating students students dispensing sexual favors in exchange for grades students falsifying their results and with professors who appropriated student work in one bizarre instance thered been a thesis advisor on heroin he felt at the age of twentythree like a man who had seen it all not anymore the idea of murder that someone would with calculation try to kill his brother left him shaken and sweating and cold he didnt trust himself to speak to this woman who was supposed to be his brothers girlfriend but who had evidently plotted against him no tears from this girlfriendshe didnt seem upset at all she said youre awfully quiet peter its been a long day buy you a drink no thanks mai tais are famous here i think i better call it a night have you had dinner not hungry she got up from the sand brushed herself off i know you must be upset i am too yes why so cold toward me im just trying to im sorry he said quickly he didnt want her to suspect anything that would be unwise even dangerous its all been such a shock she put her hand up touched his cheek call me if i can do anything thanks okay they walked back inside the hotel all your friends are arriving tomorrow she said theyre upset about what happened to eric but the tour of the facilities is all arranged do you want to go on it absolutely he said i cant just sit aroundfeeling like this waiting the tour will start at the waipaka arboretum in manoa valley in the mountains near here she said thats where we get a lot of our rainforest materials for research four oclock tomorrow should i pick you up thats not necessary peter said ill take a cab he somehow managed to give her a kiss on the cheek thanks for coming by alyson it means a lot i just want to help she looked at him doubtfully and you are helping he said believe me you are unable to sleep unable to eat tormented by jorges information peter jansen stood at the balcony of his room the view looked away from the ocean across the city and up into a jumble of mountain peaks wild and black without lights outlined only by stars in the night sky alyson bender had made three brief calls to a phone number the time of these calls pm stuck in his mind late afternoon he remembered that the video shot by the couple had been timestamped he tried to recall the time stamp he had a head for numbers he used numbers constantly in his data sets the time stamp rose in his minds eye something just three minutes after alyson made those calls erics boat was stalled in the video wait what about that text message from eric when did that come in he went indoors and got his phone and scrolled through the call log the text dont come had arrived at pm eastern time there was a sixhour time difference between the east coast and hawaii it meantit meant that eric had sent the text at pm he had sent it just two minutes after alyson bender had made three calls to a disposable cell phone it was only a twoword text dont come that was because eric had been in a lifeordeath crisis and had not had any time to send a longer text eric had sent the text from his boat while he was struggling to get the engine started moments before he had jumped overboard peters hands were clammy and his phone almost slipped from his fingers he stared at the words dont come he was reading his brothers last words chapter ala wai honolulu october am a kamai boat services was right on ala moana boulevard next to the ala wai boat basin at the end of waikiki beach the taxi dropped peter off at eight in the morning but the boat yard was already busy at work it wasnt a large yard perhaps ten or twelve hulls out of the water and it took him no time to locate the boston whaler he was here because of alysons question the night before did the police check the boat why would she ask that supposedly she was concerned about her boyfriend yet she seemed to care more about the boat he jumped off the boat peter walked around the boat now looking closely considering the pounding it had taken in the surf the boston whaler seemed surprisingly intact true the white fiberglass hull was scratched all over as if it had been clawed by giant hands a jagged rip ran several feet along the starboard hull and a chunk had been whacked out of the bow whalers were famous for their ability to float even if the hull was broken into pieces his brother had had years of experience with whalers eric would have known the boat hadnt been in danger of sinking certainly the damage to the boat did not justify erics abandoning it plainly his brother shouldnt have jumped he would have been safer staying on board so why did he jump panic confusion something else there was a wooden ladder on the far side of the boat and he climbed up onto the stern all hatches and the door to the cuddy cabin were sealed with yellow crime scene tape he wanted to look at the outboard engines but they were sealed as well can i help you a man below shouting up heavyset grizzled streaks of grease on his work clothes dirty baseball cap shaded his eyes oh hi peter said my name is peter jansen this is my brothers boat uhhuh whatre you doing here well i wanted to see you illiterate the man said no im well it seems like you must be because that sign over there says plain as day all visitors register at the main office are you a visitor i guess why didnt you register i just thought i could wrong you cant now what the hell you doing up there this is my brothers i heard you the first time your brothers boat you see all that yellow tape i know you do and i also know you can read it cause you told me youre not illiterate isnt that right yes so thats a crime scene and you got no business up there now you get the hell down right away and go to the office and register and show us some identification you have identification yes okay then get down off of there and stop wasting my time the man stalked off peter climbed down the ladder on the far side of the boat as he came near the ground he heard a gruff male voice say can i help you miss and a womans voice answered yes im looking for a boston whaler the coast guard brought in it was alysons voice he paused hidden from view by the hull of the boat goddamn the man said what is it about that fricking boat gets more visitors than a rich uncle on his deathbed hows that she said well yesterday some guy shows up claiming it was his boat cept he had no identification so i told him to get lost the things people try then this morning we have some young guy claiming it was his brothers boat i had to get him out of the cockpit and now we got you what is it about that boat i really couldnt say alyson said myself i just left something on the boat and i wanted to get it back no chance of that not unless you got a letter of authorization from the police do you well no sorry thats a crime scene like i told the young guy where is this guy she asked he was coming down the ladder probably still on the other side of the boat hell be along want to come inside the office why would i do that we can call the police see if theyll give you a waiver to get your stuff off the boat that seems like a lot of trouble its just my well its my watch i took it off my wrist no trouble i guess i could buy another one it did cost a bit uhhuh i thought it would be easy well suit yourself but you still better sign in i dont see why youre supposed to i dont think so she said i dont want to get mixed up in any police thing peter waited a few minutes then heard the man say you can come out son he came out from behind the hull there was no sign of alyson in the yard the heavyset man looked at him quizzically head cocked to one side didnt want to run into her we dont get along peter said i figured you want me to sign in the man nodded slowly yes please so peter went into the office and signed in he couldnt see what difference it made alyson bender already knew he had gone to the boat and therefore she already knew he suspected something from this point on he would have to move fast by the end of the day he thought he had to be finished he went back to his hotel room where he found an email from jorge on his laptop with no text instead there were three wav files sent as attachments one was a recording of alyson benders call to vin drake and there were two new files he listened to them they were recordings of two phone calls alyson had made from her cell phone in the hours after eric had disappeared both calls seemed fairly routine in the first call alyson had phoned somebody perhaps in a nanigen purchasing department and asked for a new budget breakdown in the second call she had spoken briefly with another person a man perhaps an accountant on the subject of expenses alyson omicron has lost two more uh prototypes other person what happened alyson they didnt tell me vin drake wants you to account for this as an ordinary research expense not a capital writedown other person the loss of two hellstorms but thats a big costthe davros people alyson just call it research okay other person of course peter saved the files after listening to them but they didnt make sense or reveal anything he could use he also saved the telephone conversation between alyson and vin however which would be very useful he downloaded it onto a flash memory stick and slipped the stick into his pocket and then burned a cd of the same conversation then he took the cd to the hotel business center and had them print a professional label that said nanigen data when he was finished he checked his watch it was shortly after eleven in the morning he went down to the terrace to have a late breakfast and sit in the sun over coffee and eggs he realized he was making a lot of assumptions the most important assumption was that nanigen would have a conference room equipped with the usual electronic equipment that seemed a safe enough bet all hightech companies had such rooms second he assumed that the tour would move all the graduate students together en masse instead of breaking them into smaller groups or taking them around individually but he suspected that vin drake would give the tour himself and vin liked an audiencethe bigger the better also if everybody stayed together it would be easier for nanigen to control exactly how much information they were given for peter it was important that the students be kept together because he felt he needed as many witnesses as possible for what he was planning to do or should he try to stage it in front of just one or two witnesses nohis mind racedno try to provoke a blowup in front of many people that might be the best way he thought to get drakes facade to crack and perhaps reveal what drake and alyson had done to his brother finally he had to hope that drake would lose his cool or at least that alyson would especially if they were primed in a way that made them nervous and he thought he knew how to do that if he pulled it off drake or alyson might get very upset in front of the grad students and that was what he wanted chapter waipaka arboretum october pm the taxi drove away from the ocean and soon was climbing steeply into the hills broad acacia trees shaded the road thats the university on both sides the driver said he pointed to featureless gray buildings that looked like condominiums peter saw no students where is everybody those are dorms theyre at class now they passed a baseball field a surrounding residential area small homes bungalowstyle but as they drove on the houses thinned and the trees grew larger now they were heading toward a green mountain wall heavily forested rising two thousand feet into the air in front of them thats koolau pali the driver said no houses up there no you cant build nothing there thats straightup crumbly volcanic rock cant climb it or nothing you come way back here like we do now you leave the city you in wilderness now too much rain mauka side near the mountain nobody live back here what about the arboretum half mile up this road the driver said the road was now a single lane dark beneath a heavy covering of towering dense trees nobody come here neither folks go to foster or the other pretty arboretums you sure you want come here yes peter said the road narrowed and climbed zigzagging along a steep jungleclad mountainside a car came up behind them on the twisting road and honked and roared past them people in the car waving and yelling he blinked the grad students from the lab were crammed into the car a midnightblue bentley convertible sedan the taxi driver muttered something about crazy lobsters lobsters peter asked tourists way they burn soon the road arrived at a security gate steel massive new it stood open directly in front of a tunnel a sign warned unauthorized persons to keep out the driver slowed the taxi brought it to a stop before the gate and tunnel theyve been doing some changes up here why you want to go in this place he said its business peter said even so looking at the tunnel he got an uneasy feeling with the steel gate in front of it it seemed like a tunnel of no return peter wondered if the gate was to keep people outor was it to lock people in the driver sighed and took off his sunglasses and drove into the tunnel it was a narrow singlelane passage cored through a shoulder blade of the mountain the road emerged into a pocket valley the valley was deeply forested and walled in by the slopes and cliffs of the koolau pali waterfalls trailed from misty jungle mountains the road descended and they came into a clearing dominated by a large glassroofed shed in front of the shed were a few parking spaces in a muddy area vin drake and alyson bender were already there standing next to a red bmw sports car they both wore boots and hiking clothes the students were piling out of the bentley they became less boisterous when peter stepped from the taxi sorry peter sorry about your brother yes sorry any news erika kissed his cheek took his arm im so sorry the police are still investigating peter said vin drake shook his hand with a firm grip i dont have to tell you this is a great great tragedy if it proves true and i hope to god it does not its a dreadful loss to all of us personally to say nothing of a terrible setback to our company which eric was such a part of i am so sorry peter thank you peter said its good the police are investigating yes peter said they havent given up lost hope quite the contrary peter said it seems theyre taking a new interest in erics boat something about a missing cell phone one that may have broken up inside the engine compartment i didnt really follow what they told me a cell phone in the engine compartment vin frowned i wonder what that could as i said i didnt really follow peter said i dont know why they would think there was a phone there perhaps my brother dropped hisi dont know but theyre also going to check phone records phone records ah yes good good no stone unturned had vin turned paler peter couldnt be sure alyson licked her lips nervously were you able to sleep peter yes thanks i took a pill oh good well vin drake rubbed his hands turned to the others at any rate welcome to the manoa valley what do you say we get to the business at hand gather round people and i will give you your first insight into how nanigen works drake led them from the parking lot toward the forest they passed a low shed housing earthmoving machinery although as drake said youve probably never seen machines like this before notice how small they are to peter the machines looked like tiny golf carts fitted with a miniature backhoe with an antenna drooping over the top these diggers drake went on are specially manufactured for us by siemens precision ag a german company the machine is able to precisiondig soil with millimeter accuracy which is then placed in the flats you see in the back of the shed those flats are thirty centimeters squareabout a foot squareand either three or six centimeters deep and what about the antenna as you see the antenna hangs directly over the backhoe the antenna enables us to locate precisely where to dig and to keep a record in our data files of the exact place where the sample of soil came from this will all be clear as the day goes on meanwhile lets look at the site they plunged into the forest itself the ground suddenly uneven beneath their feet the trail narrow and twisting among the giant trees overhead the massive trunks were wrapped with broadleaf vines the ground was covered with plants and bushes to knee height and the overall impression was of a thousand shades of green the light filtering through the tree canopy overhead was pale yellowgreen drake began this may look like a natural rain forest it doesnt rick hutter said and its not thats correct its not this area has been cultivated since the s when it was an experimental station for oahu farmers and more recently for ecological studies run by the university but in recent years nobody has bothered with this tract and the land reverted to a more natural state we call this area fern gully he turned and walked down the trail while the students followed him going slowly and looking at things occasionally stopping to examine a plant or flower moving along now drake went on speaking briskly youll notice a profusion of ferns prominently around us you see the big tree ferns cibotium and sadleria and lower down to the ground the smaller blechnum lycopodium and of course he indicated the mountainside with a swipe of his handup there the uluhe ferns which cover the mountain slopes over much of hawaii you missed that uluhe fern right at your feet rick hutter broke in its called dicranopteris also known as false staghorn i believe so vin drake said barely concealing a flash of irritation he paused and bent down on one knee the peahi ferns line this path the larger ones are makue ferns which spiders like to live on you will notice the large number of spiders here some twentythree species in all are represented in this small area alone he stopped in a clearing where trees opened into views of the mountainsides around the valley he pointed up to a peak on a ridge overlooking the valley that peak is called tantalus its an extinct volcanic crater that looks down on this valley weve been conducting research at tantalus crater as well as here in the valley alyson bender fell into step alongside peter jansen did the police contact you today she said no he said why i wondered how you knew they were searching the boatand the phone records oh in truth he had made that up well it was on the news was it i didnt hear what channel i dont remember five i think rick hutter came over and said really sorry peter really sorry man jenny linn had been walking close behind vin drake and she said to him but i dont understand your research programlike what youre actually doing here in this forest drake smiled at her and said its because i havent explained it yet in simple terms were planning to collect samples from a crosssection of the hawaiian ecosystem from tantalus crater down into the manoa valley where were standing collect what kind of samples rick hutter said hands on his hips he was wearing the usual rick outfit jeans and an outdoor shirt sleeves rolled up and now damp with sweat looking as if he was on a bushwhack through deep jungle he had the usual combative look on his face too his jaw set eyes narrowed drake smiled and answered essentially we will collect samples from every species of living thing in this ecosystem what for rick went on he stared straight at vin drake drake stared right back at rick a cold look then smiled a rain forest is the greatest repository of active chemical compounds in nature we are standing in the middle of a gold mine full of potential new drugs drugs that could save uncounted human lives drugs worth uncounted billions of dollars this forest mr uh hutter rick said this lush forest mr hutter contains keys to the health and wellbeing of every person on this planet and yet this forest has barely been explored we have no idea what chemical compounds actually exist here in the plants in the animals in the microscopic lifeforms this forest is terra incognita absolutely unknown terrain its as vast as full of riches and as unexplored as the new world was for christopher columbus our goal mr hutter is simple our goal is drug discovery were searching for new drugs on a vast scale beyond anything imagined we have begun a total screening of this entire forest for bioactive compounds from tantalus to the bottom of this valley the payoff will be huge the payoff rick echoed gold mine new world so its a gold rush youre talking about isnt it mr drake its all about money thats much too crude drake answered first and foremost medicine is about saving lives its about ending suffering and helping every person reach their human potential he switched his attention to the others and began walking along the trail getting himself away from rick hutter who obviously annoyed him rick now standing with his arms folded murmured to karen king the guy is a modern spanish conquistador hes looting this ecosystem for gold karen gave him a scornful look and just what are you doing with your natural extracts rick youre boiling the hell out of tree bark looking for new drugs why is that any different the difference he said to her is the huge sums of money involved and you know where the money in all this is right its in patents nanigen will take out thousands of patents on the compounds they find hereand giant drug companies will exploit the patents earning billions youre just jealous cause you dont have any patents karen turned away from rick while rick glared at her he called after her im not doing science to get rich unlike you apparently he realized she was ignoring him pointedly danny minot struggled at the tail end of the group for some reason danny had brought his tweed jacket to hawaii and he was wearing it now sweat poured down dannys neck and drenched his buttondown shirt and he skidded from place to place on the trail in tassel loafers he blotted his face with a pocket square and pretended to ignore his misery mr drake he said if you happen to be familiar with poststructuralist theoryuhyou might be aware of howughwhoofhow we cant actually know anything about this forestfor you see we create meaning mr drake when really there is no meaning in nature drake seemed unfazed by danny my view of nature mr minot is that we dont need to know the meaning of nature in order to make use of it yes but danny went on meanwhile alyson bender drifted back a few paces and peter ended up walking with rick rick nodded toward vin drake do you believe this guy hes like mr biopiracy ive been listening to your remarks mr hutter drake said twisting his head around suddenly and i have to say its completely false biopiracy refers to the taking of indigenous plants without compensating the country of origin the concept is attractive to the illinformed dogooder but fraught with practical difficulty take the example of curare a valuable medicinal drug used in modern medicine today surely someone should be compensated yet there are dozens of different recipes for curare developed by many tribal groups stretching across central and south americaa vast area the curares differ in ingredients and cooking time depending on what is meant to be killed and on local preferences how then do you compensate native medicine men did the shamans of brazil do more valuable work than the shamans of panama or colombia does it matter that the trees used in colombia migratedor were transplantedfrom native panama what about the actual formula is the addition of strychnos important or not how about the addition of a rusty nail is there any consideration for public domain we allow a drug company twenty years to exploit a drug then make it public some say sir walter raleigh brought curare back to europe in certainly it was well known in the s burroughs wellcome sold curare tablets in the s for medical purposes so by all odds curare belongs in the public domain and finally modern surgeons no longer use curare from native plants anyway they use synthetic curare you see the complexities this is all corporate evasiveness rick said mr hutter you seem to enjoy being the devils advocate against my points drake said i dont mind it helps me sharpen my arguments the truth is using natural compounds for medicine is just the way of the world the discoveries of every culture are valuable and all other cultures borrow from one another sometimes discoveries are traded for a price but not always should we license the horse stirrup from the mongols who invented it should we pay the chinese for domesticated silk production for opium should we track down the modern descendants of neolithic farmers of ten thousand years ago who first domesticated food crops in the fertile crescent and pay them how about the medieval britons who learned to smelt iron lets move on erika moll said we take your point even if rick doesnt okay the point is that claims for biopiracy of plants really cant occur in hawaii because there are strictly speaking no indigenous plants these are midpacific volcanic islands that rose from the surface of the ocean as barren hot lava plains and everything growing on them now has been brought from elsewhereby birds by wind by ocean currents by polynesian warrior canoes nothings indigenous although some species are endemic the legalities of the situation are one reason why in fact we have located our company in hawaii evading the law rick mumbled obeying the law drake said thats the point they were coming to an area of chesthigh green leaves and drake said now we call this area ginger lane with white yellow and kahili ginger kahili has those footlong red stems the trees above us here are mostly sandalwood with the typical deepred flowers but there are also soapberry and milo trees with large dark green leaves the students were turning looking in all directions i assume youre all familiar with this but in case youre not this spiky striped leaf is oleander and it will kill a human being one local man died from grilling meats over a fire on an oleander stick children sometimes eat the fruits and die in addition the very large tree off to your left is a strychnine tree originally from india all parts are fatal the seeds most of all next to it that tall shrub with the starshaped leaf is the castor bean plant also fatally toxic but at very low doses castor bean compounds may have medicinal properties i assume you know that mr hutter of course rick said castor bean extracts have potential to improve memory function as well as antibiotic properties drake turned at a fork following a path that went down to the right finally here we have bromeliad alley he said about eighty varieties of this plant family which as you know includes the pineapple bromeliads harbor a great range of insect life as well the trees around us are primarily eucalyptus and acacia but further on we have the more typical rainforest treesohia and koa as you will see from the curved leaves littering the trail and why are we being shown all this jenny linn asked amar singh joined in exactly im curious about the technology mr drake how do you take samples from so many different living things especially when you consider that almost all living things are very small bacteria worms insects and so forth i mean how many biosamples are you collecting and processing per hour per day our laboratory sends a truck to this rain forest every day drake said to pick up precisioncut flats of earth or a selection of plants or whatever else our researchers have asked for so you can expect to have fresh research materials brought to you daily and in general to be provided with whatever you ask for they come here every day rick said thats right about two pm we just missed them jenny linn crouched down whats this she said pointing to the ground it seemed to be a small tent about the size of her palm covering a small concrete box i saw another one just like it a short distance back ah yes drake said excellent observation ms linn those tents are scattered throughout the rain forest in this area theyre supply stations ill explain that to all of you later in fact if you are ready to leave i think its time you learned what nanigen is all about they began to circle back toward the parking lot skirting a small brownish pond with overhanging palm fronds and small bromeliads lining the edges this is pau hana pond drake said means work is done strange name for a duck pond danny said because thats what it is i saw three or four families of ducklings here before and did you see what happens drake said danny shook his head no is this going to upset me that depends look in the fronds about three feet above the water the group paused stared karen king saw it first gray heron she whispered nodding a dustygray bird standing about three feet tall with a spiky head and dull eyes it looked unkempt and lazy it was absolutely motionless and it blended perfectly into the shadows of the palm foliage it can stay that way for hours karen said they watched for several minutes and were about to leave when one of the duckling families began to skirt around the edge of the pond they kept their bodies halfhidden in the overhanging waterside grasses but to no avail in a swift motion the heron left its perch splashed among the ducks and resumed its perch this time with tiny duck feet protruding from its jaws ewwww danny yuch jenny the heron threw back his head looking straight up and in a single flip motion gulped down the remains of the duckling it then lowered its head and turned motionless again in the shadows it had all taken place in a few seconds it was hard to believe it had happened at all thats disgusting danny said its the way of the world drake said youll notice the arboretum is not overrun with ducks and thats the reason why ah if i am not mistaken here are our cars waiting to take us back to civilization chapter kalikimaki industrial park october pm on the way back to the nanigen headquarters karen king drove the bentley convertible and the other students crammed themselves into it while alyson bender and vin drake went in the sports car they hadnt gone far when danny minot the science studies student cleared his throat i think minot said speaking above the rush of the wind that drakes arguments about poisonous plants are subject to dispute subject to dispute was one of minots favorite phrases oh hows that amar said amar in particular loathed minot well this notion of poison is slippery isnt it minot said poison is what we call any compound that does us harm or we think does us harm because it may not in reality be so harmful after all strychnine was once dispensed as a patent medicine in the s it was thought to be a restorative and its still administered for acute alcohol poisoning i believe and the tree wouldnt go to the trouble of making strychnine unless it had some purpose selfdefense most likely other plants make strychnine like nightshade there must be a purpose yes jenny linn said to keep from being eaten thats the plants view its our view too because we dont eat it either but for humans amar said to minot are you arguing that strychnine is not harmful not really a poison thats right as a concept its slippery one might even say its indeterminate the term poison doesnt really refer to anything fixed or specific at all this brought groans throughout the car can we change the subject erika said im simply saying the idea of what is poison is subject to dispute danny with you everything is subject to dispute in essence yes he said nodding solemnly because i have not adopted the scientific worldview of fixed verities and immutable truths neither have we erika said but some things are repeatedly verifiable and therefore justify our belief in them wouldnt it be pleasant to think so but thats just a selfserving fantasy that most scientists have about themselves in reality its all power structures minot said and you know it whoever has the power in society determines what can be studied determines what can be observed determines what can be thought scientists fall in line with the dominant power structure they have to because the power structure pays the bills you dont play ball with the power structure you dont get money for research you dont get an appointment you dont get published in short you dont count anymore youre out you might as well be dead there was silence in the car you know im right minot said you just dont like it speaking of playing ball with power rick hutter said look over there i think were coming to the kalikimaki industrial park and nanigen headquarters jenny linn took a small insulated goretex case the size of her hand and carefully clipped it to her belt karen king said whats that show and tell yes jenny said if theyre really going to offer us jobs well i thought she shrugged these are all of my extracted and purified volatiles what did you bring benzos baby karen said benzoquinones in a spray container blister the skin burn your eyesit may come from beetles but its the ideal personaldefense chemical safe shortlasting organic itll make an excellent product of course you would bring a commercial product rick hutter said to karen thats because i just dont have your scruples rick karen said why you going to tell us you didnt bring anything no no liar well okay he tapped his shirt pocket theres a latex extract from my tree you daub it on and it kills any burrowing parasites under your skin sounds like a product to me karen said swinging the wheel and the bentley slipped around a hairpin turn glued to the road maybe youll make a billion dollars from it rick she took her eyes off the road for a second and flashed him a wicked smile no no im just studying the underlying biochemical mechanism tell it to the venture capitalists karen glanced at peter who sat in the front seat beside her and what about you youve got a lot on your mind did you bring something actually peter said i did fingering the cd in his jacket pocket peter jansen felt a nervous shiver pass through his body now that he was going into the nanigen building he realized he hadnt fully worked out his plan somehow he had to get bender and drake to confess in front of the group and playing jorges recording of the phone call between alyson bender and vin drake would provoke that he hoped and if all the graduate students heard a confession then drake would be unable to retaliate there were seven of them he couldnt attack them all at once at least that was the idea lost in his thoughts peter stayed with the group as they moved into the building led by alyson bender this way please and ladies and gentlemen they stopped first at the elegant blackleather reception area i will need your cell phones your cameras and any other recording devices in your possession you will leave those here to pick up when you depart and please sign nondisclosure agreements at this time she passed out the legal documents peter signed absently not bothering to read it anybody doesnt want to sign you can wait here until the tour is over no everybody wants to go very well then follow me she led them down a corridor to a series of biological laboratories where vin drake was waiting the glasswalled labs ran along both sides of a central corridor and they were uptodate in the extreme peter noticed that several of the labs contained a surprising amount of electronic equipment almost like an engineering laboratory it was quiet at nanigen the end of the work day and most of the labs had emptied out though a few researchers remained doing work that would run on into the night walking down the hallway vin drake rattled off bits of information about each lab proteomics and genomicschemical ecologyphytopathology including plant virusesstochastic biologyelectrical signaling in plantsinsect ultrasound labphytoneurology thats plant neurotransmitterspeter heres venoms and toxinsarachnid and coleoptid volatilesbehavioral physiology thats exocrine secretion and social regulation ants primarily whatre all the electronics for someone asked for the robots drake said they need to be reprogrammed or repaired after each trip in the field he paused looked at the group i see a lot of puzzled faces here come inside lets take a closer look they filed into the laboratory to the right it smelled faintly of earth decaying plant matter desiccated leaves drake led them to a table where several footsquare flats of earth were laid out above each square was a suspended video camera on a jointed arm here are examples of the material we bring back from the rain forest he said we are working on different projects for each but in every case the robots are at work where erika asked i dont see drake adjusted the light and the video camera on side monitors they saw a tiny white object in the soil magnified many times as you see its a burrowing and collecting machine working on a microscopic scale drake said and it has much to do because a flat of soil like this holds a vast and interconnected world that is yet unknown to man theres trillions of microorganisms tens of thousands of species of bacteria and protozoa nearly all of them uncatalogued there can be thousands of miles of wispy fungal hyphae threads in a patch of soil this big there can be a million microscopic arthropods and other tiny insects too small for the naked eye to see there are dozens of earthworms of various sizes in fact there are more small living things in this little square of earth than there are large living things on the entire surface of our planet think about it we humans live on the surface we think thats where the life is we think in terms of people and elephants and sharks and forests of trees but our perceptions are wrong the truth of life on our planet is very different the real bedrock fundamental lifeteeming burrowing breeding continuously activeis down here at this level and this is where the discoveries are going to be made it was an impressive speech drake had given it before and audiences were always awed into silence but not this group rick hutter immediately said and whats this particular robot discovering nematodes vin drake said microscopic roundworms that we think have important biological properties in a flat of soil like this there are about four billion nematodes but we want to collect only those which have not yet been discovered drake had turned to a line of windows that looked into a laboratory where a handful of researchers were working at banks of machines complicated machines what were doing in that room drake said is screening were screening thousands of compounds very rapidly using highspeed fractionation and mass spectrometrythose are the machines you see weve already found dozens of totally new drug candidates and theyre natural mother natures best amar singh had been quite impressed by the technology but there were still things he didnt understand one of them was the robots the robots were really small too small he thought to have much of a computer in them amar said how can those robots sort through the worms and pick them out oh they do it easily drake said how the robot has the intelligence to do it but how amar indicated a flat of soil where a tiny robot was rooting feverishly in the dirt this machine cant be more than eight or nine millimeters in length amar said its the size of my little fingernail you cant put any computing power in such a small dimension actually you can how lets go to the conference room four huge flatpanel screens glowed behind vin drake the screens showed images in deep blue and purple that looked rather like waves on the ocean as seen from an airplane drake paced in front of the screens his voice amplified by the lapel microphone clipped to his jacket he gestured to the purple screens what you are looking at he said are convection patterns in magnetic fields approaching sixty tesla in strength these are the highest magnetic fields generated by man to give you some perspective a sixty tesla magnetic field is two million times greater than the strength of the earths own magnetic field these fields are created by cryogenic superconduction using niobiumbased composite materials he paused to let this sink in its been known for fifty years that magnetic fields affect animal tissues in various ways youre all familiar with magnetic resonance imaging or mris you also know that magnetic fields can promote bone healing inhibit parasites change platelet behavior and so on but it turns out that those are all minor effects arising from exposure to lowintensity fields the situation is entirely different under extremely high field strengths of the kind we have only recently been able to generateand until recently nobody had any knowledge of what happened under those conditions we call such magnetic fields tensor fields to distinguish them from ordinary magnetic fields tensor fields have ultrahigh field strengths in a tensor field dimensional changes can become evident in matter but we did have a hinta clue if you will it came from research conducted in the s by a company called nuclear medical data which studied the health of workers at nuclear facilities the company found workers were generally in good health but they also noted that over a tenyear period workers exposed to high magnetic fields lost a quarter of an inch in height this conclusion was considered a statistical artifact and ignored drake paused again waiting to see if the assembled students understood where this was going they didnt yet seem to suspect it turns out that it was not a statistical artifact a french study in found that french workers in a high magnetic field area lost about eight millimeters in height but the french study also discarded the finding calling it trivial however we now know that it was nothing of the sort darpa the defense advanced research projects agency took an interest in these studies and apparently tested small dogs under high strength fieldsthe strongest that could be generated at that time at a secret lab in huntsville alabama there are no official records of these tests except for some faded xeroxes of faxes which make reference to a pekingese dog the size of a pencil eraser that caused a stir some of the students shifted in their chairs they glanced at one another it seems drake continued that the dog squeaked pitifully and died after a few hours exsanguinating with a tiny drop of blood in general the results were unstable and inconclusive and the project was abandoned by order of then secretary of defense melvin laird why one of the students asked he was worried about destabilizing ussoviet relations drake said why would it do that that will be clear in a minute drake said the important point is that we can now generate extremely high magnetic field strengths these socalled tensor fields and we now know that under the influence of a tensor field both organic and inorganic matter undergo something analogous to a phase change the result is that material in the field experiences rapid compression by a factor of ten to the minus one to ten to the minus three quantum interactions remain symmetrical and invariant for the most part so that shrunken matter interacts in a normal way with regular matter at least most of the time the transformation is metastable and reversible under inverse field conditions are you with me so far the students were paying close attention but their faces registered a wide range of reactions skepticism outright disbelief fascination even some confusion drake was talking about quantum physicsnot biology rick folded his arms and shook his head so what are you getting at he said quite loudly unruffled drake answered its good you asked mr hutter its time you see for yourselves the giant screens behind drake went dark then the central panel lit up they were watching an hd video it showed an egg the egg sat on a flat black surface behind the egg there was a folded yellow backdrop like a curtain the egg moved it was hatching a small beak poked through the eggshell a crack lengthened the top of the egg broke off a baby chicken struggled out cheeping and stood up wobbly and flapped its little stubby wings the camera began to pull back as the scene widened the chicks surroundings came into view the yellow backdrop it turned out was actually the huge clawed foot of a bird the foot of a chicken the baby chick now tottered by a monstrously large chicken foot as the camera drew back farther the entire adult chicken became visibleit seemed gigantic as the camera pulled fully back however the chick and the pieces of eggshell became nothing but specks of dirt under the grown bird get out rick began then stopped he couldnt take his eyes off the screen this drake said is nanigens technology the transformation amar began can be done to living organisms yes we shrank that egg in a tensor field the chicken fetus inside the egg wasnt affected by the dimensional change it hatched normally as you can see this proves that even highly complex biological systems can be compressed in a tensor field and still carry on the normal functions of life what are those other things in the picture karen asked in the video the floor under the giant chicken appeared to be splattered with tiny dots some of the dots were moving some not those are the other chicks we dimensionally shifted the whole brood drake said unfortunately theyre so small the mother has stepped on some of her babies without knowing it there was a brief silence amar was the first to speak youve done this to other organisms of course drake answered that meanspeople amar said yes those little robot diggers we saw in the arboretum amar went on youre telling us you dont actually program intelligence into them we dont need to because you have human beings run them yes human beings who have undergone a dimensional change holy shit danny minot burst out are you fucking kidding me no drake said somebody burst out laughing it was rick hutter scam rick muttered guys selling worthless stock to fools karen king didnt believe it either she said this is bullshit hype no way you can do anything with video its existing technology drake said calmly amar singh said so youre saying you can cause a dimensional change in a human being as great as ten to the minus three yes which means that someone six feet tall would be uh seventytwo inchessevenhundredths of an inch tall thats correct drake said slightly less than twotenths of a millimeter jesus rick hutter said and at ten to the minus two drake said the person is approximately half an inch tall twelve millimeters i would actually like to see this for real danny minot said of course drake said and you will chapter nanigen headquarters october pm w hile drake was talking with the students peter jansen had taken alyson bender aside some of us brought samples and compounds to show mr drake thats good alyson said to him ive got a cd with some of my uh research on it peter said she nodded in response its a recording it involves my brother peter added he hoped to start winding her up making her nervous she nodded again and left the conference room did he see a flicker of alarm in her eyes after shed left while drake was still talking peter slipped behind the service door and went to the audio panel he needed some equipment something to magnify his voice he did not want drake or anyone to be able to shut him up or shout him down behind the service door there were some drawers he began opening them and he found what he wanted it was a lavalier a wireless microphone device that would transmit his voice to a loudspeaker the lavalier was identical to a unit drake had used during his slide show and talk the device consisted of a transmitter unit and a throat mike with a wire that ran to the transmitter he slipped the transmitter into his pants pocket stuffed the wire and mike in after it drake concluded his presentation on the screens and the lights went up in the meeting room some of you have brought things to show us drake said and we are very eager to see them now ifyes what is it alyson bender had come back into the room she leaned close to drake whispered in his ear drake stared at peter as he listened then looked away he nodded twice but said nothing finally he turned back to peter peter you have a recording a cd yes what is on that recording peter drake didnt seem upset at all something that will interest you peters heart was pounding related to your brother yes drake seemed unruffled i know this is a difficult matter for you he said placing his hand on peters shoulder gently he added wouldnt it be easier to talk privately drake wanted to get him off alone where nobody could hear what was said peter balked we can talk here he answered in the conference room with everybody else drake looked concerned if i might have a private word with you petereric was a friend of mine too ive suffered a loss myself lets step into the next room peter shrugged and got up and walked with vin drake and alyson bender into a smaller adjacent roomit was a prep booth for the conference room drake closed the door behind them and with a smooth gesture flipped the doors lock then he spun around and in the blink of an eye his face had been transformed it was contorted with rage he viciously clamped his hand around peters throat and slammed him against the wall with his other hand he took peters arm and bent it holding it in a lock i dont know what your game is you little bastard no game the police arent looking for a phone on the boat no no you little bastard because they havent been to the boat yard all day peters mind was racing the police didnt need to go to the boat yard he said because they can find the phone just by looking at the gps tracking signal no they cant drake let go of his arm and punched him in the stomach hard peter gasped and doubled over and drake grabbed his arm and bent it behind him and got peter in a neck lock immobilizing him dont lie to me they cant because i disabled the gps before i ever put that phone on the boat alyson said nervously vin shut up so peter said you disabled the gps and rigged up the phone to clog my brothers gas line no to kill the fuel pump you little assholei killed the radio too alyson vin listen alyson keep out of this whyd you do it peter said coughing pulling at drakes fingers drakes grip was strong on his throat why your brother was a fool you know what he wanted he wanted to sell this technology turns out theres some legal issue about ownership who really owned it so eric thought we should sell can you imagine sell this technology eric betrayed nanigen he betrayed me personally vin for gods sake shut up your mike alyson pointed to the lavalier microphone on drakes lapel its on ah shit vin drake hissed he punched peter brutally hard in the solar plexus and let him crumple to the floor on his knees gasping very deliberately drake pulled back his jacket revealing the transmitter clipped to his belt he tapped a switch the light was off im not stupid peter knelt on the floor and retched and coughed unable to get a breath he realized that the small clip microphone had come out of his pocket and dangled on its cord drake might see it groping around he tried to stuff it back in his pocket and his hand hit the transmitter he heard a loud popping noise coming over the loudspeakers in the conference room drake looked toward the conference room he had heard the sound his eyes followed peters hand and he saw the little microphone he took a step backward and lashed out with his boot kicked peter on the side of the head peter collapsed drake tore the lavaliers cord out of peters pocket disconnecting the mike and tossed it away peter rolled on the floor and groaned what do we do now alyson said to him theyve heard it shut up he paced god damn it none of them have cell phones right right they left them at the front okay then what are you going to do she said trembling just stay out of my way he flipped open a security panel and hit a red security button a loud rising and falling alarm began to sound he hauled peter up under the armpits and dragged him to his feet where he swayed unsteady and in pain groggy from his beating suck it up sport drake said time to clean up your mess drake unlocked the door and burst into the conference room supporting peter he had to shout over the alarm weve had a security breach he said peter has been injured the security robots have been released these bots are extremely dangerous come quickly this way all of you we need to get to the safety room he led them out into the hallway holding on to peter while alyson bender took peters other arm in the hallway a few researchers were running toward the entrance get outside somebody shouted running past heading for the buildings main exit most employees had gone home for the day drake however turned and led the students deeper into the complex where the hell are you taking us rick hutter said to drake its too late to get outdoors we need to get to the safety room the students were in a state of confusion what safety room what did that mean what are you doing alyson said to drake drake didnt answer they came to a heavy door marked tensor core drake punched a keypad and the door swung open this way come on now the students entered a large space with hexagonal tiles on the floor the floor was almost transparent they could see machinery below complex machinery going deep into the ground all right everyone drake said i want you all to stand in the center of one of the hexagons each hexagon is a safety spot its robotproof do it now thats ithurry hurrywe dont have much time drake touched a security pad and they heard bolts slamming home they were locked inside the room erika moll had gotten extremely frightened she uttered a cry and made a run for the exit door dont danny minot screamed after her the exit door was locked and erika couldnt get out drake had shut himself in a control room where he looked in on the students through a window an instant later he went out of sight the control room door opened and a man a stranger was flung into the big room he was a nanigen employee get in there and help them drakes voice roared after the man the man followed drakes order looking shocked he stood in the center of a hexagon among the students the students were all positioning themselves erika had come back peter jansen toppled and fell to his knees rick hutter grabbed him and tried to support him but peter stayed on his knees karen king noticed a row of backpacks hanging along the wall and she ran and grabbed one and slung it over her shoulder meanwhile drake had become visible in the window again and they saw him punching buttons in a rapid sequence alyson was by his side vin for gods sake alyson said standing beside him no choice vin drake said and he hit the final button for peter jansen groggy from his beating everything happened fast the hexagonal floor sank beneath him and he descended some ten feet into the multiple jaws of some huge electronic apparatus that was all around him and very close almost touching his skin the jaws were actually wired armatures painted at intervals with red and white stripes the air smelled strongly of ozone and there was a loud electronic hum the hairs on his skin were raised up a synthesized voice said dont move please take a deep breathand hold it there was a loud clank unnerving and mechanical and then that electronic hum returned a brief wave of nausea he sensed he had shifted somehow within the apparatus you may breathe normally stand by he took a breath let it out slowly dont move please take a deep breath and hold it another clank another hum a ripple of nausea stronger than before he blinked his eyes now he was sure things had changed before he had been looking at stripes at about the midpoint of the jaws but now he was looking at stripes much lower down he was shrinking the jaws buzzed and moved closer toward him of course they would do that he thought the magnetic field would be strongest at small distances the smaller the better the synthetic voice take a deep breath and hold it when he looked upward again he saw that he was really very much smaller the top of the jaws ten feet above seemed now as high as a cathedral ceiling how tall was he dont move please take a deep breath and i know i know peters voice was shaking dont speak you risk serious injury now take a deep breath and hold it one final clank a grinding sound a final spasm of dizzying nauseabut now the jaws moved away from him and he felt the floor beneath his feet begin to vibrate as it rose upward he saw light from above shining down and felt a cool breeze and then he was flush with the rest of the floor and the vibration stopped he was standing on a polished black expanse stretching away in all directions in the distance he saw erika and jenny both looking around dazed and still farther away amar and rick and karen but how far away were they actually peter couldnt be sure because he himself was no more than half an inch tall dust motes and flecks of dead cellular debris rolled across the floor came to rest against his knees like tiny tumbleweed he looked down at this tumbleweed in stupefaction he felt slow dullwitted stupid the reality of the situation gradually dawned on him he looked across the floor at erika and jenny they seemed as shocked as he felt half an inch tall a crunching sound made him turn he faced the tip of an enormous boot the sole as tall as he was peter looked up and saw vin drake crouched down on one knee looming above him his face enormous his exhalations a stiff noxious wind and then peter heard a deep rumbling that reverberated throughout the room like thunder it was the sound of vin drake laughing it was difficult to hear with all the echoes and reverberations from these two enormous people the sounds made his ears ache they seemed to move and speak slowly almost in slow motion alyson bender crouched down alongside drake and together they stared at peter alyson said whatareyoudoingvin the words boomed and rolled and seemed to slur together into a mishmash of sounds too deep to make out without difficulty vin drake just laughed apparently he found the situation amusing but the mans laughter propelled gusts of stinking breath toward peter and he recoiled from the odor of garlic red wine and cigars drake glanced at his watch itsafterhours he said and smiled pau hana astheysayhereinhawaiimeansworkisdone alyson bender stared at him drake tipped his head from side to side as if he had gotten something stuck in his ear it seemed to be a habit the students heard his voice rolling out afterworkcomesplay chapter nanigen animal facility october pm vin drake produced a clear plastic bag with surprising gentleness he picked up peter jansen and dropped him in the bag peter slid down the plastic surface came to rest at the bottom he got to his feet and watched as vin went around the room picking up each of the graduate students in turn dropping them in the bag last of all he picked up the nanigen man from the control room they heard the man call out mr drake what are you doing sir drake didnt seem to hear the man and didnt seem to care as each person tumbled down among the others in the bag nobody got hurt apparently they now had too little mass to cause damage were almost weightless amar commented we must weigh no more than a gram or so like a tiny feather amars voice was cool composed but peter thought he detected a tremor of fear well i dont care who knows it im scared rick hutter blurted we all are karen king admitted i think were in shock jenny linn said look at our faces circumoral pallor blanched skin around the lips was a classic sign of fear the nanigen man kept saying theres been some mistake he couldnt seem to believe what drake had just done who are you someone asked him my name is jarel kinsky im an engineer i operate the tensor generator if mr drake would justjust give me a chance to talk with him youve seen too much rick hutter cut him off sharply whatever drake does to us hes going to do to you as well lets take an inventory karen king snapped quickwhat weapons have we got but they got no further the bag was tossed around throwing them into a tangle uhoh amar said struggling to sit up whats happening now alyson bender pushed her face very close to the plastic bag she was looking carefully at the individuals inside apparently worried about them her eyelashes flicked against the plastic the pores in the skin of her nose were alarmingly large great pink pockmarks vinidontwantthemharmedvin that drew a smile from vin drake speaking slowly he said iwouldntdreamofharmingthem you realize karen king said that that man is a psychopath he is capable of anything i realize it peter said thats just not true about mr drake jarel kinsky said there is a reason for this ignoring him karen said to peter we should have no illusions about what drake intends at this point were witnesses to his confession that he killed your brother now hes going to kill us all do you think so danny minot said plaintively we shouldnt jump to yes danny i do think so maybe youll be first its just so hard to imagine ask peters brother about at that moment vin picked up the plastic bag and walked quickly into the hallway he was simultaneously arguing with alyson bender but their words were too difficult to decipher it just sounded like thunder rumbling they walked past several labs and then drake entered one even inside the plastic bag they could immediately detect the difference in this lab a sharp acrid odor wood chips and feces animals this is an animal lab amar said and they could see through the distortion of the plastic bag that there were rats hamsters and lizards and other reptiles vin drake set the bag down on top of a glass tank now he was talking apparently directing his remarks at them but they could not understand what he was saying they looked from one to another whats he saying i dont understand hes crazy i cant make it out jenny linn had turned her back on the group she was entirely focused on drake she turned to peter and said its you what do you mean hes going to kill you first wait just a minute what she unzipped her belt pack revealing a dozen slender glass tubes with rubber bumpers at each end my volatiles it was impossible to miss the devotion these tubes represented years of work she pulled one out im afraid its the best i can do peter shook his head not understanding she uncorked the tube and in a single quick motion poured it over his head and down his body there was a pungent odor then nothing he said what is it before she could answer vin drake thrust his hand into the bag and gripping peter by the leg lifted him out upside down peter yelled and waved his arms its hexenol she said from wasps good luck nownowyoungmasterpeter drake said his voice booming youvecausedmeagreatdealoftrouble he held peter close to his face squinted at him worried betyouare drake turned on his heel the quick movement was dizzying for peter and then he slid the glass top of a tank open a fraction of an inch and dropped peter through the slot he slid it shut leaving the bag with the people in it on top of the tank peter fell landing in sawdust alyson bender said vin i didnt agree to this this wasnt what we discussed the situation has changed obviously but this is unconscionable tell me about your conscience drake said scornfully later she had agreed to help him eliminate eric after eric had threatened to destroy nanigen she had thought she loved vin drake and maybe she still did love him vin had been incredibly good to her advanced her career paid her unlimited amounts of money while eric had acted so badly toward vineric had betrayed vin but the others were only studentsthis situation was going out of control even so she felt paralyzed the situation had developed too fast she didnt know how to stop drake there is nothing cruel about a predator drake said standing before the snake tank it is extremely humane that blackandwhite striped creature on the other side of the glass is a banded krait from malaysia its bite for a creature peters size will be almost immediately fatal hell hardly feel a thing slurred speech difficulty swallowing paralysis of the eyes and then complete paralysis of the body in a matter of moments he may possibly still be alive when the snake ingests him but ah he probably wont care drake placed his index finger against his thumb and flicked the plastic bag it caused the microhumans inside the bag to be flung around shouting and swearing with terror and confusion they tumbled upon one another while drake peered at them theyre quite lively he commented to alyson i assume the krait will accept them if not theres also the cobra and the coral snake she looked away its essential alyson he said their bodies have to be ingested there cant be anyevidence but thats not all of it she said what about their car their hotel rooms plane tickets ive got a plan for all that do you trust me i do he stared at her alyson he said after a long moment are you saying you dont trust me no of course not she said quickly i hope not because without trust were nothing we are in this together alyson i know yes i know you do he patted her hand ah i see young peter has dusted himself off and here comes the krait looking for his meal slithering black and white stripes partially hidden in the sawdust black tongue flicking in and out now watch closely drake said to her it happens fast alyson had turned away she couldnt watch peter got to his feet and brushed himself off the fall hadnt hurt him but he still felt the effects of drakes punches and kicks and his shirt was stuck to his chest with drying blood he was waistdeep in sawdust in a glass cage the cage had a small branch with some leaves on it otherwise it was empty except for the snake from where he stood he could only see a few darkgray and white bands probably a banded krait bungarus candidus from malaysia or vietnam as a rule kraits ate other snakes but he could not count on this one to be fussy he saw the coils of black and white move and with a soft hissing sound disappear the snake was sliding forward he couldnt see the head or even very much of the body he was too small to really grasp the layout of the cage unless he climbed the branch which didnt seem like a good idea all he could do was wait for the snake to come to him helpless defenseless he patted his pockets but they were empty his body began to shake uncontrollably was it shock from his beating or fright probably both he backed into a corner glass on both sides maybe he would make a reflection that would disturb the snake maybe he would he saw the head it emerged from the sawdust tongue flicking rapidly it came so close to peter that the tongue almost brushed his body he closed his eyes unable to watch he was trembling so hard he thought he would collapse in sheer terror he took a breath held it trying to stop the trembling he opened one eye slightly hazarding a look the snake was right there just inches from his torso and the black tongue continued to flick in and out but something was wrong this snake seemed confused or hesitantand then to his utter amazement the animal raised its head and slithered backward pulling away from peter disappearing into the sawdust and gone and then he did collapse falling to the ground shaking with fear and exhaustion unable to control his body and one thought remained fixed in his mindwhat the hell happened god damn it vin drake said looking down through the glass what the hell was that what just happened maybe it wasnt hungry oh its hungry alright god damn it i cant have these mishaps im on a schedule a tight schedule the intercom clicked mr drake you have a visitor mr drake visitor at the front desk oh for christs sake drake said throwing up his hands im not expecting anybody today he dialed reception what is it mirasol im sorry mr drake but i was in the parking lot after the alarm and someone from the honolulu police came to see you so i brought them in oh all right he hung up great the police alyson said ill go see what they want no you wont he said ill deal with the police you go back to your office and stay out of sight until they are gone all right if thats what it is yes all right vin jenny linn watched as vin drake and alyson bender left the animal room she noticed that drake was careful to lock the door as he left the plastic bag was lying on top of the snakes tank the top of the bag was twisted lightly but it was loose jenny wriggled herself up in the neck of the bag pushing and she managed to get it open come on she said we can at least get out the others followed jenny climbing out of the bag until they were standing on the clear glass lid that covered the tank jenny looked down into the tank peter was getting to his feet obviously shaken she shouted can you understand me he shook his head at jenny not really rick hutter said why didnt the snake strike jenny got down on her hands and knees cupped her hands around her mouth and said peter can you hear now he shook his head try bone conduction amar said jenny lay flat on the surface putting her cheek against the glass she spoke loudly peter now yes he said what happened i doused you with volatiles from a wasp she said principally hexenol i figured there were very few things that would put off a poisonous snake but a wasp sting would be one of them damn clever amar said snakes rely more on smell than sight anyway and the kraits nocturnal it worked it thought i was a wasp yes but the substance is very volatile peter meaning it will evaporate it is as we speak great im not a wasp anymore not for long how much time would you say he said i dont know minutes what can we do karen king said how are your reflexes shot he held out his hand it was shaking whats your idea amar said do you have any of the spider silks we worked on for about six months amar and karen had been synthesizing spider silks with various propertiessome were sticky some strong some flexible like a bungee cord some could turn from smooth to sticky from the addition of a chemical at one end i have several yes amar said okay you see that plastic tube beside the cage closed at one end it looks like its part of a little water dispenser right thats the one can you grab that tube with sticky silk and hoist it up i dont know amar said doubtfully it probably weighs an ounce or two wed all have to help haul it up thats fine because we all have to help anyway to open the cage open the cage the top of the krait cage was a double piece of glass one slid over the other i dont know karen that means shifting the glass piece just an inch or so just enough to lower the tube right peter are you following this amar said i am and it sounds impossible i dont see an alternative karen said we have only one shot at this and you cant miss amar had opened up a plastic case which hed had in his pocket and he was already uncoiling his sticky silk from an armature in the case he lowered the silk over the edge and hooked the plastic tube it was surprisingly light amar and rick hutter were able to raise it easily they tried sliding the glass plate to get it open but that proved to be a much greater challenge we have to be coordinated karen said everybody on the count of three onetwothree the glass moved just a few millimeters but it moved okay again hurry and the krait was becoming more active whether from seeing all the little people walking around on top or because the volatile was wearing off the snake began twisting and coiling moving toward peter getting ready to try another approach get that thing down here peter said his voice was tremulous lowering it now amar said the thread scraped over the glass edge making a strange squeaking sound that going to be okay karen said will it hold its strong amar said come lower a little lower peter said okayhold it there the tube was chesthigh he stood behind it holding it in position with both hands at the back but his hands were sweating slippery his grip unsure the snake was moving hissing through the leaves and sawdust what if it strikes from the side peter said adjust karen said cause it looks like yeah it is here it comes damn it oh shit peter said the snake struck with blinding speedunimaginable speedunthinking he swung the tube to meet itthe full impact of the kraits head slammed against his chestthe silk snapped and peter fell backward with the krait on top of him writhing and coiling angrily pinning peters body down but the kraits head was lodged tightly inside the tube and it would be difficult for him to get free how did you do that karen said her voice full of admiration the snake was so fast i dont know peter said i justreacted it had all happened faster than thought now peter struggled to push the snake away so close to him the smell of the animal was nauseating finally he kicked free and staggered to his feet the snake stared up at him with baleful eyes it shook the tube hard and banged it repeatedly against the glass but did not dislodge it its furious hiss was magnified reverberating inside the tube thats great rick said but we better get you out of there vin drake gritted his teeth mirasol the receptionist was beautiful but she was an idiot the muscular man in the blue uniform standing before him was not a cop but a coast guard ensign and what he wanted was information about ownership of erics boston whaler because the boat yard wanted to move it to another location and they needed permission of the owner to do that i thought the police were still inspecting the boat vin said irritably he might as well try to get some information from this numbskull i wouldnt know about that the ensign said the police hadnt come to see him he explained it was the boatyard owner i heard they were looking for a phone not that im aware i think the police have finished their investigation drake closed his eyes gave a long sigh christ at least the ensign said as soon as they complete their inspection of his office drakes eyes snapped open whose office jansens office his office here in this building he was vice president of this company right i know they went to jansens apartment today and that theyre coming to look at his office here the ensign glanced at his watchany minute now actually in fact im surprised they havent already shown up christ vin drake said he turned to mirasol the police are going to be arriving soon he said and someone needs to show them around should i page ms bender no vin said ms bender will beshe will be busy working with me i have some lab work to ship out it cant wait who should i call get don makele the head of security he said he can show the officers around theyll want to see mr jansens office and wherever else he worked the ensign added he was staring fixedly at the receptionist and wherever else he worked drake repeated cars were pulling up in the street outside he repressed an urge to bolt and instead calmly shook the ensigns hand youre welcome to go along with the police he said and mirasol why dont you accompany the officers see that they get coffee whatever all right mr drake i believe i will stay the ensign said then you must excuse me for the moment drake said he turned and walked down the hallway the moment he was out of sight he began to run alyson bender sat in her office and bit her lip the monitor on her desk showed the reception area she could see drake talking to the uniformed kid and see mirasol flirting fussing with the flower in her hair as usual drake was impatient quick aggressive in his movements almost hostile really of course he was under pressure but seeing the way he movedno words just the body languagemade it clear how angry he was he was an angry angry man and he was going to kill all of those kids it was only too clear what he intended to do peter jansen had trapped him and vin was going to escape the only way possible by leaving no witnesses seven young people bright students with their lives before them he didnt seem to care it didnt seem to matter to him they were merely in the way it frightened her her hands trembled even when she pressed them flat against the desk she was afraid of him and terrified of the situation she found herself in she could not confront him directly of course hed kill her if she did but she had to stop him from killing those kids somehow she had to do that she knew what she had done she knew her involvement in eric jansens death knew it only too well making those calls to the trigger phone but to be involved in the murder of seven more peopleno eight including the nanigen employee whod had the bad luck to be in the control room when drake came inshe wasnt sure she could do it it would be homicide on a grand scale but she might have to do itto save herself on the monitor drake was telling the receptionist what to do the ensign was grinning drake would soon leave alyson stood up and hurried out of her office she didnt have much time he could return to the lab looking for the students at any moment in the lab the students had gotten out of the bag and they stood on the transparent top of the krait cage looking down at peter jansen alyson bender burst into the room she bent down and stared at them her face looming over them iwonthurtyou she said her eyes were wide and frightened she put out her hand palm flat and picked up jenny linn very gently and placed her on her palm she gestured to the others hurry idontknowwhereheis ms bender let me talk with mr drake jarel kinsky shouted at her waving his arms she didnt seem to hear or understand the others seeing no other option climbed onto alysons palm she lifted them into the air and the room spun around the wind blew knocking them off their feetshe carried them swiftly to a desk and placed them down on it then she went over to the snake cage opened it and lifted peter out and put him on the desk with the others she stared at them seeming not to know what to do with them her breathing was ragged and loud karen king said we should try to talk to her i dont know if it will do any good peter said alyson moved away they saw her go across the room she threw open a cabinet looked inside took out a small brown paper bag and hurried back to the desk hideinthis she said speaking slowly youcanbreathe she opened the bag and laid it down on the desk with its mouth facing them and gestured to them to get in they scrambled into the bag last of all was the nanigen man who couldnt seem to accept the reality of their desperate situation he kept shouting ms bender ms bender please alyson folded the top of the bag tightly and hurried out of the room she carried the bag into her office and placed it gently inside her purse which sat on the floor by her desk she snapped the purse shut and pushed it with her toe underneath her desk and ran back to the animal lab arriving just as vin drake walked in what the hell are you doing he said i was looking for you i told you to stay in your office drake went over to the snakes cage and saw the empty plastic bag theyve escaped he said he spun around and swore and turned around again and lunged at a shelf full of chemicals with one movement he swept everything to the floor sending broken glass and liquids splashing where are they vin please i dont know the hell you dont he snarled and peered into the snake tank where he saw the snake with its head stuck in the plastic tube and no sign of peter what the that jansen kid is dead anyway snake got him he shot alyson a violent look were going to find the rest of them and i swear to god alyson if youve been screwing with me it will be the last thing you ever regret she cringed i understand youd better at that moment two police officers came down the hallway visible through the lab windows led by don makele they were both young not in uniform which meant they were detectives shit drake straightened up and suddenly composed himself a shift that happened so quickly it seemed eerie hi there don drake said crossing the room and easing out into the hallway with a warm smile on his face introduce me to our guests we dont often have visitors to nanigen officers im vin drake im the president of this company how can i be of service to you the paper bag was scrunched up inside alysons purse and it was pitchdark the students and the nanigen man sat huddled i cant tell if she means to help us or not karen king said shes obviously terrified of drake peter said who wouldnt be amar said rick hutter sighed i told you drake was a corporate slime nobody listened shut up damn you karen yelled at him hey please amar said in a very calm voice not now sorry karen said then she added but were not dealing with an ordinary slime were dealing with a very sick man she fingered her knife it was useless as a defense it might not even break drakes skin there came a banging thunderous noise and the bag shook and light suddenly glowed through the bag the purse had been opened then with a slamming noise everything went dark again they waited wondering what would come next the students alyson bender knew had to be put back in the generator and restored to full size and quickly but she didnt know how to operate the generator herself the workday was long over and almost all the employees had gone home leaving nanigen deserted she found drake back in the animal room he had finished talking with the police officers and now he was searching the animal room carefully looking into every corner and cabinet peering into every cage he stared at her his eyes hard did you let them go no i swear vin im going to have this lab cleaned tomorrow the animals put to death the whole room sterilized with gas then washed with bleach thatsthats good vin we dont have any choice he touched her arm go home and get some rest im going to stay here for a while she gave him a grateful look then she hurried into her office picked up her purse and headed outdoors mirasol had gone home the reception area was empty a fat moon drifted in stars dusting the sky a beautiful night if only her mind hadnt been in turmoil she got into the bmwit was a corporate car for her use she put the purse on the seat next to her and sped off vin drake went into the deserted lobby keeping himself in the shadows when he heard alysons car start and go down the street he ran outdoors to the bentley and started it where were her taillights he got to the farrington highway left or right he swung left the way to honolulu the most likely way shed go he pulled out into traffic and accelerated feeling his body pressed into the seat with a surge of power there it was the red bmw traveling fast he dropped back watching her taillights her car turned onto the entry ramp to the h freeway the midnightblue bentley faded into the night he was just another set of headlights behind her in the flow of traffic he had not been able to find the students there was only one possibility alyson had taken them with her in her car he couldnt be completely sure of it but his instincts told him so she might have to go he certainly couldnt trust her that was obvious the woman had lost her nerve but it was getting complicated all these people disappearing alyson bender was nanigens chief financial officer and if she disappeared now it would provoke a very thorough investigation he didnt want that an investigation of nanigen would sooner or later turn up something he had done it was inevitable enough time enough checkingthey would find out no no he didnt want an investigation he began to realize he had made a terrible mistake he couldnt kill her he couldnt afford to kill herat least not right now he needed her on his side for a little while how could he get her on his side alyson followed the freeway around pearl harbor trying not to look at her purse on the seat maybe vin was right maybe there was no choice she exited into downtown honolulu not certain where to go she drove to waikiki there she went slowly along kalakaua avenue caught in traffic the crowds of tourists were thick people out for the evening then she turned onto diamond head road and circled past the diamond head lighthouse she would take the paper bag to a beach somewhere on the windward side of oahu or maybe to the north shore she would drop the bag in the surf somewhereno evidenceno survivors drake stayed back watching her car she went past makapuu point and through waimanalo and kailua but then she turned and picked up the freeway and headed back toward honolulu where in hell was his cfo going he wondered having driven around the eastern edge of oahu and doubled back into honolulu alyson finally found herself following the manoa valley road winding up into the rainforested valley among the mountains she arrived at the steel gates and the tunnel the gates were locked she punched the security code and went through the tunnel emerged into a velvet dark valley the place was deserted the greenhouses glinting faintly in the moonlight she opened her purse and took the bag out of it and got out of the car she didnt dare open the bag they were probably dead by now crushed or suffocated but what if they werent what if they started pleading with her that would be worse than if they were dead she stood in the parking lot headlights coming out of the tunnel somebody had followed her she stood there holding the bag frozen in terror caught in the headlights of the corporate bentley chapter waipaka arboretum october pm w hat are you doing here alyson drake said getting out of the bentley he kept the headlights burning on her she blinked in the glare why did you follow me im worried about you alyson very worried im fine we have a lot to do approaching her what she shrank back we have to protect ourselves sharp intake of breath what are you planning he couldnt allow the blame to fall on himself on her but not on himself he had begun to form an idea there was a way to get this done there is a reason for their disappearance you know he said to her what are you talking about vin a plausible reason why they vanish a reason other than you and me whats the reason alcohol what he grabbed her hand and dragged her toward the greenhouse saying theyre penurious students no money always trying to save their pennies they want to have a party get wasted but they dont have any money so where do poor science students go when they want to get wasted for free where the lab of course he unlocked the door flicked on the lights the bulbs came on in banks overhead one after another down the long expanse of the lab revealing benches of exotic plants potted orchids beneath hanging mistmakers and in the corner shelf after shelf of bottles and jugs full of reagents he pulled out a plastic gallon jug labeled ethanol whats that she said lab alcohol he said is that your idea yes he said you buy vodka or tequila at a store you get seventy eighty ninety proof this stuff here is double that its a hundred and ninetysix proof its almost pure alcohol and vin was picking up plastic cups handing them to her alcohol causes car accidents especially among young people she groaned uhh vin he was watching her carefully okay lets call a spade a spade he said you dont have the stomach for it well no and neither do i thats the truth she blinked confused you dont no i dont i cant stand this alyson i dont want to go through with this he said i dont want this on my conscience thenwhat will we do she said he allowed a look of doubt of uncertainty to fill his face i dont know he said shaking his head mournfully probably we never should have started this and nowi just dont know he hoped his expression of uncertainty was convincing he knew he could be convincing he paused then reached down and took her hand and held it up to the light in her hand was the paper bag rolled up theyre in there arent they what do you want me to do her hand was shaking go outside and wait for me he said i need a few minutes to think we have to come up with a solution to this alyson no more killing let alyson kill them even if she doesnt know shes killing them she nodded silently i need your help alyson i will she said ill help you i will thank you heartfelt she went outside he entered the greenhouse and went to a storage cabinet where he found a box of nitrile safety gloves tough lab gloves stronger than rubber he pulled out two gloves and stuffed them in his pocket then he hurried into a side office and turned on the surveillance monitor overlooking the parking lot it was a nightvision camera flaring green and black of course everything was recorded he watched as alyson went outside and stood near the cars looking at the bag and pacing he could almost see the idea forming in her mind do it vin whispered the field teams had had horrendous problems four employees had died in fern gully alone and they had been heavily armedand there was the problem of the bends these kids wouldnt last an hour in this biological hell after that it would be a matter of getting alyson on his sidetemporarily she was walking away from the cars yes toward the forest yes she went downhill following the trail down into fern gully good keep going on the monitor her shape faded into the blackness she was going downslope down into the depths of the forest he lost track of her then a starlike point of light came on she had a flashlight shed turned it on now he watched the light as it went back and forth getting fainter she was zigzagging on a switchback trail the deeper into biological hell the better suddenly he heard a scream panicked shrieks coming from the darkness of the forest christ he turned away from the monitor and ran outdoors even though the moon was up in the depths of the rain forest it was so dark it was hard to see her he hurried down the trail stumbling and slipping heading toward her flashlight and heard her saying i dont know i dont know her voice soft in the gloom she was shining the beam around alyson he paused waiting for his eyes to adjust what dont you know i dont know what happened she was a dark shape holding the bag out in front of her as if it was an offering from a dark god i dont know how they got away here look she shone the flashlight on the bag he saw a jagged cut running along the bottom of the bag it was a fine cut one of them had a knife he said i guess and they jumped or fell i guess yes where right around here i first noticed it here i havent moved since i didnt want to step on them i wouldnt worry about that theyre probably dead already he took her flashlight crouched down swung it along the tops of the ferns he was looking for disturbances in the shimmering dew that coated the ferns he saw nothing she started to cry its not your fault alyson i know sobbing i was going to let them go i figured im sorry but i was going to do it vin put his arm around her not your fault alyson thats what matters did you see any sign of them with the flashlight no he shook his head its a big fall and they dont have much mass they could have been blown a considerable distance then they might still be they might yes but its doubtful we should look for them but at night alyson we might step on them by accident we cant just leave them here you know the fall almost certainly killed them now i believe you alyson when you tell me that you didnt cut the bag open and dump them out what are you saying but the police may not believe your story so readily you could already be implicated in erics death and now thisdumping those kids in the most dangerous placeintentionally thats murder alyson well youll tell the police the truth of course he said but why should they believe me either the fact is alyson we have only one way to go here and that is to continue on the plan we started their disappearance has to be explained as an accident then if they reappear miraculously later onwell hawaii is a magical place wonderful place miracles happen here she stood very still in the darkness we should just leave them we can look tomorrow in daylight he squeezed her shoulder pulled her close to him he shone the flashlight down here lets follow the path we can see whats ahead and we can leave safely then well come back tomorrow but right now we have to deal with the car okay one thing at a time alyson still sobbing she allowed herself to be led out of the forest back to the parking lot vin drake checked his watch it was pm there was still time to carry out the next stage of his plan chapter waipaka arboretum october pm the students were jostled inside the paper bag every movement of alysons magnified and accompanied by a loud rasping sound as they scraped back and forth across the paper peter never realized that ordinary brown paper was so rough it felt almost like sandpaper to his skin he saw that the others had all managed to face inward so they didnt abrade their faces as they slid back and forth they had been driven somewhere and it had taken a long time but where were they and what would be done to them it was hard to talk as they fell this way and that and difficult to come up with a plan when everybody was talking at the same time the nanigen man jarel kinsky kept repeating that there had been some mistake if there was some way i could talk with mr drake kinsky said get over it karen king snapped at him but i cant believe mr drake would justkill us kinsky said oh really karen said kinsky didnt answer the bigger problem was that they didnt know what vin or alyson were up to they had been driven around in a car but where had the car ended up it made no sense then vin and alyson seemed to reach an agreement their exact conversation was impossible to follow and alyson carried the bag outdoors into darkness whats this karen king said alarmed as they were carried along whats going on they heard a booming sound it was a snuffle alyson bender i have the feeling she wants to save us peter jansen said vin will never allow it karen said i know i think we better take things into our own hands karen said she produced her knife unfolded it now hold on danny minot said this is a decision we have to reach together i dont know about that karen said cause ive got the knife dont be a child minot said dont be a coward we act or they act on us and they kill us which is it she didnt wait for danny to answer she turned to peter how far above ground do you think we are right now i dont know maybe four and a half feet hundred and thirtyseven centimeters erika moll said and whats our mass peter laughed not very much youre laughing danny minot said amazed you people are insane compared to our normal size a drop of four and a half feet is the equivalent of uh four hundred and fifty feet erika said say the height of a fortyfivestory building and no this would not be the equivalent of a fall from a fortyfivestory building of course it would danny said isnt it great when the science studies people dont know any science erika said peter explained its a little issue of air resistance no that doesnt matter danny said through clenched teeth clearly stung by the criticism because objects fall in a gravitational field at the same rate irrespective of mass a penny and a piano fall at the same rate hit the ground at the same time nothing can be done for him karen said and we have to make a decision now the jostling in the bag had slowed alyson was making up her mind to do something i dont think the distance we fall matters very much peter jansen said he had been trying to figure out the physics of being very small it was all about gravity and inertia peter said whats important is newtons equation for enough i say we jump karen interrupted jump jenny said jump amar said oh god danny moaned but we dont know where we are jump erika said this is our only chance rick hutter said jump jump peter said okay karen said im going to run along this seam at the bottom and cut it open try to stay close together imagine youre skydivers arms and legs wide a human kite here we gooo but just a minute danny yelled too late karen shouted good luck peter felt her brush past him the knife in her hand and a moment later the paper bag tilted beneath his feet and he fell into darkness the air was surprisingly cool and wet and the night was brighter now that he was outside the bag he could see the trees around him and the ground below as he fell toward it he fell surprisingly fastalarmingly fastand for a moment he wondered if they had collectively made a calculation error out of their shared dislike for danny they knew of course that air resistance was always a factor in the speed of falling objects in daily life you didnt think about it because most things in life presented similar air resistance a fivepound barbell and a tenpound barbell would fall at the same rate same thing for a human being and an elephant theyd fall at pretty much the same rate but the students were now so small that air resistance did matter and they had collectively guessed that the effect of air resistance would overcome the effect of mass in other words they would not fall at their fullsize speed they hoped now with the wind whistling in his ears tears blurring his eyes as he fell downward peter clenched his teeth and wiped his eyes and tried to see where he was headed he looked around and could not see any of the others falling through the air though he heard a soft moan in the darkness looking back to the ground he saw he was closing in on a broadleafed plant like a giant elephant ear he tried to spread his arms wide and shift his position so he would hit the leaf in the center he hit it perfectly he smacked into the elephant earcold wet slipperyand he felt the leaf bend beneath him then rise back up and in a swift movement toss him back into the air like a tumbler on a trampoline he yelled in surprise and when he came down again he landed near the edge of the leaf spun and slid on the waterslick surface down to the far tip and fell in darkness he hit another leaf beneath but it was hard to see down here and he again rolled down toward the tip of the leaf he clawed at the green surface trying to halt his inevitable descent it was to no availhe fellhit another leaffelland finally landed on his back in a bed of wet moss where he lay gasping and frightened staring up at the canopy of leaves high above which blotted out the sky you just going to lie there he looked over it was karen king standing over him are you hurt she said no he said then get up he struggled to his feet he noticed she didnt help him he was unsteady standing in the wet moss which leaked through his sneakers his feet were cold and wet stand over here she said it was as if she was talking to a child he moved to stand beside her on a patch of dry ground where are the others somewhere around here it may take some time peter nodded looking at the jungle floor from his new perspective half an inch above the ground the jungle floor was incredibly rugged mosscovered stumps of rotted limbs rose like skyscrapers and fallen branchestwigs reallymade ragged arcs twenty or thirty feet above the ground even the dead leaves on the floor were larger than he was and whenever he took a step they shifted moving around him and beneath his feet it was like trying to move through a rotten organic junkyard and of course everything was wet everything was slippery and often slimy where exactly had they landed they had been driven around for a long time they could be anywhere on oahuanywhere there was a forest at least karen jumped up on a large twig nearly fell off got her balance and sat on it her legs dangling down then she put her fingers in her mouth and gave a piercing whistle they should all hear that she whistled again just then something bulky and dark in color crunched out of the undergrowth at first they couldnt see what it was but the moonlight revealed a gigantic beetle jet black moving past in a surefooted gait its compound eyes gleamed faintly it was covered with jointed black armor and had spiky hairs bristling from its legs karen drew her legs up respectfully as the beetle crawled below the twig she was perched on erika moll pushed her way out through a spray of plant stems dripping wet well she said its probably a metromenus a ground crawler it doesnt fly dont disturb itits a carnivore its got jaws and im sure its got a nasty chemical spray too they didnt want to get drenched with chemicals or become the beetles next meal they stopped talking and became very still while the beetle poked along evidently hunting suddenly the beetle charged forward running remarkably fast and seized something small in its jaws which struggled thrashing around in the darkness they couldnt see what the beetle had caught but they could hear crunching sounds as it chopped up its prey they got a whiff of something sharp and very nasty we are smelling the beetles defensive chemicals erika moll commented its acetic acidthats vinegarand maybe decyl acetate i believe the bitter stench is benzoquinone the chemicals are stored in sacs in the beetles abdomen and may circulate in the beetles blood too they watched the beetle move off into the night dragging its prey thats a superior evolutionary design better than ours at least for this place erika added armor jaws chemical weaponry and lots of legs peter said yeah way more legs erika said most animals that walk the earth have at least six legs as she knew those additional appendages made maneuvering over rough terrain easier all insects had six legs and there were close to a million named insect species many scientists suspected that another thirty million insects were just waiting to be named which made the insects the most varied life form on earth apart from microscopic organisms such as viruses and bacteria insects erika said to the others have been incredibly successful at colonizing the land areas of the planet we think they look primitive peter said we think fewer legs is a sign of intelligence because we walk on two legs we think it makes us smarter and better than an animal that walks on four or six legs karen pointed to the underbrush until we face this and then we want more legs they heard a scratching sound and a rotund shape emerged from under a leaf it looked like a mole and was rubbing its nose with both hands briskly this sucks it said spitting dirt it still wore its tweed jacket danny i never agreed to be half an inch tall okay size matters i already knew that what are we going to do for starters you could stop whining karen said to danny we have to formulate a plan we have to take stock take stock of what our weapons weapons whats the matter with you two we dont have any weapons danny said starting to shout we have nothing thats not true karen said calmly she turned to peter ive got a backpack she jumped off the twig and grabbed the pack on the ground lifted it up i took it just before drake shrunk us did rick make it somebody asked you bet came a voice from the darkness somewhere to their left this doesnt faze me and neither does the jungle at night when i was doing research in the field in costa rica thats rick peter said anyone else from above there was a thwap and the splatter of water droplets and jenny linn slid down a leaf and landed at their feet you took your time karen said got caught on a branch about ten feet up had to work myself free jenny sat crosslegged on the ground and immediately jumped to her feet whoa everythings wet its a rain forest rick hutter said emerging from foliage behind them his jeans were drenched everybody okay he grinned how you doing danny boy fuck off danny said he was still rubbing his nose oh come on rick said get into the spirit of the thing he pointed to the moonlight streaking down through the canopy of trees overhead were talking science studies isnt this the perfect conradian moment an existential confrontation of man facing raw nature the real heart of darkness unfettered by false beliefs and literary conceits somebody tell him to shut up rick leave the guy alone peter said no no not so fast rick said because this is important what is it about nature that is so terrifying to the modern mind why is it so intolerable because nature is fundamentally indifferent its unforgiving uninterested if you live or die succeed or fail feel pleasure or pain it doesnt care thats intolerable to us how can we live in a world so indifferent to us so we redefine nature we call it mother nature when its not a parent in any real sense of the term we put gods in trees and air and the ocean we put them in our households to protect us we need these human gods for many things luck health freedom but one thing above allone reason stands outwe need the gods to protect us from loneliness but why is loneliness so intolerable we cant stand to be alonewhy not because human beings are children thats why but those are all disguises we create for nature you know how danny loves to tell us that the science narrative privileges the balance of power how theres no objective truth except for whos got the power power tells the story and everyone accepts it as truth because power rules he took a breath but whos got the balance of power now danny can you feel it take a deep breath feel it no then ill tell you the balance of power lies in the hands of the entity that always holds the balance of powernature nature danny not us all we can do is go for the ride and try to hang on peter threw his arm around rick and steered him away thats okay for now rick i hate that fucking guy rick said were all a little scared not me rick said im cool i love being half an inch tall thats bite size for a bird and thats what i am im a freaking hors doeuvre for a mynah bird and my chances of surviving another six hours are about one in four maybe one in five we must make a plan karen said her voice calm amar singh appeared around a log to the left covered with mud his shirt torn he seemed remarkably calm peter asked everybody okay they said they were the nanigen guy peter said hey kinsky are you around all along jarel kinsky answered softly close by he had been sitting underneath a leaf his legs drawn up motionless and saying nothing watching and listening to the others are you all right peter asked him you want to keep your voices down kinsky said speaking to the students as a whole they can hear better than we can they jenny said insects silence fell over the group thats better kinsky said they began talking in whispers peter said to kinsky any idea where we are i think so kinsky answered look over there they turned and looked a distant light was shining in that direction buried in the trees the light cast a glow down along the corner of a wooden building just visible through the foliage and the light reflected off panes of glass thats the greenhouse kinsky went on were at the waipaka arboretum oh god jenny linn said were miles from nanigen she sat down on a leaf and felt something moving under her feet the movement went on and on ceaselessly nudging and bumping at her feet and then something small crawled up her leg she plucked it off and tossed it away it was a soil mite an eightlegged creature and harmless she realized that the soil was full of tiny organisms all going about their business the ground is alive under our feet she said peter jansen knelt down brushed a small worm from his knee and faced jarel kinsky what do you know about being shrunk like this the term is dimensionally changed kinsky answered ive never been dimensionally changed until now of course ive talked with the field teams rick hutter broke in i wouldnt trust anything this guy says hes loyal to drake wait peter said calmly what are the field teams he asked kinsky nanigen has been sending teams into the microworld three people on a team kinsky answered in a whisper he seemed very afraid of making noise theyre dimensionally changed half an inch tall they operate the digging machinery and collect samples they live in the supply stations jenny linn said you mean those tiny tents we saw yes the teams never stay here for more than fortyeight hours you begin to get sick if you stay changed for much longer than that sick what do you mean peter asked you get the microbends kinsky said microbends peter said its an illness that develops in people who are dimensionally changed the first symptoms appear in about three to four days what happens wellwe have some data on the disease not much the safety staff began testing animals in the tensor generator they shrank mice at first they kept the shrunken mice in tiny flasks and studied them with a microscope after a few days all the shrunken mice died the mice were hemorrhaging next they shrank rabbits and finally dogs again the animals died with hemorrhages necropsies of the animals after theyd been restored to normal size showed that there was generalized bleeding at sites of injury small cuts bled profusely and there was internal bleeding as well it was discovered that the blood of the animals lacked clotting factors essentially the animals had died of hemophiliathats the inability of the blood to form clots we think that the sizechange disrupts enzymatic pathways in the clotting process but we dont really know but we also found that an animal could live for a short while in a shrunken state as long as the animal was brought back to normal size within a couple of days we began calling the illness microbends because it reminded us of the bends in scuba diving as long as an animals time in the shrunken state was limited the animal seemed to be healthy next there were several human volunteers including the man whod designed the tensor generator his name was rourke i think humans could live for a few days in the microworld with no ill effects it seemed but then there wasan accident the generator broke down and we lost three scientists they got trapped in the microworld and couldnt be returned to normal size one of the fatalities was the guy who designed the generator since then weve had otherproblems if a person is stressed or suffers a major injury the microbends can come on very suddenly and sooner than usual so we have lostmoreemployees thats why mr drake halted operations while we try to learn how to keep people from dying in the microworld you see mr drake really does care about safety whats the disease like in humans rick interrupted kinsky went on it begins with bruises especially on your arms and legs if you have a cut you can bleed endlessly its like hemophiliayou can bleed to death from a small cut at least thats what im hearing but theyre keeping the details pretty quiet kinsky said i just run the generator is there any treatment peter asked the only treatment is decompression get the person restored to full size as soon as possible were in trouble danny murmured we need to do an inventory of our assets now karen said decisively she laid the backpack shed grabbed in the generator room on top of a dead leaf with only the moonlight to see by she opened the pack and spread various things out on the leaf as if it were a table they gathered around and checked the contents carefully the backpack contained a firstaid kit including antibiotics and basic medications a knife a short length of rope a reel rather like a fishing reel which was attached to a belt a windproof lighter a silver space blanket a thin waterproof tent a waterbackpackers headlamp there was also a pair of headsets with throat mikes attached to them those are twoway radios kinsky said for communicating with headquarters there was also a veryfinemesh ladder and keys or starter controls for some kind of machine not present karen put everything but the lamp back into the pack and zipped it shut pretty useless karen said getting to her feet and putting on the headlamp she switched it on casting the light around playing it over the plants and leaves we really need weapons your lightplease turn it off kinsky muttered it attracts things what kind of weapons do we need amar asked karen say danny interrupted as if something had just occurred to him are there poisonous snakes in hawaii no peter said there are no snakes at all not many scorpions either certainly not in the rain forest its too wet for them here karen king added there is a hawaiian centipede that can deliver a nasty sting to a human being it could certainly kill us at our present dimension in fact a great many animals can kill us birds toads all sorts of insects ants wasps and hornets you were talking about weapons karen peter said we need some kind of projectile weapon karen said something that can kill at a distance a blowgun rick broke in karen shook her head nah it would be a tenth of an inch long no good wait karen i could use a hollow piece of bamboo i could use it fullsize half an inch long peter said and a wooden dart to fit in it sure rick said the dart sharpened by heat amar said as the tempering agent but for poison curare peter said getting up looking around i bet lots of plants around here have rick interrupted thats my specialty if we could make a fire we could boil bark and plant materials and extract poison and especially if we can find some piece of metal ironto make a dart point my belt buckle amar said and then what boil the stuff then test it that takes a long time its the only way what about using the skin of a frog erika moll said in the night they heard the croaking of what seemed to be bullfrogs all around them peter shook his head we dont have the right kind here what youre hearing are bufos large toads theyre the size of your fist well your old fist theyre gray not brightly colored they do manufacture unpleasant skin toxins theyre called bufotenins not curarebased compounds of the central american all right for christs sake danny snapped just explaining we get the picture erika put her arm around peters shoulder nodded to danny he was still fussing with his nose scratching at it with both hands holding them curved as if they were little paws as if he were a mole cracking up erika whispered fearfully peter nodded amar said to continue the poison you recommend watching danny peter said bark scrapings of strychnos toxifera tree add oleander sap not leaf include chondrodendron tomentosum if its available boil the mixture for at least twentyfour hours lets get started karen king said we could find these plants a lot more easily in the morning light jenny linn said whats the rush the rush karen said is those halogen lamps back at the entrance right now vin drake could be heading here to kill us she swung the pack over her shoulders and tightened the straps so lets get started chapter alapuna road october am in bright moonlight they hadnt much cover the dense hau bush that clung to the cliff side stopped at the level of the dirt road and it was only too easy to see the two cars driving along the narrow volcanic ridge to the left the land sloped down gently to agricultural fields to the right a steep cliff ended at crashing surf on the north shore of oahu alyson drove the first car the bentley convertible whenever she hesitated vin drake waved her on from the second car the bmw they still had a distance to go to reach the washedout bridge finally he could see it in the moonlight creamcolored concrete from the s amazing it had lasted that long alyson stopped and started to get out of the car no no he said waving her back in you have to dress it dress it yes the students are all jammed into the bentley remember theyre partying he was carrying a laundry bag full of clothes and other items hed collected from what the students had left in the front office and in the bentley parked at nanigen several phones shorts tshirts bathing suits a towel a couple of rolledup issues of nature and science a tablet computershe started tossing the things at random around the car no no he said alyson please we have to decide where everyone was sitting im nervous very well we still have to do it itll all get messed up when you push it over the cliff alyson we still have to do it but the policethe bodies will be missing they wont be in the car the water is full of rip currents and sharks the sea swallows the dead thats why were doing it this way alyson okay okay she answered wearily whos back rear danny she got out a sweater and a wellthumbed conrad novel chance are you sure vin seems like a setup has his name in it all right whos next to him jenny she feels sorry for him a delicate printed scarf a belt of white python shoved back expensive isnt that illegal python just in california then peter jansens glasses a pair he was always losing erika molls bathing suit and a pair of board shorts they went on to finish dressing the front seat with karen king driving then vin drake splashed lab alcohol over the back of the car cracked the bottle dropped it in the front where it would catch under the dashboard dont want to overdo it he looked around at the fleecy clouds in dark blue the white surf far below beautiful night he said shaking his head beautiful world we live in he walked to the left side of the car and surveyed it from a distance theres a downslope just ahead he said drive a few yards until you hit the downslope and then you can get out and we can push the rest hey alyson held up her hands i uhi dont want to get in there again vin dont be silly were talking ten feet of driving just ten feet but what if something nothing will happen why dont you drive to the downslope vin alyson a firm eye in the darkness im taller id have to move the seat back it would look suspicious in a police investigation but we agreed he opened the door for her come on now she hesitated we agreed alyson she got behind the wheel shivering despite the evening warmth now put up the top he said the top why she asked to keep everything in the car she turned on the engine pressed a button and the bentleys top rose and folded over vin stood some distance away and with his hand indicated for her to move the car forward the car tilted downward slid a few feetshe yelpedthen it skidded to a stop okay perfect vin said reaching into his pocket for the nitrile lab gloves keep it there in park engine on he came forward and she started to get out she didnt hear the snapping sounds as he drew on the gloves in a swift movement he slammed the door shut locked it reached in through the window and grabbed her by the hair with both hands he slammed her head against the metal of the windshield frame where there was less padding she started to scream but he pounded her head again and again then he banged her forehead on the steering wheel a few times to be sure she was still conscious but that wouldnt matter for long he reached across her back and jerked the car into drive it was awkward he fell backward as the bentley rolled past him over the broken bridge and then twisting dropping six hundred feet to the river and ocean below drake scrambled to his feet he was too late to see the impact yet he heard it the rending of metal against stone the convertible had landed upside down and he watched for a while to see if there was any movement from beneath one wheel spun loosely but otherwise nothing trust is everything alyson he said softly and turned away peeling off the gloves he had left his own car a hundred yards back and the dirt path was rockhard dry and would take no tire impressions he got in his car and backed slowly down the narrow pathno mistakes nowuntil he found a space wide enough to turn his car around then he headed south back to honolulu it would be several days before the police discovered the fallen car and he should probably hurry things along hed call in the morning to report that his graduate students were missing and he was worried about them theyd been taken for a night on the town by the lovely ms alyson bender as for wider publicity reaching back to cambridge and boston vin drake had few fears hawaii would be helpful in this regard hawaii was a tourist destination traditionally reluctant to report how many visitors died from rogue waves strong surf crumbling hiking trails and the other attractions of the beautiful outdoors the cambridge story would play for a few days particularly since several of the kids were attractive but inevitably it would be replaced by juicier fare austrian princess dies in helicopter skiing on mount rainier divers lost off tasmania texas millionaire dies at khumbu base camp freak cinqueterra accident tourist eaten by giant komodo lizard there was always juicier news it would pass of course there would be difficulties inside the company itself this visit was to have been a major addition to nanigen staffing a very needed addition too because of the recent losses of staff and therefore it would have been a major boost to his company he would have to finesse this matter with skill the sports car scraped and lurched along the dirt road he gripped the wheel firmly he was heading south to kaena point where souls leave the planet and the surf raged up on both sides of the trail he made a mental note to wash the salt water off his car and tires better to take it to a standard car wash over in pearl city he checked his watch three thirty am oddly enough he felt no urgency no nervousness there was time enough to get back to the other side of the island to waikiki near diamond head and time enough to check the kids hotel rooms for artifacts scientific objets they had brought with them and then plenty of time for vin to drive back to his own luxurious apartment on the kahala side and slide into bed so he could awaken shocked to learn of the absurd behavior of his chief financial officer and the talented students she had led astray chapter manoa valley october am the seven students and kinsky walked through the forest singlefile listening watching steeped in darkness and deep shadow and enveloped in alien sounds as rick hutter moved along stumbling his way among leaves on the ground and scrambling under dead branches that seemed bigger than fallen redwoods he held a homemade grass spear across his shoulder karen king wore the backpack and kept her knife gripped in her hand peter jansen led the group on point peering around trying to pick a route somehow in his quiet way peter jansen had become the leader they were not using the headlamp for they didnt want to attract any predators peter couldnt see much of the terrain in front of him the moon has gone down he said dawn must be jenny linn began a terrible cry drowned her out it began as a low wail and rose into a series of throaty shrieks coming from the depths somewhere above it was an eerie sound dripping with violence rick spun around holding his spear up what the hell was that a bird singing i think peter said were hearing sounds at a lower pitch he looked at his watch am it was a digital watch it was running normally even when shrunk dawns coming he said if we could find a supply station we could try to call nanigen on the radio jarel kinsky suggested if they heard our signal they would rescue us drake would kill us peter said kinsky didnt argue but it was clear he didnt agree with peter peter went on we have to get ourselves into the tensor generator so that we can be restored to full size to do that we have to get back to nanigen somehow but i think it would be a mistake to ask drake for help can we call danny broke in great idea danny just tell us how rick said scornfully jarel kinsky explained that the radios in the supply stations only had a range of about a hundred feet if somebody from nanigen is nearby and listening at the right frequency they can communicate with us otherwise nobody will pick up our signal and the radios he explained didnt broadcast on any frequency that the police or emergency services used anyway the nanigen microsized radios broadcast at around seventy gigahertz kinsky explained thats a very high frequency it works well for the field teams over short distances but its useless for longdistance communication jenny linn said when drake was showing us around the arboretum he mentioned theres a shuttle truck that goes to nanigen from here from manoa valley we could stow away on the truck everybody fell silent jenny had come up with what sounded like a good idea indeed as they thought about it vin drake had mentioned a shuttle truck but if the field teams had been withdrawn from the microworld would the shuttle still be running peter turned to jarel kinsky is the shuttle truck still making runs to nanigen do you know i dont know what time does the truck normally arrive at the arboretum two oclock kinsky answered where does it stop the parking lot next to the greenhouse everybody absorbed that thinking about it i think jens right we should try to get on that truck peter said get ourselves back to nanigen then try to get into the tensor generator waithow the hell are we going to climb up onto a truck when were this small rick hutter demanded he faced peter jansen its a crazy plan what if theres no truck nanigen is fifteen miles from here were a hundred times smaller than we used to be think about it it means that one mile is like a hundred miles for us if its fifteen miles from here to nanigen thats really like fifteen hundred miles for us basically we have to do what lewis and clark did and we have to do it in less than four days or well die of the bends its a shitty bet guys ricks idea is to wring his hands and give up karen said rick turned on her angrily we need to get practical youre not being practical youre whining karen said to him peter tried to defuse the argument he put himself between rick and karen figuring he could make himself a target of their wrath rather than let them continue to pick at each other please he said putting his hand on ricks shoulder arguing isnt going to help anybody lets take things one step at a time the group set off again walking in silence half an inch tall on the forest floor they had difficulty seeing much of anything even as the sun rose ferns thick and abundant grew everywhere and were especially difficult to deal with for they blocked the view and created deep shadows they lost sight of the greenhouse building and couldnt find any recognizable landmarks still they kept moving the sun broke forth and beams of light slanted through the forest canopy in the daylight they saw the soil more clearly it was churning with small organismsnematode worms soil mites and other little abundant creatures this is what jenny linn had felt wriggling against her feet in the dark the soil mites were very small spiderlike creatures of many different species crawling around or hiding in cracks in the soil the mites would have been almost invisible to the naked eye of a normalsize person but in relation to the microhumans the soil mites were much larger to the microhumans the mites appeared to be anywhere from the size of grains of rice up to the size of golf balls many of the mites had small eggshaped bodies covered with thick armor and spiky hairs the mites were arachnids karen king the arachnologist kept stopping to gaze at them she didnt recognize a single mite they all seemed to be unknown a vast number of different kinds of mites she couldnt get over the richness of nature here was biodiversity as far as the eye could see the mites were everywhere they reminded her of crabs on a rocky seashore small and harmless busy and scuttling carrying on their small hidden lives she picked up a mite and set it down on the palm of her hand the creature seemed so delicate so perfect karen felt her spirits lifting what was going on to her surprise she realized that she felt happy in this strange new world i dont know why she said but i feel like ive been searching all my life to find a place like this its like im coming home not me danny said the mite walked up karens arm exploring it watch out it could bite you jenny linn said not this little guy karen answered see his mouth parts theyre adapted for sucking up detritusdead stuff he eats crud how do you know its a he karen pointed to the mites abdomen penis a guys a guy no matter how small jenny remarked as they hiked along karen grew animated mites are incredible theyre highly specialized many mites are parasites and theyre particular about their hosts theres a kind of mite that lives only on the eyeballs of a certain fruit batnowhere else theres another mite that lives only on the anus of a sloth please karen danny erupted get over it danny its just nature about half of all people on earth have mites living in their eyelashes many insects get mites on them too in fact there are mites that live on other mitesso even mites get mites danny sat down and pulled a mite off his ankle little monster chewed a hole in my sock must be a detritus eater jenny said thats not funny jenny anybody want to try my natural latex skin cream rick hutter said maybe itll keep the mites off they stopped and rick took out a plastic lab bottle and passed it around they rubbed small amounts of the cream on their faces hands and cuffs it had a pungent smell and it worked it did seem to repel mites for amar singh the reality of the microworld seemed to assault his senses he noted that being small even changed the sensations he felt on his skin his first impression of the microworld involved the feeling of air flowing over his face and hands tugging at his shirt and ruffling his hair the air seemed thicker almost syrupy and he could feel every ripple of breeze as the air coiled and flowed around his body he waved his arm and felt the air sliding between his fingers moving through the air in the microworld was a bit like swimming because their bodies were so small the friction of air passing over their bodies became more pronounced amar staggered a little feeling a puff of air pushing him sideways were going to have to get our sea legs in this place he said to the others its like learning how to walk all over again the others were having similar difficulties staggering feeling the air tugging at them and sometimes miscalculating the steps they took trying to jump up on something they would jump too far their bodies were clearly stronger in the microworld but they hadnt learned how to control their movements it felt like moonwalking we dont know our own strength jenny said she gathered herself leaped high and grabbed the edge of a leaf in both hands she hung by her hands for a moment then from only one handit was easy she let go and fell back to the ground rick hutter had taken a turn wearing the backpack though it was loaded with gear he discovered he could jump up and down pretty easily even with the pack onand he got himself fairly high in the air without much effort our bodies are stronger and lighter in this world because gravitys no big deal here small has its advantages peter remarked i dont see them danny minot said as for amar singh a feeling of dread crept over him what lived among these leaves meateaters they were manylegged animals with jointed armor and unusual ways to kill prey amar had been raised in a devout hindu familyhis parents immigrants from india whod settled in new jersey did not eat meat he had seen his father open a window and chase a fly out rather than kill it amar had always been a vegetarian he had never been able to eat animals for protein he believed that all animals were capable of suffering including insects in the laboratory he worked with plants not animals now in the jungle he wondered if he would have to kill an animal and eat its meat in order to survive or whether an animal would eat him were protein amar said thats all we are just protein whats that supposed to mean rick asked him were meat walking on two legs you sound kind of gloomy amar im being a realist at leastits interesting jenny linn remarked jenny noted the smell of the microworld it had a smell all its own a complicated earthy scent filled her nose and it wasnt bad actually quite nice in a way it was an odor of soil mixed with a thousand unknown scents some sweet some musky drifting in the liquid air many of the smells were pleasant even lovely like exquisite perfumes were smelling pheromones the signaling chemicals that animals and plants use for communication jenny said to the others its the invisible language of nature it lifted her spiritshere she could experience the full spectrum of scents in the natural world for the first time this revelation both thrilled her and made her feel afraid jenny held a chunk of soil up to her nose and sniffed it it was teeming with tiny nematode worms and numerous mites and several plump little creatures called water bears and it smelled faintly like antibiotics she knew why the soil was full of bacteria and many of the bacteria were different kinds of streptomyces you can smell streptomyces jenny said to the others theyre one of the types of bacteria that make antibiotics modern antibiotics are derived from them the soil was also laced with thin threads of fungus known as hyphae jenny pulled a fungal thread out of the soil it was stiff but slightly stretchy a cubic inch of soil could hold several miles of these threads of fungus something drifted past jens eyes falling downward through the thick air it was a small nugget the size of a peppercorn studded with knobs what on earth is that she said stopping in her tracks to watch it the nugget landed at her feet another fell slowly past she put out her hand and caught it in her palm then rolled it between thumb and forefinger it was tough and hard like a small nut its pollen she said with wonder she looked up there was a hibiscus tree overhead bursting into a profusion of white flowers like a cloud for some reason she could not explain her heart leaped at the sight of it for a few moments jenny linn felt glad to be very small i think its kind ofwonderful here jenny said turning slowly around looking up at the clouds of flowers while a steady snow of pollen fell around her i never imagined this jenny we need to keep moving peter jansen had stopped to wait for her and was shepherding people along as for erika moll the entomologist she did not feel happy at all she was experiencing a growing sensation of fear she knew enough about insects to be extremely afraid of them right now they have armor and we dont erika thought their armor is made of chitin its bioplastic armor light and supertough she ran her fingers over her arm feeling the delicacy of her skin the downy hair were soft she thought were edible she didnt say anything to the others but felt a choking sense of terror seething below the surface of her calm she was afraid her fear would betray her that she would lose control of herself in a panic erika moll compressed her lips and clenched her hands and trying to keep her fear under control kept walking peter jansen called for a halt they rested sitting on the edges of leaves peter wanted to pick jarel kinskys brain kinsky knew a lot about the tensor generator since he operated it if they could somehow get themselves back to nanigen and could get themselves inside the tensor generator room would they be able to operate the machine how would they do it if they were tiny peter asked kinsky would we need to get help from a normalsize person to run the machine kinsky looked doubtful im not sure he said and poked at the ground with a grass spear i heard a rumor that the man who designed the tensor generator put a smallsize emergency control in it that a microhuman can operate i presume this tiny control panel is somewhere in the control room ive looked for it but ive never found it theres nothing in the engineering drawings either but if we could find the tiny control panel i can operate it well need your help peter said kinsky lifted the spear from the soil and gazed at a mite that walked along the spear waving its forelegs all i want is to get home to my family he said softly and shook his spear tossing the mite away your boss couldnt care less about your family rick hutter snapped at kinsky rick doesnt have a family danny minot whispered to jenny linn he doesnt even have a girlf rick lunged at danny who scrambled away shouting you cant solve a problem with violence rick it would solve you rick muttered peter took rick by the shoulder and squeezed it restraining him as if to say stay cool to kinsky he said are there any other possibilities for getting back to nanigen besides the shuttle truck which might not exist kinsky bowed his head thinking after some time he said wellwe could try to get to tantalus base whats tantalus base its a bioprospecting facility in tantalus crater on the mountain ridge above this valley kinsky pointed vaguely toward the mountain which was only a green shape barely visible through gaps in the tangled forest the base is somewhere up there jenny linn said vin drake mentioned tantalus during the tour i remember karen said is the base open peter asked kinsky i dont think so people died at tantalus there were predators what kind karen demanded wasps i heard but kinsky went on musingly there were microplanes at tantalus base microplanes small aircraft our size could we fly to nanigen i dont know what the range of these aircraft is kinsky answered i dont know if any of them were left at the base how far above us is tantalus base its two thousand feet above manoa valley kinsky answered two thousand feet up rick hutter exploded thatsimpossible for people our size kinsky shrugged the others said nothing peter jansen took charge okay heres what i think we should do first lets try to find a supply station and take what we can from it then well try to get to the parking lot well wait there for the shuttle truck we have to get back there as soon as possible its obvious were going to die danny minot said his voice cracking we cant just do nothing danny peter said trying to keep his voice evensounding he sensed danny could break down into a panic at the drop of a hat and that would be dangerous for the whole group the others went along with peters plan some of them grumblingbut nobody had a better idea they took turns drinking water from a dewdrop on a leaf and began moving again looking for a trail a tent or any trace of human presence small plants near the ground arched over them sometimes forming tunnels they wound their way through the tunnels and wandered past the trunks of stupendous trees but there was no sign of a supply station okay so were going to bleed to death if we dont get the hell out of here fast rick hutter said as they hiked along and we cant find a damn supply station plus weve got a psychopathic giant looking to kill us and ive got a blister is there anything else i need to worry about he asked sounding very sarcastic ants kinsky replied calmly ants danny minot broke in his voice quavering what about ants ants are a problem ive heard kinsky answered rick hutter stopped in front of a large yellow fruit lying on the ground he looked up and all around yes he said thats a chinaberry tree melia azederach the berry is highly poisonous especially to insects and insect larvae it contains around twentyfive different volatiles principally cinnamoyl compounds this berry is absolute death to insects it can be an ingredient for my curare he took off the backpack and stuffed the chinaberry into it the berry filled much of the pack and loomed out of the top of the pack a bright yellow ovoid sort of like a giant melon karen glared at him its going to leak poison nope rick grinned and tapped on the yellow berry tough skin karen gave rick a skeptical look its your life she said curtly the group moved on danny minot kept falling behind his face had gotten red and he kept wiping his forehead with his hands finally he took off his sport coat and threw it to the ground his tassel loafers had gotten coated with mud he sat on a leaf and started scratching inside his shirt and pulled out a single pollen grain and held it between thumb and forefinger does anybody know i have serious allergies if one of these objects gets up my nose i could go into shock karen gave a scornful laugh you arent that allergic if you were youd be dead by now danny flicked it away and the grain danced off spinning as it drifted through the air amar singh couldnt get over the profusion of life the small creatures that seemed to exist in every nook and cranny of the microworld gosh i wish we had a camera i want to document this they were young scientists and the microworld revealed a wonderland of unknown life they suspected they were seeing creatures that had never been noticed or given names you could get a dissertation out of every square foot of this place amar remarked he began thinking he would do just that he could get himself one incredible phd out of this trip if i survive he reminded himself little torpedoshaped creatures with jointed bodies and six legs were crawling about on the ground they were quite small and were all over the place some were sucking up strands of fungus as if they were eating spaghetti as the humans walked along every now and then one of these creatures would get startled make a loud snapping noise and flip high into the air spinning end over end erika moll stopped to examine one of them she picked it up and held it while it struggled snapping its tail with vigorous clicking sounds what are these things rick asked pulling one out of his hair theyre called springtails erika moll said in the normal world she explained springtails are extremely small no bigger than the dot over an i on a page of text she said the animal had a spring mechanism in its abdomen she explained that propelled it long distances helping it escape from predators as if on cue the springtail flung itself off her hand soaring into the air and out of sight beyond a fern springtails kept bouncing into the air as they moved along disturbed by their footsteps peter jansen led the way sweat dripped from his body he realized their bodies were losing moisture fast we need to make sure we drink enough water he said to the others we could dry out really fast they found a clump of moss hung with droplets of dew and they gathered around it they drank from dewdrops cupping the water in their hands the surface of the water was sticky and they had to swat the water to break the surface tension as peter lifted a bit of water to his mouth it heaped up into a blob in his hands they came to a massive tree trunk it soared up from a sprawling buttress of roots as they worked their way around the roots a sharp smell became apparent they began to hear thrumming tapping sounds like rain falling peter who was leading the way climbed on top of a root and came in sight of a pair of low walls snaking across the ground and out of sight the walls were made of bits of dirt stuck together with some kind of dried substance between the walls a column of ants was moving streaming in both directions the walls protected an ant highway in one spot the walls extended into a tunnel peter crouched down and motioned to the others to stop they moved forward cautiously until they were lying on their stomachs and looking down on the ant column were the ants dangerous each ant was nearly as long as his forearm not that big peter thought and he felt relieved for somehow he had expected ants to be much larger than this but there were certainly a lot of them they flowed swiftly by the hundreds along their road and through the little tunnel theyd built their bodies were reddish brown in color and prickly with hair their heads were shining black as black as coal the odor of the ants drifted from the ant highway like exhaust coming from freeway traffic the smell was tart and acidic yet perfumed with a delicate fragrance that sharp smell is formic acid its a defense erika moll explained as she knelt down watching the ants with great intensity jenny linn said the sweet smell is a pheromone its probably the colony scent the ants use that scent to identify each other as members of the same colony erika continued theyre all females theyre all daughters of their queen some of the ants were carrying dead insects or pieces of dismembered insects the food carriers were all traveling in the same direction along the highway toward the left the nest entrance is that way its where theyre carrying the food erika added pointing to the left do you know the species peter asked her erika searched her mind for the name umhawaii doesnt have any native ants all ants in hawaii are invading species theyve arrived here with humans im pretty sure these ones are pheidole megacephala do they have a name in english rick asked im just an ignorant ethnobotanist its called the bigheaded ant erika went on it was found originally on the island of mauritius in the indian ocean but its now spread all over the world its the most common ant in hawaii the bigheaded ant had turned out to be one of the most destructive invasive insects on the planet erika explained the bigheaded ants have done a lot of damage to the ecosystem of these islands she said they attack and kill native hawaiian insects theyve nearly wiped out some hawaiian insect species they also kill nesting baby birds that doesnt sound good for us karen said a baby bird she realized would be much larger than they were as microhumans i dont see whats big about their heads danny remarked erika said these ones are minor workers the majors have the big heads majors danny asked nervously what are they the majors are soldiers erika went on the bigheaded ant has two castesminors and majors the minors are workers theyre small and plentiful the majors are the warriors the guards theyre large and uncommon so what do the bigheaded soldiers look like erika shrugged big heads there were so many ants and each ant seemed filled with inhuman energy one ant by itself certainly didnt pose a danger but thousands of themexcitedhungrydespite the threat the young scientists couldnt help gazing at the ants with fascination two ants stopped and tapped their antennae together and then one of the ants began wagging its rear end and making a rattling sound the other ant obligingly vomited a droplet of liquid into the others mouthparts erika explained what was going on she was begging food from her nestmate she wagged her rear end and made those scratchy sounds to say she was hungry its the ants version of a dogs whine danny interrupted i fail to see the joy of watching an ant blow lunch into another ants mouth lets go please the ant highway wasnt very wide they could have easily jumped over it but they decided to avoid the ant column rather than risk trouble as peter put it we dont want an ant to latch on to someones ankle jarel kinsky had stopped and he was staring up at the branches of the great buttressed tree which soared over their heads i know this tree he said its a giant albesia tree theres a supply station on the other side of it im pretty sure he clambered up onto a root and walked along the root for a distance and hopped down yes he said i think were getting close kinsky took over the lead from peter and began heading toward the left around the albesia tree pushing his way through dead fern leaves striking at things with a grassstem spear knocking leaves and plants aside peter jansen dropped back to the rear he had not liked the look of the ants and wanted to keep an eye on them as the group moved along rick hutter was the last in line moving slowly with the pack on his back carrying the chinaberry and holding his spear hey rick can i take your spear for a while ill bring up the rear peter said rick nodded handed him the spear and kept walking kinsky meanwhile dragged a leaf aside and said loudly if we can get back to nanigen well have to find the hidden console so we can operate the generator even if mr drake doesnt want at that moment jarel kinsky froze in his tracks ahead in the distance beyond the roots of the tree stood the peak of a tent a station a station kinsky shouted and he started running toward the tent he didnt see the entrance of the ant nest it was an artificial tunnel fashioned from bits of glued dirt emerging from the base of a palm tree kinsky ran right past the tunnel mouth standing around the tunnel in guard positions were dozens of bigheaded soldier ants the soldiers were two to three times larger than the workers their bodies were dull red covered with sparse bristly hair their heads were gleaming black and massively oversized packed with muscles and plated with armor and fitted with mandibles designed for fighting their eyes were black marbles they spotted kinsky as he ran toward the tent instantly all the soldiers charged kinsky noticed the giant ants running toward him and he swerved but the soldiers had fanned out they converged on kinsky coming from different directions a strategy that cut off his escape kinsky stopped running and backed up inside a closing ring of ant soldiers holding his grass spear over his head no he shouted he slashed at a soldier with the spear but the ant grabbed the spear in its mandibles and broke off its point several soldiers darted in and began to pull kinsky to the ground while one ant closed its mandibles around kinskys wrist he shouted and shook his hand whirling the ant around trying to make it let go but the ant had clamped on his wrist and was shaking its head bulldogging kinsky his hand came off and the ant flew away and hit the ground running with the hand in its mandibles kinsky screamed and went down on his knees cradling his severed wrist which spouted blood a soldier climbed up kinskys back fastened its jaws behind his ear and began tearing off kinskys scalp kinsky fell to the ground writhing within moments the soldiers had him spreadeagled and were pulling on his arms and legs from different directions they were drawing and quartering the man attempting to tear him limb from limb a soldier got its mandibles fastened under his chin and his screams ended with a guttural noise as blood spurted from his throat and drenched the ants head smaller workers joined the attack and kinsky seemed to disappear under a pile of frantic ants peter jansen had run forward waving a spear shouting at the ants trying to drive them off kinsky but it was too late peter stopped and stood his ground before the mass of struggling soldiers holding the spear and watching the horror he could buy time for the others to get away he thought and he started advancing toward the ants then he noticed that karen king stood beside him holding her knife get out of here peter said to her no she said to him she crouched facing the ants holding her knife in front of her she could delay the ants maybe give the others time to escape meanwhile more soldiers poured out of the nest they began hunting around seeking enemies a soldier raced toward peter and karen its mandibles wide peter thrust his spear at the ant the ant dodged it and went for him moving extremely fast leave me peter karen king shouted she backed away from the ants then she leaped into the air soaring far higher than a normal human could ever jump and landed catlike away from the ants at the same time she pulled from her belt the spray bottle of defensive chemicals that shed planned to show to vin drake benzos ants didnt like benzos she was pretty sure of that she sprayed the stuff toward an advancing ant the ant stopped instantly turned aroundand ran away yeah she yelled the spray worked it made them run like rabbits out of the corner of her eye she could see the others running away from the ant nest good buying them time she kept spraying and the spray held the ants back stopped their attacks but the bottle had contained only a small amount of the liquid and still more soldier ants were breaking out of the nest the nest had gone into full alarm an ant leaped up onto karen landing on her chest tearing her shirt and it began snapping at her neck hai she shouted and grabbed the ant behind its head held it up in the air and with her other hand slammed her knife into the ants head the blade punched through the ants head and a clear liquid squirted outit was hemolymph insect blood instantly she flung the ant away it landed on the ground and went into convulsions its brain destroyed but the ants had no fear no sense of selfpreservation and there seemed to be no end to their numbers as the ants closed in on her karen jumped away soaring head over heels backward like a circus tumbler and again landed on her feet and then she ran ahead of her she saw the other humans running explosively fast driven by fear leaping over leaves and fern stems dodging things fleeing like gazelles how can i run this fast ive never run so fast in my lifekaren thought clearly their bodies were much stronger and faster in the microworld it gave karen a feeling of superhuman power and exhilaration she leaped over obstacles like a hurdle runner clearing things in a series of incredible jumps she realized she was sprinting at about fifty miles an hour in the scale of the microworld i killed an ant with a knife and my bare hands they soon got out of the visual range of the ants ahead in the distance stood the tent worker ants continued to butcher kinskys body they bit off the arms and legs and cut the torso into chunks making cracking sounds as they sheared through the ribs and spine yanking out the mans viscera the ants drank the spilled blood making sucking noises a welter of torn clothing blood and intestines was strewn about while the ants began transporting the meat underground karen king stopped running for a moment to look back and she saw the ants carry kinskys head down the hole the severed head stared back as it went down pulled by workers it seemed to hold a look of surprise chapter nanigen headquarters october am it was a sunny day in central oahu and the view from nanigens meeting room swept across half the island the windows looked over sugarcane fields to the farrington highway then to pearl harbor where navy ships floated like gray ghosts and to the white towers of honolulu beyond the city a ragged line of peaks extended along the horizon painted in misty greens and blues these were the koolau mountains the pali of oahu clouds had begun to build over the range it will rain on the pali today it usually does vincent drake murmured to nobody in particular while he thought the rain will solve the problem if the ants havent solved it already of course if there were any survivors they might find refuge in a supply station he reminded himself not to overlook this detail drake turned away from the window and sat down at a long table of polished wood where a number of people were waiting for him seated across from him was don makele the vice president for security there was the nanigen media officer linda wellgroen and her assistant as well as various other people from different departments at the far end of the table by himself sat a slender man wearing rimless spectacles edward catel md phd was the chief liaison for the davros consortium the group of pharmaceutical companies that had supplied capital to nanigen the davros consortium had invested a billion dollars in nanigen edward catel monitored events at nanigen for the davros investors drake was saying seven graduate students we were recruiting them to do field work in the microworld theyve disappeared our cfo alyson bender has also gone missing don makele the security chief said maybe they went to watch the surf on the north shore drake looked at his watch they should have checked in with us by now don makele said i should file a missingpersons report good idea drake said drake wondered just when the police would discover the corporate car with alysons body and the students clothing in it the car had fallen into a tidal inlet he did not think the police would be able to make much sense of the crash the cops are locals he thought hawaiian locals take life easy they go for the simple explanation since that makes the least amount of work for them even so he didnt want the police to get too interested so he gave don makele and the media staff his orders nanigen cannot afford any media attention right now we are at a critical stage of our explosive growth we need to work quietly while we smooth out the wrinkles in the tensor generator especially the problem of the microbends he turned to linda wellgroen the media officer your job is to stop publicity over this incident wellgroen nodded understood if you get media inquiries be warm and helpful but dont give out any information drake went on your job is to be boring its in my resume wellgroen said with a smile experienced at mediadiffusive ambiguation in realtime crisis contexts it means that when the crap is flying i can be as exciting to the media as an episcopalian vicar discussing how to toast a crumpet those kids didnt get into the tensor generator did they said don makele the security chief drake said firmly of course not linda wellgroen jotted something on a legal pad any idea what happened to ms bender drake looked concerned frankly weve been worried about alyson in recent days she was known to be deeply depressed possibly distraught she had been having an affair with eric jansen and when eric tragically drownedwelllets just say alyson struggled with private demons you think ms bender took her own life linda wellgroen said drake shook his head i dont know he turned to don makele tell the police about alysons state of mind the meeting broke up linda wellgroen tucked her legal pad under her arm and walked out of the room accompanied by the othersbut at the last minute vin drake touched don makeles elbow and said wait the security chief stayed while drake closed the door now only makele and drake were left in the room along with the davros advisor dr edward catel who had remained seated at the end of the table he hadnt spoken a word during the meeting drake and catel had known each other for many years they had made significant amounts of money working together on deals vin drake thought that ed catels greatest strength was the fact that he displayed no emotions the man had no discernible feelings of any kind catel was a medical doctor but he had not treated a patient in many years he was all about money deals and growth dr catel was as warm as slate in january drake waited a moment then he said the situation is different from what i just told our media people those kids did go into the microworld what happened sir makele asked they are industrial spies drake said catel broke in speaking for the first time why do you think that vin he had a mild even voice i caught peter jansen in the project omicron area that zone is forbidden he had a memory stick in his hand when i walked in on him he looked guilty as hell i had to grab him and rush him out of the zone the bots could have killed him catel raised an eyebrow he was one of those people who seem to have yogic control over their facial muscles the omicron zone doesnt sound secure if a grad student can walk in there drake got annoyed the zone is very tight but we cant have the security bots active all the timenobody could enter the zone i should be asking you about security ed you paid professor ray hough a great deal of money to let us recruit his grad students i didnt pay him a cent vin he got stock in nanigen under the table so what you are responsible for the behavior of those students ed you manipulated the situation in cambridge to get those students out here you have not solved the problem of bends dr catel answered in a bland voice you planned to send them into the microworld at considerable risk to their lives or am i conjecturing drake ignored him and paced the room the ringleader is peter jansen he went on speaking rapidly hes the brother of our deceased vice president eric jansen peter seems to irrationally blame nanigen for his brothers death hes looking for payback hes trying to steal our corporate secrets he may be planning to sell our technology to whom catel asked sharply does it matter catels eyes narrowed everything matters drake didnt seem to hear him a nanigen employee is involved in the spying drake went on a controlroom operator named jarel kinsky why do you think so catel asked drake shrugged kinsky has disappeared too i think hes in the microworld in the waipaka arboretum where hes serving the students as a paid guide what theyre doing i think is trying to find out how we operate in the field and what were discovering dr catel pinched his lips together but said nothing more you want me to start a rescue don makele began drake cut him off too late theyre dead by now drake gave his security chief a sharp look nanigen has been attacked on your watch don you didnt seem to notice is there anything you want to explain about that don makeles jawline tightened he was wearing an aloha shirt he had an ample belly but his bare arms sinewy and massive were fatless and drake saw how his security mans arms went rocktense don makele was an exmarine intelligence officer a security failure like thisa spy ring operating under his nosewas unforgivable i offer my resignation sir he said to drake effective immediately drake smiled and stood up and put his hand on don makeles shoulder feeling the moisture soaking the mans rayon shirt it pleased him to see how a few wellchosen words could make an exmarine break into a sweat not accepted drakes eyes narrowed and he got a careful look he had humiliated his security chief and now the man would be eager to please go to waipaka arboretum and collect the supply stations don all of them bring them back here they need to be cleaned and refurbished that would prevent any survivors from taking refuge in a station dr catel had picked up his attache case and was moving toward the door he glanced at drake and gave him a nod and left without saying another word vin drake understood exactly what dr catels nod meant clean up this mess quickly and the davros consortium wont hear about it he went over to the window and looked out as always the trade winds were blowing across the mountains endlessly lofting into mist and showers there was nothing to worry about for humans without weapons and protective gear survival time in the microworld was measured in minutes to hours not in days speaking to himself in a murmur he said nature will take its course chapter station echo october am the seven graduate students gathered at the entrance of the tent a sign over the tents door said supply station echo property of nanigen microtechnologies they were in a state of shock filled with horror over the brutality of kinskys death they were also extremely surprised at how fast they had run danny minot had lost his tassel loafers the shoes blew off his feet while hed made a jawdropping dash that would have shamed an olympic sprinter danny stood there in muddy bare feet shaking his head and they had seen karen king fighting the ants her twists and leaps soaring through the air it was clear they could do things in the microworld they couldnt have dreamed of before they investigated the supply station quickly as a raiding column of ants could show up at any moment the tent stocked with various boxes sat atop a concrete floor in the center of the floor there was a round steel hatch the steel hatch was operated with a wheel lock like a bulkhead door of a submarine peter jansen spun the wheel and lifted up the hatch a ladder went down into darkness ill check it out he put the headlamp on his head and switched it on and descended the ladder he ended up standing in the middle of a dark room as he swung his headlamp around the beam fell across bunks and tables then he spotted a bank of power switches on the wall he threw them and the lights came on the room was a concrete bunker it contained spartan living quarters tiered bunks were stacked along two walls there were laboratory benches equipped with basic lab supplies there was a dining area with a table and benches and a cooking stove a door led to the bunkers power source a pair of dsize flashlight batteries looming far above their heads another door led to a toilet and shower a chest held some freezedried meals in pouches the bunker was secure against predators a sort of bomb shelter in a dangerous biological environment its not a disneyland ride out there peter jansen said he sat slumped at the table in the bunker exhausted he felt unable to think clearly images of kinskys death ran through his mind karen king leaned against the wall she was splashed with ant blood the blood was gooey and clear with a slightly yellowish color and it dried fast danny minot sat hunched at the dining table he had resumed picking at his face and nose with his fingertips a computer sat on the lab bench we could learn something from this jenny linn said and switched it on the computer booted but a password screen came up of course they didnt know the password and jarel kinsky wasnt there to help them with things like that were not safe here rick hutter remarked drake could show up amar singh agreed i propose lets stock up with food and gear and leave immediately i dont want to go outdoors erika moll said her voice trembling as she sat down on a bunk why had she ever left the university in munich she longed for the safe world of european research these americans played with fire hydrogen bombs megapower lasers killer drones shrunken micropeopleamericans were demonraisers americans awakened technological demons they couldnt control yet they seemed to enjoy the power we cant stay here karen said to her speaking gently she could see how frightened erika was the most dangerous organism we face is not an insect its human it was a good point peter jansen suggested that they stick to the original plan go to the parking lot try to get on a truck to nanigen get into the tensor generator somehow we have to get restored to normal size as soon as possible we dont have much time we dont know how to operate the generator jenny linn said well cross that bridge later rick said we have some good tools for getting ourselves on the truck including the rope ladder we found in the pack he had been poking around in the supply boxes and hed pulled out something another pair of radio headsets this meant they now had a total of four communication radios there is only one thing to do danny minot murmured call for help he held up a radio headset you call nanigen rick said to him and vin drake will come around looking for us and not with any magnifying glass with the toe of his boot peter suggested that they keep radio silence except in an emergency in case drake was listening for them i dont see the point danny said we need to call for help jenny linn did not take part in the conversation instead she opened all the cabinets one by one and went through them carefully she found a lab notebook she opened it and began flipping through the pages somebody had jotted handwritten notes on the first few pagesweather readings logs of samplegathering activities mostly it didnt seem useful until she came to the map look at this guys jenny said spreading the notebook on the table on a page of the lab notebook somebody had sketched a rough map of the manoa valley the map showed the locations of ten supply stations scattered through fern gully and partway up the mountain slopes toward tantalus peak at increasing distances from the greenhouses and parking lot the supply stations were designated by letters of the nato alphabet from alpha bravo and charlie up to kilo there was an arrow marked to tantalus basegreat boulder tantalus crater wasnt shown on the map nor was the base the map as crude and incomplete as it was still contained valuable information it showed the basic layout of the supply stations the location of each supply station was indicated by landmarks around the stationtrees rocks clumps of fernsmaking it possible to find the station as long as you could locate the landmarks there was a station next to the parking lot it was station alpha and it was located under a clump of white ginger plants according to a note on the map we could head for station alpha peter jansen said maybe not stay at alpha but at least we could search it for more supplies and information why should we go anywhere danny said kinsky was right we have to negotiate with vin dont you dare try rick was practically shouting please stop this amar singh said he couldnt stand conflict first there had been all the fighting between rick and karen and now rick was getting into a hassle with danny rick people have different styles you need to be more tolerant of danny cut the crap amar that guy is going to be the death of us all with his stupid peter jansen could feel the situation spiraling out of control the one thing that would certainly destroy them would be conflict within the group they had to become a team peter thought or they would soon be dead somehow he had to get this quarrelsome catty group of intellectuals to understand that survival required cooperation he stood up and went to the head of the table and waited for silence eventually they quieted down are you done squabbling he said now i have something to say were not in cambridge anymore in the academic world you guys got ahead by cutting down your rivals and proving youre smarter than everybody else in this forest its not about getting ahead its about staying alive we have to cooperate to survive and we have to kill whatever threatens us or we will be killed oh its kill or be killed danny said dismissively an outmoded pseudodarwinian philosophy dating back to victorian times danny we have to do whatever it takes to survive peter said but theres more to survival than just killing think about who we are as humans a million years ago our ancestors survived on the plains of africa by operating in teams bands is a better word for itwe were bands of humans back then a million years ago we were not at the top of the food chain all kinds of animals hunted uslions leopards hyenas wild dogs crocodiles but we humans have been dealing with predators for a very long time we survive with brains weapons and cooperationteamwork i think we were built for this journey lets think of it as the chance of a lifetime to see incredible things in nature no one has ever seen before but whatever course of action we decide on we will have to work together or well die were only as strong as the weakest member of our team peter stopped wondering if hed gone too far if he had sounded too preachy to these grad students there was a period of silence as they digested peters speech danny minot was the first to speak he turned to peter by weakest member i assume you mean me i didnt say that danny danny cut him off excuse me peter i am not a slacklipped hominid with a beetling brow clutching a chunk of stone in my hairyknuckled fist and cheerfully bashing in skulls of leopards in fact i am an educated person used to an urban environment it is not harvard square out there it is a green hell crawling with ants the size of pit bulls i will stay in this bunker and wait for help he rapped on the wall its antproof nobodys going to help you karen said to danny well see about that he went off and sat by himself amar spoke to the others peter is right he turned to peter im on the team he leaned back and closed his eyes as if he was thinking about something karen said im on the team too erika moll finally agreed peter is right i think we need a leader jenny linn said i think peter should lead us peter is the one person here who gets along with everybody in the group rick said and turned to peter youre the only person who can lead us it was confirmed quickly by a vote danny refused to take part now it was a question of getting the teams act together first we need to eat im freaking starved rick said indeed they all felt ravenously hungry they had been up all night without food and there had been that mad dash from the ants we must have burned a lot of calories peter said i have never been so hungry in my life erika moll said our bodies are tiny we probably burn calories a lot faster like a hummingbird you know karen said they took out the instant food packets tore them open and devoured them sitting at the table and sprawled around the room there wasnt much food and it vanished in moments they found a giant block of chocolate and karen hacked it up seven ways with her knife the chocolate disappeared quickly searching the bunker for anything that might be useful on their journey to the parking lot they found a number of plastic lab bottles with screw lids and piled them on the table the bottles could be used as canteens for water and to store any chemical compounds they might be able to gather were going to need chemical weapons just like insects and plants have them jenny linn said yeah and ill need a jar to hold my curare rick added curare karen said right its wicked stuff rick said if you know how to make it i do rick said huffily who taught you rick a hunter ive read papers papers on curare karen turned to something else while rick fumed in one chest she had found three steel machetes each machete had a belt and holster with a diamond knifesharpener tucked into a pocket of the belt peter jansen drew a blade and touched it with his thumb wow that is sharp as an experiment he tapped the blade on the edge of a wooden table and saw the blade sink into the wood as if it were soft cheese the machete was far sharper than a scalpel its as sharp as a microtome he said we used one in our labrememberfor slicing tissue peter ran the diamond sharpener over the machete whisking it along the edge the sharpener was obviously to keep the edge in top condition the edge is very fine so it probably gets dull quickly but we can sharpen the machete as needed the machetes would be useful in cutting a path through vegetation karen king swung a machete around her head nice balance she said decent weapon rick hutter had stepped backward with alarm as karen whirled the machete you could cut somebodys head off he said to her she smirked at him i know what im doing you stick to berries and blowdarts quit pushing me rick burst out whats your problem peter jansen stepped in despite their promises to work as a team it was easier said than done pleaserickkarenwed all appreciate it if you didnt argue its dangerous for everybody jenny linn slapped rick on the shoulder and said to him karens just showing her fear this didnt sit well with karen but she didnt say anything more jenny was right karen knew full well that the machetes wouldnt stop some predatorssuch as birds for example she had been needling rick because she was afraid she had revealed her fear to the others and it embarrassed her she climbed up the ladder and opened the hatch and went outdoors to get herself calm under the tent she began investigating the chests that were stored there she found packets of food in one chest and many vials and scientific samples in another probably samples that a team had left behind she discovered a steel rod hidden under a tarp the rod was longer than she was tall it had a point at one end while the other end had been enlarged and flattened for a moment she couldnt figure out what this enormous metal thing was then the scale of the object clicked in her mind and she knew she climbed down the ladder and informed the others of what shed found its a pin she said it wasnt clear what the pin was doing in the tent possibly it had been used to pin something to the ground in any case the pin was made of steel it could be shaped into a weapon we could use the diamond sharpeners to hone the pin make it really sharp karen said we could put a notch in the tipthat would make a barbed point a killing point a barb that would grab in the prey and wouldnt come loose a harpoon they had to work on the pin inside the tent for it was too long to be brought down the ladder using the diamond sharpeners they fell to work cutting and shaping the steel first they sawed off the flattened head of the pin which shortened it and gave it better balance so that a person could hold it and throw it they took turns filing the point into a notch to create a barb the diamond sharpeners worked quickly on the steel after the work had been done peter picked up the harpoon and hefted it it was a steel polemassive gleaming balancedyet he handled it as if it weighed almost nothing in the microworld a piece of steel that size was just about heavy enough to do some damage to an insect if you threw it hard and it was sharp enough danny minot refused to help in any of the preparations he sat on a bed in the bunker with his arms crossed and knees drawn up and watched peter jansen felt sorry for him and went over to him and said quietly please come with us youre not safe here you said i was the weakest person danny replied we need your help danny for assisted suicide he said bitterly and refused to budge rick hutter had set about making blowdarts he went a few paces outside the tent carrying the machete for protection against ants and cut several grass stems back inside the bunker he sliced a stem lengthwise and began stripping out the harder strands of woody material the grass seemed as tough as bamboo he shaped the splinters into a couple of dozen darts the darts still needed to be hardened he went over to the stove and switched on a coil he carefully heated and hardened the point of a dart by holding it over the hot coil when he was finished he tore open a mattress and pulled out some stuffing he needed to fasten a puff of soft material to the tail of the blowdart so that the dart could be propelled through the tube by a persons breath in order to attach this tailpuff to the shaft he needed thread amaris there any more of that spider silk amar shook his head it got used up saving peter from the snake no problem rick rooted around and found a coil of rope he cut a short length of the rope then picked it apart into strands with his fingers this produced a pile of very strong threads he held a piece of fluff from the mattress against the end of the dart and wound a thread around it lashing the tailpuff in place now he had a real honesttogoodness blowdarthardened tip tailpuff the dart ready to be armed with poison even so no scientist would assume the dart worked he would have to test the dart one of the grass stems fulllength made a blow tube rick fitted the dart into the blow tube took aim at the wooden frame of a bunk and blew the dart zinged across the room hit the bunkand bounced off shit he muttered the dart couldnt penetrate wood that meant it would never get through an insects exoskeleton either fail karen remarked the dart needs a metal tip rick said where to find the metal tableware stainless steel tableware rick took a steel fork from the kitchen area and bent back one of the forks tines he cut off the tine using the edge of a diamond sharpener then honed the tine into an exceedingly sharp point he lashed the steel point to a grass dart and fired the dart at the bunk this time the dart embedded itself in the wood of the bunk with a satisfying thwock and stayed there trembling now that will drive into a beetle rick said one by one he cut the tines off all the forks in the bunker until he had created a supply of more than two dozen darts and several blow tubes he placed the darts in a plastic box hed found in the lab to keep them dry and protected from damage rick still had to make curare but in order to do that he needed to collect more ingredients like a fine sauce a good curare contained a variety of ingredients cooked together a chemistry of horrors all he had for an ingredient at the moment was the chinaberry which hed stored upstairs in the tent nobody wanted a toxic chinaberry to be kept inside the bunker it might give off fumes it might make them sick for the same reason he could not boil curare on the stove he did not have the ingredients for curare anyway and even if he did everybody could get poisoned if he tried to make curare inside the bunker the fumes would probably kill them he would have to boil curare outdoors over an open fire they also turned up a pair of binoculars and two more headlamps and packed them into the duffels amar singh dug up a roll of duct tape we cant possibly survive in a superjungle without duct tape amar joked rick hutter opened a chest and shouted a gold mine and he pulled out a laboratory apron rubber gloves and safety goggles this is just what i need for making curare excellent excellent he stuffed the things in a duffel bag hed have to cook the curare in a vessel of some kind in the bunkers tiny kitchen facility at the bottom of a shelf near the floor he found a large aluminum pot he lashed the pot to his duffel pack and then put the pack on his back testing its weight he was surprised the pack though enormous felt very light im as strong as an ant rick said jenny linn rooted through a supply box and discovered a military compass the compass battered and worn was the type used by american soldiers ever since the korean war it could be used to keep them going in a straight line but none of them could find a gps unit anywhere at the station its because gps cant tell us where we are peter explained a gps unit is accurate to about ten meters at our small size thats equivalent to a onekilometer accuracy in other words gps cant tell our location more precisely than a kilometer in any direction by our measure of things a compass is much more accurate than gps for us suddenly after the meal and all the work a desire for sleep came over all of them peters watch showed that the time was just before noon lets finish packing up our gear later karen king suggested they hadnt slept the night before but they were used to pulling allnighters in the lab karen prided herself on her stamina but even so she couldnt keep her eyes open why am i so tired all of a sudden she thought maybe it had something to do with their small bodies all the calories theyd burnedbut she couldnt focusand she couldnt resist crawling into a bunk where she fell instantly asleep they all slept chapter manoa valley october pm a pickup truck black and new swung into the parking lot by the greenhouses at the waipaka arboretum don makele the security director of nanigen got out he put on a knapsack and clipped a sheath knife to his belt he knelt on the ground by a clump of white ginger plants growing along the edge of the parking lot and drew the knife blade the knife was a kabar a combat model with a black blade delicately he pushed aside plant stems with the flat of the knife until he found the little tent supply station alpha hidden in the gloom of the ginger leaves he leaned into the plants to get a better look and with the tip of his knife pulled aside the tiny flap of the tent anybody home he said he knew he wouldnt hear a response even if a microhuman did answer he didnt see any microhumans anyway station alpha had been tidied up and battened down a month ago when it had been abandoned by the last field team to stay there he plunged the knife into the soil next to the station and cut a circle around the station rocking the blade back and forth then he yanked the bunker out of the earth the soil dropping off it the tent fluttering and shaking on top of the structure he stood up and banged the bunker on his shoe to knock off clots of dirt and put the bunker into his knapsack don makele took out a map and studied it next stop station bravo he walked swiftly along a path that led into fern gully after fifty feet he plunged off the path into the forest not reducing his speed moving easily through the jungle environment according to the map station bravo was at the south side of a koa tree and the trees trunk had been marked to make the station easy to find a few minutes of tramping around brought him to the right tree a reflective orange tag had been nailed to the trunk he knelt at the spot found the tent and peered into it nobody what about the bunker he straightened up and called hey and stomped on the ground beside the tent that would send them scurrying out if they were in the bunker but he saw nothing no movement no tiny figures running he knifed the soil and took out the bunker and put it in his pack with station alpha he consulted the map again and looked along the hillside peering up the sloping land that rose to cliffs and eventually to the heights of tantalus it seemed like a waste of time to bring all the stations back to nanigen the microworld had swallowed the students without a trace still he had to follow drakes orders it didnt bother him to be removing the only hope of survival for the students since the students were dead anyway for sure he wasnt doing anything wrong just cleaning up the stations as he hiked laterally along the hillside he dug up stations foxtrot golf and hotel he moved along quickly at ease in the jungle higher on the mountainside he located station india and dug it up higher still he found juliet and knocked the mud off it but station kilo seemed to have disappeared kilo was supposed to be embedded in the ground at the base of a cliff among a tangle of vines by a small waterfall yet he simply could not find it eventually don makele decided that kilo had probably been washed away in a rainstorm this happened to stations occasionally the weather was hard on them because they were so small then he doubled back going straight downhill into the depths of fern gully he was heading for station echo which lay deep in fern gully amid a stand of albesia trees hey the sound thundered through the bunker waking up all the students the room jounced and boomed and they were flung out of the bunks and tossed around the room as if a major earthquake had just hit the lights went out crashing sounds of chests and boxes and lab equipment filled the darkness and the room shook peter jansen understood what was happening someones out there he shouted get out go go he groped around for a headlamp by his bunk found it and switched it on the lights came on again the batteries had been rattling on their contacts rick hutter grabbed his darts and started scrambling up the ladder karen king following him the others frantically began to grab duffel bags machetes whatever they could carry rick leading the way reached the top of the ladder he put his hands on the hatch wheel when suddenly the room felt like it was being yanked into the air and he fell off the ladder and everybody went sprawling the room turned sideways and a deafening noise a hammering sound made the bunker shake ahstupidthing the words seemed to shake the bunker like artillery shells landing hed cut a circle around station echo gotten it out of the soil squinted into the door of the tent the tent had supplies scattered all around inside it that looked unusual so he decided to open the hatch and look inside he pinched the hatch wheel between his thumb and forefinger but the wheel snapped off now he couldnt get the hatch open shit he laid the station on its side on the ground and knelt and tapped on the hatch cover with the tip of his knife but that didnt work the hatch was tightly shut and not even the tip of his knife would get it open so he raised his knife over his head he would split it open the kabar blade as tall to the microhumans as a tenstory building plunged through the bunker with a roar driving shattered blocks of concrete through the room the blade continued down into the earth opening a gaping hole in the room the edge began to saw raggedly through the bunker while rocking back and forth rick clung to the bottom of the hatch trying to spin it trying to open it he got the hatch open and thrust out his duffel bag but then the bunker began rising up into the air he saw the ground below the bunker turned completely sideways until he was lying on the ladder people were crowding behind him he began reaching for the others he grabbed amar and pushed him out through the hatch and saw him falling away the bunker was rising higher tilting peter jansen got next to rick help me get the others out peter shouted they managed to get danny out through the hatch they heard danny scream and saw him falling erika went next inside the bunker jenny linn had been pinned against the giant knife blade her arm trapped between the blade and concrete karen king struggled to free jens arm while the blade moved sideways threatening to crush them both my arm jenny whimpered i cant move a table slid up against jenny then a concrete fragment smashed the table and rammed into karen karen kicked the concrete away surprised at her strength and worked frantically to free jenny the bunker went down again slammed against the ground and the knife cut it in half spilling jenny and karen out revealing the sky above against the sky towered a man a man they didnt recognize he opened his mouth and sounds rumbled out he raised the knife high karen picked jenny up and got her to her feet watching the knife wave over them jens arm hung limply at a strange angle run karen screamed as the great knife flashed downward at them chapter fern gully october pm the knife entered the ground between karen and jenny driving them apart and continued down into the earth for what seemed like a vast distance then it was withdrawn with a rumbling sound shaking the world jenny was on her knees holding her arm and moaning karen scooped jenny up with one hand and began to run with her heaving her across her back and sprinting at high speed the knife plunged down again but this time karen had dived under a clump of ferns still carrying jenny on her back the ground thumped and bounced and the thumping receded the man was walking away carrying the broken halves of the station in his hands they saw him toss the pieces into a knapsack he moved off and was gone a silence descended jenny was crying my arm jenny said it hurtshurts so much jens arm had been broken badly dont worry well get you fixed up karen said trying to sound optimistic jens arm looked horrible a compound fracture of the humerus probably karen found a duffel bag lying on the ground nearby and she opened it and took out a radio headset and began calling on it you guys anybody im with jenny she has a broken arm can you hear me peters voice came on were okay everybodys accounted for they gathered under the fern and placed jenny on a leaf using it like a bed none of them had any medical experience karen opened the medical kit and found a syringe with morphine she held it where jenny could see it do you want this jenny shook her head no too groggy she might need her wits despite the pain instead jenny accepted a couple of tylenol tablets while karen ripped up a piece of cloth and fashioned a sling they helped her sit up jenny swayed her face ashen her lips pale ill be okay she said but she was not okay her arm was swelling dramatically the skin darkening internal bleeding karen caught peters eye and she knew he was thinking the same thing she was remembering what jarel kinsky had said about the bends you could bleed to death from a small cut and this was not a small cut peter looked at his watch it was two oclock in the afternoon theyd slept for two hours the ground was scattered with debris it was like a shipwreck the duffel bags and the backpack lay in various places many other things had fallen out of the bunker when the knife had split it open they found the machetes and the harpoon ricks chinaberry rested on the ground nearby it had fallen out of the tent they had survival gear and supplies at least but where would they go if station echo had been taken away what had happened to the other stations had the man seen them did he work for vin drake they had to assume the worst they had been discovered the stations had been taken away where to hide where to go how to get back to nanigen now as they stood pondering what to do the sky grew darker a gust of wind tugged at the leaves of a haiwale plant nearby revealing the fuzzy undersides of the leaves as peter looked up he saw the wind catching leaves overhead flipping them over tossing the leaves then came a strange sound a deep sploosh and another sploosh they watched in stunned surprise as a flattened sphere of water of enormous size fell on the ground next to them and exploded into a hundred smaller droplets flying everywhere the afternoon rains had arrived get to high ground peter shouted this way they began to run heading upslope grabbing whatever they could carry karen carried jenny on her back while raindrops exploded around them like bombs going off at nanigen vin drake turned away from his computer screen he had been watching a weatherradar scan of the koolau pali those trade winds were so dependable as the winds ran up against the windward side of oahu they dropped their moisture on the mountains the peaks of the koolau pali were some of the wettest places on earth don makele knocked on the door the security man entered and placed the pieces of station echo on drakes desk the beds are rumpled toilets been used and i saw a couple of them on the ground running i ordered them to stop i tried to stop em with my knife they scattered like cockroaches thats disturbing drake said very disturbing don i told you to fix this what do you want me to do sir vin drake leaned back and tapped a gold mechanical pencil on his teeth a portrait of him hung on the wall behind him painted by an upandcoming brooklyn artist in which drakes face seemed to fracture into bold colors it was an image of power and drake liked it i want you to close off the security gate at the entrance to manoa valley stop the shuttle truck the valley is to be sealed and bring me your two best security men that would be telius and johnstone i trained them in kabul they have experience in the microworld plenty makele answered what do you want them to do rescue the students but youre sealing off the valley just do as i say don yes sure ill meet your men outdoors parking lot b twenty minutes the raindrops were pounding down exploding hurling gouts of water mixed with soil peter vanished in a cloud of spray as a raindrop hit him the raindrop knocked peter through the air and left him sprawled and coughing the others ran slipping and sliding while more raindrops landed around them then came a sound like a freight train it was a flash flood running down a cleft in fern gully it burst around a rock and past the base of a tree fern and hit the people with a wall of brown water sending them swimming for their lives karen was carrying jenny along when suddenly as the flood hit jenny was torn from her back with a cry jenny the water took karen down she couldnt see jenny she found herself clinging to a leaf which was spinning around and around in the current rick was kneeling on the leaf in front of her grab my hand he shouted to her rick caught karen by one hand and hauled her onto the leaf she coughed and gasped the leaf spun and ran along with the current ive lost jenny karen shouted looking around frantically with her broken arm jenny would not be able to swim danny minot had climbed up onto a rock it poked out of the floodwaters ripping around it a drowned earthworm floated past rolling over and over in the water jenny linn struggled in the water trying to swim but her sling interfered and her broken arm flopped in a frightening way her head went under and came up rick lay flat on the leaf jenny he shouted reach out jenny hang on rick karen shouted and she grabbed ricks feet and held on trying to keep him from sliding off the leaf as he reached out to try to save jenny jenny rolled on her side and reached out with her good hand but she passed by rick her fingertips just brushing his he lost her couldnt get a grip on her fingers and he shouted in frustration jenny was approaching the rock where danny huddled danny please she screamed putting out her good hand the current shook her body threatening to drag her under danny minot reached out for her he touched her hand her fingers closed around his fingers he reached farther with his other hand and managed to get his fingers under the sling he pulled jenny toward him then he felt himself slipping off the rock jenny screamed in pain as he wrenched her broken arm but she welcomed it dont let go of me please she reached with her good handcaught dannys shirt a drowning person will take you down with them danny knew about drowning people they were very dangerous he looked around was anybody watching then he locked eyes with jenny linn sorry he said he opened his hands and let her go he was going to be pulled into the water and drowned by her for sure danny turned away he couldnt bear that expression on jens face he had done everything he could to save her if he hadnt let her go she would have pulled him in certainlythey both would have diedjenny was doomed anyway im a good personhe huddled on the rock while the water rumbled around it nobody had seen what hed done except jenny that look in her eyes karen screamed as she saw danny lose his grip on her no jenny no they glimpsed jens head bob once more in the current and she went down and they didnt see her again chapter nanigen headquarters october pm vin drake crossed the parking lot moving toward telius and johnstone who waited between two cars at the edge of the lot better to talk outdoors anything you said could be heard recorded preserved he had to keep track of the details details are evidence evidence could escape evidence could fly out into the world you could lose control of it weve had a breach of security drake said to the two men telius stood with his shaved head bent listening a short wiry man with fierce restless eyes that darted over the ground as if he was searching for some small object hed lost johnstone much taller than telius wore sunglasses and stood at ease with his hands behind his back a tattoo on johnstones scalp shone through a fade haircut drake went on were dealing with industrial spies they could destroy nanigen we believe these spies are working for a foreign government as you may know there are certain classified activities at nanigen that unfriendly governments would very much like to know about we dont know anything about that telius said thats correct drake said you dont somebody drove by and parked their car and drake paused he and the two men turned away and walked along the edge of the parking lot saying nothing for a few moments waiting for the person to go inside the building the trade wind rattled the seed pods of acacia shrubs growing in the empty lot nearby drake turned and gazed at the metal building that building doesnt look like much but in the near future the business inside it will be worth at least a hundred billion dollars a hundred billion dollars he paused to let the number sink in incredible wealth will be created for the lucky people who own groundfloor shares in nanigen he squinted into the sunlight then looked sideways at the two men you know what groundfloor shares are right the owners of groundfloor shares can sell their shares for a spectacular profit when the company goes public in an ipo did they see where he was going with this their faces revealed precisely nothing no thought no emotion nothing to be read or inferred professional faces he thought drake continued i want you to go into the microworld on a rescue mission to find the spies ill give you a full movement kit a hexapod and weapons anything you need the spies were droppedare believed to have been lost in an area about twentymeters radius around supply station echo so i want you to begin your search at echo its possible the missing persons are following the microtrails looking for supply stations in order to take refuge in them the supply stations have all been removedall except for station kilo we couldnt find station kilo you are to follow the networks of trails moving from the site of one station to the next searching for the spies andah how to put this clearly so there would be no mistake you will find the missing people but heres the point the rescue will fail understand despite your best efforts the spies will not be found i dont want to know anything about how you do it the spies have to disappear but i dont want to hear any rumors about what happened to them either if no trace of them is found there will be areward drake put his hands in his pockets and felt the wind kissing his face failure he added softly is the only option he turned around and looked at the two men he saw nothing there the mens faces held no expression a small bird whipped past and landed in the acacia bushes if the rescue effort fails the reward for each of you will be one share of nanigen groundfloor stock when nanigen goes public a single share will be worth at least a million dollars get it the men just looked at him with eyes as flat as the parking lot but they got it he was sure of that youre venture capitalists now drake said slapping telius on the shoulder as he left the rain ended as quickly as it had begun a steamy golden glow filled the forest as the clouds broke and the water quickly receded as the rivulets emptied and the rain ran off into the stream that drained the manoa valley they had lost a lot of their gear scattered by the water and jenny had disappeared they collected themselves together in a group and when everyone was accounted for they spread out looking for their gear and most of all for jenny they went downhill following the water flow using the two headset radios to keep in touch jenny are you there jenny they shouted but there was no answer and no sign of her i found the harpoon rick said it hadnt traveled far his darts had been in a plastic case inside his duffel bag and the bag turned up wedged against a stone even the chinaberry was found underneath the edge of a leaf glowing yellow karen king moved along with a sense of dread as they searched for jenny linn she was shaking she had seen the look on jens face when she went down that last time the worst horrors are the human ones what had jenny seen then karen spotted something pale soft draped under a twig a human hand she had found jenny her body was pinned under the twig crushed and oddly twisted and speckled with mud with the forsaken look of the drowned her broken arm flung akimbo and contorted like a wet rag jens eyes were open vacant her body was covered with spaghettilike threads which crisscrossed and draped her like a veil they were threads of fungus already beginning to grow karen knelt by the body and pulled a thread from jens face and closed jens eyes and wept the others gathered around rick found himself weeping and it embarrassed him he tried to control his tears but it didnt work peter put his arm around rick and rick shook him off i tried so hard danny said and cried i just couldnt save her erika enfolded danny in her arms you are a brave man danny i never realized it until now there was a creaking sound the veil of fungus threads that covered jens body seemed to twitch what was that erika saidand her eyes widened with horror as she saw a thread of fungus bend and wave like a crooked finger and the tip of the thread touched jens skin it went in through the skin making a scratchy sound piercing the body probing for nutrients the fungus veil had already begun to consume the body erika cringed and stood up peter spoke we need to bury herquickly using the harpoon and the machetes they hacked apart the soil it was soft and rich and alive with small creatures moving and squirming the soil was almost a living organism in its own right the only nonliving thing was seemingly jenny they lowered her into the grave theyd dug and crossed her arms over her chest arranging the broken arm they tried to clear the fungus off her but the threads had tightened clamping themselves to the body penetrating it everywhere erika moll wept uncontrollably peter cut a part of a petal from a fallen hibiscus flower lying on the ground and he laid the piece of petal over jenny like a white shroud it covered the activity of the fungus beneath it then erika suggested that they say a prayer she wasnt a religious person at least she didnt think she was but she had been raised a catholic and had been taught by nuns in a nursery school in munich the nuns had taught her how to say the twentythird psalm in german der herr ist mein hirte erika began haltingly trying to remember it peter picked it up in english the lord is my shepherd i shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures magical incantations danny commented the words have no reference to socalled reality but possibly they help us in a psychological way i suspect praying stimulates primitive parts of the brain actually it even makes me feel a little better then they piled soil on top of jenny the body would not last long and would soon be consumed by the fungus and nematode worms it would be digested by bacteria and devoured by the soil mites that crawled everywhere soon there would be no trace of jenny linn left in the soil her remains swallowed and recycled her body returned to the bodies of other creatures in the microworld no sooner had life ended than it became life again afterward peter gathered the group and spoke to them trying to rally their spirits jenny wouldnt want us to give up she went on bravely we can honor her by looking to our own survival now they assembled the backpack and the two duffel bags they couldnt linger at jennys grave they had to keep moving toward the parking lot the lab notebook containing the map hadnt been lost karen had tucked it into the backpack they took it out it was crumbling mushy soaked but they could still read the map it showed a trail or path running from station echo to station delta and finally to alpha by the parking lot they had a lot of travel ahead of them we dont know if any of the stations remain but we can still follow the trail if we can find it karen said they couldnt find any sort of trail the rain had altered the landscape shifting debris around cutting new channels in the soil peter took out the compass and studying the handdrawn map he sighted a line toward the parking lot they began walking with peter leading the way cutting a path with a machete karen stepped along behind him carrying the harpoon across her shoulder rick hutter brought up the rear silent and wary holding a machete ready for action danny kept stopping to rest dont your feet hurt peter asked him what do you think danny muttered we could make you some shoes its hopeless danny said but we must try erika said to him i tried so hard to save jenny peter cut up strips of dead grass while erika wrapped dannys feet in the grass making rough moccasins out of the grass strips amar remembered the duct tape hed found at station echo he dug it out of a duffel bag and began winding strips of tape around dannys grass moccasins to hold them on his feet danny stood up and took a few steps in his ducttapegrass mocs they were surprisingly tough and remarkably comfortable a thudding noise drifted high overhead sounding strangely like a helicopter a mosquito appeared it soared downward out of the trees and dodged around them despite its large size the mosquito held itself effortlessly suspended in the air on its beating wings and it seemed to be studying them it had a blackandwhite striped body and striped legs a long proboscis hung from its head they could see twin razorsharp cutting blades at the tip of the proboscis the blades were caked with dried blood the mosquitos bloodsucking tools looked sharp enough to stab straight through the body of a microhuman danny minot lost his nerve get away he shouted at the mosquito and ran waving his arms and shuffling in his moccasins perhaps attracted to dannys motion or perhaps to his scent the mosquito chased after him hovering just above his neck without warning it dove down almost spearing him between the shoulders with its proboscis danny flung himself to the ground and rolled over on his back kicking his legs in the air get off me the mosquito buzzed over him and lunged at him againuntil karen king leaped on top of danny straddling him and waving her machete trying to scare off the mosquito it didnt scare easily form up peter shouted make a defensive circle the humans formed themselves into a defensive ring around danny who lay on the ground in terror they faced outward with their machetes held ready watching the mosquito while it circled around them the mosquito evidently smelled their blood and may also have sensed the carbon dioxide they gave off as they breathed it darted in and out seeming to stare at them with goggly eyes its proboscis dangling uhoh erika moll said what its a female aedes albopictus meaning danny said lurching to his knees an asian tiger mosquito the females are aggressive and they carry diseases rick hutter grabbed karen king by the arm gimme that harpoon hey she said whirling on him but hed snatched the harpoon from her rick advanced toward the mosquito raising the harpoon be patient rick peter said wait for an opening the mosquito darted in toward rick he saw his chance he whirled the harpoon using it like a stick and whacked the mosquito across the head with it go pick on someone bigger than you rick yelled the mosquito thundered off wobbling in the air karen king began to laugh whats so funny rick ripped at her the mosquitoes ran you back to your hotel in costa rica youve come a long way rick thats not funny he said to her give me that back she said grabbing the harpoon from him they got into a tugofwar over the harpoon karen won she yanked the harpoon away from rick who swore at her karen couldnt take that she lost it she stepped toward rick pointing the harpoon at his face dont use a word like that with me whoa now rick backed away holding up his hands karen flung the harpoon at ricks feet take it peter stepped between them were a team hey you two have to stop fighting with each other karen smoldered i wasnt fighting with rick if i was hed be holding his softies and puking his guts out peter jansen stayed out front picking the route cutting tirelessly at obstacles with the machete and pausing every now and then to sharpen the blade with the diamond sharpener the blade could cut anything as long as its edge was maintained he tried to keep everybodys spirits up do you know what robert louis stevenson said about travel he said calling back to the others he said it is better to journey hopefully than to arrive fuck hope ill settle for arrival danny minot remarked as he marched along at the back of the line rick hutter glanced at the others studying them he considered karen king he really couldnt stand her she was full of herself arrogant aggressive thinking she was such an expert in spiders and arachnids and handtohand combat she was goodlooking but beauty wasnt everything even so rick felt somewhat better that karen was with the group she was a fighter you could say that much for her right now she seemed icy cold alert on edge weighing every move as if she was in a fight for her lifewell of course she was he despised her and yethe was glad to have karen around next rick studied erika moll she walked along pale frightened erika was holding herself together on the edge of some kind of emotional crackup the fungus devouring jens bodythis had gotten to erika rick thought if erika didnt pull herself together she might be doomed but who could say just which of the humans possessed the strength and cunning to get out alive from this kingdom of tiny horrors as for amar singh rick thought he seemed resigned to his fate as if hed already decided he was going to die danny minot trudged along in his ducttape slippers that guys tougher than he looks rick thought watching danny he could be a survivor rick looked at peter jansen how did peter do it he seemed so calm almost gentle at peace with himself in some deep way rick couldnt fathom peter jansen had become a true leader and it fit him well it was as if peter had come into his own in the microworld there was rick hutter himself rick was not a reflective person he rarely thought about himself but he did now something strange was happening to him and he couldnt quite understand it he felt okay why he wondered did he feel okay i should feel terrible jenny is dead kinsky got ripped by ants whos next but this was the expedition rick hutter had always dreamed of yet never thought possible a journey into the hidden heart of nature into a world of unseen wonders in all likelihood he would die on this quest nature was not gentle or nice there was no such thing as mercy in the natural world you dont get any points for trying you either survive or you dont maybe none of us will make it he wondered if he would vanish here in a small valley on the outskirts of honolulu swallowed up in a labyrinth of threats almost beyond imagining got to keep going rick thought be smart be clever get through the eye of the needle after what seemed like miles of walking rick noticed a strange bittersweet smell drifting in the air what was it he looked up and saw tiny white flowers overhead scattered like stars through a tree that had snaky limbs and smooth silvergray bark the odor of the flowers resembled semen but with a nasty edge of something harmful yes nux vomica rick called to the others to stop wait a minute guys ive found something he knelt by a gnarled root which poked from the ground its a strychnine tree he said to the group with his machete he began hacking at the root until hed revealed a strip of inner bark which he chopped out working carefully with the machete this bark he explained contains brucine its a drug that induces paralysis i would have preferred the seeds because they are incredibly toxic but the bark will do handling the bark carefully trying not to get any sap on his hands he tied a rope to the bark and started dragging it along behind him we cant put this in my pack it would poison everything rick explained that bark is dangerous karen said you wait karen its going to get us food and im hungry erika stood aside and sniffed the air watching keeping alert for the warning smell of ants the air felt slightly heavy as it went in and out of her lungs everywhere she looked every crack and cranny in the soil every blade of grass every little groundhugging plant teemed with small living thingsinsects mites nematode worms and she could actually see masses of soil bacteria tiny dots in clumps everything was alive everything was feeding on something else it reminded hershe had begun to feel really hungry they were ravenously hungry but had nothing to eat they drank water from a hole in a tree root and moved on rick dragging the piece of bark we have strychnine and we have the chinaberry he said but its not enough we need at least one more ingredient he kept looking around scanning the vegetation for plants he recognized for anything toxic and eventually he found what he was looking for he discovered it by scent he recognized a sharp odor coming from a mass of vegetation oleander rick said and he went toward a mass of shrubbery with long pointed shiny leaves the sap is the wicked stuff crashing through leaf litter he arrived at the trunk of the shrub he drew his machete sharpened it and hacked into the trunk a translucent milky sap surged forth while rick backed away quickly that liquid will kill you fast if it touches your skin its got a lethal mix of cardenolides in it itll stop your heart bam you dont want to breathe the fumes either the fumes could give you a heart attack while the sap oozed down the bark rick rummaged in his duffel and he put on the lab apron and the rubber gloves and goggles hed found at station echo amar grinned rick you look like a mad scientist madness is my style rick said he opened one of the plastic lab jars and advanced toward the running sap holding his breath he let the jar fill up while the sap dribbled over his gloves he screwed on the cap then rinsed the outside of the jar in a drop of dew he filled a second jar the same way and held up both jars with a triumphant smile now what we need to do is cook everything into a paste for that we need a fire but the forest was soaking wet after the rain nothing would burn no problem rick said all we need is aleurites moluccana what the hell is that rick karen king said its a candlenut tree he answered the hawaiians call them kukui trees there are kukui trees growing all over this forest he stopped and looked up and turned around staring upward yeah thats a kukui right there he pointed at a tree with large silvery leaves the tree stood out like a pale thunderhead ten meters away it was hung with greenish balls of fruit they pressed on toward the candlenut tree when they reached its base they saw pulpy fruits scattered on the ground around the tree let me have a machete rick said now watch he began hacking into a fruit chopping off the pulp using the machete soon he reached a hard core a nut thats a kukui nut he said the nut is loaded with oil the ancient hawaiians filled stone lamps with kukui nut oil its a great source of light they also put the nuts on a stick and used it as a torch the nut burns the kukui nut covered with a glossy hard shell proved difficult to crack however they took turns chopping away at it with a machete the weapon had a heavy blade and an exceedingly sharp edge and it cut slowly into the nuts shell a few minutes of chopping revealed the oily nutmeat they began hacking out chunks of the nut and they made a pile of the nutmeat on the ground they added husks of dry grass which peter peeled out of the center of dead grass stems which had stayed dry despite the rain rick set his metal pot on top of the nut pieces and put on his chemical equipment he adjusted his goggles and loaded the pot with strips of strychnineroot bark chunks of the chinaberry the two jugs of oleander sap and water collected from the top of a leaf rick lit the fire with the windproof lighter the tinder began to burn and the kukuinut fire blazed up yellow and bright it was a small fire by the standards of the normal world not much bigger than a candle flame yet to them it seemed like a bonfire the fire heated their faces and made them blink and shy away and it brought the water in the pot to a boil within seconds two minutes of boiling time was enough to reduce the contents of the pot to a tarry goo fresh curare rick said lets hope anyway working carefully with a splinter of wood wearing rubber gloves and holding his breath rick packed the curare into a plastic lab bottle he could dip his darts in the stuff to arm them with poison he hoped the goop was poisonous but he wouldnt know for certain until he used it in a hunting situation he screwed the top on the bottle then lifted the goggles from his eyes and parked them on his forehead peter stared at ricks plastic bottle and the browncolored gunk in it so you think thatll take down big game something as big as a grasshopper he asked rick offered him a wry smile its not finished how so we need one more ingredient which is cyanide what peter said while the others gathered around listening you heard mecyanide rick said and i know where to get it where peter wondered in answer rick turned his head around slowly i can smell it hydrogen cyanide also known as prussic acid that whiff of bitter almondscan you smell it cyanidea universal poison itll kill practically anything and fast cyanidea favorite of cold war spies get thistheres an animal around here that makes cyanide its probably hiding under a leaf probably asleep the others stared while rick set out through the superjungle stopping occasionally to sniff the air following his nose he started turning over leaves dragging them with both hands the smell grew stronger it tickled their noses now once rick had pointed it out to them he stuck his head under a leaf got it he whispered under the leaf a brownish oily jointed carapace gleamed along with many curved legs thats a millipede rick said im just an ignorant botanist but i know these guys make cyanide erika moaned dont its a very big animal its dangerous rick chuckled a millipede he turned to karen king heykaren whats the behavior of this animal when its threatened karen king smiled millipedes theyre scaredy cats wait are you sure its not a centipede danny quavered remembering that peter had said a centipede can deliver a nasty sting nah this baby isnt any centipede karen said kneeling and looking under the leaf centipedes are predators a millipede doesnt eat meat it eats rotten leaves she explained its a peaceful animal doesnt even have a sting what i thought rick hauled the leaf off the millipede revealing it the millipede lay curled up and seemingly asleep it was a cylindrical animal with segmented armor and at least a hundred legs in relation to the microhumans the millipede appeared about fifteen feet long akin to the biggest boa constrictors it breathed gently making whistling noises through holes in its carapace a millipedes version of snoring rick drew his machete wake up he cried and slapped the millipede with the flat of the blade the animal thrashed suddenly the humans backed away and the odor grew stronger the millipede curled its body into a tight spiral a defensive posture holding his nose rick darted forward and whacked the animal again he didnt want to hurt the millipede he wanted to frighten it the trick worked a pungent smell of almonds mixed with a nasty bitter stench filled the air and blobs of an oily liquid oozed from pores in the millipedes armor rick opened a clean plastic jar and quickly put on his gloves apron and goggles the millipede wasnt going anywhere it remained curled up apparently frightened wearing his gear rick advanced and scooped some of the liquid into the jar until hed collected about a cup of the stuff its an oil its full of cyanide he explained he dumped the oil into the jar that held his curare goo and stirred the mess with a stick i scared the cyanide out of the poor bastard he said holding up the jar of curare which reeked of lethal chemicals and now he added its time to start hunting chapter nanigen headquarters october pm vin drake stood before a window that looked into the tensor core the window was bulletproof and it gave the scene in the chamber the appearance of a fish tank inside the chamber the hexagons of the sizetranslation tubes were set flush with the plastic floor two men walked around the core telius and johnstone they were suiting up they put on segments of lightweight kevlar armor vests arm coverings greaves for the legs the armor was tough enough to turn away the jaws of a soldier ant each man carried a caliber express gas rifle the gun was powered by a pressurized gas tank it fired a heavy steel needle tipped with a broadspectrum supertoxin long range total stopping power the supertoxin was equally effective on insects birds and mammals the gun had been designed especially for the protection of humans in the microworld wait for the hexapod drake said telius nodded and searched the floor with his eyes as if he was looking for a coin hed dropped telius was a man of few words drake went to a door marked restricted area under the sign there was a symbol that looked vaguely like a biohazard symbol and a word microhazard this was the entry door that led from the tensor core directly to project omicron no sign on the door advertised its name of course drake took up a hand controller a device that looked a little like a video game control and punched a code into it this disarmed the bots inside the omicron zone and he entered a cluster of small windowless labs with its own special access to the tensor core nobody was permitted inside omicron except for a handful of top nanigen engineers in fact few of the nanigen employees were even supposed to know of the existence of omicron inside the rooms several lab benches stood about and on the benches sat a series of objects draped in black cloth shrouds the shrouds concealed the objects whatever they were they were secret even people permitted to enter the omicron zone were not allowed to look at them drake took a shroud off one of the objects it was a robot with six legs and it vaguely resembled a mars robot lander or possibly a metal insect it was not very big about a foot across drake carried the sixlegged robot back into the tensor core and handed it to johnstone your transportation its got a full charge quad microlithiums were good johnstone mumbled he was chewing something god damn it drake barked whats in your mouth energy bar sir you get so hungry you know the rule no eating in the core you could contaminate the generator sorry sir its okay just swallow it drake clapped the man on the shoulder in a friendly way a little bit of mercy goes a long way with people who work for you telius placed the sixlegged device into hexagon the two men stood in hexagons and drake went into the control room he would operate the generator himself he had cleared all employees out of the core nobody could see him shrinking these men and this equipment that would be a loose detail he programmed hexagon to shrink the walker somewhat less than the humans would be shrunk just as he had locked down and started to initiate the sequence don makele came into the control room behind him drake and makele watched together as the generator hummed and the power structures under the floor ramped up and the hexagons descended after the men had been shrunk drake placed the microhumans in a transport box and he put the hexapod in another box he handed the boxes to don makele lets just hope the rescue succeeds lets hope makele replied it was dangerous enough that peter and the rest knew he had murdered eric but drake also worried that eric might have shared with his brother a very sensitive fact about drakes activities that could not be made publicand that peter might have passed it on to the other students this particular fact if it were known could destroy nanigens business it was just business nothing personal only logic just what had to be done in order to keep the business moving had don makele figured anything out drake couldnt be sure quite what the security man thought or knew drake gave his security chief a sharp sidelong glance how many groundfloor shares do you own two sir im giving you two more shares makeles expression didnt change thank you don makele had just made two million dollars on this conversation the man would keep his mouth shut chapter fern gully october pm be quiet and dont move they have keen eyesight and sharp hearing erika moll was speaking she was looking up into the branches of a mamaki plant which extended some distance over their heads unfolding large lobed leaves clinging to a leaf was an enormous creature a winged insect the animal shone with brilliant greens and its body was enclosed by a pair of lacy green wings that looked like leaves the animal had long antennae bulging eyes jointed legs and a bloated abdomen visibly packed with fat they could hear a faint hiss uhh hiss sound as it breathed the air flowing in and out of a line of holes in its flanks it was a katydid rick took one of the blowgun tubes he had made and balanced it on his shoulder he fitted a dart into the tube the steel tip had a glob of stinking poison smeared on it wafting a smell of bitter almonds and nastiness ricks curare a wisp of mattress stuffing which rick had taken from station echo was fastened to the butt of the dart rick knelt and brought the tube to his lips being exceedingly careful not to get any curare in his mouth the cyanide made his eyes water and his throat felt tight wheres the heart he whispered to erika moll who crouched beside him she would direct his shot for she knew insect anatomy best the heart its posterior dorsal to the metathorax erika said rick grimaced at erika huh erika smiled just under the top of the animals back rick shook his head cant make the shot the wings are covering the area he aimed the tube this way and that and finally decided on a gut shot he took aim at the animals lower abdomen took a deep breath and fired the dart sank deep into the katydid the creature gasped and shivered its wings for a moment they thought it would take off and fly but it didnt the animal let out a deafening shriek an earsplitting cry was it a cry of alarm of pain its breathing sped up and it sagged and slipped and dangled from the edge of the leaf amar cringed watching this he had never realized how the suffering of an insect could affect him ricks curare was very powerful they waited the katydid now dangled upside down its breathing slowed the hiss uhh hiss dragging out and sounding raspy then its breathing stopped shortly afterward the katydid fell to the ground nice work rick rick the hunter at first the dead katydid didnt seem appealing to anyone except erika moll i ate some termites once in tanzania they were quite delicious erika said people in africa consider insects a delicacy danny minot sat down on a twig feeling sick he felt like he might heave just looking at the dead bug maybe well find a burger joint around here he said trying to make a joke insect meat is not as bad as hamburger amar singh said mashed muscle blood and connective tissue of a bovine mammal really grosses me out i will not eat a cow but a katydidwellmaybe as they stared at the dead animal their hunger grew sharper and more insistent their small bodies had been burning energy at a high rate they simply had to eat had to their hunger overcame their squeamishness they butchered the katydid with machetes while erika guided them through the anatomy as they pulled out meat and organs erika insisted that everything edible be washed in water the animals blood the hemolymph was a transparent yellowgreen liquid and it dripped out as they cracked open its armor they removed the legs cutting through the tough bioplastic to get at the meat inside the legs the upper rear legs once split open revealed masses of lean white muscle they sliced steaks out of the largest parts of the legs the animals blood might contain toxins from the dart and so the meat had to be washed but after theyd dipped and rinsed the flesh in dewdrops it smelled clean and delicious they ate the meat raw it had a mild sweet flavor not bad rick said tastes like sushi really fresh karen said even danny began eating the meat gingerly at first but with increasing gusto until he was cramming katydid steak into his mouth needs salt he mumbled the fat of the animal soft and yellowish oozed out of the abdomen the abdominal fat is good for you im sure erika said when none of them would try it she scooped some fat out with her hands and ate it raw its sweet she said slightly nutty taste their bodies craved the fat and soon they all dug into the katydids abdomen scooping out the fat and gulping it down licking their fingers i feel like were lions at a kill peter said the katydid yielded far more meat than they could possibly eat they didnt want to let it go to waste so they gathered up bundles of moist moss and wrapped some of the meat in the moss as much as they could carry and stuffed it down in the duffel bags to keep it cool they ended up with enough katydid steaks to keep them going for a while anyway feeling much better they consulted the handdrawn map peter had been carrying the map and had been guiding them with the compass he pointed to features were right here i think he said noting a cluster of tree ferns that appeared on the map were pretty close to station bravo we might make bravo by nightfall he looked around and up at the sky the light was going it was late afternoon lets just hope the station is intact peter sighted the compass on the distant trunk of a palm tree and they headed out carrying the duffel bags and stopping once in a while to smell and listen for ants whenever they ran into an ant they knew there would be more as long as they moved quickly away the ants wouldnt get too excited the big danger was a nest entrance as the sun began to set shadows deepened on the forest floor and peter who was leading became more cautious about ants and more worried about stumbling into an ant nest but so far so good stop peter said he examined a mark on the stem of an ilihia plant growing up from the ground like a miniature tree the stem had been cut with three vshaped notches and above them was splashed an x made of orange paint it was a blaze they had come to a trail peter advanced and found another orange x sprayed on a pebble the trail proceeded onward a faint disturbance of the soil marked with blazes at points along the way minutes later he stopped at the edge of a large ragged hole in the ground the soil around it had been dug up and turned over around the hole giant footprints were impressed in the ground the footprints had filled with water like swimming pools peter consulted the map were at station bravo he said but theres no station the footprints told a story somebody had dug the station out of the ground and taken it away we have to assume the worst karen king said taking off her backpack and sitting down by the hole she wiped her brow this is vin drakes work it means he knows or suspects were still alive hes taken away our means of survival so drake could be hunting for us peter said but how would he find us rick wondered it was a good question their bodies less than an inch tall would not be easily noticed by a normalsize person radio silence is essential now peter said the disappearance of station bravo meant that they had no place to hide during the hours of darkness the sun was setting and night was coming on fast as it does in the tropics erika was becoming increasingly alarmed as she watched the sun go down just to point out she said to the others the vast majority of insects come out at night not during the day and many of them are predators we need to make a bivouac peter said were going to build a fort not far away a hexapod walker vehicle strode rapidly across the forest floor climbing over pebbles and pushing leaves aside its six legs working with seemingly boundless energy motors on the legs whined johnstone was driving his hand sunk in a glovelike device a hand controller while he watched the readouts the readouts told him the levels of power the servomotors were delivering to the vehicles six legs telius sat next to him in the open cockpit his eyes tracking left and right up and down both men wore fullbody armor the walker was powered by a nanolaminate microlithium power pack it had a long range and plenty of power regular vehicles didnt work well in the microworld they got stuck the wheels spun uselessly wheeled vehicles couldnt climb over obstacles either instead the nanigen engineers had copied the design of an insect the design worked extremely well the walker arrived at a hole in the ground stop telius said johnstone brought the vehicle to a halt and stared into the hole thats echo was telius corrected him both men leaped out of the vehicle in soaring jumps their armor clattering they landed on their feet they had a lot of practice at physical movement in the microworld and they knew how to use their strength they began circling around the hole examining moss crumbs of dirt the rain earlier in the day had obliterated most traces of the students passage across the surface but johnstone knew that clues remained he could track anybody anywhere a growth of moss on a rock attracted his attention he went up to it and studied it the moss stood waisthigh he touched a narrow stalk that came up out of the moss it was a spore stalk with a broken spore capsule at the end of it the stalk was bent at a right angle broken and spores had spilled out some of them clinging to the moss in the sticky fluff of wet spore granules telius found the imprint of a human hand somebody had grabbed the spore stalk broken it spilled the pollen then put their hand in it farther on telius found a confused set of human footprints clambering over a lump of dirt in a spot under a spreading leaf that had protected the ground underneath from rain splashes johnstone knelt and examined the footprints theres five of themno six walking in a line he looked off heading southeast whats southeast telius said parking lot johnstone narrowed his eyes and smiled telius looked at him quizzically johnstone picked a mite off his shoulder plate crushed it flicked it away fucking mites now we know their plan what plan theyre looking for a ride back to nanigen he was right obviously telius nodded and began walking swiftly ahead following clues johnstone jumped back into the hexapod and began driving it following telius as he moved swiftly ahead of the walker often leaping over things traveling at a pace somewhere between a dogtrot and a flatout run occasionally telius stopped to examine tracks in the soft soil the targets hadnt made any effort to cover their tracks they didnt suspect they were being followed but it was starting to get dark telius and johnstone knew enough about the microworld to know they needed to go to ground for the night you did not move after dark not ever they stopped the hexapod johnstone ran an electricshock cable in a circle around the vehicle staking the cable into the ground chesthigh while telius dug a foxhole directly underneath the vehicle they energized the power cable from the capacitorit would deliver a shock to any animal that touched itand they hunkered down in the foxhole sitting back to back holding their expresses propped at their sides loaded and ready for action telius leaned back and put a dip of snuff under his lip johnstone took the radio locator with him into the foxhole so that he could listen for any radio transmissions during the night johnstone wasnt worried this was his tenth trip into the microworld and he knew what he was doing he turned on the locator and watched the screen looking for signs of any radio transmissions in the seventygigahertz bandthe frequency used by the nanigen headsets he saw no sign of radio chatter they might not even have radios he said to telius telius grunted in response and spat a jet of tobacco they ate packaged meals they got up to urinate separately one man going off a few paces while the other man kept his partner covered with a gas rifle just in case something tried to attack through the electrified wire some of those bastards out there could smell you when you took a piss afterward they traded watches one man dozing while the other stayed on lookout the lookout wore infrared goggles his eyes just above the level of the ground johnstone couldnt get over how damn lively this world was at night in his ir goggles he saw constant ceaseless movements of small creatures going about their damn businessbugs a million bugs crawling everywhere he didnt even know what they were seen one bug youve seen em all as long as they werent some kind of predator he watched for the warm shape of a mouse he wanted to shoot some big game tonight dropping a mouse with a express was as good as shooting a cape buffalo which hed done a few times in africa id like to blow away a mouse johnstone said that would be fun telius grunted i just dont want to meet a fucking scolo johnstone added chapter near station bravo october pm the six surviving students picked a rise of higher ground at the base of a small tree at this spot they wouldnt get flooded out if it rained during the night the tree was an ohia and it had gone into bloom shining with red blossoms which glowed in the evening light we should make a palisade peter said they gathered dry twigs and stalks of dead grass they split the twigs and grasses into long splinters then jammed the splinters into the ground side by side this formed a wall of sharpened stakes surrounding their campsite with the points of the splinters facing outward they left an opening in the palisade just wide enough for a human to slip through with a barrier of stakes around the opening in a zigzag to make the entrance hard to penetrate they continued to work on strengthening the fort as long as there was any light to see by they dragged dead leaves inside the palisade and used the leaves to make a roof over their heads the roof would give protection against rain and would also conceal them from the sight of flying predators they spread leaves on the ground under the roof too the leafbed kept them up off the ground which was a constantly squirming bustle of small worms they cut the lightweight tent to make a flat tarp out of it and they spread the tarp on top of the leafbed to keep the surface dry and make the bed a little more comfortable for sleeping they had made a fort karen brought out her spray bottle it was nearly emptyshed used most of it during the fight with the ants its got benzoquinone in it if anything attacks us theres a couple of shots left i feel much safer now danny said sarcastically rick hutter took the harpoon and dipped the point in the jar of curare he leaned the harpoon against the palisade ready for action we should stand watches peter reminded them well change shifts every two hours there was the question of whether to build a fire if you were stranded in the wilderness at night in the normal world you would build a fire to stay warm and drive off predators the situation was different in the microworld erika moll summed it up insects are attracted to light if we have a fire it could draw predators from hundreds of meters away i suggest we do not use our headlamps either it meant they would spend the night in total darkness as dusk turned into night the world was drained of color fading into grays and blacks they began to hear a pattering thudding noise coming closera sound of many feet passing over the ground whats that dannys voice rose in a quaver a herd of ghostly delicate animals appeared and wandered past the camp they were daddy longlegs also called harvestmen eightlegged creatures walking on spindly legs that seemed impossibly long from the point of view of the students the legs spanned fifteen feet the body of each daddy longlegs was an oval nugget perched on the legs and the body sported two bright eyes the creatures glided over the terrain tapping their legs around looking for things to eat giant spiders danny hissed through his teeth theyre not spiders karen king said to him theyre opiliones meaning what theyre a cousin of spiders theyre harmless daddy longlegs are poisonous danny said no they arent karen snapped at him they have no venom most of them eat fungus and decaying material detritus i think daddy longlegs are beautiful to me theyre the giraffes of the microworld only an arachnologist would say that rick hutter said to her the herd of daddy longlegs moved on and the noises of their pattering feet faded the darkness thickened and filled the forest like a rising tide the sounds of the forest became different it meant that a whole new set of creatures was coming out its the changing of the guard karen kings voice came out of dimness the new shift will be hungry they couldnt see one another clearly now as the night advanced the noises rose up and grew stronger more insistent swirling around them from near and far came screeching booming wailing tapping whistling stretchedout growling and pulsing sounds the humans could feel vibrations running through the ground too for some insects communicated by tapping on the ground or on a surface the students couldnt understand a word of it they curled up next to one another while amar singh took the first watch holding the harpoon he climbed up on the leafroof of the fort where he sat bolt upright listening and sniffing the air the air was thick with pheromones i dont know what im smelling he confessed its all strange to me amar began to wonder how they were able to smell anything their bodies had been shrunken by a factor of a hundred presumably this meant that the atoms in their bodies were a hundred times smaller as well if so how could the tiny atoms in their bodies interact with the giant atoms of the environment they shouldnt be able to smell anything in fact they shouldnt be able to taste anything in fact how could they breathe how could the tiny hemoglobin molecules in their red blood cells capture the giant oxygen molecules that existed in the air they breathed theres a paradox amar said to the others how can the tiny atoms in our bodies interact with the normalsize atoms of the world around us how can we smell anything how can we taste anything in fact how does our blood manage to hold oxygen we should be dead no one could figure it out maybe kinsky would have had an answer rick said maybe not peter said i get the idea nanigen doesnt understand their own technology very well rick had been thinking about the microbends he had been secretly inspecting his arms and hands looking for bruises so far he hadnt noticed anything maybe the microbends are caused by some mismatch in the sizes of atoms he said maybe something goes wrong in the interactions between the small atoms in our bodies and the large atoms around us a mite crawled over amar and he plucked it off his shirt and dropped it not wanting to hurt the creature what about our gut bacteria we have trillions of gut bacteria inside us did they get shrunk too nobody had any idea amar went on what happens if our supertiny bacteria get loose in this ecosystem maybe theyll die of the bends rick said a silvery glow had brightened the forest slightly the moon was up and was climbing higher in the sky along with the moon came an eerie booming cry which echoed through the forest puuueeeoooooo my god what was that someone said i think its an owl were hearing it at a lower frequency the hoot sounded again coming from a tree top and the cry sounded like a death threat wrapped in a moan they felt the owls lethal presence somewhere above them im beginning to understand what it feels like to be a mouse erika said the hooting stopped and then a pair of sinister wings crossed the canopy in total silence the owl had bigger prey to catch it had no interest in anything as small as a microhuman a creaking rustling tremor shook them the ground heaved theres something under us danny cried leaping to his feet he lost his balance as the ground began to break apart and he began staggering back and forth as if on the deck of a heaving ship the others scrambled up off the bed of leaves pulling out their machetes while the earth under them groaned and trembled amar took up the harpoon raised it over his head his heart hammering in his chest he was ready to kill he knew it the humans scattered running up against the palisade wondering if they should flee outside or wait and see the threat materialize and then it appeared a pinkishbrown cylinder of stunning size rising up from the bowels of the earth thrusting the dirt before it danny screamed amar almost threw the harpoon but checked the thrust at the last moment its just an earthworm guys amar said putting down the harpoon he wasnt going to stab an earthworm if he could help it the gentle animal was just trying to make a living in the dirt and was a threat to nobody the earthworm didnt like what it found it withdrew sliding back down into the earth and it traveled on crunching like a bulldozer while the palisade wall jiggled and shook as the moon climbed the bats came out the students began to hear whistling cries staccato sounds and whooshing roars crisscrossing the treetops and gulfs above them the bats sonar the noise was eerie the sound of flying predators using beams of ultrasound to probe the air for prey a bats sonar is too highpitched for human hearing but in the microworld the bats sounded like submarines pinging the deep they heard a bat zeroing in on a moth and killing it the kill began with a lazy chain of pings the bat was directing pulses of sound toward a moth identifying the prey and ranging the moth getting its distance and the direction it was flying next the bats pings sped up and grew louder erika moll explained what was happening the bat is painting the moth with sonar it is firing a beam of ultrasound at the moth and hearing the echoes that come back the echoes tell the moths location its size and shape and the direction its flying the pings get faster as the bat zeroes in on the moth often as a bat was pinging a moth the moth would defend itself with a loud drumming noise moths have very good hearing erika explained the moth had heard the bats sonar and the moth was starting up its defensive noisemakers the banging sounds were coming from drums on the moths abdomen the sounds could jam the bats sonar confusing the bat making the moth invisible to the bat as a bat closed in on a moth there would be a crescendo of bat pings mixed with a rising drumming sound as the moth tried to jam the bats sonar ping ping ping went a bat pompompompom went a moth trying to jam the bats sonar sometimes a moths drumming would end abruptly the bat ate the moth erika informed them they listened almost hypnotized as the batsounds played over their heads and then a bat passed right over their fort with a whoomp of velvet wings the sound of the animals sonar as it passed almost deafened them and left their ears ringing this world scares the hell out of me karen king said but somehow im glad to be here anyway i must be nuts at least its interesting rick commented i do wish we had a fire erika muttered cant do it it would advertise us to every predator out there said peter erika moll was the person who had advised them not to build a fire but even so the ancient human in her longed for a fire a simple fire warm and bright and comforting a fire meant safety food home but only darkness and chill and weird noises surrounded her she began to notice the sound of her heart thudding in her throat her mouth had gone dry and erika realized that she was terrified more frightened than she had ever been in her life the primitive part of her mind wanted to scream and run even when the rational part of her mind knew it would be certain death to run blindly through this superjungle at night the rational thing was to stay silent and not move yet her primitive fear of darkness threatened to overwhelm her the darkness seemed to coil around the humans and watch them what id give for a light erika whispered just a small light i would feel better she felt peters hand close around her hand dont be afraid erika he said erika began to cry silently gripping peters hand amar singh sat with the harpoon across his knees he smeared more curare on the point working by sense of touch and hoping he wouldnt cut himself peter began to sharpen his machete with the diamond sharpener they heard a whisk cling sound as peter passed the sharpener back and forth over his machete the others slept or tried to sleep the sounds changed a blanket of quiet dropped around them the quiet woke the sleepers they listened straining their ears the quiet seemed worse than any noise whats going on rick hutter said take up your weapons peter whispered urgently there were clinking soundsmachetes being grappled held poised then a strange soft whistling noise began it seemed to come from several places at once the whistling came closer something was approaching what is that it sounds like breathing maybe its a mouse thats no mouse it has lungs anyway yeahtoo many lungs peter said get your headlamps ready turn them on at my signal whats that smell an acrid musty reek filled the air it grew stronger and thicker until the smell seemed to coat their skin like oil thats venom peter jansen said what kind peter karen asked sharply peter tried to summon from his memory the odors of different venoms he didnt recognize it i dont know what a very large heavy animal began rushing toward them making crashing sounds lights peter shouted several headlamps came on and the beams crisscrossed over a vast centipede rippling toward them it had a bloodred head studded with four eyes under its head a pair of red fangs with black tips were held open around a complicated mouth the centipede traveled on forty legs moving in waves and its body was encased in segmented armor the color of mahogany it was a hawaiian giant centipede a scolopendra one of the largest centipedes on earth chapter fern gully october am the scolopendra burst through the wooden palisade scattering splinters while the people leaped and tumbled aside screaming and shouting the centipede had a keen sense of smell and the humans scent had provoked it to attempt an ambush the centipede mistook the leafbed for its prey and sank its fangs into it as the humans scattered with astonishing speed it coiled itself around the leafbed gallons of venom gushed from the fangs splashing and filling the air with a foul odor the individual legs of a giant centipede end in pointed fangsfootfangs each footfang is loaded with venom and can deal a sting the scolos forty legs hammered around dribbling venom amar had been sitting on the leaf roof of the shelter when the centipede crushed the roof amar fell down among the coils he threw himself facedown to the ground trying to protect himself karen knew something about centipede anatomy she shouted to amar watch out for the legs each leg has a poison barb amar rolled over and began writhing this way and that while the footfangs danced and thrust around him dribbling venom he was going to be pierced by one of those feet amar peter shouted he advanced with his machete and began hacking at the centipede trying to draw the centipede away from amar but the machete had no effect only bounced off the armor amid shouts and crisscrossing headlamp beams the others struck at the centipede with their machetes trying to distract it and give amar a chance to escape karen sprayed the benzo spray but the animal didnt even seem to notice the centipede suddenly let go of the leafbed and began lashing its head back and forth opening and closing its mouthfangs looking to seize prey it had poor eyesight but could detect smell with its antennae which it now whacked around an antenna slapped karen knocking her into the wall of the palisade the centipede swung around and faced her amar lying on his back on the ground rolled away as the centipede turned on karen he struggled to his feet still holding the harpoon and shouted hey that had no effect so amar jumped up onto the centipedes back he stood on the armored shell trying to keep his balance as it heaved around holding the harpoon uncertain where to thrust it aim for the heart karen shouted he had no idea where the heart was the creatures body was divided into many segments where he shouted segment four amar counted four segments down from the head and raised the harpoon but then hesitated there was something magnificent about the creature in that moment of hesitation the centipede heaved its back amar drove the harpoon down deep into the centipedes back but was thrown off he tumbled to the ground the harpoon still lodged in the centipedes back the centipede whirled around twisting and writhing and its fangs snapped shut the point of one fang slashing across amars chest tearing apart his shirt and covering him with squirting venom the venom drenched amar amar curled up moaning in pain he felt as if his chest had been dipped in flames the centipede went into a flurry while the harpoon clanged around rick and karen rushed in and dragged amar away the centipede uncoiled coiled up again hissing the harpoon stood in its back go up karen shouted centipedes dont climb trees they had camped at the foot of a tree and the tree was covered with moss they jumped up into the moss grabbing handholds and footholds and started to climb because gravity was less powerful in the microworld they could climb quickly and easily amar tried to climb but shooting waves of pain were running through his body and he couldnt grip anything peter hauled amar up lifting him under the arms and trying not to touch the wound on his chest they quickly reached two feet above the ground and they stopped in a sort of cave of moss looking out and down trying to see the centipede the centipede was crawling out of the ruins of the fort the harpoon waving in its back they could hear it hissing it did not get very far it became still and its breathing ceased amar had dealt it a fatal blow with the harpoon ricks curare had worked they were huddled in a cave of moss two feet above the ground out of reach of any centipede they had turned off their headlamps amar singh seemed to be going out of his mind peter and karen held him talking to him trying to keep him calm amar was in shock sweating profusely but his body temperature plummeted and his skin felt cold and clammy they wrapped him in the space blanket they also examined him with a light the slash from the centipede fang had laid open his chest to the bone and he had obviously lost a lot of blood he had been splashed with a large quantity of venom too which had drenched the wound there was no way of knowing how much venom amar had absorbed or what it would do to him amar struggled with them delirious his breathing ran fast and shallow it burns amar listen to me youve been envenomed peter said we have to leave this place you need to keep still no amar struggled while the others held him and tried to calm him its coming its almost here he moaned what is were going to die amar screamed he fought to escape they held him down trying to quiet his struggling peter knew that the venom of centipedes had not been studied much by scientists there was no antivenin no antidote for any type of centipede venom peter feared amar might go into a breathing arrest some of the symptoms of centipede envenomation resembled rabies amar was experiencing waves of hyperesthesia feeling and sensing everything with too much intensity sounds were too loud and the slightest touch on his skin made him cringe he kept trying to pull the space blanket off his body it burns it burns he kept saying peter flicked on his headlamp for a moment to get a look at amar turn it off amar screamed swinging his arms the light hurt his eyes his eyes watered with tears that streamed down his face though he wasnt crying above all an unspeakable feeling of doom had gripped amars mind he seemed to believe that at any moment something terrible would happen we have to leave this place he moaned its coming its getting closer but he couldnt say what it was run amar shrieked he tried to crawl out of the moss cave and jump peter and the others struggled with him and they held his arms and legs trying to keep him from leaping from the tree into the night for a long time amar singh struggled and babbled but during the early hours of the morning he grew quieter and seemed to stabilize or perhaps he had exhausted himself peter took this as a good sign he hoped amar was turning the corner im going to die amar whispered no youre not hang in there ive lost my faith when i was a little kid i believed in reincarnation now i know theres nothing after death its the venom talking amar ive hurt so many people in my life no way to make it up now come on amar you havent hurt anybody peter hoped his voice conveyed confidence all of this happened in darkness for they didnt dare turn on their lights erika moll had been very afraid of the dark as a small child and her fear of the dark roared back as she listened to amars frightened babbling amars suffering hit erika moll harder than the others and she began to cry she couldnt stop crying will somebody shut the woman up please danny minot said its bad enough with amar going insane but this sobbing is getting on my nerves he began stroking his nose running his fingertips over his face peter could see that danny wasnt doing well either but he turned his attention to erika he put his arms around her and smoothed her hair they had been lovers but this wasnt love it was survival just trying to keep people from dying it will be all right he said to erika and squeezed her hand erika began reciting the lords prayer vater unser im himmel she turns to god when science fails her said danny what do you know about god rick said to him as much as you do rick the others tried to sleep the moss was warm and soft and they were exhausted after the harrowing fight none of them wanted to fall asleep but sleep took them gently in its arms anyway chapter chinatown honolulu october am lieutenant dan watanabe sat at a table in an eatery in downtown honolulu called the deluxe plate holding a piece of spam sushi in his fingertips the sushi was a ball of fried rice wrapped in seaweed with a chunk of spam at the center he took a bite the seaweed the fried rice and the salty pork combined in his mouth into a taste that could be found nowhere but hawaii he savored it chewing slowly during world war ii whole shiploads of spam had arrived in hawaii to feed the troops american soldiers had basically fought the war on spam spam and an atomic bomb had guaranteed american victory at the same time the people of hawaii had developed a passion for the canned pork product a love that would never die dan watanabe believed that spam was a brain food he believed it could help him think more clearly about a case right now he thought about the missing nanigen executive the executive eric jansen had apparently drowned off makapuu point when his boat had stalled out and flipped in heavy surf however his body had not turned up plenty of white sharks cruised the molokai channel the stretch of sea between makapuu point and the island of molokai and the sharks could have eaten the body but more likely the body should have washed up around koko head since the prevailing winds and currents would carry it that way instead it disappeared then shortly after erics disappearance his brother peter jansen shows up in hawaii and then peter disappears the honolulu police had gotten a call from the chief security officer of nanigen donald makele who reported that seven graduate students from massachusetts had gone missing along with a nanigen executive named alyson f bender one of those students had been peter jansen the students had been in employment discussions with nanigen all eight persons including the bender woman had gone out for the evening and never returned don makeles call had been taken by the missing persons detail in the honolulu police department a report had been written up and it ended up in the daily highlights bulletin that circulated through the department each morning watanabe glancing over the highlights had noticed it so there were two missing nanigen executives eric jansen and alyson bender plus seven students nine people tied to nanigen gone of course people did go missing in hawaii especially young tourists the surf could be very dangerous or they went on a drinking binge or they got so high on puna weed they seemed to forget their names they hopped a flight to kauai and went backpacking on the na pali coast and didnt tell anybody where theyd gone but nine people all linked to nanigen from different places doing different things all missing dan watanabe took a swig of black coffee and finished off his sushi he had an unpleasant feeling mixed with a professional curiosity he could almost smell it it was a whiff of probable cause a scent of unrevealed crime refill the waitress misty said to him offering a coffee pitcher thanks it was kona coffee strong enough to put structure in ones afternoon dessert dan we got a haupia chiffon pie watanabe patted his stomach gosh no thanks misty i just had my ration of spam misty left the check on the table and he stared out the window an elderly chinese woman passed by hauling a wheelie basket full of her days shopping which included a fish wrapped in newspaper the tail sticking out a shadow raced down the street darkening the peoplea passing cloudthen hot sunlight flared then another cloudshadow as usual the trade winds were driving rain and sunlight across oahu rain and sun endlessly marching over the island and when you looked into the mountains you often saw rainbows he put on his sunglasses and walked back to police headquarters taking his time running his tongue over his teeth trying to work out a spam knot from between his molars by the time he got back to his office watanabe had made up his mind he had decided to open an investigation into nanigen do it quietly the matter was sensitive nanigen was a rich company with a highprofile ceo the company might have political connections who knows the nanigen matter would take time away from his investigation into the bizarre case involving the three dead menthe lawyer willy fong the pi marcos rodriguez and the unidentified asian male the victims had bled to death from numerous cuts while theyd been inside fongs locked office the willy fong mess as he liked to call it would have to go on hold he wasnt getting anywhere with the willy fong mess anyway at headquarters watanabe dropped by the office of his boss marty kalama i want to look into these disappearances at nanigen why dan kalama said sitting back and blinking rapidly watanabe knew kalama wasnt questioning his methods kalama just wanted to hear what he had in mind his reasoning watanabe said first i want to wait a short while and see if the missing people turn up if they dont ill assemble a squad but right now i just want to do a little poking around on my own lowpro you suspect criminal activity i dont have probable cause but things dont add up okay kalama said explain peter jansen when i showed him a video of his brother eric drowning he seemed to recognize a female in the video who was a witness to the drowning but then he like covers it up says he doesnt know the woman i think he was lying then i had a couple of my people visiting nanigen to get info on eric jansen the executive who drowned my guys met the ceo named drake drake was polite but my guys said it was like a traffic stop when the subject is visibly nervous but theres no obvious reason for him to be nervous maybe mr uh drake drake was upset about losing his executive watanabe said it was more like he had a body in the trunk of his car marty kalama squinted behind his rimless spectacles dan im not hearing about evidence watanabe patted his stomach gut my spam is talking to me kalama nodded be careful about what you know what nanigen does right watanabe grinned oops he hadnt yet looked into nanigens business they make small robots kalama went on really small okay so a company like that could have contracts with the government thats trouble you know something about nanigen watanabe asked his boss im just a cop cops dont know shit watanabe grinned ill keep you out of it the hell you will kalama snapped get out of here he took off his glasses and polished them with a kleenex watching dan watanabe leave the guy was quiet and smart one of his best detectives those were the ones who created the worst trouble the thing about trouble was that marty kalama kind of enjoyed it chapter fern gully october am morning came and the six survivors stirred inside a pocket of moss on the trunk of a tree somewhere on a rainforested mountainside in the koolau pali the birds were singing slow and deep they sounded like whales calling to one another in the deep sea peter jansen stuck his head out of the hiding place in the moss on the side of the ohia tree and looked around he could see the remains of the fort on the ground below trashed by the centipede nearby lay the dead centipede ants had already begun butchering it and had removed large portions of the carcass they were near the bottom of a sea peter reflected it was a sea of jungle as deep as any ocean he craned his neck looking up along the trees trunk the tree was young and small and its crown was ablaze with red blossoms as if the tree had burst into flame i think we should try to climb to the top peter said why rick asked peter looked at his watch id like to get a view of the parking lot to make sure were headed in the right direction and to watch what happens in the parking lot makes sense rick said peter and rick pulled their heads in the others sat huddled in the moss with amar between them wrapped in the silver blanket he had finally fallen asleep a bruise had developed on the side of his head extending over his left temple it might be just a bruise or it might be a sign of the bendsin any case they decided that rick would remain with amar to look after him while the others would attempt to climb the tree there were four radio headsets all told rick would keep one radio while the climbers would carry the others peter said we should keep radio silence except in an emergency you think somebody from nanigen could be listening karen said the radios range is only a hundred feet but if drake suspects were alive he may be listening for us and hes capable of anything peter answered they began climbing the tree peter led the way up the first pitch he put on the belt with the reel and line attached to it and carried the rope ladder from the backpack karen king took along rick hutters blowgun and the box of darts and the jar of curare karen would serve as the expeditions hunter tree climbing proved to be extremely easy mosses and lichens as well as the rough bark offered plenty of handholds and footholds as they climbed they were strong enough in the microworld to be able to hang from something with one hand even by just a few fingers and it didnt really matter if you fell there was no real danger in a fall youd land on the ground unhurt they took turns leadclimbing one person secured by another with the reel and belt down below would lead the way up the trunk carrying the rope ladder which he would then secure to the tree and drop down to the others to climb the tree was covered with furrowed bark and the bark was densely packed with mosses and liverwortstiny plants some of them almost microscopic in size though to the microhumans the mosses and liverworts seemed as big as shrubbery the tree was also crusted with many kinds of lichens frilly lacy and knobby the leaves were rounded and leathery and the branches snaked around eventually danny minot gave up i cant do this he said and sat down and tucked himself into a lump of lichen in a sunny warm spot do you want to stay here while the rest of us go on peter asked actually id prefer to be in the algiers coffeehouse in harvard square drinking espresso and reading wittgenstein danny grinned weakly peter handed him a radio headset call if you have an emergency okay peter put his hand on dannys shoulder everythings going to be all right obviously not danny tucked himself down into a frilly lichen we cant just give up danny danny scowled and leaned back in the lichen and put on the radio headset testing testing he said into the radio his voice crackled in their ears heyradio silence peter warned him vin drake help sos were stuck in a tree danny shouted into his mike knock it off i was only joking got a transmission johnstone bent over the radio locator in the cockpit of the hexapod earphones on his head he started laughing dumb bastardstheyre calling drake for help his eyes moved upward searched the canopy theyre in a tree somewhere above us telius grunted a pair of binoculars hung around his neck telius stood up with the binoculars and began searching through the crowns of trees all around looking for motion listening for voices the spies were somewhere up there they were not going to be easy to find he couldnt see anything then he silently pointed with one finger go this way johnstone toggled the joystick the hexapod responded by walking swiftly and smoothly across the forest floor making almost no sound only a faint whine coming from the motors on the legs telius was pointing to the base of a tree a pandanus tree telius pointed upward along the trunk up he said johnstone operated a control and claws on the vehicles feet were withdrawn into sheaths revealing soft pads covered with extremely fine bristles they were nanobristles the bristles similar to the pads on a geckos feet could stick to virtually any surface even glass the hexapod began to walk straight up the trunk of the tree strapped in the cockpit the two men hardly seemed to notice that the walker had gone vertical they could barely feel gravity anyway the climbers reached the top branches of the ohia tree and karen king led the way up the final pitch she crawled and walked along a high branch into a cluster of leaves that stood in bright sunlight where she broke out into a magnificent view the others followed her and they ended up standing on a branch among the leaves the branch swayed in the breeze the ohia blossoms red and spraylike resembled fireworks the flowers consisted of a radiant explosion of red stamens and they smelled impossibly sweet the view from among the flowers took in the manoa valley and the surrounding mountain ridges around the valley mountain flanks cloaked in green and sheared by cliffs plunged down from ridges and defiles veiled in clouds waterfalls threaded through rifts in the forested mountainsides tantalus peak the curving rim of a volcanic crater looked down on the valley from the north to the southwest beyond the narrow mouth of the valley the buildings of honolulu rose revealing how close to the city the valley was even so the nanigen headquarters on the far side of pearl harbor might just as well have been a million miles away off to the southeast they saw the greenhouse and the parking lot a dirt expanse dotted with puddles of rainwater the parking lot was empty and deserted no sign of people or vehicles at the narrow mouth of the valley the access tunnel was visible running through a cliff area they could see the security gate the gate was closed peter took a compass reading on the parking lot parking lot is on a bearing of a hundred and seventy degrees southsoutheast he said to the others as he peered at the compass then he looked at his watch it was ninethirty in the morning the shuttle truck wouldnt arrive until the afternoon if indeed it did arrive but right now the valley looked devoid of human activity a thundering sound passed by overhead in the leaves instinctively the humans ducked grabbing at leaves and wedging themselves down peter went sprawling look out he yelled a butterfly zoomed past its wings patterned with orange gold and black made booming sounds as the creature whipped and twisted through sunlight the insect seemed to be playing then it hovered wings thundering and landed on an ohia flower droplets of nectar gleamed in the blossom the butterfly unrolled its proboscis and sent it deep into the flower until the tip touched a droplet they heard sucking squishing sounds as the butterfly pumped seemingly endless gallons of nectar into its stomach peter slowly raised his head karen was laughing you should see yourself peter frightened by a butterfly its uh impressive peter said sheepishly the species erika told them was the kamehameha butterfly native to hawaii it fed in the flower for a while poking here and there while the wind carried a bitter stench to the humans the butterfly might be lovely to look at but it gave off a nasty smell its a chemical defense erika moll said phenols i think the compounds are bitter enough to make a bird throw up the butterfly ignored the humans it took off from the flower and with powerful strokes caught the wind and soared outbound into the blue oceans of air the butterfly had taught the humans a lesson the flowers dripped with liquid sugar just what they needed for energy karen king crawled into a flower headfirst she reached a glob of nectar and began scooping it into her mouth with both hands you guys have to try this her voice came out of the flower muffled with stickiness she could feel her body ramping up with energy almost as soon as she swallowed the nectar the others crawled into flowers and drank as much nectar as possible while they gorged on nectar a movement in the distance caught peters eye somebodys coming he said they stopped drinking and watched as a vehicle approached in the distance coming up the winding road from honolulu it was a black pickup truck it followed the road along the cliff edge as it climbed and stopped at the gate in front of the tunnel here the driver got out peter studying the scene with binoculars saw the man take a yellow sign from the back of the pickup truck the man placed the sign on the gate he put up a sign peter said what does it say karen asked peter shook his head i cant see is it the shuttle truck hold on the man drove the truck through the gate it closed behind him moments later the truck emerged from the tunnel and descended into the valley and stopped in the parking lot the man got out peter studied the scene through the binoculars i think its the same man who dug up the supply stations muscular guy wearing an aloha shirt theres a sign on the truck that says nanigen security that doesnt sound like the shuttle karen said no in the parking lot the man walked around scuffing at things peering at the ground then he got down on his knees and started running his hand back and forth under a clump of white ginger plants hes searching the ground around the edge of the parking lot peter said for us karen asked looks like it thats not good now hes talking on a handheld radio to somebody uhoh what hes looking straight at us karen scoffed he cant see us hes pointing toward us and talking on the radio its like he knows where we are thats impossible karen said now the man went over to the back of the truck and lifted out a spray tank of some kind he hoisted the tank to his shoulder on a strap and walked around the edge of the parking lot spraying the vegetation then he sprayed the surface of the parking lot as well what is that about erika asked poison i bet karen said to her they know were alive theyve guessed wed try to hitch a ride on the shuttle so theyre nuking the parking lot and im sure theres no shuttle now theyre trying to trap us in this valley theyre figuring well die here lets make them wrong peter said karen remained very skeptical how well revise our plan said peter how karen asked well go to tantalus peter answered tantalus thats insane peter but why erika asked peter said theres a nanigen base up there there could be people at the base they might help us you dont know and jarel kinsky talked about airplanes at tantalus he called them microplanes microplanes karen said well ive seen a very small nanigen airplane and you guys did tooremember i found it in my brothers car amar and i magnified it it had controls and a cockpit maybe we could steal some microplanes and fly karen stared at peter thats completely totally crazy you dont know anything about tantalus base well at least they wont expect us at tantalus so we have the element of surprise but look at the mountain karen said to peter sweeping her arm indeed tantalus peak dominated the view upward a hulk of a volcanic cone blanketed with nearvertical superjungle its two thousand feet high peter she paused and thought for a moment for us thats like climbing seven mount everests but gravity wont slow us down peter answered calmly he had taken out the binoculars and was sweeping across tantalus he found a massive boulder sitting in an open area on the lip of the crater that could be the great boulder the map says tantalus base is at the foot of it he couldnt see the base thoughit would be only a few feet across not visible from this distance he took out the compass and sighted a line on the boulder its on bearing of three hundred and thirty degrees from here just follow the compass line itll take weeks karen said we have a couple more days tops before the bends hit us soldiers peter said to her can walk thirty miles a day peter were not soldiers erika groaned i spose we could try karen said but what about amar he cant walk well carry him peter said what are we going to do with danny hes a pain in the ass karen said danny is one of us well take care of him peter said firmly just then peters radio beeped and started crackling with a frantic voice it was danny calling speak of the devil karen murmured peter put on the headset and heard danny minot shouting help oh god help me in the lower branches of the tree tucked in a sunny spot danny minot had fallen asleep his mouth hung open and he snored he was exhausted after the longest and most terrifying night of his life he didnt hear the clattering noise that approached him and hovered over him as she helicoptered hovering her expressionless eyes studied him she was a wasp she landed and advanced carefully lightly she touched his left arm with her antennae then tapped her antennae over his throat his cheeks tasting his skin the skin so pale so soft reminded her of a caterpillar a host from the end of her abdomen hung a long tube like a length of garden hose the tube had a drill bit at the end of it she took him gently in her forelegs and planted her drill bit in his shoulder she thrust the bit into his flesh it injected anesthetic then she activated the drill bit and drove the tube in deep she began gasping making sounds that eerily resembled a woman in childbirth danny was dreaming the dream shifted he was holding a beautiful girl in his arms she was naked and gasping with arousal they kissed he felt her tongue go down his throathe looked up at her and her eyes were compound eyes bulging in a womans faceshe clutched him wouldnt let gohe woke with a start ahhg he was staring into the eyes of a giant wasp the wasp was holding him tight gripping him with her legs and burying her stinger in his shoulder and he felt nothing his arm had gone dead no he screamed and grabbed the stinger in both hands and tried to pull it out but then the wasp pulled its stinger out of his shoulder anyway and let go of him and flew away he rolled over on his back clutching his arm aah ay help the arm had become a nothingness hanging from his shoulder a dead weight with no feeling in it as if it had been pumped full of novocain he noticed a small hole in his shirt with dark wetness spreading in the clothblood he tore open his shirt and stared at a hole in his shoulder it was as neat and round as a drill hole and it oozed blood there was no sensation of pain nothing he clutched for the headset help oh god help he shouted danny peters voice came on something stung meoh my god what stung you i cant feel it its dead whats dead my arm it was so big his voice ran up into whimpering terror rick hutters voice came on whats happening he was calling from the moss cave lower on the tree where he had stayed with amar singh dannys been stung peter said dannystay where you are im coming down to you i fought it off good danny hunched up not wanting to look at his shoulder the blood oozed into his shirt he felt his forehead did he have a fever was he getting delirious he began muttering no poisonim fineno poison no poison no poison peter took the firstaid kit with him descent was easy and quick he let himself down hand over hand sometimes hanging by one hand he found danny curled up in a fetal position his face drained of color his left arm seemed limp i cant feel my arm danny whimpered peter pulled open dannys shirt and inspected the wound on his shoulder it was a small puncture wound he cleaned it with an iodine swab expecting danny to feel a sting from the swab but danny felt nothing peter searched for signs of envenomation he stared into dannys eyes looking for constriction or dilation of the pupils his eyes seemed normal he took dannys pulse noted his respiration and looked for changes in skin color or mental state danny seemed very frightened peter inspected dannys arm the skin had a normal color but the arm was limp he pinched the arm did you feel that danny shook his head nausea pain he asked danny no poisonno poison i dont think youve been envenomed if there had been venom in the sting then danny would be extremely sick with severe pain or even dead but his vital signs remained stable i think you scared it away what was it anyway a bee or a wasp danny muttered i dont know wasps were much more common than bees hawaii probably had thousands of different kinds of wasps many of them unnamed and unidentified there was no telling what kind of wasp had stung dannyif it had been a wasp at all peter opened a bandaid and placed it over the puncture in dannys shoulder then he tore off the sleeve of his own shirt and turned it into a makeshift arm sling for danny he wondered how to get danny down to the ground do you feel able to jump no maybe it wont hurt us then peter called on the radio to karen king and erika moll who were still at the top of the tree danny and i are going to jump to the ground you might as well do the same karen and erika leaned out from a cluster of leaves they couldnt see the ground karen glanced at erika who nodded were cool karen said on the radio and she checked to make sure the blowgun was strapped tightly to her back one two three erika jumped first karen following moments later as she fell into space karen spreadeagled herself like a skydiver she went into a glide wow she shouted she could see erika falling below her and erika was shouting they were gliding and it was controllable karen moved her legs and arms and went off at a slant she could feel the air flowing over her body thick and soft supporting her weight this was like bodysurfing except it was in air rather than water she slammed into a branch and tumbled into space unhurt and spread her arms again and surfed the liquid wind descending through the tree she saw erika diving at an angle below her erika had gotten ahead of her was falling faster karen wanted to slow herself down she rolled her body leftward and rightward catching the air and using her arms and legs to slow her fall whooo she yelled leaves were coming she had lost sight of erikashe heard erika scream she burst through the leavesand a spiderweb lay deadahead erika was trapped in it bouncing up and down thrashing her arms and legs trying to escape a pale green spider clung to the edge of the weba crab spidervery poisonous karen rolled her body sideways as she fell her knowledge of this spider flashing through her mind she needed to fall into the web it was the only way to save erika gotta hit the web she had no fear she could handle a crab spidershe slammed into the edge of the web and hung there bouncing in midair to karen the web seemed maybe fifty or sixty feet across far bigger than a safety net in a circus unlike a safety net the web was sticky its radial threads spangled with droplets of glue she felt the glue soaking into her clothes pinning her to the web while erika struggled in a blind panic screaming for help trapped in threads out of karens reach the crab spider seemed to hesitate possibly it didnt recognize the humans as prey karen thought but it would attack she thought and soon the attack would come in a rush hold still she called to erika she rolled herself over until she was facing the spider and drew her machete yah she shouted at the spider her eyes moved rapidly over the web she was looking for a trigger line and she saw ita thread running from one of the spiders feet across the spiral threads to the center she flung herself across the web and cut the trigger line the spider used the trigger line to sense the presence of prey in the web cutting the trigger line was like cutting a nerve it also alarmed the spider the spider suddenly fled running away and tucking itself inside a curledup leafits home most of em scare easily karen said to erika she cut another thread and the two women fell free while karen called back to the spider sorry sweetheart they landed together on the ground amid a tangle of sticky silk erika was badly shaken i thought i was going to die karen pulled threads of silk off her nothing to worry about as long as you know the structure of the web but im a beetle person erika answered peter and danny landed nearby crashing into leaves finally rick appeared lowering amar with the help of the rope they gathered in a group at the base of the ohia tree and peter explained the change of plan they would head for tantalus ten minutes later with rick and peter carrying amar between them they entered a fern forest a seemingly endless maze of sword ferns tall and dripping with moisture arching over tunnels that ran in all directions koa trees olopua trees and white kokio hibiscus trees sprang from among the ferns twisting into the upper story of the forest peter sighted with the compass that way he said and they began to walk down a long winding passageway among the ferns fronds arched far overhead covering the world in green danny was stumbling along when he stopped stared at amar singh dannys eyes widened heshes bleeding nobody had noticed rick lowered amar and amar sank to his knees while a rivulet of blood trickled out of one nostril and ran across his upper lip the blood began falling to the ground in a steady drip leave me amar whispered i have the bends chapter beneath the green canopy october noon theyre hiding in there telius said to johnstone looking through binoculars into a mass of sword ferns on the forest floor the two men were hanging upside down in their seat harnesses in the hexapod the machine in turn hung upside down from a leaf in the pandanus tree clinging to the leaf with its feet they had been able to get a fix on the radios telius stared for a while then gestured silently with one finger drop us johnstone hit a button and the footpads let go of the leaf and the hexapod went into free fall johnstone working the controls folded the legs under the vehicle as it fell it tumbled a few times its legs tucked underneath it and hit the ground and bounced and came to rest upside down the roll cage had protected the humans inside johnstone popped open the legs they lashed out and flipped the vehicle upright and the hexapod moved off stalking its way around the edge of the fern forest and went into the ferns telius stood up and turned his head listening he had heard them talking he indicated with his finger where the people were then directed johnstone to drive up a fern stem the hexapod climbed the stem got in among the fronds and stopped telius took up the binoculars and stared through them he had acquired the targets six of them down below somebody was sick had a bloody nose might be the bends the others were gathered around the victim indian guy looked like blood streamed from the guys nose and over his upper lip and chin yupthe man had the bends he was a goner poor fuckers having a bend bleedout he murmured to johnstone who grunted as he studied the group telius identified the leaderslender guy light brown curly hair standing slightly apart and talking to the others who listened this was the individual whod taken leadership of the group telius could see it telius could always tell an officer you drop the officer first of course a good setup telius nodded to johnstone and took up the gas rifle and aimed it at the groups leader while johnstone took up spotter duty training his binoculars on the target and speaking to telius telius looked through the scope and put the crosshairs on the leaders head the range was long about four meters a slight breeze stirred the fern leaf and the hexapod telius shook his head not stable the shot was a little chancy and telius left nothing to chance he would have to make several kills in quick succession on moving targets because the moment he dropped the leader the others would scatter like frightened rabbits he gestured to johnstone meaning get us lower johnstone turned the vehicle and it began creeping down the fern leaf hunting for a more stable position then telius signaled to johnstone to stop telius unbuckled himself and fell out of the hexapod spun once in the air and landed on the ground on all fours like a cat rifle on his back he crept closer to the targets peter broke open the medical kit and knelt over amar holding a compress to amars nose he didnt know what to do the nosebleed would not stop im useless please go on amar said were not going to leave you im just protein leave me amars right danny said touching his sling arm we have to leave him or well all die ignoring danny peter took the compress away from amars nose it was soaked he had lost a lot of blood and he had become anemic and the bruises all over amars armsit seemed as if the centipede venom had accelerated the bends in amar and decompression was the only treatment for the bends yet they were no closer to nanigen we have to call for help on the radio danny said plunking himself down and glowering at the others danny could be right erika said maybe there is some good person at nanigen maybe we should call karen said it might be our only chance to save amar peter stood up holding a radio headset all right from lower down on the fern stem telius took aim he had the leader in the crosshairs of his gas rifle but now the leader was bending over the guy with the bends trying to help him hmm maybe he could get both of them with one shot the leader and the bleederyeah he adjusted his aim squeezed the trigger and the gas rifle kicked viciously there was a sudden hiss a steel needle seemingly a foot long zipped past peters neck tearing his shirt and entered amar singh and detonated the explosion threw metal fragments and blood in all directions amar jerked into the air yanked off the ground and his body seemed to come apart peter froze a quizzical expression on his face while amar and pieces of amar spattered around peter peter stood up covered with amars blood what he began the others watched it happen as if it wasnt real karen looked around sniper she screamed get cover she began to dash for the nearest fern but saw that peter wasnt movinghe seemed paralyzed as if he couldnt process what had just happened the snipers second shot hit a leaf over peters head and exploded the blast sent peter to the ground karen realized the sniper was aiming for peter she swerved and ran toward peter and grabbed him duck and zigzag she screamed at him he needed to get away but not make any predictable movements the sniper could pull lead on peter and hit him as he ran go she yelled at peter peter understood he began to run left right leftleftstop run always heading for the cover of ferns karen ran too zigzagging staying with peter but not too close to him wondering if the next shot peter tripped fell and sprawled peter she screamed no peter had stopped moving he had become an easy target karenget away peter said hauling himself to his feet these were his last words in the next instant a needle flew through peters chest exploding as it went he toppled peter jansen was dead before he hit the ground chapter fern gully october pm rick hutter felt karen king lift him up by his shirt dragging him out of what he thought was a good hiding place and heard her say get upgo he noticed his blowgun lying on the ground picked it up grabbed the dart kit and sprinted for cover he lost track of karen he had no idea where she had gone he ran underneath a stick bashed through some leaves and began to run among fern stems looming over him that was when he saw the insect vehicle a sixlegged truck up there on the fern clinging to a frond and moving along it making a faint whine driven by a man wearing armor it was a man just ricks size a microhuman the man seemed experienced and confident the man stopped the vehicle held up a strangelooking gun with a largecaliber muzzle he loaded a metal needle in the breech took aim through a scope and fired the gun kicked giving off a hiss rick had flung himself down behind a rock where he lay on his back panting while he watched the man shoot the man seemed relaxed comfortable with murder rick realized while a hot rage welled up in him the man had butchered peter and amar in cold blood rick was still holding the blow tube get off a dart at that bastard anyway i think karen just saved my life it was dumb to stay crouched like that she pulled my ass out of a bad place he opened his dart kit and took out a dart looked at it with a sense of futility it was just a splinter with a metal point made from a dinner fork never get through that bastards armor he opened the curare jar and jammed the tip into the sludge and twirled it choking back a cough as an odor wafted from the jar put a hot load on the dart anyway he fitted the dart into the tube and rolled over and looked out past the rock the vehicle wasnt there it had moved out of sight where rick crept out from behind the rock listening looking around he heard a whining sound to his left the bug truck he got up and ran toward the sound and when it got louder he dove into a clump of moss and waited the sound got closer carefully he looked out of the moss the bug truck had crawled up on the moss and stopped almost directly above him he was looking at the bottom of the truck he couldnt see the man from here there was another hiss the man had fired again rick had no idea if anyone but himself was still alive karen could be dead erika too they were being slaughtered it made him furious it made him want to kill even if it cost him his life the man had stopped firing and now the truck advanced it came to a halt a short distance away and he heard the man talking on a radio theres a female at your three oclock bitch has a knife bitch karen noshe was about to be shot he started crawling frantically through the moss then got himself wedged under a fallen leaf he was looking right up at the man the man wore a helmet a breastplate armored plates over his arms his chin was bare bare neck rick aimed for the mans neck try to hit him in the jugular he inhaled slowly trying not to make a sound and blew with all his might the dart missed the mans neck but landed in the soft flesh under his chin and drove deep buried up to its fluff it had entered the mans chin just above his adams apple and gone upward rick heard a choking scream and the man tumbled down into the vehicle out of sight he heard wet cough then thrashing thumping the guy was seizing flopping around like a fish inside the truck then silence rick loaded another dart into the blowgun and jumped up on the truck ready to shoot again he looked inside the man lay sprawled face cherryred eyes popping frothy mucus drizzling out of his mouthcyanide poisoning rick realized only the tail puff of the dart remained visible a wisp of cotton stuck under the mans chin the dart had punched vertically upward through his tongue and the roof of his mouth and pierced his brain that was for peter he said his hands were shaking then his whole body began to shake he had never killed a person before hadnt thought he was capable of it off to his right he heard another hiss oh fuck not another one he thoughtanother sniper out there shooting at my friends get the bastard rick leaped from the truck and began running toward the sound holding the loaded blowgun as he ran he noticed that things had gotten darker overhead and then he sawa shadow moving in the ferns he stopped running suddenly he felt very very small and completely powerless he couldnt believe how big the damned thing was karen saw the man rise up between two fern stems he was a small man agile and catlike in his movements he wore camo armor and a glove on his right hand his left hand was bare and was closed around the guns trigger and the gun was aimed at her he was about one meter away close enough she had drawn her knife it was no match for the gun she glanced around no cover he moved out from behind the fern stems keeping the gun trained on her he seemed to be playing with her for he could make the shot easily he spoke into a throat mike found her after a pause he added you copy evidently he didnt get an answer copy he still didnt get an answer he stepped forward it was then that karen saw the shadow behind the man at first she didnt know what it was she saw something brown and covered with fur buried in a cluster of fern fronds it moved slightly then stopped she thought it must be a mammal maybe a rat because of the brown fur and because it was really big but then a leg appeared a long tapering jointed leg an exoskeleton covered with bristly brown hair then a fern frond was pushed aside and she saw the eyes all eight of them it was an enormous spider as big as a house the spider was so vast it seemed almost unrecognizable as a spider karen knew the species though it was a brown huntsman common in the tropics it was a carnivore too huntsmen spiders dont build webs they are ambush predators and they hunt on the ground this one was holding its body close to the grounda sign that it was hunting it had a flattened body protected by hair with sickleshaped fangs folded under bulbous appendages this one was a female she would crave protein karen knew since she was making eggs karen was struck by the stillness of the spider since it was an ambush predator the fact that it wasnt moving was bad news this meant it was hunting the man stood with his back to the spider unaware of it its constellation of eyes stared at the man like droplets of black glass karen heard a soft moaning intake and exhalation of air flowing through the spiders lungs located in the spiders abdomen johnstone do you copy the man said he paused listening for his partner what happened to your friend karen whispered make him talk he just looked at her not a chatty one she kept her body very still no sudden movements she knew that a spider couldnt see very well even with so many eyes but a spider had highly accurate hearing ten ears were scattered over each legholes in its armor that picked up sounds eighty ears all told in addition the thousands of hairs on its legs were also listening devices vibration sensors the hearing organs on its legs gave the spider a d soundimage of the world if she made any noise or vibration the spider would form a sonic image of her would recognize her as prey the attack she knew would happen in the blink of an eye she knelt very slowly and picked up a rock raised her arm slowly the man smiled go ahead if it makes you feel better she threw the rock at him it struck his breastplate and bounced off with a thump he raised his gun at her and took aim through the scope and chuckled just as the fangs closed around him and yanked him into the air crushing his gun he screamed the spider took a few steps forward and then surprisingly flipped itself over on its back while karen sprinted for safety lying on its back it lifted the man into the air sinking its fangs deeper the razorsharp hollow tips punched through the mans armor and began pumping venom into him his body swelled up as the venom pressurized it until his armor began to make popping sounds and blood mixed with venom began squirting out of the cracks in the armor as the venom went to work his spine curved backward and his head whipped back and forth neurotoxins in the venom set off a firestorm in his central nervous system he began to writhe and went into convulsions a grand mal seizure as he seized his eyes rolled up into his head until only the whites showed then abruptly the whites turned hotred blood vessels had burst in his eyes as they were rupturing everywhere in his body for the venom contained digestive enzymes that liquefy flesh internal hemorrhages flooded the mans body until his heart stopped the spider venom was ebola in thirty seconds the spider continued to pump poison into the body until the armor began to crack and split the breastplate popped open and the mans viscera peeked out drizzling venom karen had taken cover behind a fern where she found rick crouching blowpipe in hand they watched the spider process its meal having killed the prey while it lay on its back the spider flipped over and stood upright on its eight legs again and began cutting up the prey it gripped the man in its palps a pair of handlike appendages on either side of its mouth the fangs opened like folding knives they had serrated inner blades the blades macerated the body chopping it into a bloody mash of flesh broken bones and intestinal contents mixed with scraps of kevlar and pieces of plastic using its palps the spider handled the meatmass deftly molding and shaping it into a food ball while squirting digestive fluid into the mass through the tips of its fangs in a minute or two the human remains had been turned into a spheroid of liquescent pap speckled with bone fragments and shredded armor interesting karen whispered and turned to rick spiders digest their food outside their bodies i didnt know having digested its prey the spider placed its mouth firmly on the food ball and began sucking fluids out of the mess while its stomach made a steady pumping noise the eyes gleamed with a faraway expression karen thought or maybe a look of satisfaction do we need to worry rick asked nah shes busy but we should get out of here before she starts hunting again they began calling for erika and danny erika had hidden herself under a hibiscus flower and danny had tucked himself under a tree root there were four survivors now rick karen erika and danny they gathered themselves put on the packs and hurried off into the ferns abandoning the bodies of peter and amar while a sense of terrible emptiness swept over them amar singh a gentle person who loved plants was gone peter jansen gone it had not seemed possible that peter could die the loss of peter had devastated them he was so steady rick said i really thought he could bring us through peter was our hope erika said she began to cry i believed he would save us somehow this is what i predicted danny said he sat down and adjusted his arm sling then with his good hand unstuck some duct tape on his grass shoe and stuck it back in place trying to tighten his shoe then he put his head down between his knees his muffled voice rose up the inevitable has happenedthe catastrophewe are completely totally utterlydead actually were still alive rick said not for long danny muttered karen said we all had faith in peter he was socalm he never lost his courage she wiped sweat from her face and hefted her pack adjusting it and kept walking karen could hardly admit it to herself but for the first time she had lost her nerve entirely she was petrified she couldnt see how they would ever get back to nanigen peter was the only person who could lead us now we dont have a leader yeah and its clear that drake knows were alive and is trying to kill ussending hired killers to take us out rick said we got rid of two goons but who knows who else is out there with orders to kill us two of them karen asked him rick answered her with a grim smile look straight ahead the hexapod stood crookedly on top of a mound of moss rick leaped into the vehicle a moment later a body was flung out spinning through the air and landed with a crash at karens feet she saw the mans armor the dart embedded in the mans chin the eyes bulgingthe foamy tongue thrust out she drew in her breath there had been two snipers rick had said nothing about it until now you killedthis man get in rick said busying himself with the controls were driving to tantalus and weve got a gun chapter manoa valley october pm the pickup truck wound up the singlelane road leading to the manoa valley it was a beatup toyota spraypainted several different colors with a surfboard rack and fat tires that seemed affected by elephantiasis it arrived at the gate in front of the tunnel and stopped and a man got out he walked up to the gate and read the sign private no admittance shit eric jansen rattled the gate he examined the lock it was a keypad he tried some corporate codes but nothing worked fucking vin had changed the code on the lock for sure eric thought he backed around and drove down the road a short distance to a turnout where he rammed the truck into the undergrowth if anybody from nanigen noticed it theyd assume he was a pot farmer gone off to tend his crop on the mountain not a vice president of the company looking for his brother he put on a knapsack and hurried down the road slipped underneath the gate jogged down the tunnel beyond the tunnel in the valley he went off the road and into the forest out of sight where he opened the knapsack and took out a laptop computer and complicatedlooking box of electronic circuits it had a homemade look soldered boards an antenna he put on a pair of headphones and began to listen scanning around the seventygigahertz band he heard nothing he switched frequency checking the band of nanigens private wireless communication network and heard a garbled hiss he always heard it intracompany chatter the problem was to decipher it he waited three hours listening until the battery began to run down he packed up the gear and hurried down the road through the tunnel and back to the truck and drove off nobody had noticed him nobody had been around anyway he would be back tomorrow to listen again just in case peter and the others were somewhere in the valley he didnt know where they were only that they had gone missing chapter honolulu october pm in his windowless office dan watanabe called an officer in the missing persons detail let me know if any new information about those students comes up funny you should ask you want to call nanci harfield shes out in district right now sergeant nanci harfield was in the traffic division district covered the southwest side of oahu im at kaena she said to him weve got a luxury car upside down in the tidal inlet below the bridge the vehicle is registered to one alyson f bender slash nanigen microtechnologies theres a body trapped under the vehicle female by appearance no other bodies visible id like to have a look watanabe said he got in his brown unmarked ford crown victoria and drove it at an easy ninety along the freeway around pearl harbor he continued into waianae a town that lay on the southwest coast of oahu this was the leeward side of the island dry and sunny where the beaches were lapped by gentle waves and the smallest keiki s could play and paddle it was the rougher side of the island in terms of law enforcement though lots of car breakins and petty thefts but little or no violence anyway back in the s in the days of the kingdom of hawaii the leeward side of oahu had been a violent place a haven for bandits who robbed and murdered people who ventured there now it was mostly property crimes at kaena point a car rested upside down in shallow water the police departments heaviest winch truck was parked on the road a cable ran from the truck down through hau tangle to the car it had been a nasty job getting the cable down through the brush the car tipped as the cable yanked on it and it flipped over landing right side up a dark blue bentley convertible its soft top torn and crushed sand and water streamed out of the car and a dead woman sat in the drivers seat creepily upright watanabe made his way down the slope he tore his slacks and slipped and skidded regretting that he wore street shoes by the time he reached the car the cable had winched it out on the rocks the dead woman wore a dark business suit her hair swirled around her face and clogged her mouth her eyes were gone reef fish had eaten them he leaned into the car past the corpse and looked around he saw articles of clothing plastered all over the wet compartment clinging to the seats and caught in the twisted metal of the convertibles top board shorts a belt made of snakeskin chewed by fish a womans underpants limegreen another pair of board shorts with a tag still on them just purchased a hilo hattie shirt a pair of bootcut jeans with a hole in the right knee was the lady going to do laundry he remarked to an officer the clothing was the sort that younger people wear he noticed a plastic jug wedged under the dashboard and took it out and studied the label ethanol hmm he found a wallet in the backseat it held a massachusetts drivers license belonging to one jenny h linn one of the missing students but there were no bodies in the car other than the womanswhich might or might not be alyson bender that would have to wait for the medical examiner he climbed back up to the road there nanci harfield and another officer had photographed and measured the tire tracks in the grit leading over the shoulder of the road watanabe looked at harfield so what do you think looks like the car stopped here before it went over then it rolled straight off harfield had searched carefully around the tire tracks for any shoeprints in the gravel the gravel was scuffed but there were no clear shoeprints she went on it looks like the driver stopped right here then the car goes off the edge no use of the brakes if shed braked youd see the skidmarks in the dirt no skidmarks means no attempt to stop she could have sat here for a while making up her mind then touched the gas and went over suicide watanabe asked her thats a possibility its consistent with these marks the evidence squad took photographs and video they bagged the body and loaded it into an ambulance which drove off silently lights flashing the totaled bentley followed riding on the deck of the police tow truck still dripping seawater watanabe ended up back at his desk at headquarters looking at the scratched metal wall he would stare at sometimes to clarify his thoughts he couldnt get over the feeling that somebody had put the clothing in the car especially that wallet people who are planning to go off dont leave their wallets behind if jenny linn had gone off voluntarily she would have taken her wallet with her what if she hadnt gone voluntarily maybe kidnapped had this been a boating accident a lost boat would explain so many people missing at the same time he called the property crimes unit and asked if there were any reports of missing boats not lately he stared at the wall some more it might be time to eat an emergency spam sushi but then his phone rang it was an officer in the missing persons unit ive got another one for you yeah who a joanna kinsky called to report her husband didnt come home from work last night hes an engineer at nanigen another nanigen missing youve got to be kidding ms kinsky says she called the company nobodys seen her husband since yesterday afternoon the nanigen security chief hadnt reported this one there were just too many nanigen people dropping out of sight in the quiet little honolulu town another phone call it was dorothy girt a forensic scientist in the scientific investigation section danwould you come down and take a look at something its the fong case ive found something shit the willy fong mess not what he needed right now don makele walked into vin drakes office he had a disturbed look on his face telius and johnstone are dead drake gritted his teeth what happened i lost radio contact with them they had located the survivors they had begun the uh rescue operation makele said he was sweating again right in the middle of this they were attacked by something i heard screaming and thenteliuswellhe got eaten eaten i heard it some kind of predator his radio went dead i called for a long time there were no more transmissions what do you think i think everybodys dead why my men were the best something got through their weapons and armor so the students makele shook his head not a chance drake leaned back so there was an accident with a predator makele sucked on his lips when i was in afghanistan i noticed something about accidents whats that drake asked accidents happen more often to assholes drake chuckled thats true the rescueit failed sir drake realized that don makele understood exactly what was meant by rescue nevertheless drake had his doubts how can you be sure don that the rescueahfailed theres no survivors im sure of it show me the bodies but there arent i will not believe the students are dead until i see evidence of their deaths drake leaned back as long as theres hope we will spare no effort to save them no effort am i clear makele left drakes office without saying a word there was nothing to say as for vin drake he felt reasonably good about what had happened to telius and johnstone it meant he didnt have to pay them bonuses in valuable stock nevertheless he could not assume that all the students were dead they had shown some survival skills surprising tenacity and so he would continue to try to flush them out just in case some of them were still alive chapter the pali october pm this thing would kick ass in boston traffic karen king remarked she was driving the hexapod up a steep slope guiding it across a jumble of rocks and grass stems it lurched please watch my arm danny was sitting in the passenger seat gripping his left arm which hung like a sausage in the sling it had become badly swollen filling the sleeve of his shirt the hexapod moved along steadily its legs whining climbing through a vast vertical world glowing with a million shades of green in the cargo compartment in back erika sat huddled tied in with rope rick walked along beside the vehicle holding the gas rifle and looking around alert for predators a bandolier of needlebullets slung over his shoulder the terrain had gotten very steep the soil had given way to crumbly lava pebbles and grit with protruding masses of lava rock everything festooned with grasses and small ferns koa and guava trees twisted this way and that mixed with thin straight shafts of loulu palms many of the trees were draped with vines branches rattled in a steady wind that blew across the mountain face and the breeze occasionally battered the truck and the humans a wall of mist drifted through the vegetationa cloudfollowed by brilliant sunshine the deaths of peter jansen and amar singh weighed on the students their group had been winnowed from eight people stranded in the microworld down to four survivors their number had been cut in half in just two days fifty percent fatalities that was a horrible statistic thought rick hutter it was worse than the life expectancy of soldiers fighting on the beaches of normandy rick could see more fatalities comingunless by some miracle they were rescued but they couldnt reveal themselves to anyone at nanigen now for vin drake had mobilized his resources to try to find them and make them disappear drakes still looking for us rick remarked im sure of it thats enough karen said to him there was no point talking about vin drake since all that did was to make them feel more helpless peter wouldnt give up karen said to rick more calmly as she worked the controls guiding the truck straight up the face of a large rock rick jumped on board for the ride they had gotten into mountain vegetation occasional gaps in the canopy revealed a striking vista cliffs and blades of the pali plunged all around and a waterfall roared nearby somewhere above them a curving stretch of ridge formed the lip of tantalus crater as the machine marched along its feet stirred up living things startled springtails bounced away flipping through the air worms wriggled and seethed mites scuttled here and there sometimes climbing up the legs of the hexapod they had to keep brushing mites off the vehicle or the creatures would crawl around inside it and all over the gear dropping small blobs of mite dung and getting everything dirty and in the air all around insects by the thousands flew humming past spiraling around glittering in the sunlight i cant stand all this life danny complained he hunched forward over his bad arm looking utterly miserable if the batteries last rick was saying we might make tantalus by nightfall what then karen said working the controls we do reconnaissance watch the base then decide our next move what if the base isnt there torn out just like the stations do you have to be such a pessimist im just trying to stay realistic rick fine karen tell me your plan karen didnt have a plan so she didnt answer rick just get to tantalus and hope something turns up it wasnt a plan it was a hailmary pass as they moved along karen considered their situation she was profoundly frightened she had to admit it but her fear also made her feel very alive she wondered how much longer she had to live maybe a day maybe hours better make the best of it just in case your life turns out to be as short as an insects she told herself she looked over at rick hutter how did the guy do it there he was tramping along with the gun slung over his shoulder swaggering a little looking like he didnt have a care in the world for a moment she envied him even though she disliked him she heard a moan it was erika sitting in the back of the truck with her arms wrapped around her knees are you all right erika karen asked her all right are youscared of course i am scared try not to be too scared itll be okay karen said erika didnt reply she didnt seem able to handle the pressure of this journey karen felt sorry for erika and worried about her don makele paid a visit to the communications center at nanigen a small office equipped with encrypted radio gear and corporate wireless networking equipment he spoke to a young woman who was monitoring all the corporate channels i want to try to get a ping from a piece of equipment weve lost in manoa valley he said to the young woman he gave her the serial number of the piece what kind of equipment is it she asked him experimental he wasnt going to tell her it was an advanced hexapod from the omicron project typing commands by remote the young woman switched on a highpower seventytwogigahertz transmitter on the roof of the greenhouse in the waipaka arboretum it was a lineofsight transmitter where should i point it northwest toward supply station echo got it tapping a keyboard she oriented the transmitter now ping the young woman entered a command and stared at the screen nothing she said start pinging in a search pattern around that location she worked the keys for a while still nothing happened now point the transmitter up the mountainside do sequential pings after she worked some more she brightened got it it pinged me back where is the equipment gosh its on the cliffs halfway up tantalus she called up an image of the terrain on her screen and pointed to a spot on the mountainside far above the bottom of manoa valley how did the equipment get there she asked i dont know makele answered somebody had survived they were now driving the hexapod straight up the mountain interesting makele returned to drakes office just for the hell of it i pinged the hexapod i got a ping back guess what the hexapod is halfway up to tantalus crater drakes eyes narrowed what the hell somebody had survived the predator that had eaten telius and johnstone can we find that hexapod retrieve it those cliffs are really steep i dont think we could reach the hexapod right now plus we cant get a tight fix on it we can get its approximate location on the cliffs only good to a hundred meters a tiny smile formed at the corner of drakes mouth and grew wider until it had become a grin i wondermaybe theyre heading for tantalus base yeah could be drake broke into laughter tantalus base ha i would like to see their faces when they see tantalus theyre in for an ugly surpriseif they get there he became serious you go up to the crater and make sure they get a surprise ill keep track of their progress rick was driving when there was a beep and the hexapods communication panel lit up a display flared answerback what the hell was that rick said danny slumped in the passenger seat next to him turn that thing off i cant its just doing this shit on its own rick began to wonder was somebody trying to talk to them maybe it was drake but then the panel went quiet again he had a feeling though that drake might know where they were if so what would they do if drake found them the gas rifle would have no effect on a human of normal size karen walked alongside the radios acting funny he said to karen she shrugged the terrain trended upward at a steep angle they came to a low cliff and the walker climbed it at the top of the cliff they made their way around a bunch of sedge grass and came to a rock stop rick said he advanced toward the rock he had seen something under it something black and shiny its a beetle hiding under there he said erika what kind erika focused her attention on the beetle it was a metromenus the same kind theyd seen when theyd first arrived in the microworld be careful erika said they have a nasty spray exactly rick said whats up karen asked him its a chemical war out there we need chemical weapons too we dont need it karen said to him weve already got the benzo spray she lifted the spray bottle out of her pocketthe selfdefense compound that she had made in the lab which shed hoped to show to vin drake but when she squeezed the pump nothing came out it had been used up spraying the centipede rick was determined to reload the bottle with spray he crept ahead with the gas rifle took aim and fired at the beetle the needle penetrated the beetles shell there was a muffled explosion and the beetle shuddered and sprayed chemicals around in its death throes until the air reeked of acids erika assured them there would be a lot of spray left in the beetle rick put on his mad scientist outfit the rubber apron the goggles and the gloves and he went to work first he flipped the dead beetle over on its back next with his machete he began tapping around on the jointed segments of the abdomen looking for an opening erika gave him advice cut between segment six and segment seven lift the sclerite plates offgently rick sliced into the beetle working the blade along a joint between segments then pried with his machete lifting up the armored plates they came off with a tearing sound revealing fat he started cutting into the fat carefully youre looking for a pair of chemical sacs at the base of the abdomen erika explained kneeling next to rick dont burst a sac or youll be sorry rick lifted out a footballshaped organ then another one these were the chemical sacs they were closedmuscles clenched them shut following erikas instructions he cut the muscle and the sac began to leak liquid it stank thats benzo erika said its mixed with caprylic acid a detergent that helps the chemical stick to surfaces which enhances its power as a weapon dont get it on your skin it pleased karen to see erika interested in something for a change erika had gotten so quiet so depressed at least this would distract her rick collected the liquid in a bottle and screwed on the top then he handed it to karen there you go for your protection karen wondered at rick he certainly had energy she should have thought of collecting more chemicals herself rick seemed quite skilled at this business of getting along in the microworld he even seemed to enjoy it it didnt make her like rick hutter any better but somewhat to her surprise she found herself glad to have him along on the journey anyway thanks she said to him stuffing the bottle back in her pocket dont mention it rick took off his outfit and stored it away and they resumed their upward climb the land grew impossibly steep it went almost vertical and they arrived at the base of an endless cliff the cliff ran upward as far as the eye could see an expanse of bubbly volcanic rock draped with lichens and hanging moss and dotted with clumps of uluhe ferns there seemed to be no way around it damn the cliff full speed ahead rick said they made sure the equipment was tied down and then rick jumped in back with erika and tied himself in karen drove the trucks feet stuck to the rock beautifully and the truck moved upward they made excellent speed gaining altitude fast but the cliff just seemed to go on forever the day was coming to a close and they didnt know how far they had come or how far they had to go the battery readout showed that the power had been draining steadily the vehicle had only about a third of its battery power left i think we should bivouac on the cliff rick finally said it might actually be safer than anywhere else they found a ledge and parked the truck on it it was a lovely spot and it looked out over the valley they ate the last of the katydid steaks danny spread out some things in the back of the truck where he intended to spend the night his arm was clearly swollen it felt bloated and lifeless it didnt seem to belong to him anymore but had become a dead weight oooh he whispered he clutched his arm and made a face whats the matter now rick hutter said to danny my arm just popped popped nothing just a noise in my arm lets have a look rick said bending over danny no come on roll up your sleeve its fine all right dannys left arm had remained paralyzed and it hung in the sling the arm had packed the shirt sleeve giving the sleeve a bulging taut appearance the shirt was filthy too you might want to roll up your sleeve to let your skin get some air rick said that arm could get infected go away youre not my mother danny stuffed a rag under his neck as a pillow and curled up in the truck bed darkness fell over the pali the night sounds rose up again the cryptic noises of insects rick settled down in the passenger seat you sleep karen ill stay up thats all right why dont you sleep rick ill do the first watch they both ended up wide awake keeping watch in smoldering silence as erika and danny slept the bats came out and squeals and echoes sounded near and far crisscrossing the sky as the bats plucked moths and other flying insects from the air danny stirred the bats are keeping me awake he complained but soon they heard him snoring the moon climbed high over the manoa valley turning the waterfalls into silver threads falling into emptiness around one of the waterfalls an arc of light glimmered rick stared at it what was that light around the waterfall the light seemed to shimmer change karen had noticed it too she pointed the harpoon at it you know what that is right no idea its a moonbow rick she touched his arm look its a double moonbow he hadnt even known moonbows existed here they were travelers in a dangerous eden it would be just his luck to be stuck in eden with karen king of all people he found himself glancing at her well she was beautiful especially in the moonlight nothing seemed to keep karen down for long nothing seemed to defeat her karen king made a good partner for an expedition even if they didnt get along personally she did not lack courage that was for sure it was just too bad her personality was so unruly so contrary he drifted off and woke later to find that karen had fallen asleep against him her head nestled on his shoulder breathing gently chapter beretania street honolulu october pm its strange dorothy girt senior forensic scientist with the honolulu police department kept her eyes focused on the eyepieces of a zeiss binocular microscope ive never seen anything like it she stood up and dan watanabe sat down at the microscope they were in an open area subdivided by lab benches the benches were stocked with testing equipment imaging equipment microscopes computers he adjusted the eyepieces and focused at first he sawa small object with a metallic look how big is it he asked one millimeter it was somewhat larger than a poppy seed but it was a machine or looked like one what the hell he said my feeling too whered it come from fongs office dorothy girt said the evidence team dusted the office for prints they lifted this object on a print tape from a window near the lock watanabe changed the focus and moved his gaze up and down the object it was damaged it appeared to be crushed and was covered with a dark tarlike material the object vaguely resembled a vacuum cleaner except that it had something that looked like a fan on it fan blades inside a housing a little bit like a jet engine there was a long flexible neck a gooseneck and at the end of the neck two sharp flat metal pieces stuck out it must have fallen out of somebodys computer he said dorothy girt was standing next to him leaning on the lab bench she straightened up does a computer have knives in it she said quietly he looked again what he had thought were two flat pieces of metal coming off the gooseneck now looked more like blades crossed daggers gleaming at the end of a flexible arm do you think he began i want to know what you think dan watanabe turned the zoom knob he went down into the view deeper and deeper magnifying the daggers they became precision instruments forged and polished each blade reminded him of a tanto a japanese dagger used by samurai there was some kind of dark dirty material smeared on the blades and then he saw the cells dried red blood cells the cells were mixed with fibrin theres blood on it he said i had noticed how long are those blades less than half a millimeter girt answered then it doesnt work he said the victims bled to death from cuts up to two centimeters deep the cuts opened their jugulars these blades are far too small to cut somebodys throat its like trying to kill a whale with a pen knife cant do it they both were silent for a moment except at birthdays watanabe added excuse me dan youre wrapping a birthday present you cut the paper with scissors those blades are scissors he said they could have snipped large wounds in the victims he began scanning the device searching for identifying marksa serial number a printed word a corporate logo he found nothing of the sort whoever had built the device had not put on identifying marks or had carefully erased them in other words whoever had made the device didnt want it to be traced he said did the autopsies turn up any more of these devices in the wounds in the blood no girt said but the examiners probably wouldnt have noticed them whats the status of the bodies fong was cremated rodriguez got buried john doe is in the fridge he needs a second look will do watanabe stood back from the microscope and put his hands in his pockets and began to walk up and down the lab he frowned why was the device found on a window if it came out of a body how did it get to the window how did it get into the body in the first place he returned to the microscope and studied the little devices fanlike housing whoait was a propeller my gosh this thing could fly dorothy thats speculative dorothy girt said dryly it could swim in blood possibly can you recover dna from the blood thats stuck on the device a prim smile i can get dna from a fleas sneeze dan id like to see if the blood on the device matches any of the victims blood that would be interesting dorothy girt said her cynical eyes brightening a little they make small robots he murmured what dan he stood up nice work dorothy dorothy girt gave lieutenant watanabe a faint smile hardly a smile at all what did the lieutenant think she did with her time in the forensic lab other than nice work with exquisite care she picked up the tiny object with a pair of tweezers and lowered it into a plastic vial smaller than her pinky and carried the vial into the evidence locker area after all she could be handling a murder weapon watanabe went out thinking nanigen small robots now there seemed to be a link between the willy fong mess and nanigen time to have a chat with the ceo vin drake had dropped by the communications center he had kicked the young woman operator out of the room and locked the door and had taken over the pinger himself now he gazed into a screen that displayed a threedimensional terrain map of the northwest cliffs of manoa valley from the valleys bottom to the structure of tantalus crater two thousand feet above near the top of tantalus cliffs at the base of the crater he saw a circle with crosshairs over it this showed the approximate location of the stolen hexapod the survivors he could see had made it nearly to the lower slopes of tantalus crater at the rate they were climbing they would reach tantalus base maybe by tomorrow morning unless a predator got them he couldnt control the predators what he could control was tantalus base sitting in the communications room drake got out his encrypted corporate phone and called don makele the hexapod is getting close chapter tantalus cliffs october am the truck climbed up over a lip of rock and emerged into a pocket of mossy ground a small pond gleamed and a miniature waterfall dribbled into the pond as the drops landed in the water they made the water shimmer with prismatic flashes rick karen and erika climbed down from the truck they stood by the pool gazing into it it was crystalclear with a mirrorlike surface were so dirty erika said i could use a swim karen said they saw their reflections in the water they were tiredlooking and sweaty and their clothing had become ragged and grimy karen knelt and touched the water her finger dented the water but didnt break it she was touching the meniscus the rubbery surface of the water she pushed against the meniscus putting her weight into it and her hand broke through the surface its so tempting she said dont do it youll be killed danny said from the truck theres nothing dangerous here danny karen said rick wasnt so sure he took the harpoon and probed it around in the pool jabbing it into the bottom and stirring the water if any nasty creature lived in the pool he hoped the disturbance would lure it out the water flickered with singlecelled organisms drifting and corkscrewing but none of these little creatures seemed dangerous the pool was small and shallow enough that they could see all of it nothing seemed threatening im going for a swim erika said im not danny said rick and karen glanced at each other erika went off behind a clump of moss and returned naked is there a problem she said to the others while danny stared were all biologists here she stepped onto the surface of the pool the water dimpled under her toes but it supported her weight didnt break she pressed down harder and suddenly she broke through and went in up to her neck she waded over to the waterfall and stood under it the droplets tumbled down bursting on her head and making her gasp its magnificent come in karen began to take off her clothes in a matteroffact way rick hutter wasnt sure what to do he felt embarrassed to be looking at karen while she undressed more embarrassed to be swimming with her and erika naked he got his clothes off fast and jumped into the water welcome to eden erika said a dangerous eden rick ducked down and began scrubbing his head as karen explored the pool she saw it was like a fish tank full of living things but they werent fish they were singlecelled organisms the creatures spun and darted and drifted a torpedoshaped creature swam up against her it was a paramecium a pondwater animal a protozoan consisting of a single cell the paramecium was covered with rippling hairs that propelled the creature through the water it began bumping along karens arm tickling her skin she cupped her hands and picked up the paramecium holding it in a handful of water she could feel the hairs beating on her palms and the cell squirmed it reminded her of a cat that didnt like being held i wont hurt you she said to the cell stroking it gently with a fingertip as she touched the hairs they reacted by reversing direction beating against her finger it was like stroking velvet that fought back why am i talking to a cell karen thought thats pretty silly a cell is a machine she told herself its just a clockwork of proteins inside a waterfilled bag and yetshe couldnt help feeling that the cell was also a small being full of its own purposes and desires a cell wasnt intelligent the way a human is of course a cell couldnt imagine galaxies or compose a symphony yet it was a sophisticated biological system perfectly adapted to survive in this environment and bent on making copies of itself as many as possible good luck she said out loud opening her hands and letting the cell go free she watched it hurry away corkscrewing as it swam she said to rick were not so different from these protozoa i dont see the resemblance rick said a person is a protozoan on the day the person is conceived as the biologist john tyler bonner likes to say a human being is a singlecelled organism with a complicated fruiting body rick grinned the fruiting body is the best part crude karen remarked erika smirked at him a shadow crossed the pool and a scream echoed above instinctively they ducked their heads under the water when they came up rick looked around and said birds what kind karen said no idea theyre gone anyway they washed their clothes in the pool rinsing the dust and mud out afterward they spread their clothes to dry and sunbathed for a little while on the moss the clothes dried quickly we need to get going rick hutter said buttoning his shirt just then the distant cries grew louder and dark shapes flashed through the air above them the humans leaped to their feet a flock of birds was cruising along the cliffs landing and taking off the birds were foraging their cries shattered the air a bird landed before them it was enormous with shiny black feathers a yellow bill and an alert gaze it hopped around investigating the spot and screamed a raspy echoing cry and then suddenly it took off more birds arrived overhead and they began circling inspecting the scene and landing in trees that clung to the cliff face the humans became aware of many eyes watching them the cries of the birds surrounded the pool rick dashed for the truck grabbed the gas rifle theyre mynahs he shouted get cover mynahs were carnivores danny had tumbled out of the truck and he cowered underneath it karen had thrown herself down behind a rock while erika wedged herself down into clumps of moss rick knelt in the open holding the gas rifle watching the black shapes as they swept past the cliff their cries streaming in the wind the birds saw him they had no fear of something so small a mynah cruised in and landed and hopped across the ground toward him he fired at the bird the gun erupted with a hiss kicking him backward but at that instant the mynah leaped into the air and soared away downwind he had missed he reloaded frantically slamming another pin into the chamber the gun was a boltaction rifle it fired one projectile at a time he thought there must be twenty or thirty of them anyway they swirled around the cliffs their cries deafening they hunt in packs rick said another mynah landed he pulled the trigger nothing happened shit a jam he frantically worked the bolt the bird took one hop toward him and cocked an eye at him then it pecked at him and grabbed the gun it was a shiny object it had attracted the birds eye the mynah slammed the gun against a rock crumpling it and tossed it aside then it held up its head opened its beak and howled letting out a cry that seemed to make the ground shake rick meanwhile had thrown himself flat and was crawling for the harpoon which lay near the pool the mynah turned its attention to erika who cowered in the moss she crouched staring up at the bird and suddenly lost her nerve she broke and ran ducking her head whimpering dont erika rick shouted at her erikas motion drew the birds attention and it hopped toward her karen king had been watching and she made a sudden decision she would sacrifice her life for erika she would give erika a chance to live it was good while it lasted she thought and stood up and ran toward the bird waving her arms hey take me the bird swerved and pecked at karen but missed her and she went sprawling erika had now jumped into the truck and was attempting to start it erika had gone into a fullblown panic she didnt know what she was doing other than trying to get away danny shouted at her stop i order you to stop erika paid no attention the truck lurched off and began climbing upward along the rocks but it was very exposed she was deserting the others erika turn around karen screamed erika had gone past the point of hearing anybody the truck shiny and moving up the cliff its six legs working must have seemed like something tasty or interesting a mynah coasted in and plucked erika out of the drivers seat packs and gear flew out of the truck as it tumbled down the cliff and bounced out into sheer air and then it was gone the mynah landed carrying erika moll in its beak the bird slammed her several times against the cliff whipping its head back and forth to kill its prey the bird then took off carrying the corpse immediately it got into a squabble with another mynah and they fought with each other over the remains of erika moll and tore the body apart in midair it wasnt over rick had gotten his hands on the harpoon and he looked around where was karen she was lying on the ground out in the open underneath a mynah the bird which had an unusual black streak on its bill had landed and was staring down at karen it seemed to be trying to make up its mind about her was this thing edible karen rick shouted and threw the harpoon at the bird the harpoon a thread of metal went into the birds feathers not very far the bird shook itself and the harpoon dropped to the ground the bird studied karen she crouched trying to make herself look small and unappetizing over here rick shouted and started running hoping to distract the bird no rick the mynah cocked its eye at karen when she spoke it lunged for her and picked her up in its beak threw its head back and swallowed karen in one gulp then it flew off wings thundering damn you rick yelled at the mynah he waved the harpoon at the bird which had become a fluttering speck in the distance come back with her the flock in the trees chattered and roared now he couldnt tell which of them had eaten karen come back come back for a fair fight he jumped up and down waving his arms shaking the harpoon he felt like crying he would have done anything to get the mynah bird to come back the one with the streak on its bill he couldnt give up now but then he remembered something hed learned about birds a bird does not have a stomach it has a crop chapter edge of tantalus october am karen king was curled up in a fetal position inside the crop of the mynah bird holding her breath the muscular walls of the crop pressed in on her clamping her in place so that she couldnt move the walls were slimy slick and smelled foul however there were no digestive juices in the crop it was simply a bag for storing food before the food was passed down into the rest of the digestive system she knew the bird was flying because she felt the regular thumpthump of the birds pectoralis muscles driving its wings she got her arms around her face and pushed outward and managed to open a space for her nose and mouth she took a breath the air smelled horrible with an acid stench of rotting insects but at least it was air not much air though almost immediately it became stifling hot and she began to pant a wave of claustrophobia came over her she wanted to scream with an act of will she tried to calm herself if she began to scream and struggle she would use up the air quickly and would suffocate the only way to stay alive was to stay calm move sparingly and try to make the air last as long as possible she straightened her spine and pushed her legs out this stretched the crop and opened up a little more space even so she was running out of air she tried to get her knife in her hand but shed tucked it down deep in her hip pocket she couldnt reach the knife the muscular walls of the birds crop held her arm back damn gotta get that knife right then she vowed to hang her knife around her neck in the future if there was a futureshe drove her right arm downward fighting against the rubbery walls that surrounded her she forced her fingertips into the pocket and let her breath out with a whoosh gulped in nasty air and coughed her fingertips closed on a bottle in her pocketwhat was this it was the spray bottle filled with beetle spray rick had filled it a weapon she grimaced and dragged the bottle out at that moment the bird maneuvered in flight the crop tightened the muscles squeezing the breath out of her lungs with a whoosh a sensation of weightlessness came over her a sense of falling then came a lurch and a bump the bird had landed she lost consciousness the mynah had returned to the same spot where it had caught karen looking for more food it stared at rick hutter cocking its head rick recognized the black streak on its bill the same bird it had eaten karen no way of knowing if she was still alive but she might be he waved the harpoon in front of him and advanced toward the bird come and get me you cowardly bastard the masai thrust that was what he had to do to this bird a young masai warrior a boy of thirteen or fourteen can kill a lion with a spear its doable he told himself its all about technique the bird hopped toward him he watched judging the distance timing his move planning what he would do with his body the angle of the harpoon he would have to use the animals own strength and weight against itself as masai hunters do with lions the masai hunter provokes the lion to charge him and at the last instant he plants the butt of his spear in the ground with the point angled toward the lion and he kneels behind the spear the lion runs onto the spear and impales itself the bird struck at him with its beak as the strike came rick jammed the harpoons butt at an angle into the ground with the point aimed upward at the bird he took his hand off the harpoon and threw himself forward diving under the birds chest to get out of the way the harpoon caught the bird in the neck as the bird pecked down at rick with a barbed tip honed to greater fineness than a surgical needle and drenched with poison the weapon pierced the birds neck breaking through the skin and the barb stuck there the bird backed off with the harpoon dangling from its neck it shook its head trying to dislodge the harpoon while rick crawled away he sat up and drew his machete come on fight he shouted at the bird karen heard ricks voice it brought her to her sensesshe had passed out momentarily she started hyperventilating drawing air into her lungs but she couldnt get enough to breathe prickles of light flashed in her eyes a sign of oxygen starvation she became aware of the spray bottle clutched in her fist she pulled the trigger and felt a horrible burning sensation as the chemicals surged out and spread around her the muscles squeezed tighter and the stars turned into fog and then into nothing the mynah wasnt happy the harpoon had pricked it and there were unpleasant sensations in its crop it vomited karen king landed in the moss and the bird took off she was unconscious rick knelt by karen and felt her neck for a pulse and discovered that her heart was still beating he placed his mouth on hers and drove a breath into her lungs with a rasping sound she took a breath on her own she coughed and her eyes opened ohh keep breathing karen youre okay she still gripped the spray bottle her hand was locked around it rick pried her hand open and released the bottle then he dragged her under a fern there he helped her to sit up and then he cradled her in his arms take deep breaths he said he pulled a strand of hair off karens face and smoothed her hair he didnt know where the birds were whether they were still hunting in the area or had moved on but their screams had grown more distant he propped karen against a stem and sat beside her drawing his knees up he kept his arms around her thank you rick are you injured just a little dizzy you werent breathing i thought you were the cries of the birds faded the flock had moved on rick made a quick survey of their remaining gear their survival was in real jeopardy the truck was gone erika dead most of their supplies had gone over the cliff with the truck the harpoon was gone as well for the mynah had flown off with the barb still lodged in its neck the backpack lay near the pool they still had the blowgun and the curare a single machete lay on the ground danny minot was nowhere to be seen but then they heard his voice coming from above in his panic he had climbed up a vine and had come out at the top of the rock they saw him crouched up there waving his good arm i see the great boulder were almost there chapter nanigen october am drake had taken over the communications room he was staring at the screen of the remote tracking system that had been pinging the hexapod truck right now he was a little puzzled by what he saw on the screen the crosshairs on the cliff face indicating the approximate position of the truck had suddenly shifted downward by a hundred and fifty metersby about five hundred feet at first he suspected a system error but as he watched and waited the trucks location didnt change it wasnt moving he allowed himself a modest smile yes it looked like the damn truck had fallen off the cliff that had to be it the truck had plunged down the cliff face he knew that a microsize human body could survive any fall any distance but the fact that the truck wasnt moving meant that at the very least the truck had been damaged it might be busted the survivors would be in a total panic by now he realized they werent getting any closer to tantalus and the bends would be just starting to affect them they would not be feeling exactly chipper he got makele on his phone have you been to tantalus yes and i didnt do anything didnt need to its theyre not going to make tantalus anyway they took a tumble poor souls chapter kalikimaki industrial park october am lieutenant dan watanabe parked his brown ford in the single lone parking space marked visitors the painted metal building stood next to the skeleton of a halffinished warehouse on one side and an empty lot on the other side dotted with thickets of underbrush by the warehouse he noticed an area covered with gravel he walked over to it and picked up a few pieces crushed limestone interesting it looked like the same stuff trapped in the pi rodriguezs tires he dropped a few pieces in his shirt pocket for dorothy girt to have a look at the parking lot around nanigens building was full of cars hows business he said to the receptionist they dont tell me much a coffeemaker on a table diffused the sour smell of coffee that had been heating for hours would you like me to make some coffee the receptionist asked i think you already did the companys security chief walked in don makele was a heavyset man packed with muscle makele said any news on the missing students could we talk in your office as they entered the main part of the building they passed doors that were shut windows looked into rooms but the windows were covered with black blinds on the inside why were the blinds all drawn why were they black as he walked along dan watanabe felt the presence of a hum a vibration coming up through the floor that hum meant there was a lot of ac electrical current running in the building for what makele ushered watanabe into his office windowless watanabe noticed a photograph of a woman must be the guys wife two children just keiki s he noticed a plaque on the wall us marine corps watanabe sat on a chair nice kids i love em to death makele said you served in the marines intel thats cool chitchat never hurts and you can pick up things we found your vice president alyson bender he began we know she was very depressed what got her depressed shed lost her boyfriend eric jansen who drowned so ms bender and mr jansen were romantically connected i take it watanabe said he could feel the uneasiness of the man under the surface cop instinct he went on its actually pretty hard for seven people to vanish in these islands ive called around to see if the students showed up anywhere like molokai everybody on molokai knows everybody else on molokai if seven kids from massachusetts showed up there the molokai folks would be talking about it dont i know i was born on molokai makele said watanabe noticed that he pronounced the name of the island in the old way molokai with the glottal stop it made him wonder if makele spoke any hawaiian people born on molokai sometimes did speak hawaiian they learned it from their grandparents or from unclestraditional teachers molokai is a beautiful place watanabe remarked its the old hawaii whats left of it watanabe changed the subject do you know a gentleman named marcos rodriguez makele looked blank no how about willy fong a lawyer up north of the freeway watanabe did not mention they were dead makele picked it up anyway sure he squinted looked puzzled the guys who got stabbed right yes in fongs office fong rodriguez and another man still unidentified makele seemed confused he spread his hands out and said what am i missing lieutenant i dont know watanabe watched makele to see his reaction to that makele seemed surprised and irritated but he stayed calm watanabe was pleased to see that the security chief fidgeted in his chair hes nervous watanabe thought what i know about those murders don makele went on is what i saw on the news what makes you think they were murders its what they said on the news makele paused actually they said it was suicide watanabe said did you think it was murder makele didnt take it casually lieutenant is there some reason why you want to talk to me about this fong or rodriguez werent doing any work for nanigen were they are you kidding nanigen would never hire losers like that makele answered don makele knew very well what had happened to fong and rodriguez nineteen security bots had disappeared on the night of the breakin they had swarmed onto an intruder cut into his body and circulated in the mans bloodstream slicing open arteries from the inside but the bots werent supposed to do this they werent programmed to kill anybody they were supposed to photograph the intruder and cut the skin lightly making the intruder bleed and thus leave a blood trace behindand they were supposed to trigger a silent alarm that was all nothing dangerous certainly not lethal but somebody had programmed the bots to kill vin drake did it makele thought the bots had sliced he intruder to ribbons then had cut their way out of the mans body and jumped from that man to the next man like fleas bloodthirsty lethal fleas a burglar and his friends had gotten themselves killed accidents happen more often to assholes but what did this detective know makele wasnt sure and it made him nervous he decided to get tough he leaned forward and put his voice into official mode and said is this company or any of its employees the subject of a criminal investigation watanabe let a signficant silence elapse no he finally answered not at this time im glad to hear that lieutenant because this company is highly ethical the founder vincent drake is known for putting his own money into cures for orphan diseases diseases that nobody else bothers to cure because they arent profitable mr drake is a good man who puts his heart where his money is lieutenant dan watanabe listened to this with a neutral face you mean he puts his money where his heart is thats what i said makele answered gazing back at watanabe watanabe placed his card on the security mans desk and wrote a phone number on it with his pen thats my cell call it any time if anything comes up i think mr drake is expecting me vin drake sat behind his desk leaning back in an executive chair an oriental rug covered the floor an antique the air held a pleasant aroma of cigar given the pleasance of the aroma watanabe concluded that the cigar had cost more than ten dollars the office had no windows soft panel lighting he noticed through a side door a private bathroom with marble fixtures interesting to see that inside a warehouse the guy took care of himself were very distressed by the recent events drake said weve been hoping you could help us were doing our best watanabe said i just wanted to get more background on the disappearances sure watanabe had been enjoying the portrait of drake on the wall behind him it wasnt bad maybe a little pretentious but lively can you tell me what your company does basically we make small robots and use them to explore nature as a way of discovering new drugs to save human lives how small drake shrugged and put his thumb and forefinger half an inch apart watanabe squinted you mean half an inch like the size of a peanut maybe a little smaller drake answered how much smaller somewhat one millimeter say drake gave a crisp smile thats barely feasible but have you done it done what made robots one millimeter in size were getting into proprietary areas drake leaned back have you had any industrial accidents with your robots accidents drake frowned and then broke into a chuckle yesfrequently anybody get hurt its the other way around drake laughed people step on the robots by accident the robots always lose he sighed and looked at his watch i have a meeting sure just one thing watanabe would describe what hed seen in the microscope but he would not show drake a photograph of the device because a photo was evidence and you dont flash evidence so he kept things vague weve become aware of a device pretty small that appears to have what might be a propeller and cutting blades it might be able to fly or swim in somebodys bloodstream is this a nanigen product drake took a moment to reply watanabe thought the moment lasted a beat too long no drake answered we dont make robots like that does anybody make them drake gave watanabe a careful look where was this cop going i think youre describing a theoretical device what kind well it would be a surgical microrobot a what a surgical microbot also called a surgibot its a very small robot used for medical procedures in theory a surgibot could be made small enough to circulate in a patients bloodstream equipped with scalpels a swarm of surgibots could perform microsurgery they could be injected into a patient and the surgibots would swim through the bloodstream to the target tissue surgibots could cut arterial plaques from the inside of an artery for example or a swarm of surgibots could hunt down metastasized cancer cells the surgibots would kill the cancer cells one at a time thus defeating the cancer but as of now surgibots are a dream not a reality so youre not actually building thesewhat you callsurgibots not like that no im sorry i dont understand watanabe said drake sighed were getting into an area thats very sensitive why nanigen is doing researchfor you for me watanabe said looking mystified you pay taxes sure nanigen is working for you oh so youre doing government we cant go there lieutenant they were doing secret government work classified something with small robots drake was warning him off hinting hed have trouble with the government if he pursued this fine abruptly watanabe changed gears why did your vice president jump off his boat what what do you mean eric jansen was an experienced boater he knew to stay with his boat even in surf he jumped into the surf for a reason why did he jump drake stood up his face flushed i have no idea what youre getting at weve asked you to find our missing students you havent found anybody weve lost two key executives you havent given us a damn bit of help there either watanabe stood up sir we did find ms bender were still looking for eric jansen he took out his wallet and nudged out his business card drake took the card and sighed as he looked at it and an unpleasant expression flitted across his face to be frank we are disappointed with the honolulu police he let the card flutter down to his desk one wonders what you actually do well sir the honolulu police department is older than the new york police departmenti didnt know if you knew that well just keep working our cases like we always do sir weve got five more of them dorothy girt laid the photographs out for watanabe on her lab bench they showed the same devices each with a propeller inside a housing and a gooseneck with blades i found them in the asian john doe a smelly job how did you find them dorothy theyre really small dorothy girt flashed him a cool smile of triumph and opened a drawer and held up a heavy object it was an industrial horseshoe magnet i swiped it over the wounds darned thing is heavy she put the magnet aside then showed him a blowup photo of one of the robots the bot had been split cleanly in a perfect cutaway view incredibly small chips and circuitry were visible and something that looked like a battery a driveshaft gears this thing is cut perfectly in half how did you do that dorothy it was simple i mounted it in an epoxy block just like a tissue sample then i sliced it with a microtome same thing you do with tissue samples dorothys microtome with an ultrasharp blade had split the microbot right down the middle note this feature dan he bent over the photo and followed her finger to a boxlike object in the guts of the robot a small lowercase n was printed on the box so he said the ceo lied to me he wanted to slap dorothy on the back but stopped himself at the last moment dorothy girt didnt seem like a person who would welcome the gesture instead he offered her a slight nod of the head in the japanese mode of respecta family habit excellent work dorothy hmp she snorted her work was never anything but excellent chapter tantalus crater october pm mother fucking nature danny minot muttered its nothing but monsters with insatiable appetites he was trudging along dragging his grasscovered feet and holding his swollen arm protectively his arm seemed to have gotten even bigger to the point where his shirt sleeve was beginning to show small rips and tears rick hutter and karen king walked along next to danny rick wearing the backpack karen holding a machete bared and ready for action they were the last three survivors they were stumbling across a vast curving sweep of land covered with sand and gravel it was the lip of tantalus crater the open land extended to a bushy line of bamboo in the distance towering to an immense height through a gap in the bamboo a boulder the size of a mountain lurked mosscovered and furrowed with gullies the boulder seemed to be miles distant at least for people of their size the sun beat down on them no rain had passed over tantalus in many hours they were getting very thirsty their small bodies lost moisture fast karen felt exposed they were targets in motion across a wasteland without cover a bird passed overhead and she cringed and clutched her machete but it wasnt a mynah it was a hawk circling over tantalus and the humans were too small to make a decent meal for a hawkor so she hoped are you okay karen rick asked stop worrying about me but im fine check on danny he looks bad danny had sat down on a stone and seemed unable to keep going he was fondling his bad arm adjusting the sling and his face had gone white you okay man whats the meaning of that question hows your arm theres nothing wrong but now danny was staring at his arm a muscle in his arm spasmed tensing against the cloth relaxing tensing again it looked involuntary danny seemed to have lost control of the muscles why is it doing that rick asked as the spasms moved in corrugated waves along dannys arm the arm seemed to have a life of its own its not doing anything danny insisted but danny its jerking no danny shouted pushing him away and he picked up his arm and moved it out of ricks reach cradling it with his good hand and turning his back to rick as if he were guarding a football rick began to suspect that danny had lost all motor control of his arm are you able to move your arm i just did suddenly there was a tearing splitting sound danny started moaning nono his shirt sleeve was finally coming apart as the sleeve split it revealed a horrible sight the skin had become translucent like oiled parchment beneath the skin fat white ovoids rested twitching slightly they had a contented look the wasp laid eggs rick said it was a parasite no danny screamed the eggs had hatched into larvae grubs theyd been feeding on the tissues in his arm danny stared at his arm holding it and moaning the popping sounds in his armthose were the eggs hatchingthe grubs were diggingchewing through his armhe whimpered and began screaming theyll hatch rick tried to calm him well get you medical help were nearly at tantalus im dying they wont kill you theyre parasites they want to keep you alive why so they can keep feeding oh god oh god karen picked him up come on you gotta keep moving they resumed walking but danny was slowing them down he kept stumbling and sitting down he couldnt take his eyes off his arm as if the grubs had hypnotized him halfway across the ground they came to a round tube made of blobs of clay stuck together the tube emerged from the ground like a bent chimney karen said i wish erika was here she might have been able to tell us what made it they had to assume the mud chimney held something dangerous probably some kind of insect they gave the chimney a wide berth ready to dash for cover if anything moved as they passed it the great boulder drew closer she was a mother like a butterfly she drank only the nectar of flowers for her sustenance even so she was a predator she hunted for her babies they lived on meat like all predators she was intelligent capable of learning with an excellent memory in fact she had nine brains they consisted of one master brain and eight minor brains strung out along her spinal cord like beads on a string among insects she was one of the smartest she had mated once with her husband who had dropped dead after having sex with her she was a queen who lived her entire life in isolation she was a solitary wasp she emerged from her chimney and looked at the sun her head came out first followed by her body her wings normally lay folded and flat across her back like a folded fan she unfolded her wings and vibrated them letting her muscles warm up in the sunlight as the wasp climbed out of the chimney the humans froze she was truly enormous with a jointed abdomen splashed with yellow and black stripes the wasp unfolded its wings and beat them thundering and took off into the air its legs dangling beneath it get down lie flat the humans threw themselves to the ground and began crawling toward whatever sort of cover they could find scraps of grass pebbles the wasp didnt notice the humans at first after she launched herself from her chimney however she began flying in a zigzag pattern orienting herself for a hunting flight during the orientation phase she looked down at the ground inspecting every detail she kept a precise map of the terrain fixed in her memory she saw something new three objects occupied the ground at the southeast quadrant away from her chimney the objects were alive they were crawling across the ground they looked like prey she immediately changed her flight path and swooped in the wasp turned and dove down very fast it chose rick hutter and landed on him he rolled over on his back waving his machete while the wasp straddled him with her legs her wings beat over him she caught him lightly in her mandibles rick karen shouted running toward him machete raised he couldnt breathe the mandibles had driven the air out of his chest but somehow they didnt cut through him the wasp was being gentle then she curled her abdomen underneath her and brought her sting forward aimed at rick armor plates at the jointed tip of her abdomen pulled apart and two soft fingers covered with sensory hairs emerged waving and wagging these soft fingers were the sting palps the palps dabbled over hutters neck and face tasting his skin she liked what she tasted the sting happened very fast two stingers inside a sheath emerged from a hole beneath the taste palps as the sheath drilled into rick just under his armpit the stingers lanced into him first one and then the other sliding back and forth in tandem as they worked inward rick felt the needles go into him the pain was extraordinary he gasped karen threw herself at the wasp her machete swinging but she landed too late the wasp went airborne carrying rick gripped in her legs karen saw him kicking his legs but then his body went limp the wasp landed on the chimney then pushed rick inside down the shaft of the chimney butting him forward using her head she went down the chimney after rick her striped abdomen disappeared down the chimney the sting going down last huddled in the sandy area karen and danny debated what to do ricks dead danny minot said how do you know karen king said danny rolled his eyes she wished desperately for erika moll erika might have information about the wasp he could still be alive danny just groaned she racked her brain trying to remember what shed learned about wasps in entomology that was a solitary wasp i think so what lets go please wait that college class shed taken on insectssolitary waspstheyre female of course they build a nest for their young they paralyze their prey i think but they dont kill their prey they feed it to their young she had no clue as to the exact species of wasp she was dealing with or how it really lived come on danny got to his feet and began walking away karen unsheathed her machete what are you doing danny said rick saved my life karen said youre insane she didnt answer she pulled the sharpening stone from her belt and drew it across the blade of her machete that bitch has rick no karen dont karen ignored danny she opened the pack and took out a radio headset and a headlamp she took out another headset and flipped it at danny put that on she stood up and rushed over to the chimney then she spoke on the radio copy me danny he was lying on his stomach in the shade of a small plant youre crazy he shouted at her on the radio she put her ear up to the chimney again it was made of dried clay and it smelled odd insect saliva glue she could feel a slow thrumming sound under her feetthe wasps wings beating underground there was a nest down there the thrumming continued for a while then the sound began to move up to ground level coming closer the wasp was climbing up the chimney out of its nest karen stood in the shadowed side of the chimney trying to blend in the wasps head emerged as karen flattened herself against the chimney two semicircular compound eyes looked at her she felt sure shed been noticed but the wasp didnt react instead it took off airborne the wasp flew back and forth in a z pattern orienting itself and then sailed off straight into the northwest sky aiming for distant hunting grounds of its own choosing when the wasp had dwindled to a point and vanished karen took a step backward and drove her machete into the chimney hacking at it she bashed the chimney to pieces breaking it down keeping an eye toward the northwest fearful the wasp might reappear but the sky remained empty she cleared away chunks of mud and then jumped feetfirst into the tunnel dont leave me danny shouted karen adjusted her headset and beeped him on the radio can you hear me youre going to die karen ill be left with no one call me if you see her ohhh clear over karen said and snapped off she would have to move fast try to find rick and bring him out the wasp could come back at any time the tunnel had round walls lined with hardened clay it trended steeply downward karen descended feetfirst crabwalking on her hands and elbows it was tight in here daylight filtered in through the entrance behind her but the light dimmed as she proceeded deeper underground she switched on her headlamp the tunnel smelled of something pungent but not unpleasant it was probably the mother wasps pheromones she figured the smell came mixed with a rancid stench which grew stronger as she went deeper underground suddenly she came to a falloff the tunnel turned straight downward here plunging into a vertical shaft claustrophobia almost choked her as she looked down it it was a dark hole that seemed to go down into nothingness with no apparent bottom rick is down there just my luck she thought well he saved my life its a debt i have to pay and i dont even like the guy she twisted her body struggling against the tight walls of the tunnel and sat herself at the lip of the shaft letting her feet dangle she lowered herself into the hole and began descending the shaft pressing her hands and knees against its walls to provide a friction grip she definitely did not want to fall if she got wedged in the shaft she might not be able to get out the thought of being trapped in a vertical shaft while a giant wasp descended upon herno dont think about it out in the open air danny minot tore open the pack and searched it for food he had to keep his strength up not that it mattered he was dead anyway he took off his radio headset and placed it next to him and began inspecting his arm it was so horrible the radio was talking at him he picked it up what see anything no no listen danny keep a lookout if you see the wasp tell me so i can get out its in your interest i will i will he fastened the radio on his head and propped himself up in the shade with his back against a rock facing northwest where the wasp had gone karen reached the bottom of the chimney it widened slightly then made a sharp horizontal bend she crawled around this bend and the tunnel opened into a chamber she flashed her headlamp around the chamber many tunnelsabout two dozen of themradiated from the chamber in a starburst pattern each tunnel ran into darkness rick he was in one of those tunnels probably dead she crawled into a tunnel after a short distance it ended at a wall the wall had been built of rubble crammed loosely into place plugging the tunnelgrains of sand and gravel glued with saliva with spaces and gaps between them she shone her headlamp into a gap in the rubble trying to see what lay beyond she realized the gaps in the rubble were breathing holes because something alive was in there past the rubble the rubble door was a kind of stopper or plug with holes in it crunching slurping sounds filtered out through the holes along with a clicking noise a rotting smell wafted from the holes too something hungry lived in a room beyond the rubble something that ate continually rick she called are you there the clicking stopped for a moment then resumed there was no other response she put her eye up to a gap and pointed her light in it fell over a glistening surface the color of antique ivory the surface was creased into segments the segments were moving past the gap one by one this went on for a while like a subway car moving past an opening she could hear breathing but it wasnt human what frightened her was the size of the thing in there it seemed as big as a walrus there were many more tunnels to investigate she crawled back into the main chamber and headed into the next tunnel and tried to see through the blockage of stone and dried mud that clogged it rick she shouted can you hear me danny minots voice came over her headset faint and crackly because she was so far underground whats happening he said i reached a large chamber the chamber breaks into at least twenty tunnels going off in all directions each tunnel leads to a cell theres a larva in each cell i think she whacked at a rubbledoor with her machete and began chopping through mud glue rick she shouted are you in there maybe he can hear me but he cant talk or maybe hes dead maybe i need to get out of here just give this a try she hacked out the wall enlarging the opening until she could get her body through it and she crawled into the cell the cell held a wasp grub larger than she was an obese blob that hissed breathing heavily with a blind eyeless head its mouth was bracketed by twin black cutting fangs the mother wasp had provisioned the cell with food for her infant there were two caterpillars a koa bug and a miserablelooking spider at that moment the wasp grub was feeding on the koa bug an insect with a shiny green carapace the room was strewn with broken pieces of insect armor stripped of flesh there were also three whole heads of insects uneaten and reeking of decay karen edged her way into the cell keeping away from the grubs wickedlooking mouthparts it was busy rooting into the koa bug she listened she heard whispers of air moving through the holes in the exoskeletons of the food items good this meant the food was paralyzed but was still alive so rick could be alive as for the paralyzed spider its abdomen rose and fell as it breathed but otherwise it remained deathly still its eight eyes glazed over the grub shook its head yanking strings of koa bug meat in its mandibles and it sucked the flesh down like spaghetti the koa bug was breathing too karen resisted an impulse to stab the larva she wanted to kill the horrible thing but she pulled back the wasp grub was a part of nature this was no more evil than a lion cub eating meat provided by a lioness wasps were the lions of the insect world they did good things they kept populations of planteating insects in check just the way lions kept an ecosystem healthy even so karen did not like the idea of a wasp eating rick she crawled out of the cell and made her way into the next tunnel she shouted into the breathing hole then cut it open and went into the cell here she found a mature grub polishing off its last caterpillar having eaten everything else rick she shouted the soil deadened her voice he could be anywhere around here above below off to the side hidden inside a cell her headset crackled whats happening danny i cant find rick this place is a maze she broke into another cell it contained a cocoon spun of silk an unborn wasp visible through the silk curled up tight soon to break out of the cocoon as an adult as her light played over the cocoon the wasp shivered she got out of there and jammed rocks back into the door that was the last thing she needed a newborn wasp wandering around in here armed with a stinger no doubt rick its me karen she shouted she held her breath and listened no sound reached her ears except the chewing of the grubs and the beating of her very frightened human heart rick hutter lay inside a cell in total darkness unable to move or speak the sting had paralyzed him but he possessed all his senses he could feel lumps in the dirt floor pressing into his back and legs he could smell rotting insect flesh he could not see the grub that lived in the chamber but he could hear it perfectly it was eating something making crunching sucking noises his breathing went on normally he could blink his eyes when he wanted tohe could do that much by his own will he tried to move one finger and wasnt sure if the finger was moving or not he couldnt tell help somebody help me it was just a thought he realized that the wasp venom had paralyzed only part of his nervous system the sympathetic nerves the nerves that are controlled by conscious will his autonomous nervous system the unconscious part continued to function normally his heart was beating he was breathing fine all systems go but he couldnt will his body to do anything his body was like an engine stuck in idle he couldnt seem to find the controls or press the accelerator something hurt and for a little while he didnt know what it was until a warmth spread underneath him as his bladder emptied automatically he welcomed the relief the venom was a wasps version of refrigeration it kept the prey alive and fresh until it was eaten the crunching and slurping activity continued near his feet the grub seemed to be nearly finished with its meal because he could hear a rattling sound of broken pieces of exoskeleton being shoved around the grub was nosing at the scraps of its meal he could hear crackling noises scraping sounds so the grub had jaws he dreaded the first touch of those jaws he couldnt stop wondering which part of him the grub would eat first would it start by chewing on his face or would it bite off his genitals first or burrow into his abdominal cavity despite the horror of his situation rick hutter felt strangely bored paralyzed in the dark he had nothing to do except imagine his approaching death he decided hed better focus his mind on the things that had made him happy during his life this might be his last chance for memories he recalled wading into the surf at belmar on the jersey shore where his family had spent a week at a motel each summerwhat they could afford his father had driven a delivery truck for a convenience store chain he remembered standing on the drivers seat of his fathers truck when he was five years old and telling everybody he was going to be a truck driver just like his dad he saw himself opening the acceptance letter from stanford and reading it with complete disbeliefa full scholarship at stanford then graduate school at harvard again on financial support he saw himself in costa rica interviewing an old lady a curandera as she brewed a healing tea from the leaves of the himatanthus tree his mind turned to the lab one night he had been trying to extract a compound from the himatanthus leaves karen king had been working late tending an experiment with her spiders they had been alone in the room together they had worked side by side at the lab bench right next to each other without saying a word the air thick with mutual dislike but their hands had brushed by accidentmaybe i should have tried to hook up with karen that nightof course she probably would have punched me a dying man thinks mostly about missed sexual opportunities who said that anyway it might really be true he began to feel sleepydrifting off rick her voice woke him up it came faintly through the earth im here karen he shouted in his mind but he couldnt make his mouth move rick where are you hurry up theres a hoover with jaws in here with me karens light flickered briefly the first light hed seen in a long timeand was gone total darkness swallowed him again she had moved on come back he shouted in his mind you missed me silence she had gone away then in the darkness the horror of horrors arrived something moist and very heavy slid over his ankle pressing his foot into the ground its not happening next he felt the segments of the larva bumping over his leg bump bump bump no the segments were sliding over his stomach now then sliding over his chest squeezing the breath out of him no please no the wasp grub lay on top of him now its weight pressing down on him suffocating him he could feel the grubs heart beating thumping against his chest he heard a moist clicketyclick those jaws were starting to work clickclick snipsnap snick the light returned a ray shot into the cell it revealed the black cutter knives flicking around a queerly soft mouth like a pale anus right in front of his face karen was shining her headlamp into the cell she saw the scene oh my god rick she began hacking at the rubble in the doorway flinging stones aside the teeth brushed against his forehead the grub was nosing around looking for a soft spot to begin chewing it tapped its teeth over his shoulder leaving a streak of drool he felt the teeth prick his nose and the moist mouth brushed across his lips like a kiss spewing out drool it made him cough and choke automatically hang on hurry this bastard wants to give me a hickie she got through the opening and threw herself at the grub kicking the grub with both feet pushing it away from ricks face you leave him alone she shouted and thrust her machete into the grub the grub gasped a hiss coming out of its airholes karen pulled out the blade and raised the machete and swung it beheading the grub in one blow the bloblike head slopped away while the decapitated body went into a spasm and began whipping back and forth in reversing c s karen continued to stab and slash at the beheaded grub but that only seemed to intensify its thrashing she got her arms around rick and dragged him out of the chamber leaving the headless grub thumping the walls a strange odor chased them thats bad hutter said silently thats an alarm pheromone king realized it too the dying larva was screaming for help wailing for its mother in the language of scent the scent was filling the nest if the mother detected it dannys voice came on whats going on i have rick hes alive stand by im bringing him out rick was like a sack of potatoes a dead load but her strength was incredible she had got rick and she would fight to the death before shed give him up now dragging him she crawled through the big chamber heading for the vertical shaft just then dannys voice came on her headset shes back chapter tantalus crater october pm the solitary wasp flew in slowly a paralyzed caterpillar dangling between her legs she began to fly back and forth in zigzags over her nest then settled lower searching for the mud chimney of her burrow within moments she had registered that her chimney had been smashed her nest had been damaged and invaded there was an intruder danny minot wrapped himself around the rock hiding under the plant trying to make himself as rocklike or plantlike as possible you idiot he whispered to karen hed been left alone in the microworld the mother landed carrying the caterpillar vibrating her wings she advanced to the entrance at that moment she caught the scent of her babys death leaking out of the hole she began beating her wings furiously the air filled with the thunder of her wings she dropped the caterpillar then charged into the hole headfirst karen king heard a rumbling sound in the earth abovea buzz of wasp wings a clatter and clash of a wasps exoskeleton danny she called whats happening there was no answer talk to me danny the mother surged down into her nest a toxic armored bundle of maternal rage karen listened to the wasp coming she crouched in the chamber at the foot of the vertical shaft with rick lying on the floor behind her the sounds were frighteningand informative a sharp smell wafted into the rooman advance wave of the mothers fury karen got out her diamond sharpener and began to frantically hone her machete zing swish zing hang on rick she muttered she worked the sharpener over the steel bringing the blade to an extreme edge it would have to slice through massive bioplastic armor then she poised herself by the opening with the blade raised over her head come on come on she muttered the mother reached the bottom of the shaft there was a pause and then the wasps head huge blackandyellow appeared in the opening upside down she swung the machete at the wasps face with every ounce of her strength the blade bounced off the wasps eye leaving a mark the lady had armored eyes the wasp thrust her headstill upside downinto the room snapped her jaws around the machete and tore the blade out of karens hands dragging it back into the hole karen heard crunching metallic sounds the wasp was cutting up her last weapon the room shook the wasp was pounding her wings against the tunnel walls getting ready to charge she heard the wasp gasping she glanced over her shoulder and her headlamp beam passed over rick he looked dead in swinging her head around she became aware of the little knife dangling from her neck shed sworn never to carry it in her pocket again my knife she thumbed the blade open and yanked the cord off her neck the wasps head was in the room nowstill upside downand the jaws snapped at her karen dove down to the floor and slid her body underneath the wasps upsidedown head the head was covered with bristles she gripped the bristles the head jerked up and down battering her against the floor the wasp could see her a trio of little eyes stared at her from the top of the head karen clung to the head as it rotated and beat her against the tunnel the jaws crossing and snapping she was getting a terrible thrashing even so in searching for a grip she reached behind the wasps head and managed to get her fingertips wedged in the occipital suture the crack between the head capsule and the pleuron the first armored plate of the thorax this was the back of the wasps neck there was a joint in the armor at that spot her fingertips felt soft tissue in the crack the neck was so narrow that she was able to wrap her fingers entirely around the wasps neck she had gotten a stranglehold maybe she could choke the wasp at that moment the wasp jerked backward into the tunnel dragging karen along now she was jammed in the tunnel being crushed by the wasps head which continued to hammer against her body the wasp curled its body and karen realized it was trying to bring its abdomen forward and sting her the wasp pushed her back into the room again and began twisting trying to throw her off its neck but she held her grip having located the neck joint she let go of the neck with one hand grabbed her knife then slipped the tip of her knife into the crack then she quickly ran the knife blade around the neck following the crack and sawing as she went all the way around the wasps head fell off it rolled on top of her and she scrambled back into the room followed by a spurt of blood the mandibles snapped twice and froze the body exsanguinated fast blood spewing out of the severed neck all over karen the wings of the headless body thumped against the walls in the tunnel the wingbeats weakening and slowing down until the corpse quieted and lay still karen pulled herself away and knelt by rick and took his hand she was shaking badly i did it out of the corner of his eye rick saw movement behind her he blinked his eyes and shouted in his mind look out the master brain inside the severed head had lost contact with the eight minor brains in the wasps body but those minor brains were still sending out messages to the rest of the body the wasps legs went into action dragging the headless body into the room the abdomen curled and thrust forward and the stinger came out a noise at her back made karen whirl around just in time she saw the stinger coming and jumped aside as the abdomen slammed her into the wall she struggled trapped as the sting waved past her face she saw the twin blades working against each other inches from her eyes the sting palps popped out and tapped her cheek and entered her mouth but finally the stinger went still lightly resting on karens collarbone the blades bared a dewdrop of poison swelled from the blades and hung there she could see her face reflected in the droplet of wasp venom she delicately extricated herself from under the sting avoiding contact with the liquid and blades then she got down on her knees and wiped the dirt from ricks face howre you doing soldier he seemed completely paralyzed ricks face looked like a mask eyes moving blinking but no expression the muscles in his face had gone awol and he had peed his pants at least he was breathing and his heart was beating the wasp venom was tricky stuff she realized it had disabled some of his nervous system but not all of it was he trying to talk she couldnt be sure can you blink she asked if you blink your eyes it means yes if you dont blink it means no can you understand me he blinked once yes then something trembled in his face rick is that a smile yes trying to thats a start does anything hurt yes what hurtsnever mind im going to carry you will that hurt he didnt blink no she lifted rick under the arms and dragged him around the dead wasp keeping their bodies away from the big droplet of venom that still hung from the wasps stinger as she dragged rick though she could see how dire his condition was he would never survive unless he could move his muscles his nervous system needed help that fucking venomthe droplet of poison gleamed in her headlamp suspended from the stingerthat venom had acted like a smart bomb taking out only parts of his nervous system horrible poison but sophisticated too nature could do magic with chemistry that no human drug could accomplish rick needed help or he would die staring at that clear drop of poison karen got an idea the venom that had paralyzed rick might also help save him she needed to collect it she groped at her waist and found a water bottle suspended on a cord from her machete belt she poured out the water then held the open mouth of the bottle to the venom droplet and watched as the liquid dripped into the bottle she screwed on the top okay ive got a plan rick its crazy but it might work he just stared at her jamming her knees against the walls of the shaft karen pushed him up the shaft ahead of her as she climbed she felt like superwoman she never could have done this in the big world it was a long climb accomplished in stages with rests in between and she was glad she was as strong as an ant finally she arrived at the mouth of the nest danny minot had given up hope he couldnt believe his eyes when rick hutter popped out of the hole followed by a batteredlooking karen king i got him she said fiercely and hoisted him across her shoulders she carried him across the sand and dropped him in the shade of the plant beside danny she knelt by rick and studied him danny huddled nearby crouching to keep out of the wind can you stand up she asked rick he blinked once yes you want to try she helped him stand up he swayed tottering and dropped to his knees then sank and fell over she showed him the canteen of wasp venom this might save you rick no guarantees what we need to do now she looked at the line of towering bamboo across the open groundis get ourselves back into the forest she was thinking of the death of that sniper how the man had gone into a grand mal seizure from the spider venom the mans death carried information that might save rick chapter tantalus base october pm the wind blew across the ridgeline of tantalus crater karen king and danny minot walked along slowly carrying rick in a stretcher made from a space blanket karen wore the backpack and the blowgun was slung across her back they moved step by step making their way painstakingly toward the wall of bamboo trees and the great boulder ricks breathing came hoarsely from the stretcher put him down karen said to danny she examined rick his face was pale and drawn and his lips were turning blue he wasnt getting enough oxygen what especially worried her was his breathing ragged irregular insufficient the wasp venom might have affected the breathing center in his brain stem if his breathing shut down he was finished she opened his shirt and found a bruise on his chest what was that the bends coming on or just the result of being thrown around by the wasp they had to get out of this open area they were morsels for birds food for another wasp how are you doing rick he moved his head slowly from side to side not so good just dont fall asleep okay please karen studied the bamboo forest ahead we just need to get under those plants rick its not far now she hoped prayed shed find what she needed there in the leaves she heard a sigh how are you doing rick silence rick had lost consciousness she shook him rick wake up its me karen his eyes opened and closed he was becoming unresponsive all right maybe she could make him angry she had always been good at that she slapped him in the face hey rick his eyes flew open that had worked i nearly got myself killed dragging your sorry ass out of that hellhole dont you dare die on me now we might have to leave him danny said softly she turned on danny in fury do not say that again finally they got beneath the plants and put rick down in the cool shade karen gave him a droplet of water to drink holding the water in her cupped hands and pouring it into his mouth she looked up at the leaves she wasnt sure of the species of plant that didnt matter what mattered was whether any spiders lived on the leaves there was a particular spider she wanted to find she knelt by rick and talked to him rick she said you need a swift kick in the pants he smiled faintly what are you going to do danny asked her she didnt answer she rooted around in the pack and removed a clean empty plastic lab bottle then she started pacing around looking up into the leaves she grabbed the blowgun and the dart kit and she ran into the deeper parts of the vegetation where are you going danny shouted you watch him danny if you let anything happen to rick ill karen she ran off she had spotted a flash of color under a leaf dayglo green red yellow it might be what she was looking for it was she wanted to find a spider that wasnt very poisonous all spiders used venom to kill their prey generally insects but spider venom varied a lot in its toxicity to humans and mammals generally blackwidow venom was among the worst the bite of a black widow spider could make a horse drop dead yet other spiders seemed less toxic to humans she stood under the spider now looking up at it it was small with legs as transparent as glass and a body splashed with colorful markings the markings formed a pattern that looked like a human face grinning with laughterit looked like the face of a smiling clown it was a happyface spider theridion grallator one of the most common spiders in hawaii much studied by scientists known to have essentially no effect when it bites a human the happyface spider rested in a little cobweb a tangle of threads strung randomly under the leaf these spiders were very shy they tended to flee at the first sign of trouble dont run away on me she whispered she began to climb the stem of the plant she shinnied up it a distance and then getting herself seated on a leaf she took out a dart from the kit and opened her canteen the wasp venom had filled it almost to the neck she dipped a dart in the venom loaded the gun and took aim the spider backed away staring at her it appeared to be frightened yes it was scared it scrunched itself down inside its little web she knew the spider could hear her and was forming a sonic image of her with the ears in its legs it had probably never encountered a human and had no idea what karen was she blew the dart lodged in the patterned back of the spider the spider backed up its legs flipping around and it tried to run but the venom acted swiftly and within moments the spider stopped moving karen heard air whistling faintly in and out of the spiders lungs and she saw its back rising and falling good it was still breathing and its heart was beating that was important the animal needed to have blood pressure in order to pump out venom she climbed up to the web she took a strand and shook it yah the spider didnt move karen swung herself into the web and crawled across the threads right up to the spider reached out to one of the legs and flicked at a sensory hair nothing happened lying on the web she unscrewed the top of the empty lab jar and positioned it under the fangs using two fingers she lifted a fang from its base unfolding the fang from its sheath as she stared into the spiders eyes how to get the venom flowing the venom glands were located in the spiders forehead behind its eyes she made a fist and rapped on the spiders forehead the spider stirred and a few drops of liquid dribbled out of the fangs she screwed the cap on she hoped the spider would wake up no worse for its experience she cut the web below her and fell to the ground she bent over rick this spider venom she held up the jar so that he could see itmight give your nerves a jolt it has excitotoxins in it you understand he looked at her blinked once yes i understand excitotoxins theyll make your nerves fire but theres a real danger i dont know anything about this venom i cant control the dose this stuff could kill cells in your body it could start digesting you in her minds eye she saw the snipers body going through that digestive meltdown she took his hand in hers and squeezed it im afraid rick he squeezed her hand back she said you want it he blinked yes she removed a blow dart from the case a clean one no curare on it she dipped the tip of the dart into the spider venom the tip came up wet barely covered with a minuscule amount of the liquid she held it in front of him where he could see it are you sure yes she laid the point across his forearm she caught the point in his skin over a vein and pushed it in not too deep then she gripped his hand and leaned over him rick for a few moments nothing happened she was beginning to wonder if she had given him enoughbut then he gasped his breathing sped up she touched his neck and felt his pulse racing the venom was hitting him hard there was an explosive sound rick gasped and dragged air into his lungs then he went into a seizure his gaze flew around wildly and he strained upward against her eyes staring body trembling she lay across him holding his arms down but afraid to press on him too hard he gasped taking huge lungfuls hyperventilating as his spine arched she threw her weight on him trying to pin him down fearful that he would hurt himself he groaned and then his hand whipped out and fastened around her neck he gripped her throat his fingers squeezing closing her throat off he was trying to strangle her he hated her that much but then his fingers relaxed his grip softened he released her throat he ran his hand over her shoulder the touch became a caress his hand worked up the side of her neck and under her ear passed lightly over her skin and his fingers opened and ran through her hair now she was kissing him and the great thing was that he was kissing her back she broke off finally does it hurt rick hurtslikehell he croaked icouldget to like it she helped him sit up he was dizzy and almost toppled over but she held him keeping her arms around him talking softly to him telling him everything would be all right you saved my life rick you saved my life danny sat there watching rick and karen make up to each other feeling extremely uncomfortable in his opinion this kind of stuff did not advance the effort to get back to nanigen he needed a doctor as soon as possible he glanced down at his arm and almost threw up the grubs seemed fatter than ever in a little while rick was able to stand they began to walk they went into the bamboo forest where stalks of bamboo soared like redwoods they made their way through it and broke out onto a stunning view they were facing the great boulder on the lip of tantalus crater and looking down into the crater the crater extended beneath them a basin stuffed with rain forest rimmed by bare ground and patches of stunted windwracked trees all around the crater peaks of the koolau pali fingered into boiling clouds and the wind pummeled the scene at the foot of the great boulder lay tantalus base the base would have been virtually unnoticeable to a person of normal size there was an aircraft runway about three feet long at least karen felt pretty sure it was a runway she could see a dashed line and taxi markings beside the runway stood a cluster of miniature buildings made of concrete the largest building seemed to be an aircraft hangar the other buildings were smaller and looked like bomb shelters the buildings were embedded partway in the soil and were lightly covered with dead leaves and plant debris so they blended into the microterrain karen stopped wow rick she said we made it he turned his head and smiled and looked at her she rubbed his hands his arms to get the circulation going your hands feel warmer youre getting better i think they didnt want to draw attention to themselves because they didnt know what to expect from the inhabitants of the base nanigen employees who might well be following orders from vin drake they decided to watch the base for a time looking for activity they lay down under a mamaki plant the great boulder loomed above like a mountain there was no activity on the runway the place seemed deserted the runway was strewn with stones dried mud plant debris a cone of dirt had risen next to it an ant nest an ant trail extended across the runway and headed downslope toward the bottom of the crater it doesnt look good danny minot whispered karens heart fell if no microhumans lived here then there wouldnt be any shuttle to nanigen and no chance of help this place hadnt been tended to it had been overrun by ants but there might be airplanes they walked slowly down the hillside and went into the hangar there were tiedowns for aircraft but no planes while rick sat and rested with danny karen explored the base she found a room that she guessed had once held mechanical parts and supplies but it had been emptied out leaving bent metal pins and bolts protruding from the walls and floor she went into another room empty the next room contained living quarters it had been flooded by rain and was halffilled with mud there was no sign of human life anywhere tantalus base had been abandoned there was no sign of a road to honolulu either no shuttle truck no airplanes only the trade wind endlessly worrying the ground and whistling through the empty halls of tantalus they emerged from the complex and sat by the runway looking down into the crater they could see the city too through the gap in the craters wall and beyond the city the pacific ocean ran off into blue nanigen was miles away from this crater and there was no way home danny minot lay in the rubble holding his arm he began to cry his sobs echoed off the hangar and drifted into a sky shot with gray rolling clouds and wind karen watched an ant hurry across the runway carrying a seed she turned her gaze up to the great boulder and then past it to the horizon line and the clouds something moved against the sky near the boulder and she suddenly realized it was the figure of a man chapter tantalus base october pm how long the man had been standing there karen couldnt saypossibly he had been watching them the entire time theyd explored the base she saw his hair flash in the breeze long white he wore armor of some kind but she couldnt tell what it was made of his eyes looked hard and cold even at that distance he lifted up an object and she saw it was a gas rifle down karen shouted grabbing rick he fired there was a hiss and glint of steel ripped past them and buried itself in the ground somewhere beyond and exploded with a thump karen began crawling dragging rick behind her but there was nowhere to hide another sniperdrake had found them the mans voice came to them over the wind that was a warning stand up and show me your hands if you have weapons drop them in front of you they obeyed him karen held up the blowgun so he could see it and dropped it on the ground she placed the container of darts next to it put your hands on your head karen obeyed and called out we have two injured we need help he didnt answer he moved toward them keeping the gun raised as he got closer they saw that he was an older man with a weatherbeaten face bronzed by the sun and deepset blue eyes he clearly had muscles and he looked physically powerful how old was he he could have been anywhere from fifty to eighty it seemed his armor had been carved from the hard parts of a beetle a scar ran across his forehead and wandered down his neck and ran under the breastplate of his armor he studied them searching their faces the mans eyes darted away flicking around karen realized he was keeping alert for predators he gestured at them with the gun your names karen gave their names and added who are you he ignored that my arm danny began and fell silent as the man pointed the gun at his face karen added we need medical treatment the man just stared he poked at the blowgun with his foot interesting he said he picked it up then examined a dart and sniffed it poisoned he said she nodded where are your guns we lost our only gun a bird attack vin drake sent you he interrupted why karen began to explain no drake tried to kill us the man cut her off this is one of drakes tricks karen said youll have to take our word where did you come from the arboretum and you made it up here thats impossible karen walked up to him and pushed his gun aside give me back my weapon the mans eyes widened maybe in surprise maybe in anger after a pause he pointed his gun at the ground and broke open the firing chamber a smile creased his face exposing white teeth somehow he said you impress me he handed her back the blowgun welcome to tantalus my name is ben rourke im the inventor of the tensor generator karen eyed him how did you end up here castaway by chance a hermit by choice he replied ben rourke lived in a warren of caves near the great boulder about six feet above tantalus base he led them upslope toward the great boulder and he helped rick along the cave entrance was a hole in the soil at the foot of the boulder with a tunnel that ran horizontally inward like the entrance to a mine they advanced through the tunnel while the light grew dim after some distance they arrived at a door carved from wood it was shut and latched with an iron hook rourke opened the door and they went through it into a pitchblack tunnel he threw a switch and a line of led lights came on in the ceiling of the tunnel trending inward welcome to rourkes redoubt he said as i call my little place he closed the door behind them and slammed home an iron pin its to keep out centipedes he walked ahead with a lanky tough stride the tunnel went around a bend and sloped downward plunging deeper into the mountain it turned left and right and they passed side tunnels going off into darkness this is an empty rat warren rourke explained drakes people deemed the rats a threat to the humans at tantalus base so they poisoned the rats and closed off the nest i reopened the tunnels and moved in at intervals on the ceiling led lights cast a blue glow where does the power come from karen asked him solar panel up in a tree the wire runs down here to a battery pack it took me three weeks to drag the damn batteries over from tantalus base even with the help of a hexapod walker vin drake has no idea what treasures his people left behind when they abandoned tantalus he thinks im dead whats your relationship with drake karen asked him hatred what happened all in good time ben rourke was a mysterious character how had he ended up here how had he avoided death from the bends rick tested his limbs rubbed his arms he was covered with bruises he could see them in the light at least he could move he wondered how much time he karen and danny had before the bends started to affect them make them sick how long had they been in the microworld it seemed like ages but actually it had been only three days he reminded himself the symptoms start on day three or day four they arrived at another heavy wooden door the doors functioned like the bulkhead doors in a ship sealing off parts of the warren from other parts rourke barred the door behind them explaining that you couldnt be too careful with some of the predators that lived around here he threw a switch and the lights came on revealing a hall with a high ceiling stocked with furniture shelves of books laboratory equipment and supplies of all kinds it was a living area home sweet home he said he began taking off his armor hanging it in a storage space side passages went off into additional rooms and they could see electronic equipment in one room there was a desk with a computer sitting on it several chairs made of twigs and woven grass a circular fireplace hearth occupied the center of the hall a rack near the fireplace held strips of smoked insect meat rourke had also laid in supplies of dried fruit edible seeds and chunks of dry taro root rourkes bed was the shell of a candlenut packed with soft shredded bark a tall pile of cutup candlenuts sat heaped against one wall ben rourke carried several of the oily pieces of nutmeat to the fireplace and he lit the fire using a gas torch the fire caught throwing light and warmth through the room and the smoke went up through a hole in the ceiling ben rourke seemed to be a jack of all trades clearly a brilliant man who knew a lot about many things he seemed happy in his fortress he seemed to have found a life he enjoyed they wondered about his story how had he ended up here why did he hate vin drake what had drake done to him karen and rick both glanced at their hands and arms and noticed the bruises there it would be a good idea to persuade rourke they needed to leave for nanigen soon or to learn from him how he had beaten the bends the first order of business however was for rourke to examine rick and danny and tend to their medical needs rourke started with rick he rubbed ricks limbs stared into his eyes and asked questions he got out a small chest and opened it it was a medical chest rather like the kind that sea captains took with them on long voyages the chest contained a number of items including forceps scissors sterile compresses a very long scalpel a bone saw a bottle of iodine and a bottle of jack daniels rourke examined the puncture wound under ricks arm where the wasps stinger had gone in he doused the wound with iodine which made rick jump and he said it would heal he added you guys need a bath weve been in the microworld for three days karen said three days rourke said thoughtfully actually youve been here longer than that i suppose youve noticed the time compression what do you mean rick asked time moves faster for us here your bodies are running faster your hearts are beating like a hummingbirds we had to sleep during the day karen remarked of course you did and your time is running out the bends are already affecting you i can see it the crash will come soon the bruising the pain in the joints the nosebleed the end karen asked rourke how did you avoid the bends i didnt i damn near died from them but i found a way to make it through maybe some people can survive them what did you do rick asked right now we have to deal with this fellows arm he turned his attention to danny danny had seated himself in a chair near the fire the chair was made of wicker woven from fern hairs and tiny twigs yet it was massive and quite comfortable he stretched out in it cradling his arm the sleeve had torn off completely and the larvae under the skin made the arm bulge in lumps ben rourke studied dannys arm poking it gently it was likely a parasitic wasp that egged you she mistook your arm for a caterpillar am i going to die of course danny opened his mouth with a frightened look but rourke added when is the only question if you dont want to die right now that arm has to come off he drew out the long scalpel and handed danny the bottle of jack daniels anesthetic start drinking while i boil the tools no if you dont get that arm off those grubs could migrate to where your brain rourke held up the bone saw and touched its teeth danny leaped out of the chair and stepped backward holding the bottle in front of him like a club stay away from me dont spill that whiskey i dont have much left youre not a doctor he took a glug from the bottle i want a real doctor he wiped his mouth and coughed youre not going anywhere right now mr minot rourke said replacing his instruments in the chest night is coming at night the wise stay underground chapter rourkes redoubt october pm ben rourke loaded more chunks of candlenuts on the fire and swung a metal cauldron over it the cauldron was suspended on a hook and a hinged iron bar rooted in the floorpieces of metal hed scavenged from tantalus base the water a few teaspoons worth came to a boil almost instantly rourke dropped a smaller bucket into the cauldron and carried a portion of the hot water over to a wooden tub which sat in a niche in the wall it was a bathtub in a private space he added some cold water to the hot water taking it from a gravityfed water tank rick soaked in the water the venom was still in his system making him feel stiff his limbs unresponsive and he felt a little dizzy too there was a lump of soap crude and soft it was medieval soap rourke had likely made it from ashes and the fat of some insect it felt great to wash his body after crawling around for three days in the muck but he couldnt help noticing the dark shadows that had spread over his arms and on his lower legs he tried to tell himself these were bruises hed gotten from his encounter with the wasp he felt strange but it had to be the venom danny refused a bath afraid that the water might somehow stimulate the grubs he sat in the chair drinking from rourkes bottle of whiskey and staring at the fire karen luxuriated next in the tub of hot water it felt so incredible to get clean she washed her clothes and hung them to dry then wrapped herself in a robe that rourke loaned her and sat by the fire feeling refreshed rick wore a pair of rourkes pants and a work shirt the clothes were roughhewn but they were comfortable and clean rourke meanwhile cooked dinner for his guests he got a pot of water boiling and added smoked insect meat shreds of root vegetable some chunks of leafy greens and salt the stew cooked rapidly filling the hall with a savory smell rourkes insectandvegetable stew really was delicious and it brought their strength back fast they sat in rourkes strange chairs near the fire and they heard his story ben rourke had been a physicist and systems design engineer specializing in the most powerful magnetic fields he had come across the data from the old army experiments in huntsville and had decided to explore the method of shrinking matter in a tensor field he had solved some of the seemingly impossible equations of turbulence in these fields vin drake had learned of rourkes work and had hired him as one of the founding engineers at nanigen working with other nanigen engineers he had built the tensor generator out of modified but standard industrial equipment purchased largely in asia drake had raised huge amounts of capital from the davros consortium drake had a magic touch a way of making it all seem exciting and sure to lead to enormous wealth ben rourke had volunteered himself as the first human to be passed through the tensor generator he had suspected it would be dangerous and felt that he should be the first to take the risk living organisms were complicated and fragile animals that had been shrunk in the generator had frequently died usually by exsanguinationby bleeding to death drake discounted the risk rourke said he claimed there would be no problem rourke had only stayed in a shrunken size for a few hours before he was returned to normal size as more people were shrunk in the generator and as they remained small for longer periods of time they began feeling ill bruising easily experiencing mysterious bleeding they were quickly returned to normal size and examined the studies showed unexplained degradation of the bloods ability to form clots meanwhile nanigen swimming in investor money raced ahead with exploration of the microworld the company decided to concentrate on exploring tantalus crater first the crater had extremely high biodiversity and offered riches of chemistry and biological compounds tantalus base was constructed in modules we built each module as a scale model at a ratio and the modules were then shrunk in the generator to make them the right size for microhumans stocked with supplies and equipment the modules were placed at tantalus crater at first the field teams were allowed to stay at tantalus base for no longer than thirtysix hours after which they were returned to nanigen and restored to normal size then nanigen installed the supply stations in the waipaka arboretum down in the valley and began staffing them with people it was difficult to operate the digging robots and to collect samples when the teams had to be rotated in and out so quickly vin drake wanted to keep people longer in the microworld despite the risks drake asked rourke if he would agree to a longer stay at tantalus as a testto see if the human body could adjust to the microworld over time i had faith in vin and i had faith in my invention rourke said nanigen patented my design with money for me if it succeeded so i was willing to accept the risks of a longer stay in order to move nanigen forward ben rourke had offered to lead a team of volunteers who would attempt a oneweek stay at tantalus since i had designed the tensor generator i thought i should be the first person to try a longer stay take the risk myself rourke was joined by two other nanigen volunteers an engineer named fabrio farzetti and a medical doctor named amanda cowells who would monitor the other two for medical changes and so they had been shrunk in the generator and placed at tantalus base things went well at first rourke said we did experiments we tested the equipment at the base we stayed in regular contact with nanigen through a special communication systema video link with an audio frequency shifter so that we could talk with big people he indicated a wooden door in the living room the door stood open and beyond it they could see electronic equipment and a video screen thats the video link i moved it here from tantalus base maybe someday drake wont be in charge of nanigen and then i can call home but as long as vin drake is running things i dont use the system drake thinks im dead it would be a fatal mistake to let drake know i exist after a few days at the base all three volunteers began to develop symptoms of microbends we developed bruises on our arms and legs then farzetti got really sick dr cowells found he had developed internal hemorrhages so she asked for an evacuation of farzetti fabrio farzetti needed to be hospitalized immediately or he would die that was when drake told us it wasnt possible to evacuate farzetti he said the generator had broken down rourke said he claimed he was trying to get the generator fixed ben rourke knew more about the tensor generator than anyone else he began directing repair efforts from the microworld using the video link while teams of engineers at the nanigen headquarters followed his instructions but somehow the machine couldnt be fixed it kept breaking down and then farzetti died despite dr amanda cowellss best efforts to save him i think drake had sabotaged the generator ben rourke said why karen asked we were guinea pigs rourke said drake wanted to have medical data on us all the way up to the point of death next dr cowells herself had fallen ill ben rourke had cared for her all the while begging for help on the video link i finally realized we were never going to get help vin drake was determined to see his vile experiment through to the endthe death of all of us he wanted to gain knowledge of the bends but it was like a nazi survival experiment i tried to tell other nanigen staff on the video link but nobody would believe me i also think drake enjoyed watching us diethe man takes pleasure in watching people suffer its as if when people are shrunk to micro size drake forgets theyre still human nobody could believe that drake would do this people like vincent drake operate outside the bounds of normal morality their evil can become invisible to normal people because normal people cant believe anyone would commit such evil a psychopath can go on for years without being recognized as long as hes a good actor rourke said karen king asked rourke if he thought drake was working alone does he have accomplices she asked there are people at nanigen who suspect the truth about drake rourke said the project omicron people must know something whats that project omicron its the dark part of nanigen the dark part nanigen does classified research for the us government thats project omicron what does omicron do omicron deals with weapons somehow rourke said but thats all i know so how do you know about it employee gossip its unavoidable he smiled and stroked his chin and got up and went over to the pile of candlenuts he took a big piece and carried it over to the fire the fire flared up for a hermit the man seemed kind of lonely karen thought she stared at the fire and found herself thinking about her life back east she had been living like a hermit herself in a cramped seedy apartment in somerville spending long hours in the lab allnighters had become a regular thing she didnt have any close friends didnt go out on dates didnt even go to the movies by herself she had sacrificed a normal life in order to get a phd and become a scientist it had been more than a year since shed slept with a man men seemed afraid of her with her spiders her temper her drive in the lab she knew she had a hot temper maybe it was just the way she was maybe she would be happier alone the way ben rourke liked being a hermit right now her life in cambridge seemed in another universe almost what if i wanted to stay in the microworld ben do you think i could survive there was a long silence rick hutter stared at her rourke got up and threw another piece on the fire and said why would you want to stay here ms king karen gazed into the fire its dangerous herebut itsso beautiful ive seenthings i never dreamed of rourke got up and helped himself to more stew and went back to his chair and blew on the stew to cool it after a while he said there is a zen saying that a wise man can live comfortably in hell it isnt so bad here actually you just need to learn some extra skills karen was watching the smoke go up through the hole in the ceiling she wondered where it went she realized that rourke must have dug the chimney himself what a lot of work just to have a fire what would it be like trying to survive in the microworld ben had done it could she rick turned to karen just a reminder our time is running out rick was right ben karen said we need to get back to nanigen he leaned back looking at them through narrowed eyes ive been wondering if i can trust you you can ben i hope so come along and well see about getting you home do you have any iron on your bodies he made karen leave her knife behind the living room had an alcove at the end of a short tunnel closed off by a door rourke flung open the door behind it a huge disc of gray shiny metal lay flat on the floor with a hole in the center like a doughnut its a neodymium magnet two thousand gauss he explained superstrong field after farzetti and cowell died i got sick but i had a hypothesis that a strong magnetic field could stabilize the dimensional fluctuations that cause certain enzymatic reactions in the body to go wrong like blood clotting so i put myself inside this magnetic field and stayed there for two weeks i was sick as hell nearly died but i came out of it all right now i think im immune to microbends so if we stayed inside this magnet we might survive rick asked might rourke emphasized id rather get into the generator rick said of course thats why im going to show you the secret of tantalus rourke said he led them out of the magnet room down a long tunnel through a bend and up a sloping tunnel they followed him wondering where he was taking them ben rourke seemed to enjoy mysterious revelations they entered a wide long chamber sunk in shadow and filled with unidentifiable shapes drake threw a switch and a line of leds blinked on parked on the floor stood three airplanes the room was an underground hangar wide hangar doors remained closed over the mouth of the cave oh my gosh karen said the airplanes sported an open cockpit stubby sweptback wings twin tails and a propeller at the rear of the aircraft they stood on retractable wheels they were broken so drakes people just left them here i fixed them up added scavenged parts ive flown all over these mountains with them he slapped the cockpit of one of the planes equipped em with weapons too where i dont see any machine guns rick said inspecting the wings rourke reached into the cockpit and pulled out a machete kind of medieval but its the best i could do he stuffed the machete back into the cockpit could we fly them to nanigen karen asked its a very long shot he explained that the top speed of a microplane was seven miles an hour the trade winds average fifteen miles an hour across oahu if you try to fly into the wind youll go backward if you get the wind at your back you might get across pearl harbor or maybe not it also depends on whether i decide to let you have my planes these are soloseaters they carry only one person theres three of you and theres three planes that doesnt leave an airplane for me now does it dr rourke i would pay you a very large sum of money for one of your planes danny said i inherited a trust fund it would be yours i have no need for money mr minot well what would work for you to see you bring down vincent drake if you can do that you can have my planes absolutely well get mr drake danny said karen remained silent rick glanced at her what was going on with her then he asked rourke how rourke would survive if he didnt have a plane ill build another one rourke said shrugging off the question i collected a lot of spare parts then rourke took charge he had them sit in the cockpits and he explained the controls its very simple everythings computercontrolled this is the stick if you make a mistake the computer corrects your action theres a radioheres the headset they could talk to each other once they had gotten aloft but there was no radar or navigation instrumentation how would they find nanigen kalikimaki industrial park should be obvious from the airits a group of warehouses on the farrington highway he gave them a course heading okay rick said so we manage to get into nanigen then what there will be security bots guarding the tensor core security bots flying microbots however i dont think youll have a problem youre too small to register on the bots sensors they wont see you you can fly past the bots without waking them up theres a way to operate the generator from the micro side if youre very small i designed the control myself the control is located in the floor of the room underneath a hatch the hatch is in the center of hexagon three its marked with a white circle you should see the white circle from the air is the control complicated no just throw open the hatch and hit the red emergency button youll get supersized he stopped talking and was staring at rick at his arm rick had been leaning against a plane his sleeve rolled up rourke stared at the bruises lengthening up ricks arm youre starting to crash he said crash rick thought he meant the plane once the bleeding starts youre finished lets get you into the magnet rourke said to him sharply youre hours from a crash karen looked at her arms they werent in such great shape either it was going to be a race against time wait for dawn and hope nobodys started bleeding by then ben rourke advised them to sleep inside the magnet he couldnt guarantee anything but the magnetic field might delay the onset of symptoms the magnet room had a fireplace in it too and rourke hauled in pieces of candlenut and started a fire karen and rick climbed into the hole in the doughnut of the magnet wrapped in blankets and tried to settle down for the night neither of them felt terribly relaxed yet they were so incredibly tired time ran more swiftly in the microworld and a days rest could not come too soon danny minot refused to sleep in the magnet he said he would prefer to sleep in the main hall where he settled into one of rourkes chairs and wrapped himself in a blanket rourke threw another piece of nut on the fire and stood up im going to the hangar to get the planes ready you will need to launch at first light rourke went off down the tunnels into the hangar he would service the microplanes test the instruments and top off their electric charges readying them for takeoff the moment daylight glimmered danny minot found himself alone in the hall curled up in the chair he couldnt possibly sleep he drank the last of the jack daniels and tossed the bottle away his arm was stirring moving on its own the skin bulging and making crackling noises he lifted the blanket and looked and he could see the grubs twitching he couldnt stand it he began to cry maybe it was the alcohol maybe the terrible state of his arm maybe it was his general situation but he lost it he wept and looked down the hall where rourke had gone how long would rourke be gone and that was when his arm came apart there was a cracking sound a sound like paper tearing he didnt feel anything but he looked down at the noise and saw the head of a grub pushing out through a widening split in the skin of his arm it had a glistening head it was huge and it was squirming waving its head around lengthening as it struggled out oh god its hatching he whispered the larva began to do something strange and horrible it spat liquid from its mouth stringy thin droolsno actually it was thread it was silk the larva still partway inside his arm and more than halfway out began to spin silk around itself rapidly waving its head around it flung silk threads around its body building up a covering of silk around itself even while its rear end stayed rooted in dannys arm what was it doing it wasnt going to hatch it was just going on to another phase it was turning into a cocoon but it refused to leave his arm terrified he tugged on the larva trying to make it come free it lashed angrily spitting silk threatening to bite him with little teeth too it didnt want to come out of his arm it wanted to stay there anchored in his arm and build itself a silken case karen rick he said softly the door to the alcove was closed they didnt hear him they couldnt help him anyway ohhh he stifled a moan of panic what about that video screen in the next room rourke had said it was a communication system that connected with nanigen he glanced around rick and karen were in the magnet room a distance away rourke was in the hangar he threw the blanket off got up and went into the communications room where he inspected the video screen he found a lens it was a minicam pointed in front of the screen and there was a cover at the base of the screen he flipped open the cover and discovered a power switch and a red button marked link simple enough he pushed the power button and in a moment the screen powered up glowing blue then he pushed the red button link almost immediately a female voice came on but the screen remained blank nanigen security services where are you calling from tantalus somebody help me sir who are you what is your situation im daniel minot abruptly the screen showed the womans face she had a smooth professional appearance put me through to vin drake please he said to the woman its late at night sir its an emergency tell him im at tantalus and i need help chapter waikiki beach october pm vincent drake was seated at the best table at the sea with his current lover emily st claire a surfer and interior designer the sea overlooked waikiki beach and was one of the finest restaurants in honolulu the table was placed in a private corner of the room by an open window that looked along the beach toward diamond head a breeze wafted over them and whispered through a palm tree near the window they had finished dinner emily poked at a chocolate ganache tart and sipped a glass of chateau dyquem drake swirled a snifter of single malt scotch a macallan i have to go back east for a few days what for emily st claire said to meet with some partners want to come boston in november i think not the lights of houses lined up along the base of diamond head twinkled and the diamond head lighthouse blinked and faded we could do paris afterward drake said mm she answered maybe if we go in the gulfstream just then there was a buzzing sound and drake touched his jacket it was his encrypted corporate phone excuse me he said taking the phone from his jacket he stood up and placed his napkin on the table and walked over to an open window between the tables on the screen of his phone he could see a live video feed the face of danny minot looked back at him you say youre at tantalus base drake said not exactly minot answered were in ben rourkes fortress what hes got all kinds of equip youre telling me ben rourke is alive absolutely minot answered knowingly and he doesnt like you mr drake describe thisfortress its an old rats nest i need medical help drake cut him off where is this uh rats nest exactly its six feet up the hillside from tantalus base drake was silent for a moment they had climbed those cliffs they had made it alive through unexplored superjungle that should have rendered them dead in minutes mr drake i need to get to a hospital minots voice went faster my arm its infected look drake watched on the screen of his phone as danny raised his arm and peeled back the sleeve the arm had been transformed into a bubbly sack dotted withwhiteheads enormous boils the boils weremovingtwitching drakes stomach turned at the sight theyre hatching mr drake danny moved his arm closer to the camera the scene zoomed in until drake could see one of the whiteheads clearly it was the head of a larva struggling pushing up through a hole in dannys skin the grubs mouth pulsed and it spat out a thread of silk the camera moved and he saw more grubs waving and struggling popping up through his skin thank you mr minot i can see very well its horrible my arms all numb im sorry daniel he felt his throat tighten he glanced back at emily st claire who seemed impatient for gods sake help me the little face on his cell phone beseeched him who is with you drake said sharply holding the phone close to his ear i cant see your face drake turned the phone so danny could see him we will help you he said gently who else is with you i want to go to a top hospital yes yes a top hospital who is with you karen king and rick hutter what about the others theyre all dead mr drake peter jansen is dead too yes are you sure hes dead he got shot his chest exploded i saw it how terrible where are king and hutter i dont care about them get me to a hospital but where are they asleep danny said sullenly jerking his head rourkes in the hangar hangar what hangar daniel rourke stole some planes from tantalus base hes a thief mr drake so rourke had microplanes how had he survived the bends rourke had learned of a way to deal with the bends this was incredibly valuable how did rourke escape the bends daniel a shrewd look flickered on dannys face that oh its simple what did he do ill tell youif you help me daniel i am doing my utmost to help you ben knows the secret danny said what is it exactly totally simple tell me danny knew hed gotten drake where he wanted him he didnt trust the man but he knew he was smarter than drake get me to a hospital mr drake and ill tell you how to survive the bends drakes lips compressed all right thats the deal mr drake its not negotiable of course i agree now here is what i want you to do daniel you must do exactly as i say just help me can you fly one of those planes any idiot could fly one even you my little daniel listen get me help thats what im desperately trying to do just get me out of here danny was screaming over the cell phone can you listen to me for one moment drake stepped to the open window and leaned out he needed to get him out of there talk to him pump him get the information on rourkethen take care of all the little people in short order drake looked along the length of waikiki beach little daniel would need a landmark he saw a light blink on off diamond head lighthouse to his left inland he could see clouds hovering over the mountain peaks it meant that the trade wind was blowing blowing from tantalus toward diamond head that was important daniel you know what diamond head looks like dont you everybody does i want you to take one of those planes and fly toward diamond head what theyre easy to fly you cant crash you just bounce off things silence are you listening to me daniel yes as you get closer to diamond head you will see a blinking light near the sea this is the diamond head lighthouse fly toward the lighthouse you cant possibly miss it i will be in a red sports car parked as close to the lighthouse as possible land on the hood of my car i want a medevac helicopter waiting for me first we need to get you decompressed youre too small for a helicopter minot began giggling they could lose me in a helicopter couldnt they ha ha thats funny daniel drake said well take you to the best hospital theyre hatching just fly to the lighthouse drake disconnected and pocketed the phone and returned to the table where he kissed emily st claire on the cheek total screaming emergency im sorry oh christ vin where are you going nanigen im needed he caught the waiters eye the waiter moved toward them emily st claire shook her hair and took a sip of wine she put the glass down without looking at drake she said suit yourself ill make this up to you emily i promise well do tahiti in the gulfstream thats so old id prefer mozambique done he said he reached into his jacket and lifted a thick wad of hundreddollar bills from his billfold he handed them to the waiter without looking at them and said take care of the lady he hurried out vin drake drove to a large discount store off kapiolani boulevard on the way he called don makele meet me at the diamond head lighthouse as soon as you can bring a micro communication radio come in the security truck i will need the truck drake emerged from the store carrying a plastic bag with something bulky in it he placed the bag in the trunk of his car danny turned off the video screen and went back into the main hall and took a drink of water from a bucket he felt unbearably thirsty fluid had been leaking from his arm as the grubs began to break out wetting his shirt and dribbling onto his pants and the horror was that the grubs were spinning silk around themselves they were turning into cocoons stuck to his arm his heart was beating too quickly he felt terrified but knew what he had to do it was kill or be killed in this world he curled up in the chair by the fire when rourke returned from the hangar he closed his eyes and feigned sleep snoring to make sure rourke got it he watched through slitted eyes while rourke added fuel to the fire and climbed into his bed danny got up began creeping toward the tunnel where are you going rourke asked danny froze just the privy let me know if you need anything sure ben he went down the tunnel past the opening to bens privy and hurried down the corridor to the hangar once he got there he turned on the lights there were three microplanes which to choose he selected the largest one hoping it would have the greatest range and most power a cable led from the planes battery pack into the dirt floor he unplugged the cable he had forgotten to open the hangar doors the doors were held in place with metal pins he pulled out the pins and slid open the rolling doors revealing a night sky studded with tropic stars a waxing moon and ghostly shapes of trees he climbed into the cockpit and settled himself buckled up and touched the instrument panel at that moment a terror struck him he didnt have a starter key he searched the control panel and found a button with a power symbol on it he pressed it the panel lit up and he felt the plane lurch as the electric motor turned over ready for takeoff his left arm lay on his lap like a prop from a horror movie the sleeve had shredded as the grubs chewed their way out two more grubs had broken through his skin and begun to spin cocoons around themselves it was horrible how could nature be so cruel it was so gruesome so inhuman and it really didnt seem fair he took the stick in his hands and moved it and saw the ailerons waggle he pushed the throttle forward the propeller wound up fast whining at the back of the plane the plane began bumping along the floor he slopped the stick around cursing and got the plane under control and the plane shot out of the hangar and climbed into the voracious night chapter waikiki october pm eric jansen had gone out on kapiolani late to get something to eat and he walked back to the apartment carrying a styro box of kalua pork and rice in the driveway he said hello to two guys who were sitting on lawn chairs by the colorful pickup truck drinking beer and listening to music he went around to the back and up a flight of steps to a secondfloor apartment the apartment was a furnished onebedroom eric sat at a tiny table and opened the box and began eating he thought hed better check the monitor since hed been gone for over an hour he went into the bedroom opened a drawer in the dresser in the drawer sat the laptop computer and next to it a metal box dense with electronic parts along with an electric soldering iron cutters pliers tape and a roll of solder wire a light on the box was blinking it meant that an emergency call had been made over nanigens intracompany network shit hed missed it the message was encrypted he tapped the keys of the laptop and ran the deencryption program the one hed downloaded from nanigens vpn it took a minute to unscramble the call and then he began to listen as voices came out of the laptop you say youre at tantalus base not exactly were in ben rourkes fortress what hes got all kinds of equip youre telling me ben rourke is alive absolutely and he doesnt like you mr drake eric leaned over the dresser listening more intently this had been an emergency call made through the videoconference link with tantalus he couldnt get the image but he could get the sound the voices went on what about the others theyre all dead mr drake peter jansen is dead too yes are you sure hes dead he got shot his chest exploded i saw it eric gasped as if hed been punched no he said he closed his eyes no he said again he made a fist and slammed it on the dresser no he turned around and pounded the bed with both fists and picked up a chair and threw it against the wall and sat down on the bed and buried his face in his hands peteroh petergod damn you drakegod damn you eric jansen didnt cry for long he didnt have time right now he got up and restarted the playback and listened to the end of the message as you get closer to diamond head you will see a blinking light by the seafly toward the lighthouse he had been monitoring all the major intracompany data feeds waiting and hoping for news of his brother and the other graduate students he had felt pretty sure that drake had dumped them somewhere maybe at the arboretum though he couldnt be certain he had gone there in the truck and walked into the valley through the tunnel and had listened with the equipment but heard nothing nevertheless he had hoped that peter would turn up sooner or later he had had faith in peters resourcefulness he had waited hoping he could rescue peter and the others he had made a terrible mistake he should have gone to the police immediately even if it had guaranteed his own death the call had come in almost an hour ago damn he had taken his sweet time getting that food eric swore and dragged open the drawer scooped up the laptop and a radio headset and ran down the stairs in the driveway the two guys were sitting beside the parked truck eric didnt have a car he had worked out a deal with one of the guys to rent the truck paying fifty bucks every time he used it now he handed the guy fifty dollars and got in placing the equipment on the seat next to him when you be back dont know he started it you okay man theres been a death in my family oh sorry man he swung onto kalakaua avenue and immediately realized hed made a mistake kalakaua was the main drag of waikiki and the crowds had flooded the avenue people going on foot and in cars he should have gone the other way to diamond head but that probably would have been just as bad as he inched his way through the stoplights past the major hotels he began to cry again and this time he let it happen its my fault he told himself my brother is dead and its my fault drake had planned the killing with extra layers of security different ways to make eric die eric wasnt sure exactly how drake had done it but drake had made the boat stall in heavy surf and hed rigged something that had launched two hellstorms at eric the killer bots flew out of the cuddy cabin after the boat stalled at first eric had thought they were flies or moths but then he saw the propellers and the munitions too after he jumped out of the boat with the killer bots flying after him he had to keep himself under water to avoid them he had texted peter just before he jumped warning peter to stay away but there had been no time to explain things eric was a strong swimmer and knew how to handle himself in surf he had gone into the surf without a life jacket diving deep whenever a breaker passed over him in order to keep himself safe from the bots he had considered the surf the safest place to be safer than anywhere else just then he swam into a small cove where there was a pocket beach known locally as the secret beach the beach was tucked among the headlands you couldnt see it from most places it could only be reached by a hiking trail he had come out of the water at the secret beach only after he was reasonably sure no one had seen him swim there he had bagged a ride into honolulu from some local guys who asked no questions and could not have cared less where he came from going to the police had not been a good option the police would never believe his story that tiny flying robots armed with supertoxin weapons had been sent by the ceo of the company to kill him they would think he was schizophrenic and if he went to the police drake would learn he was alive and would send more hellstorms and hed be killed for sure and very fast in honolulu he had not returned to his apartment drake might have set a trap for him there instead hed visited a pawnshop and taken his hublot chronograph watch off his wrist and pawned it for several thousand dollars he needed to go into hiding and figure out how to bring drake to justice he had put down cash for a seedy lowprofile rental as nanigens vice president for technology eric jansen knew a lot about the companys communication network a degree in physics helped after a trip to radio shack he had tweaked up a listening device he had begun scanning the nanigen intracorporate channels and learned that his brother had shown up in hawaii immediately then had disappeared along with the other students he suspected drake had done something with the students he had not believed drake would murder them that would be too obvious and drake was a clever man so eric had assumed that drake had made them disappear in the microworld temporarily and that they would eventually reappear eric had been waiting for the moment when his brother would come to the surface for he had faith in peter he had thought that peter would get through this and come to light somehow and that he eric would eventually rescue him if the two of them could go to the police there would be two corroborating witnesses to drakes crimes this was not to be he had screwed up massively he should have gone to the police right away even if the police didnt believe him even if it meant that drake would kill him because it just might have saved peters life the whole source of the problem was omicron eric had been very careful not to tell peter what he had discovered about project omicron eric had been trying to protect his younger brother none of this had done any good he swung through kapiolani park picking up speed and weaving around the cars hoping he would get to the lighthouse in time chapter koolau mountains october pm at an altitude of feet danny minot pointed the nose of his microplane upward gaining height in order to be sure he would clear the sides of tantalus crater the crater was lined with entrapping trees black and menacing he looked back wondering if any microplanes were following him but he couldnt see anything he headed upward gaining altitude this was easier than a video game the microplanes had been designed to be almost crashproof did the plane have running lights he found a switch and the running lights came on red and green on the wingtips white pointing forward he turned them off so that the others couldnt follow him but after a little while he switched the lights on again it made him feel better somehow to see the familiar winking lights on the wings and he saw the city of honolulu spread out below him the hotels of waikiki towered and seemed impossibly huge redandwhite lines of cars moved along the boulevards and he saw a cruise ship docked in the harbor the ocean was an inky expanse beyond the city the moon floated over the ocean casting a sparkling highway of light on the water to the left of waikiki beach a dark mass spread out it was diamond head and he was looking down on it seen from above diamond head was a crater a ring a few lights burned in the center of the crater he could make out the shape of diamond head itself a mountainous headland at the highest lip of the crater but he did not see any blinking light just the dark shape of diamond head where was the lighthouse he increased the power and began to fly toward diamond head his plane suddenly flipped over and blew sideways rolling over and over and he yelled with fright he had entered the trade wind as it burbled over the mountains he swore and fought the stick while the plane tumbled in wind eddies but then the plane stabilized and began flying straight and steady in the wind moving really fast he had gotten into laminar flow it was like getting into the main current of a river he looked down the forest was moving down there or rather he was moving over it the altimeter showed he had gotten up to three thousand feet in the moonlight he saw a magnificent view behind him upwind the hollow of tantalus crater spread out the crater was dark like a cave no lights in the crater no sign of rourkes redoubt or tantalus base directly below him roads snaked up the flanks of the ridge lights burned along the roads ahead of him the towers of the city were coming perceptibly closer until they seemed to burn with energy and rise to impossible heights for a moment he felt as if he was flying into the capital city of an alien galactic empire but it was only honolulu he still couldnt see diamond head lighthouse the wind was carrying him toward the hotels that stood along waikiki beach he wanted to go more to the left more toward diamond head he experimented with the control stick and with the throttle he banked left and kept the power on high he looked around he did not want to be blown into the city that would be certain death he would be crushed by traffic or sucked into the airconditioning of a building so he increased the power to emergency maximum and kept his course toward diamond head a screen flashed a warning excessive battery drain remaining flight time min min minthe remaining flight time was dropping like a stone he would run out of power in minutes he checked his airspeed the readout showed mph kph he found the radio panel and switched it on mayday mayday this is daniel minot im in a small plane a very small plane does anybody hear me mr drake are you there i cant reach diamond headim being blown into the cityoh my god a hotel loomed up like a firstorder battleship from outer space he saw two giants standing on a balcony a man and a woman holding drinks in their hands his plane rushed toward them uncontrollably carried in the wind their heads were bigger than mount rushmore the man put his drink down and reached toward the woman and pulled down the shoulder strap of her dress exposing a colossal breast with an erect nipple standing out six feet the man fondled it with a hand of horrifying size and their faces closed in for a kissas his plane rushed toward a collision he screamed and fought the controls and passed between their noses under emergency power propeller churning and the plane was caught in an eddy of wind and swept around the corner of the building and out of sight the man jerked away from the woman what the hell she had seen something weird a tiny man flying a tiny plane lights blinking on the wings the tiny man had been screaming she had distinctly heard his insectlike whine over the sound of a buzzing motor and she had seen the open mouth the staring eyesit was impossible one of those waking dreams the bugs are awful out here jimmy its these flying cockroaches they got in hawaii they got wings lets go inside danny regained control of his aircraft as the wind seemed to decrease he flew across kalakaua avenue where he looked down on the nighttime crowds he noticed that he had stopped being blown sideways his plane was flying faster than the wind was blowing he was making headway now he banked and headed northeast and flew along the length of waikiki beach straight toward diamond head now as he peered at the famous shape of the headland in the moonlight he saw a blink of light on off darkness on off it was the lighthouse im saved he backed down the power a little and left it at full cruise because it would be a disaster if the battery ran out now he was getting the hang of this it was a matter of technique he gained altitude he wanted to stay above the buildings keep plenty of distance above them it was funny how life could turn around so fast one moment you think youre ruined and dead the next youre on your way to the best hospital and admiring waikiki beach in the moonlight life was good danny thought a shape came out of the night he saw a flash of wingshe threw the stick over and just missed the thing stupid moth watch where youre going that had been close absolutely no brain he muttered a collision with a moth could drop him in the sea and he could see breakers below him then a peculiar noise reached his ears sort of an echoing whishwhinghe heard it again whishwhing whoomwhoooemmeeeeee what was that something was making freaky noises in the dark then a drumming noise started up pompompompompom he saw another moth and the drumming sound came from the mothand then the moth suddenly wasnt there something had swept the moth out of the sky oh fuck danny said bats they were painting the moths with sonar he had gotten himself into the middle of some kind of a bat situation this was not good he advanced the throttle to emergency maximum he could hear the sonar pulses ringing in the darkness left right above below nearby far awaybut he couldnt see the bats that was the worst thing above below on all sides the predators were moving in three dimensions around him it was like treading water at midnight surrounded by feeding sharks he couldnt see anything at all but he could hear them snatching prey whoowhoomwhooomeeeeeeeeeeeee that had been a kill and then he saw it a bat killed a moth right in front of him he got a glimpse of a spiky shape as it swept by and the plane shuddered and jumped in the turbulence of the bats wake holy god the bat had been far bigger than he thought it would be he had to get to ground just land anywhere even on top of a hotel he pointed the plane into a dive and went straight down engines shirring at full power aiming for the nearest hotelbut he was headed for the beachoh shittoo far away from the building too close to the water the batsounds got louder then a sonar beam raked over him and went away there was a pausethen the beam hit him fullforce making his chest flutter whoomeeepeeepeeeeeeeee the bat was painting him with a beam of ultrasound the pings shortened and became focused a chaos of sound enveloped him im not a moth he cried he threw the stick hard over and pulled sideways in a screaming diveturn with his good hand he began pounding on the outside of the cockpit trying to imitate the drumming of the moths thumping his hand on the plane maybe it would jam the bats radar too late he realized that by banging on his plane he had told the bat exactly where he was he saw a flash of brown fur gleaming with silvertipped guard hairs a pair of wings flaring impossibly wide blocking out the moon and a wideopen mouth filled with a set of canines like chisels the microplane spiraled down its wing broken its cockpit empty and landed in foam slick near the beach where it vanished chapter diamond head lighthouse october pm rourke dozed for a while but awoke when he became aware that danny minot had not returned from the privy time had passed the fire had burned down he got up and hurried down the tunnel toward the privy danny wasnt there the redoubt was a sprawling warren with many unused tunnels perhaps danny had gotten lost in a tunnel rourke went into a side tunnel and called mr minot you there nothing another tunnel yielded silence then rourke noticed air moving in the tunnel the hangarhe ran to the hangar and found the doors open a plane gone he closed the doors then woke rick and karen your friend has gone he took a plane they werent sure what had gotten into danny perhaps he had become frightened gone into a panic with his arm in such bad shape and had decided to fly to nanigen on his own it showed more courage than danny seemed capable of maybe we should fly out and try to find him karen suggested rourke forbade it hes gone the wind could take him anywhere over the island and he said it was too dangerous to fly after dark the bats were out its almost suicidal danny might already be dead and if he survived the flight it wasnt clear how he planned to get inside nanigen it doesnt make sense karen said sheer panic rick said vin drake sat in his car the beam from the lighthouse swung around above shining through the branches of trees overhead the moon washed the scene with silver what a beautiful world it truly was he felt almost placid he was high above the world walking on a tightrope and doing it well a black pickup swung in and parked next to drake drake got out and climbed into the truck he explained the situation to makele hes in the air he knows a cure for the bends hes going to tell me when he lands then makele asked drake didnt answer he put on the radio headset and began calling staring up toward the mountains daniel daniel are you there he heard nothing but a hiss of airwaves he turned to makele watch for his running lights red and green very small what are you going to do with the kid makele asked drake ignored him winds blowing from tantalus he should be here any minute a car swung into the parking area drake snatched the radio off his head and stared check it makele edged closer to the parked car and saw a couple inside getting friendly with each other he told drake there was nothing to worry about drake resumed calling but with no answer cars passed and the lighthouse beam circled many times the couple in the parked car went out of sight the two men stared up into the sky trying to see any lights against the backdrop of stars little danny was lying drake remarked about what about a cure for bends lying to make me save him ha they listened for the whine of a microplane don makele saw that the wind was blowing pretty hard if they didnt see the kid hed get blown out to sea drake removed something from the trunk of the sports car and placed it in the back of the pickup truck then he said im giving you three more shares now youve got seven shares that brings your net worth to seven million the security man grunted then he said what do we do with the kid question him drake tapped on the radio headset it could communicate with microhumans after that drake didnt reply for a bit then he leaned against the pickup truck and slapped his palm on the metal gazing into the sky he murmured the bugs are bad tonight i see makele said the two men watched a while longer makele backed up a few steps moving alongside the truck and glanced at the object drake had placed on the bed of the truck it was a plastic fuel container he could smell the gasoline drake called some more finally ripped off his headset mr minot had an accident or he changed his mind he got into the pickup truck and handed the keys of his sports car to don makele what do you want me to do with your car sir drop it at nanigen take a taxi home drake started the truck and it roared off on the diamond head road as he watched the headlights disappear makele shook his head chapter rourkes redoubt november am karen and rick were curled up inside the magnet waiting out the night were the last ones karen said rick smiled thinly i didnt figure wed end up together karen what did you figure well i thought youd survive not me he said how are you feeling she asked him perfect that was a lie his face had become streaked with bruises and his joints ached as karen studied ricks bruises it made her wonder what she looked like i probably look like ive been mugged she thought you need to get into the generator rick he glanced at her face in the firelight you too listen rick how to tell him about what shed decided just be blunt im not going back what im going to be okay i think what im not flying to nanigen im going to take my chances here they were sitting shoulder to shoulder wrapped in blankets and looking into the dying embers of the fire she could feel his body going tense and he turned and stared at her what are you talking about karen i dont have anything to go back to rick i was so unhappy in cambridge i didnt even realize it but hereim happier than ive ever been in my life its dangerous but its a new world its waiting to be explored rick felt a kind of sickness take hold in his chest and he couldnt tell if it was the bends or his feelingswhat the are you in love with ben or something she laughed ben are you kidding i dont love anybody here i dont have to love anybody i can be alone and free i can study naturegive names to things that dont have names for christs sake karen after a pause she said can you get back to nanigen by yourself ben would probably fly with you you cant do this the fire popped and crackled rick felt a disappointment grip his insides like a fist closing he tried to ignore the feeling he looked over at her saw the firelight shining on her raven hair but couldnt keep his eyes off the shadow of a bruise on her neck that bruise worried him had he done that to her when hed grabbed her around the neck he couldnt bear the thought that hed hurt herkaren he said yeah please dont stay you could die here she took his hand and squeezed it and let it go dont do it rick went on ill take my chances thats not good enough for me she glared at him its my decision but i am involved like how by the fact that i love you he heard her take a breath she turned away and her hair fell over her eyes so that he couldnt read her expression rick i cant help it karen somewhere along the way i fell in love with you i dont know how it happened but it happened when you got swallowed by the bird i thought you were dead karen at that moment i would have thrown my life away to save you and i hadnt even known i loved you and then when i got you back and you werent breathingit scared me so muchi couldnt bear to lose you rick pleasenot now well why did you save me because i had to she answered in a tight voice because you love me he went on look get off this he thought he had gone too far probably she didnt love him didnt even like him maybe he should just shut up but he couldnt ill stay with you well have the bends together well get through it just like we got through everything else rick im not somebody to stay with im basicallyalone he folded his arms around her feeling her body trembling he pulled her hair aside and found her cheekbone with his fingertips and turned her head gently toward him youre not alone he brought her mouth to his and kissed her and she didnt try to stop it and then she was kissing him deeply wrapping her arms around him that was when he noticed how much it hurt to kiss her every part of his body hurt with a deep unfocused pain an ache in the joints and bones that seemed to be spreading everywhere like a spilled liquid was he bleeding internally she winced suddenly and it made him wonder if she hurt the same way he did are you okay she pushed him off without answering dont stay why give me a reason i dont love you i cant love anybody karen their talk got no further because the ceiling lights went out plunging the room into gloom except for the glowing fire pit almost immediately a weird odor began to filter through the tunnels the room smelled like a gas station the smell grew stronger ben rourke came running gasoline he shouted get out chapter tantalus crater november am a rumbling sound started up making the tunnels shake like an earthquake and then a glow of yellow light appeared in the ceiling smoke hole over the fire hearth rick and karen jumped up throwing the blankets off as ben rushed into the room to the hangar he shouted they began to run down the tunnel but were hit with a blast of rushing air hot and soaked with fumes karen fell rick picked her up and started dragging her but she wrestled him away but then she fell to her knees and collapsed she seemed to have fainted or something he couldnt see anything and smoke had suddenly flooded the tunnels he picked her up and slung her over his back and started to run following ben he got dizzy and had trouble breathing and realized that the oxygen was being sucked out of the tunnels ben was shouting hauling him along and he fell dropping karen this time karen came around she stood up and grabbed him and started hauling him along come on rick dont fall apart on me stumbling choking coughing they ran through the smoke it filled the ceiling get under the smoke ben shouted they began crawling keeping their heads under the swirling black smoke while a horrifying deep roar made the ground shake they made it to the hangar rick and karen leaped into the planes while rourke flung open a hangar door just then the door collapsed revealing a curtain of flames blocking the mouth of the cave rourke fell back coughing ben karen screamed she saw him fall to his knees then stand up and he waved them on go but there were only two planes ben would not be able to fly karen cried ben what about you get out he was staggering backward toward the tunnel smoke poured from it now choking her head spinning karen started her plane and waved at rick take off she screamed at him they took off at the same time flying side by side through the cave while rourke staggered backward karen looked back and saw him fall to his knees he was crawling into the redoubt he couldnt breathe he would never make it but now the wall of flames approached she ducked hunching herself in the cockpit and the microplane burst through the flames and into cool night air she looked over and saw that rick hutter flew next to her he seemed okay she banked gently testing the stick and looked back rourkes redoubt had become a sea of fire the flames leaped up against the great boulder painting its face with firelight while the shadow of a giant man appeared outlined against the flames the man held a red plastic gasoline container and he was dumping it around tantalus base the man stepped back and tossed a match and a burst of flames leaped up revealing his face it was vin drake bathed in the firelight drakes face radiated calm he could have been staring into a campfire and thinking peaceful thoughts he tipped his head from side to side as if he were shaking water out of his ear or listening for something rick lost control of his plane he threw it into a barrel roll and smacked into the great boulder for a moment he thought he was dead but the microplane bounced off the rock corkscrewed and stabilized flying straight and level these microplanes were really tough he looked around he had lost sight of karen the trees extended upward in a tangled wall he searched the trees but found no lights nothing to indicate where karen had gone there was a radio in the cockpit and he debated calling her on it just then ahead of him rick saw a pair of lights wink on green and red karens running lights he switched on his running lights then waggled his wingtips at her she waggled back good they could see each other she flew into the crown of a tree and rick followed her lights he could barely see the branches and limbs all around he was flying through a dark maze following karen king rick ran up the power and caught up with her while she circled inside the tree then he switched on his radio what the hell drake couldnt reach them now even if he could hear them are you all right karen i think so what about you doing okay he answered he realized that she had nowhere to go now except nanigen she couldnt stay at tantalus since there was nothing left he decided not to remind her of that reality they could see drake through the branches as they circled he walked downslope and more flames leaped up he was burning something else whatever it was he seemed determined to eradicate all traces of the base and of rourkes redoubt the fires were burning in wet forest and would probably die without attracting attention leaving rourkes redoubt and tantalus base gutted ruins drake moved off into the forest his flashlight bobbing they heard the sound of an engine and they saw a pickup truck bouncing on the dirt road at the lip of the crater the vehicles lights vanished past the far side of the crater and darkness closed in but the darkness wasnt total for the lights of honolulu sparkled through the branches karen flew up out of the top of the tree and into the open bats gotta land somewhere rick said to her where rick we cant land on the ground they would be exposed to grounddwelling predators follow me he said he went past her and flew on ahead while she followed he could see branches leaves obstructions and he flew around them twisting left and right always staying inside the crowns of the trees where bats wouldnt be flying occasionally he looked back and saw karens running lights behind him she was staying on his tail the light of the fires faded behind them until they had gone down inside the depths of the crater into a zone where the wind blew more gently blocked by the walls and slopes of the crater they could no longer see the fires at all im going to look for a landing place rick said on the radio he coasted along a branch inspecting it it was a wide clean branch free of moss with plenty of taxi room he settled down on the branch and came to a halt these planes could land on a dime karen landed and taxied up next to him until their planes were parked beside each other the branch rocked and bobbed the wind played with it threatening to pluck the aircraft off the branch we need to tie these planes down rick said and climbed out he discovered that the planes had tiedown ropes in their noses and tails surely ben rourkes invention rick secured both planes karen king began crying softly hunched in her cockpit whats the matter ben he was trapped he couldnt have survived rick thought ben might have stood a chance i wouldnt count that guy out but there was no way of knowing if ben had escaped or had died in the flames then came the wait the clocks in the instrument panels showed the time am dawn would not come for many hours but they couldnt fly safely at night the trade wind was running strong and the branch tossed and heaved like the deck of a ship in a storm she could see the bruises on her arms dark stains in the moonlight the stains were getting larger she wondered what the rest of her body looked like rick became seasick as the branch pitched and bobbed and he wondered if the microbends were getting to him or it might be lingering effects of spider and wasp venom he thought about the distance they had to cover at dawn fifteen miles including a long passage over pearl harbor which was open water he thought its not possible well never make it chapter tantalus drive november am w hen eric jansen swung into the parking area by the diamond head lighthouse the place had been deserted there was no sign of vin drakes car he had arrived too late or maybe too early maybe drake hadnt shown up yet he had parked in the corner of the area and debated what to do next wait for drake but drake might have already been here should he go to the police but that might cost the survivors their lives because drake knew where they were and he might be heading for tantalus to kill them eric knew he had to go to tantalus and so he drove up the tantalus drive the truck roaring and misfiring past expensive homes on hairpin turns the road came to a gate with a rutted dirt track beyond it the gate wasnt locked he started driving up the track it wound up the steep mountainside through guava forests and came out at the lip of the crater and it followed the lip down through dips and gullies washed out in several places this was a fourwheeldrive track only and eric was glad he had a fattire truck eventually he reached a turnaround still no sign of drakes truck the place was deserted he did not have a flashlight that was a problem but he got out of the truck leaving the headlights shining toward the great boulder and stood there listening there was a reddish glow through the trees and he began crashing through the undergrowth toward it when he reached the great boulder he saw what had happened embers were dying down the soil smoking and the ground reeked of gasoline drake had done the deed he had killed everybody regretting that he hadnt brought a flashlight eric got down on his knees and found the entrance to the rat warren rourkes hideout anybody there he called it was useless he waited for a while though poking his finger into the soil wondering if there were survivors it was too dark to see much and they would be very small he worried he might crush somebody by accident but there werent any survivors anybody could see that he stumbled through the woods back to the truck rick and karen parked on the branch saw the headlights of another vehicle bumping slowly around the rim of the crater it was a truck rick watched for a while then said to karen im going to investigate dont he ignored her he untied his plane and started it and taxied off she heard it whining upward toward the crater rim toward the great boulder damn you rick karen yelled she wasnt going to be left alone so she started her plane and followed him rick saw a man get out of the truck he circled through the branches listening for bats but he didnt hear any sonar and he flew closer to the man the man walked to the great boulder and got down on his knees in the darkness his face wasnt visible the man stood up from the boulder and walked away crashing through the underbrush a black silhouette rick followed him dodging among branches and trunks the man arrived at the parked vehicle it was a strangelooking truck with fat tires and a weird paint job the man got in and the dome light came on revealing his face rick had seen the man before where he circled past the window as the truck started with a roar karen he called on the radio who is this guy she swooped past rick and made a steep turn by the truck she was getting the hang of flying it was pretty easy its peters brother i thought he was supposed to be dead is he in with drake how would i know karen answered testily the truck started and began rumbling off moving along the dirt track karen ran her engine up to emergency maximum running at full power their planes could barely keep up with the truck even though it bounced slowly along the dirt road the moment the truck arrived at a paved road it would speed up and they would never catch it and it would be gone they had to get erics attention soon he was driving with the windows rolled up karen flew alongside the window close to the mans face and waggled her wings no reaction then the truck sped up leaving them behind in swirling dust get in the slipstream rick said there would be a zone of dead air behind the trucks cab he thought so he dove for it watching the back of the mans head in the glass his plane flipped over and tumbled the air behind the cab had gone turbulent and chaotic and he nearly crashed on the trucks bed the truck came to a bad spot in the road where rain had washed a gully the man slowed and rolled down his window and leaned out to get a better look karen flew through the window into the cab she circled once and the man drew his head back in she made a slow pass in front of his eyes and rolled the plane its lights winking he saw that he jammed on the brakes hey his eyes followed her as she banked and turned and flew low over the dashboard he held out his hand palm upward and she landed on his hand she climbed out and stood on his hand while he looked at her rick flew in and landed on the dashboard whichonesareyou he said his voice rumbling he held karen delicately and he tried not to breathe too much as he spoke he didnt want to blow her off his hand karen held up her radio headset and pointed to it she remembered that jarel kinsky had said the radios could be used to communicate with fullsize people maybe it would be easier to talk by radio youbet he put her down on the dashboard with her plane and opened the glove box and took out a headset and plugged it into a mess of electronic equipment sitting on the seat gotoseventyonepointtwofivegigahertz he said rick and karen put on their headsets and tuned their aircraft radios the man opened his mouth and spoke words that rolled out canyouunderstandmenow an instant later the same words sounded on their headsets in erics normal speaking voice can you understand me now this is a squirt radio it collects my voice and speeds it up and squirts it at you it also slows down your voices so i can understand you they explained to eric what had happened we need to get into the generator as soon as possible karen said firstabout my brother they told him as karen described peters death erics palms hit the steering wheel throwing the microhumans and the planes into the air they came down amid choking dust particles and waited they gave him time when he opened his eyes his face had become set and calm im taking you into nanigen then im going to find vincent drake chapter chinatown honolulu november am dan watanabe woke to the buzzing of his cell phone he reached for it in the dark and knocked it off the bedside table and heard it hitting the floor he groped for the light fearing bad family news his sevenyearold daughter living with his exwife his motherbut the caller was the security chief of nanigen got a minute lieutenant watanabe ran his tongue over a sticky mouth yeah there was a fire on tantalus tonight watanabe grunted what it was small probably didnt get reported some people died in it im not following you those studentsthey were murdered he sat up fast instantly full awake take the man into custody get a statement where are you ill have a car no i just want to talk with you you know the deluxe plate it was open all night he was nursing a cup of coffee at a back booth the only customer in the place when don makele walked in the man seemedresigned makele eased himself into the booth watanabe didnt waste time with chitchat lets hear about the students theyre dead vin drake has killed at least eight people they were small people how small makele put his thumb and forefinger half an inch apart really small tell you what watanabe said lets pretend i believe you nanigen has a machine thatll shrink anything even people a waitress came over and asked if makele wanted breakfast he shook his head and waited in silence while the waitress walked away will this machine shrink another machine watanabe asked wellsure makele answered will it shrink a pair of scissors makele squinted what are you talking about willy fong marcos rodriguez makele didnt answer dan watanabe went on i understand you want to tell me what happened to the missing students but i also want to hear about the microbots that cut fongs and rodriguezs throats from ear to ear how do you know about the bots makele said did you think the honolulu police department doesnt have microscopes makele sucked on his lips the bots werent supposed to kill anybody so what went wrong the bots were reprogrammed to kill by who i think by drake watanabe took that in so what happened to the students makele explained about the supply stations in manoa valley and about tantalus base the kids mustve found out something bad about drake because hes been pushing me toget rid of them kill them yes they ended up in manoa valley drake wanted to make sure they didnt get out of the valley alive they tried to escape a few of them made it to tantalus he explained to watanabe about ben rourke drake torched the place also im pretty sure he murdered our chief financial officer and a vice president watanabes head was swimming vin drake seemed to have killed thirteen people if this was true drake was extremely dangerous tell me why i shouldnt decide youre a nutcase he said to the security man makele hunched over you decide what you want i have to tell you the truth are you involved in these deaths for seven million dollars in his years as a detective dan watanabe had witnessed many confessions even so a confession never failed to give watanabe a sense of surprise why did people decide to tell the truth it was never in their best interest the truth doesnt set you free it sends you to prison last time we talked lieutenant don makele went on you said something about molokai watanabe frowned he didnt rememberoh yesmakele used the traditional hawaiian pronunciation you said molokai is the best of the islands the security chief went on i think you meant the people of molokai not the island i dont know what i meant watanabe answered and sipped his coffee and sat back keeping his gaze fixed on makele i was born in pukoo makele went on thats a little spot on east molokai just a few houses and the sea my grandma raised me she taught me to speak hawaiianwell she tried to she also taught me about doing the right thing i joined the marines served my country but theni dont know what happened to me i started doing things for money those students didnt deserve what we did to them we left them to die when they didnt die drake sent people to take them out i will do a lot of things for seven million dollars but theres some things i wont do i wont take orders from vin drake anymore im like pau hana work is done where is mr drake right now watanabe asked the man was beyond dangerous nanigen i think watanabe flipped up his phone well get him not a good idea to just walk in there lieutenant oh watanabe said coolly holding his phone away from his ear you could hear his phone ringing tactical deployments are pretty damn effective ive noticed not with microbots they can smell you and they can fly its a hornets nest in there all right tell me how to get in theres no way in unless vin drake permits it he controls the bots handcontroller like a tv remote watanabe got an answer to his phone call marty he said putting the phone back to his ear weve got a problem at nanigen eric jansen swung the fattire truck into the entrance of the kalikimaki industrial park and cruised past the nanigen building apart from a sodium light splashing the entrance door the place seemed lightless and dead in the early hours of a sunday morning karen king and rick hutter stood on the dashboard of the truck next to their aircraft near them a plastic hula girl bobbled stuck to the dashboard and swinging in a grass skirt the hula girl loomed over karen and rick eric drove the truck inside an unfinished building just the frame of a warehouse and some concrete block walls which sat next to nanigen he parked behind a wall out of sight he shut off the engine and got out and listened for a few moments and looked around time to move on nanigen he put on the squirt radio headset and spoke into the voice pickup launch your planes and follow me karen and rick climbed into their planes and took off eric could hear the props whining near his ears as he crossed the lot heading for nanigen he realized they were flying directly behind his head to keep out of the wind you okay he said on the radio fine karen answered she didnt feel fine she felt terrible like a bad case of flu coming on every joint in her body ached rick probably felt worse she thought since hed had loads of toxins in his bloodstream that would accelerate the bends in him probably the front door was locked eric opened it with a key he held it open for a moment to let karen and rick fly through then he closed the door behind him he moved along the main corridor at a slow walk hearing the mosquitolike buzzing behind his head he glanced back and saw the two microplanes their propellers whirring floating along under the ceiling tiles bobbing in air currents generated by the buildings airhandling system his head created turbulence and they bounced around in his wake as he walked dont get sucked into a vent he warned them couldnt we land on your shoulder you could carry us karen said to eric youre better off in the air you might need to get away fastif i run intotrouble eric glanced back at the planes to make sure they were still behind him and stopped at a corner and peered around it he was looking down a long corridor past windows covered with black shades there was nobody in sight he crossed this corridor and continued down a side hallway to a door and opened it and went in the planes following him my office he said on the squirt erics office had been ransacked papers were strewn about and his computer was gone eric pulled open a drawer in his desk rummaged through it and said whew its still here he took out a device that resembled a game controller its my bot controller it should disarm the bots he explained to rick and karen then he led them back to the main corridor and they flew along behind him past the darkened windows eric stopped before the door marked tensor core he pushed the door it wouldnt open there was no security pad just a plain lock he explained shit he said this door has been locked from the inside that means somebodys in there rick asked could be but theres another way into the generator room we can get in there through the omicron zone the bots in the omicron zone might be programmed to kill an intruder there was no way to know without entering the zone and seeing what the bots did eric just hoped his bot controller would work he led the flyers around a corner turned right and stopped by a nondescript door the door had on it only a small unfamiliar symbol with a single word microhazard rick flew past the symbol a few inches from it and said on the squirt radio what does this mean it means there are bots on the other side of the door that are capable of causing death or serious injuryif theyre programmed that way it could be nasty in there eric held up the controller where the flyers could see it clearly lets hope this controls them then eric tried the doorknob it wasnt locked but he didnt open it instead he punched in a series of digits on the controllers keypad you see drake thinks im dead he said on the squirt radio to the flyers im assuming drake didnt bother to delete my pin number from my bot controller since he figured id never be using it again he shrugged well see he paused for a moment pondering the danger on the other side of the door and then thrust open the door and walked in he stopped holding the door open so that the microplanes could follow him through they had entered the main lab room of the omicron project the lights in the room were turned low and the room was mostly dark it was not a large space it could have been a normal engineering lab it contained some desks some workstations some lab benches with magnifying lenses mounted on them steel shelves held a myriad of small parts a window made of thick glass looked into the tensor core a door stood next to the window an entry door that led straight from project omicron into the core eric stood in the middle of the omicron lab holding the bot controller in his hand looking around listening so far so good he couldnt see the bots but he knew they were there clinging to the ceiling he listened for a faint hum he might just hear their turbines if they sensed him and started dropping off the ceiling coming for him if the bots hadnt been disarmed hed only know when he started to bleed but he heard nothing saw nothing and felt nothing his controller still worked he had disarmed the bots he gave a sigh of relief were good he said there were objects sitting on the lab benches covered with black cloth it was hard to see just what they were in the dim light im going to show you eric said on the squirt radio to rick and karen why vin drake wanted to kill me and why he killed your friends eric stopped in the middle of the room and held out his arm sideways bent at the elbow land on my arm he said you can get a closer look that way rick and karen landed their planes on his forearm moving carefully and shielding the planes with his hand so they wouldnt be blown off by a stray gust of air he approached the closest bench he removed the cloth from one of the objects it was an aircraft small sleek viciouslooking it did not have a cockpit its a hellstorm uav eric said an unmanned aerial vehicle a drone you mean rick asked exactly a drone no pilot it had a wingspan of ten inches eric brought his arm close to the drone letting rick and karen have a good look this is a giant prototype of a hellstorm he said once its flighttested it will be shrunk down to half an inch instead of landing gear the hellstorm had four jointed legs with what looked like sticky pads on the ends just like the feet on the hexapod trucks under its wings it carried missiles two glass tubes with long steel needles at their noses fins and what looked like a rocket motor in the tail what does it do rick asked indeedwhat does it do eric echoed its a military drone the size of a moth it can be used for surveillance it can also kill people it can evade any security system in existence it can fly under a door or through a crack around a window it can cling to a persons skin or clothing it can also crawl using those legs it can fly along the electrical conduits inside a wall then pop out and fly around inside a room it can kill any person anywhere anytime you see those rockets under its wings those are toxin micromissiles the missile is armed with supertoxins that nanigen has discovered and extracted from lifeforms in the microworldpoison from worms spiders fungi and bacteria the missile has a flight range of ten meters this means the drone has standoffattack capability it can fire toxin missiles from a distance if one of those supertoxin missiles embeds in your skin youll die fast one microdrone can kill two people since it carries two missiles what are those scoops along the fuselage are they jet intakes rick asked no those are air samplers theyre used for targeting hows that karen asked the hellstorm can smell you every person gives off a unique fingerprint of scent each one of us smells a little different from every other person our dna is unique so naturally the combination of pheromones given off by our body is unique too a microdrone can be programmed to seek out the odor of a particular person even if you are at a rock concert the drone can find you in the crowd and kill you this is a nightmare karen king said the nightmare has no end eric jansen said think of a presidential inauguration think of a thousand hellstorms released into the air all of them programmed to seek out the president of the united states if just one microdrone gets through the president dies microdrones could take out the government of any nationjapan china britain germanyany nation could be cut down by a swarm of microdrones he turned himself around slowly while rick and karen took in the scene from his arm this room is pandoras box so nanigen isnt about medicine said karen nanigen is about medicine its just that nanigen is working both sides of the street ways to save lives andways to end lives this hellstorm he touched it lightly is a drugdelivery system and you found out about it so drake had to kill you not quite i knew about the omicron program all along nanigen has a contract with the department of defense to develop microdrones the research went much better than the dod people got told vin started lying to the government he started telling them the microdrones were a failure why rick asked because drake had his own plans for microdrones we had a problem with our patents on the microdrone system theres a company in silicon valley called rexatack that actually invented and patented some of this technology vin drake is an investor in rexatack he ripped off the patents and used them to build the hellstorm drone then he decided he needed to sell the technology fast because rexatack was getting ready to sue nanigen and get its patents enforced what got me into trouble with vin was when i discovered he was trying to sell the microdrone technology to the highest bidder not to the us government karen said no vin was looking for fast money and theres more money overseas lookthere are governments out there with money to burnand its dollars countries whose economies are growing faster than ours they will pay anything for the microdrone technology anything im not saying that the us government would necessarily do nice things with microdrones im just saying there are governments out there that would commit horrors with them some of those governments hate the united states they have nothing but contempt for europe they fear their closest neighbors and they hate and fear their own people too those governments wouldnt hesitate to use microdrones as a means to their ends and then there are the international terror groupstheyd love to have microdrones i learned that drake had gone to dubai where he was talking with officials of several different governments about selling them the nanigen hellstorm technology i protested to drake i said it was a violation of us law i said it was dangerous for the whole world but i hesitated why rick asked eric sighed drake had given me stock in nanigen worth millions if i went to the authorities i knew nanigen would crash and burn my stock would be worth nothing so i hesitated out of greed i had gone into physics for the pure love of it and i never thought you see that physics would make me a millionaire now millions would slip through my fingers if i blew the whistle on drake and it was my fatal weakness then drake decided to kill me i was in my new boat doing sea trials and id told alyson bender id meet her in kaneohe for lunchits on the windward side of the island alyson or drake seeded my boat with hellstorms prototypes but they were loaded to kill me my engines failed and thats when i saw one of those damned things fly out of the front cabin at first i thought it was just a bug then i saw it had propellers and needle missiles and i knew it was a hellstorm then i spotted another hellstorm flying out of the cabin so i texted my brother and dove overboard the surf protected me the microdrones couldnt smell me couldnt launch missiles at me because i was swimming under the waves i made it to honolulu and went into hiding if i had surfaced and gone to the police drake would have hunted me down with more microdrones vin drake is drunk on the power of his bots eric sighed and paused and in the silence another voice spoke that was an excellent description of me eric i enjoyed it thoroughly a small bright light went on and vincent drake stood up behind a rack of computers the light beam swinging in front of him chapter kalikimaki industrial park november am d rake had been sitting on a chair in a dark space behind the rack of computers he wore an earbud and he was holding a gun in his right hand it was a belgian fn semiautomatic pistol with a tactical light attached to the trigger guard the light dodged around in his left hand he held a bot controller he wore a black shirt black jeans mudstained boots he walked to the center of the room and pointed the gun into erics eyes then toward erics forearm and caught the two aircraft in the light beam peekaboo i see you said drake the two microhumans heard him perfectly on their headsets he was using a squirt radio rick said to karen launch they powered up the aircraft and fell off erics arm diving the props ramping up drake didnt seem to care what they did he aimed the gun and light into erics eyes standing with his body turned sideways and his gun arm held straight out drake held up the bot controller in his other hand its screen made his hand glow he touched a button with his thumb and said your bot controller doesnt actually work eric only mine does rick banked his microplane and circled over erics head he couldnt see karen he called to her on the radio stay close to me rickcan drake hear us of course i can hear you drakes voice came on their radios he swung the gun around suddenly and the laser beam dodged around their planes and they saw his vast leering face for a moment rick thought drake would fire the gun at them but then he realized that the bullet probably wouldnt hit their planes they were too small dodging around too fast drake kept the gun pointed at erics head he held up the bot controller pressed a button there he said what did you do eric said looking up drake looked around and smiled i activated the bots he took a step backward waiting youll be attacked by them too eric said i dont think so drake lunged forward and hit eric in the face with the butt of his gun eric groaned and fell to his knees what is it about you jansen brothers you seem to require beatings on a regular basis drake said he kicked eric in the ribs eric gasped and went down on all fours and began to crawl where are you going eric looking for something go to hell drake kicked him in the side of the head viciously eric slumped down and curled up and seemed to lose consciousness while drakes pistol light danced over him eric tried to struggle to his feet but couldnt well eric theres something you dont realize the bots ignore my body scent theyll go after anybody except me he chuckled they respect me eric put his hand up to his face then took it away his hand was spotted with blood a small razor cut had opened on his forehead too bad eric looks like one of them found you eric crawled toward drake who darted backward and smiled eric began swatting at his hair at his ears shaking himself trying to get the bots off eric can you feel them crawling on your face in your hair soon theyll be in your bloodstream dont worry it doesnt hurt you just watch yourself bleed as drake worked on eric rick flew toward the door to the generator room thats where he and karen had to go he circled in close to the door and he made a slow pass near it he saw a small vent at the top of the door it might be big enough for a microplane to pass through he couldnt tell he backed away and flew up close to karen until their wings nearly touched he switched off his radio and shouted at her he cant hear us when we shout fly toward the door to the generator room looks like theres a way through he got some altitude above the vent in the door and ran up to full power and dove at the slot his wings clipped the slot as he went through and he ended up inside the generator room spiraling out of control karen followed him a moment later rick recovered got his plane under control he flew straight toward the center of the generator chamber the pattern of hexagons below him he picked out the central hexagon and banked looking down he could see a small white circle in it far below it marked the location of the control panel he could see karen king flying off his right wing im going to land by the circle he shouted to her hoping his voice carried over the rushing wind as his plane flew just then drakes voice came on their radio headsets i know what youre trying to do he said i saw you fly into the generator room however you may wish to know that the bots in there can see you smell you too they saw drakes face staring in the window now his eyes moving tracking them as they flew drake held up the bot controller where they could see it and he pushed a series of buttons i changed the sensitivity now they can find you he said and looked up at the ceiling of the generator room karen followed drakes gaze she saw them glittery specks scattered across the ceiling the specks were moving dropping and falling like tiny raindrops as they fell they fanned out flying under their own power she saw one of them turn toward rick and it began tracking him flying after him as rick went into a dive toward the floor the bot dove as well it was powered by a turboprop fan in a housing and it had a snaky neck with knives on the end of the neck as it flashed past her following rick she saw the eyes the bot had a pair of compound eyes like an insects but it was a machine vision system a pair of eyes meant it had binocular vision depth perception she realized rick she shouted behind you he didnt hear her he was heading for the floor and the white circle the bot closed in on him she had to get that bot off his tail not sure what to do she dove her plane chasing the bot and rick out of the corner of her eye she saw more objects flying and she looked over her shoulder and saw dozens of bots maybe more flying behind her they seemed to be converging on her and rick the bots shimmered as they flew and some of them hovered darting seeking rick behind you she shouted he turned his head and saw the bot following him he immediately pulled up and banked getting out of the dive twisting upward trying to shake the bot off his tail the bot flew at least as well as rick did it was closing in on him karen accelerated and dove behind the bot that was chasing rick maybe she could knock it out of the air by hitting it with the nose of her plane her propeller was in the tail of her plane so the planes nose could be used as a blunt weapon she aimed for the bot and pushed the throttle forward just before the strike she hunched down in the cockpit and tucked her head bracing for impact her plane slammed into the bot there was a pinging sound and her plane ricocheted one way and the bot went the other way both corkscrewing through the air the crash didnt hurt the plane or the bot they merely bounced off each other the bot whirled around and stopped itself in midair and hovered and oriented itself and then began to follow her plane karen regained control of her plane and peeled away watching the bot the bot accelerated toward her putting on a burst of speed and then to karens surprise the bot unfolded two jointed arms it grabbed hold of the wing of karens plane with the sticky pads on the ends of its arms the bot clung to her plane as she flew she tried to shake it off slamming the stick around banking left and right but the bot had gotten a firm grip and wouldnt let go it began cutting into the wing with its blades it was breaking up her wing rick turned back when he saw the bot attach itself to karens plane karen was in trouble he flew toward her asking himself what he could possibly do to free her plane from the bots grip his plane wasnt armed no guns no fire control buttons nothing but waitrourke had armed the planes with machetes there was one in here somewhere he groped around and felt a handle and swooped toward karens plane holding out the machete like a cavalry rider ayah he shouted and hacked through the bots neck as he passed severing it the blades and neck spun off squirming and the beheaded bot released karens plane and zigzagged away seemingly disoriented karen regained control of her plane the bots were hoveringdozens of them rick circled through them a bot darted in and clamped its arms on ricks plane as he passed and the bot began jerking his plane around then the bot began snipping through the wing with its scissorswords while rick struck at it with the machete but he couldnt reach the bot ricks plane went into a spiral another bot grabbed his plane and stopped its fall the bots held ricks plane in midair hovering as if they were quarreling over their prize while they cut it up rick bailed out taking his machete with him as he fell he flipped over on his back and saw karens plane above him bots clung to it she was spinning out of control one bot shredded karens propellers while another tore into the side of the plane at that instant rick landed on the floor on his back unhurt still holding his machete he stood up the generator room seemed enormous he had no idea where the microcontrol panel was he couldnt see the white circle the plastic floor glowing with light from below was strewn with golfballsize grains of dirt looking up and around he tried to see where karens plane had gone he couldnt see her the floor was a mess he heard a sound like oof karen king landed on both feet like a cat about a hundred yards away she had bailed out too she was holding her machete and staring up at the bots a dozen of them were bobbing high overhead holding the planes and pieces of the planes and chopping everything up debris from the planes rained down for the moment the bots seemed distracted by the planes its this way karen called pointing with her machete now he could see the white ring he was surprised by how far away it was they both started a desperate sprint toward the ring jumping over debris running an obstacle course through grit rick tripped while leaping over a human hair and he sprawled he picked himself up he had lost sight of karen karen he shouted overhead the bots had finished cutting up the planes and were now flying this way and that hovering swooping fanning throughout the room as if in seek mode rick wondered if the bots would be able to see them as they ran dozens more bots dropped from the walls and ceiling until at least a hundred bots were flying back and forth hunting for the intruders were they communicating with one another it would be only a matter of time before the bots found them chapter tensor core november am its not a bad way to die drake was saying you hardly feel a thing he worked the controller eric lay propped up with his back against the wall of the omicron lab by the door to the generator room dizzy from the beating drake had given him drake held the gun at his face shining the light into his eyes eric could feel a bot cutting through his forehead blood had begun to drizzle down his face getting in his eyes he could see specks hovering in front of his eyes their props whining like mosquitoes apparently drake could direct them with the controller because they all suddenly flew toward his face he felt them landing on his cheeks his neck exploring his eyelids a bot crawled into his shirt he could feel it and heard its engine buzzing you see how they ignore me drake worked the controller its because i have the controller drake thumbed a joystick and a bot crawled up erics cheek and stopped by the corner of his eye i can make them crawl into any orifice in your body why are you doing this to me research eric eric felt a slight sting near the corner of his eye the bot had planted its scissors in his skin and was making a hole it tucked its head into the hole and began wiggling in snipping through skin cells with the blades a droplet of blood beaded up on his cheek the police cars closed off the access road to the industrial park and set up a security perimeter around the nanigen building the vans moved into position and the hostage rescue squad deployed the flashers on the police cars played across the metal building dan watanabe waited behind one of the cars watching the buildings door he had made the handoff to the swat unit so he didnt have operational authority now but he wanted the op commander kevin hope to pay attention to him wheres dorothy he said shes on her way hope answered what about the fd decon unit in answer to his question a yellow van came roaring in and ground to a halt a squad of fire department people deployed from it pulling on tyvek protective suits as soon as theyd put on protective gear they began setting up a decontamination center with a tent washing equipment and a processing line for victims whats in the building a virus commander hope said to watanabe he had gotten the call to deploy only twenty minutes earlier and he didnt yet know what the investigation involved not a virus bots watanabe said say again tiny robots they bite commander hope gave him a weird look dont tell me this is gonna be a shooter with robots dan not a chance you cant hit em any hostages in there not that we know cant assume anything watanabe answered somebody handed him a tactical vest and he put it on somebody else brought him a handheld multichannel communicator he took the device and keyed it on and said to commander hope you want me to make the call hope gave a wry grin you talked us into this deployment dan you talk us out of it watanabe shrugged and referred to a slip of paper upon which hed written a phone number he called it in the omicron lab eric could feel a halfdozen bots entering his skin pricking him as they burrowed while drake held the gun and light pointed into his eyes eric debated which way to go to force drake to shoot him in the head or to wait a few minutes for the bots to open his arteries just then a faint buzzing sounded in drakes jacket he took out his phone and looked at the caller id blocked it told him he decided to answer it he took a deep breath to get his heart rate down yes vincent drake whos calling dan watanabe sir honolulu police sir is there anybody in the building with you oh my goodness dan im by myself working late whats this all about sir we have the building surrounded would you please walk out slowly with your hands placed on your head you will be safe i promise good grief dan theres obviously been a mistake ill be happy to complyjust give me a moment sir we need you to come out immediately certainly absolutely drake switched off his phone and advanced toward eric his face contorted in fury you went to the police eric shook his head he was losing a lot of blood his shirt was darkening in streams he could feel warmth running down his neck drake leaned over eric and hauled him to his feet youre just like your fucking brothersticking your nose into things they were eye to eye oops drake said touching eric on the cheek i think theres one in your eye get the controller eric had his left hand on the door handle behind him and he pressed it the door opened and eric fell backward into the generator room with drake landing on top of him he reached out with his right hand and felt his fingers close over the controller and he ripped it out of drakes hand as he fell backward drake swore and staggered sprawling past eric into the generator room and he fired the gun eric felt the impact in his leg the bullet passing through his thigh but oddly he didnt feel any pain he was in shock but he had the controller now and that was the main thing he knew what to do with it he slammed the controller against the floor again and again smashing it feeling it break into pieces beneath his hand now nobody could control the bots and then to his surprise he saw the gun lying on the floor right in front of him while drake was getting to his feet drake had dropped the gun drake and eric lunged for it simultaneously on the floor karen and rick saw the door open and two gargantuan human figures fell into the room the gun went off and the shockwave of the blast rolled over the microhumans moments later the two men fell with a floorshaking impact which hurled rick and karen into the air a droplet of blood splashed exploding into secondary droplets they picked themselves up and continued to run toward the white circle one of the men rolled over on his back he held the bot controller and smashed it repeatedly on the floor it broke apart and pieces of electronic boards flew past karen knocking her to the ground she saw the gun skidding across the floor toward her and felt sure it would crush her she dove away while the two men collided over the gun a moment later eric was holding the gun pointing it at drake who was lying on his back eric lay on the floor near drake he rolled over and propped himself up blood running from his leg and pointed the gun at drakes face you moveill shoot you in the head drake said wait eric we can get out alive together not going to happen you killed my kid brother eric steadied his finger on the trigger but ericyoure completely wrongi did everything to save him youre insane rick and karen reached the circle they could hear a deep thrumming soundthe pulse of robot propellers around them they had lost track of what the big humans were doing in the center of the circle there was a hatch like a manhole cover with a sunken handle karen and rick reached the hatch at the same time rick got down on his knees and tugged on the handle nothing happened the hatch seemed to be stuck by now several bots had converged on them and were hovering aggressively a bot flew in and jabbed at karen with its knives she swung her blade and with a clang knocked the bot away it fell back karen held up her machete back to back she shouted rick hutter straightened up and stood with his back to karen king his machete drawn the bots surrounded them and began darting in flying and hovering steel blades snicking rick slung a roundhouse blow with his machete and blinded a bot shearing off its compound eyes the bot hit the ground its neck writhing and it took wing flying off erratically they continued to hack at the bots but the bots had no fear no sense of selfpreservation whirling her machete karen said open it ill cover you rick bent over and tugged on the hatch again while karen straddled him facing the bots fending them off but the hatch wouldnt come up he began prying at it with the tip of his machete then tried hacking at it if he couldnt open it he could cut through it but the blade bounced off the plastic i cant get it open listen rickow she cried out in pain a bot had slashed her she swung her machete over her head try again hurry she yelled that did it he threw himself on the door and wrenched it open inside was a single red button he jumped on the button with both feet the floor shook the hexagon began to descend into the floor until they were swallowed in a hexagonal chamber a bot had gotten inside the hexagon with them it seemed confused rick fended it off banging at it with his machete as it bounced against the chamber walls the lights changed color followed by a humming sound and then a dreamy feeling came over rick hutter until he felt as if he was floating in space and dancing with the bot and dancing with karen king the three of them whirling around and around in a mad waltz the tensor generator powered up and the fields crossed and recrossed and wound up in poloidal loops and the hexagons raised up and met the floor rick hutter karen king and a gigantic enlarged bot were left resting on the floor the people were fullsize the bot had been expanded to the size of a refrigerator eric was lying on the floor bleeding heavily from a wound in his leg and from several bot cuts but he was conscious and he kept the gun trained on drake who had started to crawl across the floor toward eric an expression of fear working on his face get eric rick said to karen they scooped eric up by the shoulders and feet and began dragging him out of the chamber the gun slipped out of erics hands and hit the floor drake got to his feet and made a mistake instead of going for the door he went for the gun in that split second rick and karen got eric jansen out of the generator room and they slammed the door shut karen saw that it had a simple deadbolt she threw the bolt this left drake locked inside the generator room in the company of a hundred flying microbots and one giant bot the big bot sat on the floor its compound eyes turning left and right its gooseneck waving its turbofan blades shrieking but it couldnt lift off it had become too heavy to fly drake glanced at the big bot then stood up holding the gun rick and karen watched from behind the bulletproof window as drake picked up the bot controller eric had smashed it thoroughly he tossed it away they saw drakes lips moving and heard his voice faintly through the glass let me out rick shook his head drake fired at the window the bullet starred the glass but didnt break it drake walked up close to the window please help me im very sorry a bead of blood appeared hanging at the tip of his nose he backed up a few steps and looked around wildly and swatted at a bot circling his head he cursed and waved his gun around the light beam crisscrossing the chamber he caught a bot in the light and fired the gun at the bot pointing the light around he fired again and again and again drake fired at the bots until the tensor room filled with a haze of cordite smoke then he took his cell phone out of his pocket it was ringing again hello lieutenant would you please come get me ill tell you everything of course im in a bit of trouble in the generator room the generator room in the center of the building bots there are no bots in here dan its perfectly safe the phone slipped out of his bloody fingers and clattered to the floor a nosebleed drenched the front of his shirt drake coughed spraying blood he staggered forward and pressed himself against the window and stared at rick and karen i will have you killed i swear it his eyes went wide and a bead of blood appeared in the corner of his right eye a bot emerged through the white of his eye and began crawling across the surface of drakes eye dragging blood along with it as it crawled drake seemed to be watching the bot as it crossed his cornea get off me he whispered and dug a finger into his eye and stared at his bloody fingertip and screamed then he turned the gun to his head and pulled the trigger nothing happened he had emptied the clip shooting at the bots behind drakes back the giant bot had turned its eyes on drake it advanced upon him dragging its arms its gooseneck lashed out and the blades thrust up through drakes body cavity from below and burst out his chest the bot raised him up shook him on its gooseneck and shrugged slinging the body across the room rick and karen had turned their attention to eric jansen rick tore off his shirt and wrapped it around erics leg to make a compress he took eric under the shoulders and began halfcarrying halfdragging him through the omicron lab he was barely conscious having lost a lot of blood then they heard the humming sound of bots karen felt a stinging sensation on the back of her neck and slapped at it her hand came away bloody rooms contaminated move it rick without thinking she grabbed eric with one hand and tried to sling him over her shoulder but she couldnt do it for a moment she thought whats wrong her superpowers had vanished they managed to drag eric into the hallway and there they were met with a team of police officers running guns drawn wearing body armor just behind came a slightly potbellied plainclothes detective he wore a tactical vest but clearly wasnt a member of the swat team get back rick shouted at them bots i know the detective said calmly he turned to the men get them out quick to karen and rick he said is there anybody else in the building drake hes dead everybody out the detective said the officers bundled rick and karen along and they scoutcarried eric who had lost consciousness the last man out of the building was the detective he came out through the door into the light of dawn a trail of blood streaming from his forehead the bots had found dan watanabe wheres dorothy he called out dorothy girt had arrived in her toyota she came forward you brought your magnet of course she held up the industrial horseshoe magnet she had grabbed it out of the forensic lab on the way over everybody into decon hostages and officers said watanabe as he took off his vest dorothy will decontaminate you an emt squad brought eric into the tent first then loaded him into a medevac helicopter last of all after everybody else had taken their turn lieutenant watanabe walked into the white tent to have dorothy get the bots out of him chapter the pit november am in the tensor generator room the only thing that moved was the gigantic bot it explored the room shoving aside drakes corpse looking for a way out it couldnt find a way out so its program went into the drilling sequence it bent its neck to the floor and using its knives it cut through the plastic floor when it had opened a hole it broke through crashing down into the pit full of electronic gear there the bot continued to cut and chop doing what it knew best groaning rending crackling sounds came from below the floor of the generator room the sounds mixing with blue and yellow flashes of electrical sparks suddenly there was a boiling hiss and a cloud of vapor burst up through the hole in the floor it was the sound and fury of superconducting magnets failing the building shook as the magnetic fields in the generator went chaotic and relaxed as the magnets failed they heated up suddenly and the heat boiled the supercooled liquid helium that surrounded the magnets helium vapor began pouring out of the pit abruptly the lights in the building went outcircuit breakers had tripped meanwhile the giant bot still churned through the guts of drakes machine there was still somebody alive in the nanigen building in the pit while the big bot hacked at machinery a slender man watched he moved slowly carefully no jerky movements nothing to attract the bots attention he removed a hard drive from a rack pulling the data feed tapes out of their snaps he slipped the drive into his jacket and left the pit quickly climbing up a ladder and from there he entered the fire escape tunnel behind him he heard a thump then a roar the bot had started a fire the escape tunnel lined with corrugated metal went horizontally and ended at a ladder dr edward catel the liaison man from the davros consortium climbed the ladder the hard drive in his pocket contained five terabytes of dataall of dr ben rourkes designs for the tensor generator along with priceless engineering data from test runs of the generator when he had put two and two together and decided that vin drake had probably ordered murders of his own employees he realized that drake had become unstable and therefore could no longer serve effectively as a chief executive he had gotten in touch with certain people who for some time had been trying to discover what nanigen was doing and had told them that for a certain price he could get them designs of the generator he had gone into the building that night he hadnt realized drake was in there too now he stopped at the top of the ladder below a hatch and listened what was going on above he heard sirens a helicopter thudding maybe he should wait here for a few hours give things a chance to settle down he felt something wet run down his cheek drip on his collar he reached up to his face yes a bot had gotten into his cheek the escape tunnel had become contaminated he could feel the bot burrowing through the tissues of his cheek it would not be good if the bot entered a major blood vessel it could swim to his brain and start cutting there give him a hemorrhagic stroke he would have to exit and take his chances he pushed open the hatch it led to the middle of a patch of acacia brush by the parking lot a fire truck was parked at the corner but the crews attention was focused on smoke pouring from the building he walked quickly into the underbrush picking at his cheek with his fingertips had to get that bot out he reached into his mouth with two fingers pulled it from the tissues of his cheek and pinched it between his fingernails hard until he felt it crunch he kept walking thorns on the acacias caught at his clothing he went from one empty lot to the next lot and crossed behind a warehouse he emerged from the business park and got on a sidewalk and walked briskly along until he reached a bus stop on the farrington highway and he sat on the bench in the booth morning sun kissed the scene with a golden glow it was a sunday morning the bus might not come for hours hed just have to wait it gave him satisfaction and a sense of safety to be wearing a ripped jacket spotted with blood he smiled he could have been a homeless person and very ill the kind of person nobody wants to look at too closely and he had the hard drive that contained the only complete set of ben rourkes plans for the tensor generator the only plans a dark spot began spreading across the leg of his trousers it was blood this worried him he opened his trousers and felt around on his thigh and got it he held up the bot on the end of his fingertip and squinted at it he could just see the little blades sparkling in the light whither wander thou he murmured to the bot this was quite good he thought he looked like a madman talking to his fingers he was a free agent representing only himself at the moment catel crushed the bot between his nails and wiped his bloody hand on his pants it was like crushing a tick a fire truck rushed past sirens screaming a week later lieutenant dan watanabe adjusted the angle of a laptop screen that sat on a hospital bed table in the bed lay eric jansen the screen showed an image of a bot cut neatly in half with its insides laid open we got an id on the asian john doe i told you about his name was jason chu eric nodded slowly his leg was wrapped in bandages and his face was pale and wan anemia from loss of blood jason chu eric said worked for rexatack the company that owned the patents on the hellstorm drone technology so mr chu organized the burglary of nanigen to try to get information on what nanigen was doing with his companys patents thats right eric answered and you programmed these security bots not to kill anybody drake reprogrammed them to kill he closed his eyes and kept them shut for a while then opened them you can charge me my brother is dead and its my fault i dont care what happens to me you will not be charged at this time watanabe answered carefully a nurse came in visits up she checked erics monitors and said to watanabe can you guys take a hint or do i need to call a doctor im not a guy maam dorothy girt said politely standing up watanabe stood up and said to eric dorothy would really like a functioning nanigen bot to analyze eric shrugged theyre all over the nanigen core area not anymore the place burned to crap all that plastic it took two days to put the fire out there was nothing left no bots we found what we think is drake dental records will tell and that shrink machineits a charcoal briquette are you going to charge anybody eric asked just as watanabe and girt were leaving watanabe stopped in the doorway the perpetrators are dead the das getting pressure not to do any prosecutions the pressures coming fromlets say from government entities who dont want these robots talked about my guess is this thing gets played as an industrial accident his voice took on a note of disappointment but you never know he added and glanced at the forensic scientist its the kind of conundrum dorothy and i like to noodle with dont we i enjoy conundrums dorothy girt said rather primly come along dan the gentleman needs his rest chapter molokai november am the rain over west molokai had passed and the trade wind had grown stronger raking the palm trees along the beach and tearing spray from the surf set back from the water a cluster of tents made of canvas and bamboo thumped and fluttered in the wind the dixie maru ecotent resort had seen better days affordable on a student stipend karen king sat up on the cot and stretched the wind lifted a muslin curtain in the window of the tent revealing a view of the beach the palms an expanse of blue water close to the beach a white explosion burst from the sea karen grabbed rick hutter by the shoulder and shook him a whale rick rick rolled over and opened his eyes where he said drowsily youre not interested yes i am just sleepy he sat up and looked out the window karen admired the muscles across ricks back and shoulders in the lab in cambridge it had never occurred to her that rick might have a decent body under those ratty flannel shirts he liked to wear i dont see anything he said watch maybe itll happen again they observed the sea in silence in the distance across the molokai channel the misty outline of the koolau pali of oahu lay along the horizon the mountain peaks capped with cotton puffs of clouds it was raining on the pali rick put his hand around karens waist she placed her hand over his and squeezed it without warning it happened again first the head and then most of the body of a humpback whale appeared breaching and turning in the air followed by an incredible bomblike splash they watched the sea for a while longer but it was quiet maybe the whale had sounded or moved off rick broke the silence i got a call from that cop lieutenant watanabe what you didnt tell me he says were free to leave hawaii karen snorted theyre hushing it up yeah and we get to go back to boring old cambridge speak for yourself karen said turning to him im not going back to cambridge not now why because im going to find a way backthere the microworld you mean she just smiled but karen thats impossible theres no wayand even if there were youd be crazy to try it he looked at his arms the bruises still hadnt faded completely the microworld kills humans like flies sureevery new world is dangerous but think of all those discoveries she sighed rick im a scientist i have to go there in fact i cant imagine not going into the microworld again the technology existsand you know as well as i do that with technology once a thing is invented it never gets uninvented the bad things too rick agreed exactly killer bots and microdrones are here to stay people will die in terrible new ways terrible wars will be fought with this technology the world will never be the same a gust of wind shook the tent and the canvas flapped against their duffels in the corner what about us rick asked after the wind had died down us yeah you and me i mean he tried to pull her back onto the bed but karen was lost in thought in her minds eye she saw the view from their camping spot on the cliffs of tantalus a mistfilled valley cloaked in green clear waterfalls trailinga lost valley not yet explored or even truly seen by human eyes there has to be she began something had caught her attention a glint of metal flying out of one of the duffels a chill ran through her the memory of bots whirling through the air like insects whatever it was it flew out the window so small it passed right through the holes of the screen it was nothing she thought she turned to rick there has to be a way back
