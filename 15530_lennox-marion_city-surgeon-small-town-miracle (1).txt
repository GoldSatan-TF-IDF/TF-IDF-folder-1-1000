marion lennox sharon archer city surgeon small town miracle city surgeon small town miracle by marion lennox with thanks to the fabulous anne gracie whose friendship means the world to me dear reader sometimes reality meshes with the stories in my head this year a visit to a friend with a passion for ancient tractors was followed by a holiday to coogeeone of sydneys fabulous beaches while we were there the lights went out no power and what was worse no breakfast coffee aagh so while the love of my life tried to read his morning paper in a café so dimly lit i could barely see the table i was forced to sit over cold cereal and think up a story instead the couple at the next table were fussing over their sleeping baby they looked to be older firsttime parents and their love for each other and their joyful adoration of their beautiful daughter shone out despite the gloom thatll do i thought as i sulked over my orange juice i named them max and maggie and their lovely baby rose but theres always an obstacle to a truly great romance and suddenly those tractors sprang to mind sadly thats where my story stopped theres only so much a woman can do without caffeine luckily the power came back on and with it came coffee hooray i thought as i headed home to start chapter one ive fallen in love with maggie and max and rose and tractors i hope you do too happy reading marion chapter one the road was narrow with a sheer cliff face on one side and a steep fallaway to the sea on the other the scenery was fantastic but dr max ashton was in no mood to enjoy the view hed had enough of this bucolic setting hed had enough of holiday all he wanted was to get back to sydney to work and to solitude which wasnt happening anytime soon as he nosed his gorgeous midnightblue sports coupé around the fourth blind bend since town a cattle truck veered around from the opposite direction the small but ancient truck wasnt travelling at speed and neither was he but the road was too narrow to let them both pass the truck jerked sideways into the cliffface and the back of the tray swung out to meet him collision was inevitable and collision was what happened he wasnt hurthis car was too well built for thatbut it took moments to react to the shock to see past his inflated airbags to assess the damage mess he thought grimly but no smoke the cab of the truck didnt look badly damaged and his own car looked bent but not broken hopefully this meant nothing but the hassle of a probably uninsured idiot who didnt know enough to keep rustbuckets off the road but the accident wasnt over yet there was a bang like a minor explosion and the back of the truck jerked sideways a tyre had just decided to burst as he stared out past his airbags the steel crate on the rear of the truck lurched in sympathyand didnt stop it slewed off the truck and crashed sideways down onto the edge of the road it was as if a bucket of legs was suddenly upended a cluster of calves a soft toffee colour with huge eyes white faces and white feet was tumbling out onto the road he couldnt count them for sure they were too entwined the tangle of calves all legs tails and wide scared eyes was scrambling for collective purchase failing and pushing itself further toward the edge of the cliff before max could react the calves disappeared from view and from the cabin of the truck came a womans frantic scream nooo shock and the airbags had kept him still for all of thirty seconds but the scream jolted him out of his stupor he was out of the car before the scream had ended heading for the cab the trucks passenger side was crumpled into the cliff but the drivers side looked okay as he reached it the cab door swung open and a woman staggered out a blur of black and white flashed past her a collie stop them she yelled shoving past him as if he wasnt there bonnie go fetch them back and the black and white blur was gone she was bleeding all he noticed in that first brief glance was a slight figure in faded jeans blood streaming down her face but it was enough he grabbed her arm as she headed past and tugged her towards him she wrenched back fighting to be free but she was small enough that he could stop her he reeled her in against him an armful of distressed woman intent on following her calves over the edge of the cliff let me go she yelled theyre grans calves stop them in answer he held her tighter no matter how bad his weekend had been up to now no matter that this woman had just made it worse he was feeling a certain obligation to stop her selfdestructing youre hurt she was there was blood oozing from a cut on the side of her head and she was staggering as if one of her legs wasnt doing what it was supposed to she was also pregnant seven months or so apart from the pregnancy she looked like a kid scruffy dressed in worn jeans a bloodspattered windcheater and ancient leather boots what else he was doing a lightning assessment as she struggled her carrotred hair was tied roughly into two bright plaits she had a cute snub nose freckles and wide green eyes currently filled with fear she was hurt there was no way he could let her chase calves sit he said and tried to propel her to the edge of the road but she wasnt about to be propelled grans calves she was practically weeping she has to see them beforeplease let me go she made to shove past him again but he wasnt moving not until i see how badly youre injured youve cut your head she swiped blood from her face with her sleeve and glared up at him and he was astonished at the strength of her glare its not arterial she gasped if im bleeding out then im not bleeding in so theres nothing to worry about im not about to drop dead from raised intracranial pressure so let me go too focussed to note her unexpected knowledge max settled for a calm no yes then before he could react she kicked out her boot hit his shin hard he was so astounded he let her go and she was over the cliff like the hounds of hell were after her luckily the cliff wasnt sheer it was a steep incline sloping sharply twenty feet down to the beach so the calveshe could count four now theyd disentangled themselveshadnt fallen they looked essentially unhurt and were heading north along the sand with the collie tearing after them the woman was presumably wanting to tear after them as well and for a fraction of a second he was tempted to let her go that wasnt exactly heroic he thought ruefully neither was it possible she was battered and torn and pregnant and she was heading off to rescue calves that hed been in part responsible for releasing so he groaned and headed down the cliff after her he had no trouble catching up to her but as he reached her she swiped out at him and kept on going she lurched as she put weight on what presumably was an injured leg he grabbed her againand she kicked him again why was he doing this her rustbucket of a truck had caused this mess shed kicked him and her boots packed a painful punch women he thought bitterly since his wifes death hed carefully constructed a solid and impervious armour and once again his desire to retreat behind it came to the fore why worry she could head off after her calves and her dog and he could ring a tow truck and wait for her to come to her senses but she was bleeding and she was pregnant personal choice didnt come into this doctors didnt sign the hippocratic oath anymore but conscience was insidious besides he wasnt at all sure she was bright enough to stop before she passed out from shock or blood loss and an unconscious woman would complicate his life so much he didnt want to think about it so he groaned and headed off again and snagged her just as she hit the beach this time he grabbed her by the back of her jeans she swung back to face him already lashing out but he was ready for her he reeled her in by the waist and swung her up into his arms tugging her so close she couldnt struggle let me go ill bleed on you she snapped and she had a point hed bought this jacket in italy and he liked it ruining it for a woman who didnt have a grain of sense to bless herself with seemed a waste but it was unavoidable go right ahead ill send you the cleaning bill blood doesnt come out of leather no it comes out of torn skin which is why you have to shut up keep still and let me put something on your head to stop the bleeding i can fix it myselfwhen ive got the calves do you have any idea how im going to tell gran where her cows are you could say gran theyre on the beach he said mildly ignoring her struggles and starting to climb the cliff again okay theyre important but your dog seems to have their measure they look unhurt the cliff gets steeper in either direction so my guess is that theyll stay on the beach until you can organise a muster or whatever you do with cows meanwhile my cars in the middle of the road on a blind bend blocking traffic and i dont want whats left of it squashed she glared up at him thats a bit inequitable she said and suddenly he saw a hint of humour in her wide eyes what about my truck ill save your truck too he growled if youll let me thank you she said meekly and abruptly subsided he climbed back up to the road suddenly aware that his own knees werent too steady the airbags had kept him safe but shock was setting in plus hed been kicked almost as he thought it he felt an answering tremor in her body she wasnt as feisty as she was making out he thought or she was hurting more than shed admit or maybe she was feeling guilty im sorry i kicked you she said and to his surprise she put her arms around his neck to hang on it kept them both steadier as they climbed it felt okay too his knees didnt shake as much when she held him it might have been a little inappropriate she conceded especially since i think the accident was my fault im sure it was your fault thats not very gracious she pushed her hair back from her faceher braids were working loosethen looked at her hand in disgust she shrugged and put it back round his neck gross look okay i overreacted yes im bleeding so maybe you could lend me something to make a bandage but then i need to go back down to the beach so i can take care of the calves maybe you could drive to my farm and ask gran to send angus how fars the farm fiveminute drive angus will rescue you angus will rescue the calves sorry he said setting her down on the verge i dont know what fairytales youve been reading but in the ones i read heroes dont put calves before fair maidens im not exactly fair she retorted im red so ive noticed but she was wilting he thought and it worried him so lets stop you getting redder before she could protest he tugged off his bloodstained jacket grabbed the sleeve of his very classy shirtbought in italy at the same time as his jacketand ripped it from the shoulder he folded the linen into a pad placed it over her forehead and applied pressure that was a very nice shirt she said sounding subdued ill send you a bill do heroes say stuff like that i believe i just did he said and grinned and she managed a smile back whoa she was older than hed thoughtand she was a lot more attractive compellingly attractive in fact her smile was just plain gorgeous i can do that she said and put her hands up grabbed his shirtpad and pressed as well as being attractive she was also a lot less stupid than hed first thought he conceded shed talked about raised intracranial pressure did she have medical training no matter she was in no state to practise any medicine right now and he had no time to concentrate on her smile her head was okay for the moment but he stood and looked down at her and thought theres more here than scratches she was trying to make light of her injuries but he recognised pain when he saw it shed been limping one knee of her jeans was shredded and bloodstained though not nearly as dramatically as her face still he bent carefully took the torn part of the leg of her jeans in both hands and ripped it to the ankle hell how had she managed to climb down the cliff how had she stood up at all shed cut her kneeit was bleeding sluggishlybut that was only part of it already it had swollen to almost twice its size there was a massive haematoma building behind yikes she whispered pushing herself up on her elbows to look why did you do that it was better when i couldnt see lets get it elevated he said and mentally wished his jacket farewell he folded it then wedged it under her bloodied knee a spare tyre had spilled from the cattle crate he put that under her feet so her legs were raised on an incline as well she needed xrays both leg and head he thought no matter what she said he wasnt about to let her die of an intracranial bleed just because she was stubborn and there was also the biggie the baby might have suffered a blow and even if it was okay the impact could cause problems with the placenta she needed an ultrasound and bedrest and observation her baby needed attention that meant he needed to hand her over and get away fast we need an ambulance he told her tugging his cellphone from his pocket you need xrays you can give that up as a joke she said wearily even if there was reception out herewhich there isntyoure looking at yandilagongs only ambulance right here sorry its not usually the truck i have a decentsized estate wagon only it blew the radiator hose this morning what are you talking about my trucks the local ambulance until i can get a new radiator hose she said patiently as if talking to someone who wasnt very bright and theres not one to be had locally for love or money ill get one from gosland tomorrowif i can leave gran for that long theres no ambulance he didnt have time for the extra information she was throwing at him he needed to ignore what wasnt making sense and concentrate on essentials why not you try attracting medical staff or funding for decent equipment to a place as remote as this she said bitterly this weekend therell be a couple of firstaiders with the music festival but thats all the help i have if i cant get an ambulance from other areas then i use my own vehicle to take patients to gosland thats our nearest hospital about an hour away theres basic stuff here like an xray machine but thats in town and getting through the crush of the festival isnt going to happen but it doesnt matter she said resolutely id like to check my babys heartbeat but im sure im fine i just need to get home to gran its gran whos the emergency and she doesnt need an ambulance she needs me was she some kind of volunteer paramedic this was sounding crazier and crazier he turned away and surreptitiously checked his phone sure enough no reception okay he conceded no ambulance whats your name he asked trying to figure where to start maggie were wasting time how pregnant are you thirtytwo weeks and all of a sudden there was a quaver in her voice hes okay can you feel him even asking that hurt he thought hell hed lost his son six years ago would he ever get over it luckily shed only heard his professional question yes but there was still the quaver hes kicking good kicking was good but as maggie had said he needed to check the heartbeat he wanted a stethoscope add it to the list he thought grimly ambulance xrays stethoscope ultrasound a medical team to take over while he walked away it wasnt going to happen meanwhile there was the small problem of the mess blocking the road if someone else comes round this bend he said trying to figure out priorities its not used much she told him but theres the odd outoftowner stupid enough to try and get to the highway this way gee thanks she winced sorry yes that was rude but we do need to clear the road she stared across at the mess youll need help pulling the crate out of the way hang on and she put her hands onto the ground to push herself up no he was down beside her in an instant taking a shoulder in each hand and pressing back and his preconceptions were changing all over the place at first hed thought she was little more than a teenager like the young mothers he saw clustered outside the prenatal clinics near his consulting suite in the hospital he worked in they were mostly scared kids forced by pregnancy into growing up too fast but the more he saw of this woman the more he acknowledged maturity there were lines etched around her eyessmile lines that had taken time to grow and more life lines she looked like a woman whod seen a lot he thought suddenly she wasnt beautifulnot in the traditional senseand yet the eyes that met his as he pushed her back down onto the verge were clear and bright and almost luminous they were eyes to make a man take another look and then another hey let me up she ordered as if sensing the inappropriate direction his thoughts were taking and he came to with a snap you want that leg to swell so far i have to lance it to take the pressure off her eyes widened what the youre bleeding into the back of your knee he said if it gets any worse youll have circulation problems i want it xrayed and like you im worrying about the baby you need an ultrasound youre a doctor her voice was incredulous for my pains well how about that she whispered sounding awed a doctor and a bossy one at that a surgeon ill bet sort of but theyre the worst look if i promise to sign insurance indemnity can i get up no the crate ill move the truck you and whose army just shut up for a minute he said irritated and there was her smile again yes doctor the words were submissive but the smile wasnt it was a cute smile cheeky pert flashing out despite her fear youre a nurse he demanded suspicious no doctor she said still submissive still smiling though there was no way she could completely disguise the look of pain and fear behind her eyes but you need to let me help in your dreams he growled disarmed by her smile and struggling to keep a hold on the situation worstcase scenarioshe could go into labour or she could lose the baby another death he needed a medical kit usually he carried basic firstaid equipment but his friends luggage had filled the trunk and the back seat fiona and brenda no medicine this weekend theyd said and theyd meant it women and here was another causing trouble but actually maggie wasnt causing trouble he conceded or no more than she could help she looked like there was no way shed complain but he could see the strain in her eyes okay he told himself move this woman needs help and theres only me to give it i meant what i said about keeping still he told her i have work to do and youll just get in the way so stay yes sir she said meekly but he didnt believe the meekness for a minute there wasnt a lot of choice in truth maggies leg hurt so much she was feeling dizzy she lay back on the grass and tried not to think about the consequences of what had just happened and how it might have affected her baby that was truly terrifying she tried not to think how gran would be needing pain relief and how shed been away from home for far too long she thought about how her leg felt like it might drop off and that she wouldnt mind if it did if this guy really was a doctor he might have something in the back of his fancy car thatd help he really was a doctor he had about him an air of authority and intelligence that she knew instinctively was genuine he was youngishmidthirties she guessedbut if she had to guess further shed say he was in a position of power in his profession hed be past the handson stage with patientsto a point in his profession where seniority meant he could move back from the personal she wasnt a bad judge of character this guy seemed competentand he was also seriously attractive yeah even in pain shed noticed that for what woman wouldnt he was tall dark and dropdead gorgeous but also he seemed instinctively aloof why but this was hardly the time for personal assessments of goodlooking doctors the pain in her leg stabbed upward and she switched to thinking what the goodlooking doctor might have in the back of his car that might help what could she take this far along in pregnancy her hands automatically clasped her belly and she flinched no we need to get through this without drugs she whispered to her bump just hang in there there was an answering flutter from inside and her tension eased slightly the seat belt had pulled tight across her stomach in the crash thered been an initial flutter but she wanted more this flutter was stronger and as she took a deep breath the flutter became a kick great maybe her baby hadnt noticed the crash or if he had he was kicking in indignation well be okay she whispered for what must be the thousandth time in her pregnancy me and you and the world and she had a doctor at hand a gorgeous one but gorgeous or not doctor or not the guy had no time for medicine right now and her training had her agreeing with him triage told her that unless her breathing was impaired or she was bleeding to death the road had to be cleared someone could speed around the corner at any minute and a minor accident could become appalling but how could he move the crate it was blocking the road in such a way it stopped both the car and the truck from being moved he couldnt lift it he didnt as she watched he put his shoulder against it shoving harder than shed thought possible the crate was about eight feet long by six feet wide iron webbing built around a floor of heavy iron it had been on the back of the truck for the last twenty years shed had no idea it could come loose gran hadnt told her that there were lots of things gran hadnt told her she thought grimly a long litany of deception in fact maggies decision to have this baby had been based partly on grans deceit but there was no way she could yell at gran now in truth she was so worried about the old lady she felt sick what else she wanted to cry because her leg was throbbing she desperately needed to check on her babys heartbeat but instead she was lying still as ordered her leg stuck up in front of her watching this bossy surgeon shift her crate if she had to have an arrogant surgeon bossing her while he organised her life at least shed been sent one whose body was almost enough to distract her from the pain she was feeling when shed first seen him hed looked smoothly handsome expensive now his perfectly groomed jetblack hair was wet with sweat dark curls clinging to his forehead a trace of fiveoclock shadow accentuated his strongly boned face and his dark eyes were keen with the intent of strain he also looked gorgeous it was an entirely inappropriate thought she decided but it was there whether she willed it or not this man was definite eyecandy he had all his weight against the crate now he was grunting with effort sweat glistening one of his arms was barecourtesy of the pad she was holding above her eyeand his arm was a mass of sinews as was his chest the more he sweated the more his shirt became a damp and transparent nothing exposing serious muscles and the more he sweated the more she was distracted from everything she should be focussed on this was crazy she was seven months pregnant she was injured she had so many worries her head was about to explode yet here she was transfixed by the sight of a colleague attempting to move a weight far too big for one man only it wasnt the crate was moving an inch at a time and then faster and then he found rhythm he was right behind it and he kept on pushing right up to the verge the verge was too narrow to hold it she should have been thinking forward to what he intended but she was caught watching him fascinated move he gave one last gigantic heaveand it slid onto the verge and further before she realised what was happening the crate was toppling over the side of the cliff crashing its way down to the beach below leaving her stunned so how do you suggest i get the calves home now she muttered awed but he wasnt listening he was in her truck already shoving it into gear reversing it from the cliff face it sounded like something disastrous was happening inside the engine but at least it moved he drove it further along the road parked it on a widened section of verge then jogged back for his car she was a passive audience stunned by his body and by his energy and byhis car shed never seen an aston martin up close before not bad she conceded growing more distracted by the moment surgeon in opentopped roadster cool orhot or maybe the blow to her head was making her thinking fuzzy she should be too caught up with the pain in her knee to react likewell like she was reacting but then as he turned his fabulous car away from her suddenly her fuzziness disappeared it was replaced with a stab of panic so great it took her breath away hed backed away from the cliff turning the car to head north north toward sydney she was staggering to her feet her hands out rushing straight forward so he had to slam his brakes on or she would have run right into him as it was he stopped with barely an inch to spare she put her hand on the bonnet and tried to regroup tried to think of some way to say that this was panic she hadnt really thought hed leave she was being hysterical insulting but she had no breath to say it she could only lean on his car and gasp and then he was out of the car taking her hands tugging her toward him he looked shocked to the core as well he might be crazy woman runs straight into path of car she had to explain ii cant leave gran she stammered you have to take me home you must you cant leave me here she could hardly breathe through fright he swore and held her and then as she couldnt stop trembling he held her tighter hey maggie im not leaving he said sounding appalled i swear im not that big a rat i was just turning the car away from the bend so its safe for you to get in and then as she tried desperately to think how to respond and could only think that her leg hurt and she was close to tears and she could have killed her baby by running into a car of all things how could she have been so stupid he swore again tugged her even tighter into his arms and held her close its okay he whispered into her hair i wont leave you youre safe ill take you back to gran whoever gran is ill do whatever we have to do well do it together his chin was resting on her hair hed assumed shed realise he was just moving the car that he had no intention of leaving her but why would she assume anything he was a stranger up until now it had been all about him he thought savage with himself sure hed reacted to her injuries but hed reacted as if she was a patient in emergency where he was one of a team the surgeon doing his job without looking at the whole picture but here he had to see the whole picture she had no obvious lifethreatening wounds but she was hurt she was shocked and she was pregnant her truck was a writeoff and without a working cellphone she was stranded hed climbed into his fancy car and turned away probably making it clear by his body language he wanted to be shot of her her reactionthat he was about to leavewas so understandable he felt ill so he held her close and waited until her racing heartbeat eased until he felt the rigid terror go out of her finally he felt her body soften mould into his take comfort from his hold it wasnt exactly professional to hold her like this but who was worrying hed been shocked too if it felt good to hold onto this woman then so be it he could take comfort as well as give it and it felt good different hed hardly touched a woman for six years he hadnt wanted to now slipping into the edges of shock and concern and the need for professional care came something else desire surely not there was no way he could desire this woman for she was everything he most wanted to avoid to feel like this within moments of meeting her was crazy but there was no escaping the way touching her made him feel there was no avoiding the way his body was responding her body was soft yielding against him her hair was naturally curly and her curls were escaping their braids her hair was really cute really soft nice and thenpow the thump between them was such a surprise it drove them apart they stood at arms length staring at each other in astonishment then staring down im sso she stammered im so ssorry i dont think its you who needs to apologise for that one he growled the sensation of her baby had slammed the need for sense into his head and he took a step back literally as well as emotionally what the hell had he been thinking caring for a pregnant womanno and no and no her wide green eyes stared up at him and then down at her still heaving bump hes got a good kick she ventured cautiously he surely has new emotions were surging in now and his head was scrambling to reassemble his emotional armour how long since hed felt a babys kick it made him feel no dont even think about going there maybe its to reassure us hes okay he managed feeling lame dredging up a smile maybe she said and wobbled a smile in return and then that was unforgivable she said thinking you were leaving i hadnt told you otherwise im sorry but consider me kicked by archibald really he found himself smiling properly this time caught by her fierce determination to apologise and her equal determination to insert humour into the situation this was one brave woman the sensations he was feeling toward her were inappropriate but clinical approval was fine youve decided on his name already he knocked my mug of tea over last week she said darkly i had to run cold water over my tummy for ten minutes until i stopped stinging until then she was going to be chloe or he was going to be william but thats in the past archibald it is named for the babys father then he said still striving to sound professional he smiled again but it was her turn for her smile to fade his father would be william but archibald takes precedence he was still holding her by both hands but now she made to pull away as if naming the babys father had brought her to her senses both of them had to come to their senses look i am sorry she whispered and im sorry too he said so lets stop apologising and get things moving i need to take you to hospital im not going to hospital but i do need to get back to grans its not far if i hadnt hurt my leg i could walk yes suddenly things seemed simple this wasnt his problem he could take her to her family and explain the need for hospital assessment shed said gran was ill but where there was a gran surely thered be other relatives he could hand her over with instructions to take her to the nearest hospital and his nightmare of a weekend would be over the calves wont go anywhere she said thinking out loud with bonnies help angus can drive them home by foot from here hooray for angus he thought and william and gran a whole family better and better but she was wilting and he was wasting time okay he said and ignoring protests he lifted her across to his car blessing the fact that the aston martin had a rear seat once again though he was surprised at how little she weighed were things okay was this a normal pregnancy this was not his problem he reminded himself sharply he needed to cope with the emergency stuff only shed have her own obstetrician her family could take her there stay professional and stay clinically detached but as he lifted her into the car he smelled a faint citrusy perfume and he was caught once again in a totally unprofessional moment her luminous green eyes were framed by long dark lashes surely unusual in a redhead her freckles were amazingly cute her flamecoloured curls were still doing their best to break out of their braids and he had an almost irrational desire to help them escape whoa what was it with him he was being dumb and irrational and stupid this was his patient therefore he could stop thinking dumb thoughts about how she smelled and how she felt against him and how her hair would look unbraided so turn professional lets do formal introductions he said trying to sound like he was about to key it into her patient history can you tell me your full name maggie maria croft you maxwell harvey ashton dr ashton max is fine well forget the harvey and im hoping we dont need the doctor but if necessary he hesitated but it had to be said if your family cant take you ill drive you to the hospital at goslandor even to sydney if you prefer thank you she said courteously but firmly but it wont be necessary if you can just take me back to the farm i can sort this mess out by myself chapter two so five minutes later he turned into the farm gateand found himself staring at a graveyard a tractor graveyard the driveway from the road to the house was a long avenue of gumtrees and underneath their canopies old tractors were lined up like sentinels there were tractors from every era looking like they dated from the dark ages wow he breathed and involuntarily slowed to take a better look some of the tractors looked like they could be driven right now if he had the right crank and didnt mind using it some were a wheel or two short of perfect some were simply skeletons a piece of superstructure like a body without limbs william likes tractors he ventured gran and angus like tractors gran bought her first one when she was fifteen i believe she swapped her party dress for it the tractor didnt work then it doesnt work now but she still thinks it was a bargain she sounds a character you could say that she said morosely or pig stubborn depending on how you look at it he glanced into the rearview mirror and saw a wash of bleakness cross her facedesolation that could have nothing to do with the accident and her expression caught something deep within him for a fraction of a second he had an almost irresistible urge to stop the car so he could touch her comfort her it took strength to keep his hands on the steeringwheel to keep on driving he did not do personal involvement he told himself fiercely confused by his totally inappropriate reaction this woman was married and pregnant and he hadnt felt this way about a woman since alice died had he hit his head in the crash was he out of his mind theyd reached the end of the driveway now and he pulled up beside an old estate wagon with its bonnet up the car with the damaged radiator hose he focussed on that something practical and something that didnt make his heart twist so thats your wagon is there something else you can use to drive to hospital whats wrong with tractors she demanded and he caught a glimmer of a rueful smile in the rearview mirror once again he had that kick of emotional reaction this lady had courage and humour and something more ill be fine she told him seemingly unaware of the effect her smile had on him thanks for driving me home ill give you my licence details and our insurance companies can take it from here so that was that he was dismissed he could retreat back to sydney which was what until an hour ago hed been desperate to do it seemed to max that yandilagong was about as far from civilisation as it was possible to get without launching himself off the new south wales coast and swimming for new zealand not for the first time he wondered what hed been thinking to let his friendsa cohort of careeroriented medicostalk him into coming itll be fun theyd told him music festivals are all the rage and this one has a great lineup since hed moved to australia hed been asked to many hospital social events but each time hed refused since alices death hed immersed himself in his work to the exclusion of almost everything else now his surgical list was growing to the point where the pressure had become ridiculous more and more patients were queuing and his teaching commitments were increasing exponentially last week working out in the hospital gym in the small hours trying to get himself so physically tired that sleep would come hed realised he was reaching breaking point so hed accepted but what neither he nor his colleagues had realised was that the festival was a family event there were mums dads and kids young women holding babies grandmas bossing grandkids dads teaching kids to dance his friends men and women who were truly married to their career paths were appalled were so lucky not to be stuck with that theyd declared more than once hicksville familyville whod want it he didnt of course he didnt so why had it hurt to hear them say it then this afternoon theyd announced they were bored with music and children so theyd organised a tour of a local winery hed spent a couple of hours listening to his friends gravely pontificate about ash and oak and hints of elderberry and how wonderful it was to be away from the sound of children and how the advertisers should be sued for not letting ticket buyers know how many childrens events thered be and then his anaesthetist had rung from sydney a woman was being flown in from outback new south wales with complications from a hysterectomy when was he coming back his registrar could cope he knew he could but the choice was suddenly obvious hed left feeling nothing but relief for six years hed been alone and that was the way he liked it he wanted to be alone now but instead he was parked in a tractor graveyard while a sevenmonthspregnant woman was struggling to get out of his car wishes aside he couldnt leave her not before hed handed her over to someone responsible whos here gran but shes ill yes so wheres william he asked knowing it was a loaded question but hoping thered be a solid answer william was my husband she said flatly hes dead dead he felt like hed been punched dead hence the bleakness hell not recently you dont need to say youre sorry recent enough he thought looking at her very pregnant tummy alice had been dead for six years yet still well there was a crazy thing to think make this all about you he told himself or not so whos angus williams uncle how old sixty this was better hell look after you hell enjoy the challenge of getting the calves up to the house bonnies his dog any minute now hell be here to demand what ive done with her so thank you dr ashton ill be right from here he was dismissed for the last fortyeight hours all hed wanted to do was get out of yandilagong he still did but he needed to see how competent this angus person was and how forceful for all maggie was struggling to pull herself from the car she was looking paler and paler placental bleeding the two words had been playing in his head for half an hour now and they werent going away he might not have done anything closely related to obstetrics for six years but the training was there and he knew what a strain a car crash could put on a placenta archibald had kicked him that was a good sign but he needed more he wanted to listen to the babys heartbeat and then he wanted maggie in hospital under observation and that bleak look on her face was etched into his mind he couldnt leave her and even if he couldstill there was that tug he didnt understand youre not walking he growled and before she could resist hed lifted her up into his arms again he strode up through a garden that smelled of oldfashioned roses where honeysuckle and jasmine fought for smell space as well where tiny honeyeaters flitted from bush to bush and where noisy rosella parrots swooped in random raids to the banksias around the edge the garden looked neglected and overgrown but beautiful the farmhouse itself was looking a bit down at the heel in want of a good coat of paint and a few nails but big and welcoming and homely once again there was that wrench of something inside him like coming home which was clearly ridiculous this was like no home hed ever known hed reached the top of the veranda steps and as he paused she wriggled out of his hold and was on her feet before he realised what she was about thank you she said breathlessly soundingscared i can take it from here scared was she feeling what he was feeling he didnt know what he was feeling not unless theres someone through that door to give you a strong cup of tea then carry you out to a nice safe nontractortype car and get you to hospital he said making his voice stern can you tell me that even though she was standing he was blocking her way through the door i cant she admitted but i dont have a choice please i cant leave gran then i cant leave you neither he realised bluntly did he want to maggie is that you the high querulous voice came from inside and without waiting for permission max pushed it open the first thing he saw as he opened the door was a vast open fireplace filled with glowing embers a burgundy blue and gold carpet faded but magnificent great squashy settees and a mantel with two ornate vases loaded with roses from the garden and jasmine and honeysuckle the room was an extension of the garden and the perfume was fabulous then as his eyes became accustomed to the different light he saw gran she was a tiny wizened woman bundled in blankets on the settee looking toward the door with obvious anxiety im okay gran maggie said urgently from behind him and made to push past but she stumbled on her bad leg he caught her and held her against him and she didnt fight but suddenly gran was lurching to the hearth to grab the poker she turned toward him but then fell back on her pillows waving the poker fright and feistiness fighting for supremacy let her go her voice came out as a terrified rasp and he felt maggie flinch and struggle again to get free the two settees in the living room were opposite each other forming a corridor to the fire he ignored the pokerthere wasnt a lot of threat when gran didnt seem to be able to standand moved to set maggie down grans head and the poker were at the fire end he set maggie the opposite way so the poker was away from his head hes helping gran put the poker down maggie muttered and he felt her tension ease a little she was back in familiar territory now even if it was did seem crazy territory a tractor museum roses roses and more roses and a pokerwaving gran whats he doing here hes dr ashton maggie said flinching as she moved her leg a doctor imagine that right when we need him there was a lot to ignore in that statement too he released her onto the cushions aware once again of that weird stab of a sensation he didnt understand something that had nothing to do with a doctorpatient relationship something that had to be ignored at all costs you do need a doctor but not me he growled moving instinctively to load more logs from the woodbox to the fire thankfully gran kept her poker hand to herself maggie you need hospital i dont your baby needs to be checked i cant leave gran ill put my stethoscope on my tummy and lie here and listen to him she said thats all i can do you have a stethoscope he demanded while the old lady rubbed her poker longingly like she might still need it yes youre a nurse im a doctor a doctor they dont all come in white coats she said bitterly or aston martins and gorgeous leather jackets maggie tell me whats going on gran was trying again to heave herself to a sitting position gasping as if breathing hurt and the fear was still in her voice dr ashton crashed into our truck the calves gran said in horror but max was playing triage in his head and calves were somewhere near the bottom maggie was a doctor a doctor the personal side of him wanted to take that aside and think it through for all sorts of reasons he didnt fully understand but the professional side of him had work to do and wasnt giving him time to consider so youre a doctor he managed and you have a stethoscope the calves are okay gran maggie said seeming to ignore him bonnies looking after them then she turned back to him yes theres a whole medical kit in the back of the wagon enough to cope with anything from typhoid to snakebite she winced again and lay back on the cushions her hands instinctively returning to her belly and yes id appreciate it if you could get my stethoscope he stared at her and she stared back defiance and fear mixed ill take you both to hospital he said over my dead body the old lady said from the other settee mrs croft im betty she snapped betty then he said and softened his tone im not sure whats wrong with you im dying so are we all he said without changing his tone if she wanted histrionics she wasnt going to get them from him some faster than others i gather youre ill and im sorry i also know that your granddaughter maggies my granddaughterinlaw your granddaughterinlaw then he said evenly glancing back at maggie and knowing he was right maggies been in an accident and her baby needs to be checked if the placentas damaged there could be internal bleeding the only way she can be checked is to have an ultrasound if she doesnt have that ultrasound the baby could die and she could be in trouble herself betty im sorry that youre ill but its true im a doctor and i have to sort priorities is it right that we risk maggies babys life because you wont go to hospital were not risking maggie said and he turned back to face her he had to ignore emotion here and speak the truth if you really are a doctor you know that you really are putting your baby at risk she was torn he could see ithe saw fear behind her eyes and he knew that she was desperately trying to hide it why we dont have time to mess around he said i should have insisted at the start i can do an ultrasound she said what here not on myself her voice was suddenly pleading but theres everything we need in my car i know its asking a lot but if you could helpgran doesnt want to go to hospital and neither do i if i must for my babys safety then of course i will but theres angus as well and hell be so afraid so please max can you do an ultrasound on me here and reassure me that things are okay why will angus be afraid angus is my son and hes disabled gran whispered as maggie fell silent he has aspergers syndrome hes nothes not able to cope with people itd kill angus to leave the farm hes the reason i made maggie come here shes promised me shell stay and she wont break that promise shes a good girl our maggie my baby comes first maggie muttered looking trapped and once again he caught that look of utter desolation yes but hell be okay and youll both look after angus and the farm gran said i know you wont leave youll keep your word i know youll stay here for ever chapter three this was crazy worse than crazy it was dangerous no she wouldnt leave gran and the unknown angus but maybe his responsibility was to pick both women up and take them to hospital regardless but hed have to chain gran into the car he thought ruefully plus he didnt know what facilities gosland hospital had and the long drive to sydney was the last thing either of them needed but caring for an injured pregnant woman at home and for him personally to have to check her baby max was out on the back veranda supposedly on his way to fetch maggies gear from the back of her wagon hed taken a moment to phone anton his anaesthetist to tell him that their morethancompetent registrar would be needed for the woman coming in with the hysterectomy complications now he was staring down at the river winding down to the sea taking a second to catch his breath and his thoughts maggie would agree to hospital if there was a real threat to her baby he knew it the moment hed laid it on the linethat they were risking the babys deathhe could tell that both women would finally agree to go only there was such despair in the old ladys eyes and such a sense of defeat and fear on maggies face that hed agreed to help them stay so all he had to do now was to find maggies ultrasound equipment and turn into an obstetrician again no checking one baby didnt make an obstetrician he wasnt even delivering a baby he was simply checking it was healthy before heading back to the city to his very successful gynaecological practicethe surgery he was good at and that he could do without the emotional investment every pregnant woman seemed to demand of him the need to care not that he didnt care about his patients he did he gave excellent service making the lives of the women who came to him much more comfortable he was even saving lives he just didnt do babies anymore except this one this was insane he should refuse to have anything to do with it yetthe way she looked at him it was the craziest of reasons and yet he couldnt let it go she looked as trapped as he felt more he didnt know what was at stake here he shouldnt want to know he reminded himself do not get personally involved stay professional he told himself harshly find the ultrasound equipment make sure things are okay and then leave an ultrasound was no big deal it wasnt like she was expecting him to deliver the baby that was really when hed run a mile is he really a doctor he says he is and he knows all the right words the open fire was wonderful the room was warm but maggie was still shivering reaction she thought nothing more it couldnt be anything like internal shockcaused by a bleed say from a torn placenta she had to fight the fear but what was keeping him she had a sudden vision of max in his beautiful car heading back to sydney and she felt ill but she wasnt running after him this time she trusted him she had no choice where are my calves gran said fretfully the crate slid off the back of the truck the calves ended up on the beach bonnies watching over them are you sure theyre okay theyre fine hopefully they were how do you know of all the irresponsibleyou only had to bring four calves less than ten miles the old ladys voice was querulous and maggie looked at her sharply how bads the pain scale of one to ten three betty eight then she said goaded you have to let me put up a syringe driver with a permanent syringe morphine could be delivered continuously so there wasnt this fourhourly cycle of pain relief sleep pain that betty was suffering but so far betty had resisted shed insisted on control at every stage of this illness and she wasnt letting go now ill take a pill in a few minutes take one now no take two when i see our babys okay betty said roughly oh my dear itll be fine maggie hauled herself around and stretched her hand out to her bettys hand was thin and cold and it trembled probably hers did too maggie thought things were going from bad to worse hurry up the man with the ultrasound max a doctor for her baby and more max hed carried her and hed made her feel cared for the remembered sensation was insidiousalmost treacherous it undermined her independence stupidly it made her want to cry max he opened the back of the wagon expecting to see a basic medical kitor even no kit at all because he still hardly believed she was a doctorbut what he saw was amazing the equipment carefully stored sorted and readily accessible was state of the art what had she said back at the crash site she was the ambulance maybe she was for in the centre of the shelves of equipment lay a stretcher it had been fitted to custombuilt rails with wheeled legs folded underneath it was narrow but otherwise there was little difference to the stretcher trolleys used at his city teaching hospital the ultrasound equipment was impossible to miss for it was in a red case labelled ultrasound useful for a doctor in a crisis he thought to be able to say to an onlooker fetch me the red case with this label and the cases were stacked and fastened against the sides in such a way that in a crisis they could be pulled out fast he had a sudden vision of an emergencymaybe a child with breathing problems with this setup maggie could haul out the side cases fast then have someone else drive while she worked on the patient until they reached help basic but effective she was efficient then this dr maggie he needed to be as well he tugged the ultrasound case grabbed another case labelled painanaestheticand then thinking of the strain on the old ladys face and the wheeze behind her voice he grabbed an oxygen canister as well okay doctor with equipment they dropped their linked hands as he walked back into the room up until now hed seen only an underlying tension but there was now an obvious tie between the women emotional as well as physical was the old lady really dying he gave himself time to look at herreally look she was dreadfully gaunt as though eating had long ceased to be a priority and her face was taut with pain and her eyeshed seen that look before turning inward betty needs a shot of morphine maggie said before he could say anything please ten milligrams youll find everything in my bag the baby one injections not going to take time betty needs it badly diagnosis he said watching betty now and talking directly to the elderly woman bone metastases betty whispered ovarian cancer ten years back i knew itd get me in the end is maggie your treating doctor now im not in hospital she is betty said fretfully but look after her im fine but max was already flipping open the case drawing up the injection aware both women were watching him like two hawks with a mouse between them or two mice with a hawk you agree to this he said watching bettys face feeling maggies tension behind him yes betty whispered please he injected the morphine feeling her pulse as he did so faint irregular if she was forty hed be roaring for help he thought bullying her into hospital pulling out all stops to help her but her body language told him she knew exactly what was happening he placed pressure on the injection site for a moment and her hand lifted to his and held thank you she whispered and closed her eyes now maggie now maggie he agreed and maggie nodded and pointed to a power plug behind the couch we can do it here you dont want to be private i doubt ill shock betty by showing a bit of skin maggie said smiling wryly and its warm in here she shivered as she said it he didnt comment thoughshed know as well as he did that shock would be causing her to shiver and internal bleeding please not youve used one of these before she asked him not a portable one nothing to it she said and there wasnt in moments he had it organised set up on a side table right by maggies abdomen she was wearing jeans with an elasticised waist and a sloppy windcheater that could easily be pulled up he rubbed the stethoscope in his hands to take away the chill then knelt beside her as she tugged up her windcheater he glanced up at her and once again saw the flash of fear he should take her blood pressure first he thought and check her pulse but he had a feeling theyd be high and racing until he gave her the reassurance she needed was she shivering from shock or shivering from fear probably the latter so he placed the stethoscope over her tummy and listened and heard what is it she whispered and he glanced up and realised his emotions were showing in his face how many years since hed done this and the last baby hed heard its fantastic he said but he said it too fast and saw doubt remain try as he may he couldnt get his face in order as an alternative he put an arm around her shoulders propped her up and handed the stethoscope to her she listened and her face relaxed as it should and strangely he found himself relaxing as well in a way that had nothing to do with the sound of a strong babys heartbeat he was holding her feeling the tension ease feeling her body relax into his just like no you looked like there was something wrong maggie whispered nothings wrong then why no reason lets move on with this ultrasound he said more roughly than hed intended and she nodded and lay back on her cushions and looked at him directly do you need me to tell you how to work this im fine but okay truth time maggie im not a general surgeon he told her it went against the grain to admit it but he was up to his ears in this mess alreadyhe may as well commit the whole way im a gynaecologist a gynaecologist she said stunned yes im in charge of surgical gynaecology at sydney south he smiled wryly and glanced across at betty if bettys ovarian cancer had been diagnosed now rather than ten years back maybe id be able to help her its what im good at he was searching for gel laying out what he needed she was staring at him as if hed just grown two heads a surgical gynaecologist she muttered awed and then you dont get to be a gynaecologist in this country without being an obstetrician as well im english but yes thats right ive done the training youre a baby doctor hed thought betty had drifted into sleep as the morphine took effect but now the old ladys eyes flew open we so need a baby doctor she whispered im not a baby doctor he said more roughly than hed intended i work with women with gynaecological problems surgical problems but betty was no longer listening instead she was smiling that was the only thing missing she said now we have everything we need oh maggie dont you dare give up maggie said sounding fearful and betty tried a feeble wave but didnt have the strength to pull it off she closed her eyes you just concentrate on our baby she said on williams son okay max said trying not to sound grim as he saw the colour drain from bettys face the more he saw what was happening to betty the less he liked it but he needed to focus on maggie lets get some gel on you and have a look he rubbed gel on her bulge maggie closed her eyes yes she was desperately anxious about the outcome of this ultrasound but she was so tired if she could just sink into her cushions and sleep for twentyfour hours thats exactly what shed do there was not a snowballs chance in a bushfire of that happening where was angus and how was she going to cope with her patients with the farm with gran with an injured leg she couldnt shed hoped shed have another few weeks to work before the baby was born but now with her leg hurting as much as it did and with betty dying and and as if on cue the doorbell pealed she tried really hard not to groan max was about to place the paddle on her tummy he paused and looked questioningly at her theyll keep knocking till we answer she said and tried to sit up they itll be a patient the locals know where i live i need to answer youre not going anywhere he said sounding appalled she could think such a thing he placed his hands firmly on her shoulders and pushed her back on the cushions which she had to admit felt excellent this man was taking charge even if it was only for a moment itd do she conceded there were too many worries to fit in her head hed carried her hed cared for gran he was caring for her so soak it in she could lie back and imagine that this arrogant bossy doctor could take all her worries away hed check her baby tell her everything was fine make sure betty was pain free reassure angus fix whoever was at the door fix her world yeah and pigs might fly but meanwhile hed said she wasnt going anywhere and he meant it she let herself relax against her cushions she didnt quite close her eyes but she almost did if she shut her eyes the world might disappear she wasnt quite ready for that she conceded not yet disappearing worlds were for betty but she wouldnt mind if ninety per cent of hers went away he was wasting time the ultrasound was becoming urgent he had to get to the door tell whoever it was to wait and get back to his patient to maggie but when he tugged the door wide he found a deputation mother father a scrawny little boy clinging to the mothers jeans and a baby the babys got a cold the man said quickly as if he was worried the door might be slammed in his face weve all had it but shes been bad all day and then she went limp she looks okay now but the missus got scared so i said well stick her in the car and bring her here can doc have a look this was a nightmare he should tell them to go away but maggie had said she was the ambulance was she also the only local doctor these people looked terrified for good reason he glanced down and saw the tiny child was swaddled in so much wool he could barely see her how long was she limp he asked only for a moment the man said ben here and me were watching telly while cathy was feeding her in the bedroom cathy screamed but by the time i got there she was okay again but cathys that scared said she looked awful we wrapped her up and brought her straight to doc maggie okay unwrap her max said tersely fast he turned back to the living room calling to maggie wheres your bathroom shall i come maggie called stay where you are he growled the last thing maggie needed was crossinfection and she had to stay still bathroom he demanded again door on the right of the hall she called sounding bewildered he glanced again at the baby touched her face lightly with the back of his hand felt how hot she was and knew he was right you go in there he told the frightened parents strip off all her clothes and pop her into a tepid bath tepid not cold but not warm either shes running a fever im guessing shes had a febrile convulsion and she needs to get cool in a hurry youre to keep her in the bath and keep her cool until i come back i have an emergency in the other room but doc the man said we want doc maggie doc maggies the emergency he snapped im a doctor too and im all there is i need to take care of her how do we know youre a doctor the man said fear and belligerence mixed we want maggie pete the woman said and shed peered past max into the living room seen what was there maggies pregnant if anything happens to maggie the whole communitys in trouble just thank god theres another doctor shut up and do what he says betty was asleep maggie was still slumped against the cushions looking anxious and exhausted and pale febrile convulsion she queried im assuming so he told her but ill check her when your babys been checked he was worrying in earnest now she was looking too shocked too pale if hed messed around this long and she was bleedinglie back and let me see so she did and in the middle of chaos there was suddenly peace there was no way to rush an ultrasound there could be no urgency about it he smoothed the gel over her tummy settled the paddle and started moving it with care the screen beside him started showing images she was watching too he didnt need to explain it to her he moved his hand in careful precise rhythm taking in the whole picture with care hed seen so many this was just one baby more there was nothing here to make his heart clench only his chest was certainly tight one baby more be professional he told himself and there was no choice to be anything but he was focussing first on the placenta moving carefully seeing its position noting carefully the visuals around it he was looking for pooled blood looking for evidence of damage not finding it one tiny heart beating beating a tiny fist curled close to the wand a tiny perfect hand a miracle just like no he felt himself blink and thought hell he was hardly hiding his emotions if maggie was watching him only of course maggie wasnt watching him she had eyes only for the screen he glanced at her and saw tears coursing down her cheeks and a tremulous smile hes okay she whispered fighting to get the words out did you think he wouldnt be i shouldnt think if i wasnt a doctor i wouldnt think i wouldnt have even known about torn placentas id have felt him kick and thought he was fine he is fine involuntarily he flicked a tear from her cheek and it was just as well he was still holding the paddle for he was suddenly aware of an almost overwhelming urge to let it go and gather her into his arms to take away the look of almost unbearable strain this woman was so alone when did your husband die he asked gently as he moved the wand on three years ago his hand paused in midstroke three years worlds longest pregnancy maggie whispered still watching the screen then she managed a wavering smile sorry william had nonhodgkins lymphoma and we stored sperm before he started chemotherapy when the chemotherapy didnt work he said if i ever wanted to have his baby hed be honoured at first the thought was unbearable but gradually it seemedright but it took me this long and bettys coercion to feel strong enough and maybe that strength was an illusion anyway she winced and bit her lip fighting for composure but hey its okay she said and struggled to smile again as long as my babys fine he is he said and then he paused they were both looking at the screen you know you called him archibald max ventured cautiously not sure where to take this conversation with a colleague who was seeing exactly what he was seeing that may cause problems not that unusual names arent all the rage but she she breathed my babys a girl you didnt know she was staring at the screen in stunned amazement i had my last ultrasound at three months but betty and i always assumed itd be a boy because because betty has a blue crib she breathed shes been knitting blue matinee jackets for ever someone should alert the share market its about to be flooded with blue she looked again at the screen seeing the irrefutable evidence and she was smiling again this time like she meant it dont tell betty she whispered you think shell be upset she wants a boy so much and why tell her the smile faded and her voice was suddenly bleak again do you think betty will live to see my baby born he glanced across at betty shed collapsed into sleep but it was more than sleep the amount of morphine hed given her couldnt explain the look of total lack of consciousness he shifted slightly so he could reach over and take her wrist her skin was parched and dry her pulse was thready and her fingers were cold to touch she needs fluids he said shes dehydrated and blood tests is she hypoxic im assuming so she hasnt let me do anything but give her pain relief for weeks now but its okay its what she wants and nownow i know my babys okayif you could just check the other one before you go the other one the one you left in the bathroom she reminded him he knew that but he was moving past it in his head facing the inevitable okay heres the plan he said softly i stay here i attend to our bathroom baby i dress your head and your knee i keep a check on you tonight to make sure your head injurys not causing trouble and in the morning i find a way to get you xrayed until those things happen im not leaving she stared up at him for a long momentand then she closed her eyes for a moment he thought she was going to react with anger with denial instead she opened her eyes again and the relief he saw there was stunning her face looked lighter younger free as if an unbearable burden had been lifted hed given her a promise of one night her eyes said it was much more thank you she whispered softly you have no idea how much i would love you to stay and she reached up and took his hand and held it hed finished the ultrasound hed sorted maggies need for the night his next priority was the baby in the bathroom he should move instead he stayed looking into her eyes while her hand held his just looking feeling the touch of maggies hand and knowing it was so much more feeling a web hed taken years to break free from tighten once more inexorably around his heart this woman was pregnant this woman represented everything he ran from yet still he couldnt disengage his hand chapter four the tepid bath had worked when he finally made it to the bathroom he found the little family comforted and happy we need two doctors so much the woman said as he saw them to their car a little later the baby wrapped in light cotton and nothing else we had old doc sharrandon but the minute maggie arrived he left said hed waited ten years too long for retirement and he wasnt waiting a minute longer so instead of having one ancient doctor we have one pregnant one not that were complaining maggies lovely only its too much for her it was he saw them off from the verandathen as he turned to go inside he paused there was a dark shape moving down the track behind the tractors orseveral shapes he stood watching waiting for his eyes to become accustomed to the moonlight it was a figure in some sort of greatcoat behind threeno fourcalves and one dog bonnie and the calves he thought and this must be angus until now he hadnt realised it was weighing on himthe thought of calves and dog on the beach alonebut it felt great to see them come he walked down through the garden to meet them only to have both man and calves start away from him fifty yards away it was clear he wasnt getting closerindeed it looked as if only the dog stopped both man and calves from bolting he left them walking slowly back into the house to find maggie propped up on her cushions watching the door with anxiety was she wondering whether he was true to his wordthat hed come back more and more the knowledge settled in his mind he couldnt leave her the part of him that was fearful of relationships was screaming at him to stay dispassionate but it was being firmly overruled by sensations he wasnt close to understanding whats wrong maggie demanded maybe his emotions were showing on his face who knew if he was having trouble quelling them internally how did he keep his face in order nothings wrong he told her angus has the calves four calves and bonnie walking up the driveway right now hes brought them here for a moment he thought she was about to cryand once again came that stab of need to comfort he stayed where he was but it was hard he must have seen you bring me home she said so happily that she was obviously oblivious to what he was feeling hed have walked back looking for them she sighed and managed a wavering smile thank heaven can we wake gran and tell her wake betty that was the last thing he wanted to do im about to clean your head this is more urgent waking betty please she said suddenly passionate it really is if you knew how grans connived for this you couldnt doubt it grans sole focus for the last year has been to get me and my baby here to set angus up with a milking herd again and keep him safe shes so close to running out of time and she knows it i had to get the calves today no matter what and shes desperate to know theyre here please so we wake her up and tell her no we wake her up and show her can you get me a set of crutches youll find some out in the garage theres three pairsi reckon im the middle why do you want crutches he demanded appalled at the sudden change in her from passive and frightened patient she was suddenly all purpose im going with you and youre carrying gran over to see anguss calves in the morning maybe no look at her she said urgently can you guarantee therell be a morning max i know this seems dumb she admitted but medicines not only about drugs and bed care betty needs this more than anything in the world and i need to give it to her this whole night will leave me with a debt i can never repay but youve said youll stay and we have to do this please can you carry gran over to see what shes achieved he stared down into her face saw desperation saw passion and more there was love he thought maggie had spoken of coercion but whatever was between these two women her commitment to her now was absolute and suddenly he thought its not just for betty maggie must be a wonderful doctor she cared where hed spent the last six years pushing his emotions away hers were out there front and centre her husbands death hadnt taught her to protect herself she was way too exposed what should he tell her now youre not fit to do anything more tonight betty needs to sleep to do what you ask would be crazy he couldnt her passion was shifting his armour finding a way in tomorrow hed put this behind him he thought but for tonighthe had to do it her way he stared down at her and she stared straight back those luminous eyes meeting his with a directness he found disconcerting more than disconcerting he should run a mile from what he was starting to feel he thought inconsequentially and then he thought maybe he was running out of time to run maybe he couldnt run if he tried time out of frame he was walking across an unused cowyard in the moonlight carrying a dying woman in his arms with a sevenmonthspregnant colleague limping along on crutches beside him gran was still halfasleep shed roused when hed lifted her but maggie had simply said the calves are here gran youve got what you want you need to see them she shouldnt be on crutches he was walking slowly worrying about her but she wasnt complaining her whole focus was on what lay ahead ahead was a haystack dark and forbidding against the night sky as they neared it maggie paused and so did he angus she called and there was no answer but a soft lowing told them the calves were there angus gran wants to see the calves shes given you maggie called i have the doctor who helped me home from the crash youll have seen him his names max and hes carrying gran because she cant walk angus gran really wants to see you with the calves again there was no response but maggie looked up at him and nodded a tiny definite nod its as good as well get she whispered lets go she limped on he stood back and watched her for a moment knowing how much she must be hurting knowing how desperately she needed to be in her own bed but knowing she wasnt going to stop she paused and glanced back at him questioning and he caught himself tightened his grip on gran and kept going he was rounding the haystack following a woman he was starting to be in awe of more a woman who left him feeling disorientated as if his world was shifting on its axis and he was having trouble getting it the right way up again and here were the calves at the foot of the haystack bales had been shifted to form an enclosed warm place angus was behind them a dark figure in a dark coat out of the pool of light from a lantern hed set up he was holding bonnie as if holding a shield how did you find them maggie asked and he appeared to shrink even more bonnie he said at last and it was as if the words were dragged out of him brought em along the beach came up to find me knew something was wrong when you come home in that car bonnie made me go down the beach oh bonnie maggie said and she sounded close to tears he wanted to hold her he couldnt he was holding betty and betty was awake and looking across at the calves maggie was looking at betty and in the lamplight he could see the shimmering of her tears whatwhat do you think of them gran whispered gently he set her down on a couple of hay bales still wrapped in the blanket hed carried her in the calves shifted nervously as he stepped back but they were still close enough for betty to reach out and touch them there was a long silence max thought maybe he should say something but maggies hand came out to catch his she leaned on him heavily and instinctively his arm wrapped around her waist to support her she leaned on him some more and the pressure of her hand told him to stay silent he stayed silent he held onto maggie family he thought suddenly and the same feeling hed had when hed seen the farmhouse came over him it was a longing deep in his gut for something other than the solitary path hed elected to travel family this there were commitments all over this place for maggie to accept such responsibilityher strength left him awed and his hold on her tightened instinctively betty had asked angus if he liked the calves she was waiting for him to answer and max could see angus knew he had to say something and he knew by the tension in maggies body that she was desperate for angus to respond yeah he said at last and it was a beginning theyll be milkers gran whispered its just the start now maggies here you can have your herd again we could use the milk from these for cheese angus said in a voice that sounded rusty from disuse until we build the herd up enough to sell milk to the coop again yes it was still a whisper but grans tone was almost triumphant she turned to maggie four calves are a start if you buy angus another every time you can afford itpromise me you will promise the last word was such a fierce demand that he felt maggie flinch against him ill do my best she said and youll help her the old lady was suddenly staring at him youll help her yeah you will i know it she closed her eyes as if exhausted and max was spared having to answer itll be okay farms safe wills sonll be here its okay gran maggie said roughly sounding desperately anxious yeah its time to go to sleep gran said without opening her eyes and if your fellall give me another shot of that morphine stuff ill take it with pleasure youll do that i will max said because there was nothing else to say and the pressure of maggies hand in his increased thank you the pressure said thank you more and more he had no idea what hed been propelled into this was a weird setting so strange he felt as if hed been transported to another world but there was peace here of a sort angus was waiting with illconcealed impatience for the people in the tableau to disappear so he could be alone with his animals maggie was leaning against him taking strength from him and giving him warmth in return an old lady was saying goodbye maggie was weeping openly now tears slipping down her cheeks unchecked he held her tighter and he felt her shudder against him can you carry gran back to bed she whispered ill do that and then ill come back for you ill make my own way she whispered i always have and i always will he looked down at her in the moonlight a woman who needed to be cared for yet who was worrying about everyone around her she worried about more than just these two people he knew she worried about the whole community maggie the word alone was making him feel strange like hed never known what a woman could be until now he was involved until the morning he told himself no more did he believe it first things first leaving maggieas orderedhe carried gran back to the house she roused enough to direct him to her bedroom a room of grand proportions overlooking the front garden he tucked her into a huge bed heaped with faded eiderdowns he injected more morphine and he thought she was asleep but as he made to leave her hand came out and grasped his thank you she whispered youve made it perfect i can go now look after them for me her eyes closed again and he stood looking down at her trying to take in what shed just said it was a farewell and by the look of her she desperately needed fluids he thought touching the back of her hand pressing the dry skin back a little and watching it stay where hed pressed it she was so dehydrated she was emaciated weary done if this woman presented at emergency right now the wheels of medical technology would move into overdrive he should at least set up a drip to get fluids in but he knew instinctively that this woman wouldnt thank him for extending her life he didnt need to talk to maggie to know it the decision had already been made she was dying and she knew it so how did he react to the old ladys request take care of them what sort of request was that should he rouse her and say hey im a passing stranger stuck for the night but out of here first thing in the morning as if he could rouse a dying woman and tell her that but not to tell her he could tell her nothing she was already asleep he flicked off her bedside lamp and left feeling that a promise had been made regardless by failing to deny her nonsense she had no right to ask anything of him and he had no need to answer move on he told himself harshly move on to maggie he came out into the living room expecting her to be there but there was no sign of her hed come ahead with betty and he thought shed have struggled back on her crutches apparently not he swore and went out again to find her sitting on a low stone wall by the garden gate just sitting staring into the night she should be in bed too and those wounds still needed dressing he came up behind her and saw her shudder involuntarily his hands rested on her shoulders she flinched and then unexpectedly she leaned back into him shell go now she whispered thank you for caring for her the night was growing more and more surreal hed turned into grans treating doctor there was nothing for it but to agree i expect she will he agreed unless we get proactive theres no point but todayit would have been a disaster without you i suspect it was a disaster because of me he said ruefully if i hadnt driven around that bend you had every right to drive around that bend come inside maggie he said gently can i carry you no point she said and sighed sorry that sounded ungracious but theres not a lot of use in getting accustomed to leaning on anyone yet still she leaned on him youre cold i do need to go inside she agreed with reluctance you dont want to i want to run she whispered im so tired he hesitated there were things he should be doing carrying her inside cleaning her face strapping her knee putting her to bed as hed just put gran but out here the stars were hanging low in the sky from over at the haystack came a soft lowing as the calves settled down for the night angus would be with them as max had left carrying gran hed turned back and seen the elderly man settling onto the straw with an expression on his face that was almost joy angus and bonnie wouldnt be leaving their charges they wouldnt be coming to the house to help maggie either how alone was this woman what was he doing there was still something inside him yelling go no further ask no questions back off he couldnt the old ladys words were like a spell cast across the night take care of them it wouldnt hurt he conceded for one night he could help and maybe he could help by staying outside with her for a little instinctively he knew she didnt want to go into the beautiful old house no matter how maggie had filled it with flowers no matter how shed fought to keep it lovely for now age and infirmity had taken over leaving an intangible air of impending sorrow his hands rested on her shoulders gently yet with a message he didnt need to say im with you was his unspoken message youre not alone but he had to leave her for a moment she was growing colder wait he said and strode swiftly into the house searching for what he needed when he returned she hadnt moved he set an eiderdown around her shoulders he put another across her knees tucking it under her and then because he had no taste for martyrdom he wrapped a third around himself then he sat down beside her close thats piles taken care of piles she said cautiously never let your backside get cold he said seriously first thing they should teach any medical student nasty things piles he felt rather than saw her smile and felt also a tiny lifting of tension great those smile lines round her eyes had come from somewhere he didnt like it that they seemed to be getting rusty from disuse his arm wrapped around her waist and held he could feel the warmth of her body through the eiderdown that meant she could get warmth from him that felt okay too more than okay you want to explain the calves he said for want of a point to start for a little while he didnt think shed answer but then she started staring out at the stars like her story was written there its grans dream the great plan to get me back here to have williams son inherit the farm to give angus back his milking herd williams son he said cautiously as in the little girl youre incubating right now yeah and archibald turning into annies the least of our problems its all a bit of a dream she said dryly grans dream and my dream all mixed up do you want to share do you want to listen but then she seemed to catch herself look this is nothing to do with you there are probably places you should be to ask you to stay the night is bigto make you share any more is crazy im not volunteering to fix anything he said just listen if you want to talk and it seemed she did she sighed and unconsciously leaned closer okay potted history im english and so was williams mother williams fatherbettys sonis a hotshot businessman who left the farm when he was eighteen moved to england and has never been back william was therefore brought up in london we met as interns we fell in love we married and we were typical londoners only william used to talk about the australian farm his parents had sent him to when theyd wanted to get rid of him over the school holidays he spoke of an awesome gran a fabulous farm and a wonderful community at yandilagong he kept saying wed move here one day set up practice have bush kids dreaming it was more than that she said softly neither of us had happy childhoods the thought of a farm and country medicine and family sounded so magical we thought wed get the training we needed and go only then will died i was miserable and alone working in a dreary little haze until i got a letter from betty reigniting the dream thats a good way of putting it she said still staring out at the stars still letting her body share warmth with him i have no idea why will told his father hed stored sperm or why his dad told betty but she knew she wrote and said if i wanted to have wills baby then why not come here and live she told me theres a selfcontained apartment at the back of the house so i could be as independent as i wanted she could help with the baby i could get a parttime job helping the doctor in town she even enclosed a lovely letter from the yandilagong doctor saying there was a vacancy here for as much work as i wanted she gave a wry chuckle then which made him think she should laugh more her laugh was rusty with traces of bitterness but still he liked it and so he asked and she sighed and the chuckle faded so then i got dreamy and impractical id been in a fog of grief and apathy since will died and suddenly i thought why not i dont intend to marry againnot after the sort of heartache will and i went throughbut to have wills baby seemed like a giant leap into the future i thought if it didnt work out at the farm i could always leave thered be lots of jobs for parttime doctors in australia so i went through ivf in london and when i was four months pregnant i came to find what you see she said and he could tell she was trying hard now to keep bitterness at bay bettys here and angus angus is bettys son wills uncle will had met his shy uncle angus who lived in a separate house on the farm but he knew little about him now i realise how disabled he is he has highlevel aspergers which means hes intelligent enough to care for himself but hes pathologically afraid of the outside world bettys been in and out of hospital for the last couple of years and by himself angus has let the farm fall apart bettys had to sell the milking herd and half the land to recoup and shes now terrified that when she dies he wont be able to stay here so her plan was to induce me to come help her care for angus and work as a doctor while she minded the farm and the baby but she must have been ill when she wrote to you yes but she didnt intend the chemotherapy not to work hope has to feed on something so i walked straight into a mess but by the time id been here for twentyfour hours i knew i couldnt walk away i ami was williams wife william loved betty he loved this farm to turn my back on themi cant i see he said slowly and he did and he was seeing chasms everywhere hed also seen the way shed looked at betty maggies husband had loved his grandmother like it or not deception or not maggies allegiance was inviolate she was some woman a feisty loyal doctor a woman to make his heart twist its not a great story she said across his thoughts ithank you for listening i wish there was more i could do there isnt she hesitated so why gynaecology sorry he said startled ive told you mine you tell me yours we need to get those wounds dressed youve been saying that for hours another ten minutes wont hurt theres nothing to tell i watched your face as you watched my baby theres shadows my shadows are none of your business theyre not she agreed obligingly and tugged her eiderdown closer and pushed herself to her feet sorry of course i dont want to know if you dont want to tell me she looked thoughtfully out to where hed parked his car beside the last tractor in the row theres probably a really logical reason like gynaecology makes more money than obstetrics so it does and you can sleep uninterrupted at night so i can but thats not the reason how did she know he couldnt figure it out but there was something about this night something about this woman that said only the truth would do it was none of her business but suddenly it was i lost my wife when she was six months pregnant he said and she plumped straight back down beside him close her hand took his and held it oh max past history he said six years ago a case of the doctors wife getting the worst care i was an obstetrician she died of preeclampsia youre saying it was your fault i should have monitored her more closely she frowned you wouldnt have been the treating doctor shed have had her own obstetrician yes but so how often would you have checked her blood pressure if youd been in charge to his astonishment she was sounding indignant thats not the point it is unless you ignored swollen ankles and puffy hands and breathlessness and any of the other signs she didnt she didnt have obvious signs until too late she finished for him as if she knew as indeed she might you know as well as i do that preeclampsia can move really fast terrifyingly fast youll be pleased to know i take my own blood pressure twice a day but im paranoid and if i was your wife and you tried to take mine twice a day id be telling you where you could put your cuff tell me about your wife what was she called alice thats a lovely name she said warmly was she lovely iyes but he said it hesitantly sadly even aware that the memory of the lovely laughing girl hed met and married so long ago was fading aware that photographs of her were starting to superimpose themselves over real memory its awful isnt it she said confidingly breaking a silence that was starting to be too long you think youll remember for ever you think how can you ever move on its impossible and all of a sudden she paused then gave herself a shake tossing away thoughts she obviously didnt want and your baby a little boy he lived for twentythree hours and you called him daniel he said and he was suddenly aware that it was the first time hed said it since the funeral daniel a tiny being robbed of his mother robbed of his life odd that his memories of alice were fading yet the memory of that tiny part of him daniel cradled in his hands his son was still so strong still so gutwrenchingly real im so sorry she said and the pressure of her hand was warm and strong maggie would certainly be a great doctor he thought empathic and caring andlovely lovely there it was again it wasnt a professional word he thought but it was in his head and it wouldnt go away so she said so i abandoned obstetrics left england and came to sydney to be a gynaecologist he said too briskly and rose to his feet end of story you need to go to bed he sounded rougher than hed intended i do she admitted let me carry you that leg must be giving you hell its not tickling she admitted and somewhat to his surprise she didnt object as he gathered her up in her pile of eiderdowns maybe its time we both moved on she said as he carried her through the roses and he didnt disagree at all the fire was dying in the grate he settled her on the settee again loaded the fireplace with logs found a can of soup made them both soup and toasthe was hungry even if she wasntand bullied her into eating then finally he tended her face and her knee and all the time lovely the word kept echoing over and over which was crazy and impossible she was seven months pregnant he was mixing her up with his memories of alice he thought as he worked he had alice in his mindthat it was alice he was helping it was alice he could save no but there were memories coming at him from everywhere and the only word that kept superimposing itself on all of them was lovely he had the gentlest hands she was drifting he was cleaning her face carefully ridding it of every trace of dirt then making it secure with woundclosure strips and dressings occasionally what he was doing hurt but she hardly noticed his face was so close to hers intent on what he was doing careful caring how long had it been since someone had cared for her how long since someone had even opened a can of soup and made her toast it was an illusion she told herself this man was trapped by circumstances in the same way she was trapped the only difference was that tomorrow morning hed leave and shed stay but somehow the bleakness had lifted for tonight she could let herself drift in this illusion of tenderness she could look into his face as he worked watch his eyes abandon herself in their depths feel the strength and skill of his fingers watch his concern he was worried about her she should reassure him she thought she should say she had things under control everything was fine that shed bounce up in the morning like tigger as shed bounced before only right now she didnt feel like tigger surprisingly though neither did she feel like eeyore for who could feel sorry for herself when a doctor like max ashton was right in front of her he was so close she could take his face between her hands and and nothing get a grip she told herself and something in her face must have changed because maxs hands lifted away and his brows snapped downward did i hurt you ino i believe im nearly asleep i need to wash your knee go right ahead you want to wriggle out of whats left of those jeans i can do that she said with an attempt at dignity and then tried and it didnt work and when max gave up watching and helped she was pleased only then his hands were on her thighs and she thought that was pretty good too whoa keep it in focus maggie he was a doctor and she was a patient she felt like she was drifting on painkillers yet shed had nothing she felt drifty and lovely and like it was entirely right that she was lying halfnaked on a settee in front of a roaring fire with the man of her dreams taking her leg in his hands the man of her dreams ouch yikes that brought her down to earth earth to maggie it was about time contact was made sorry he said ruefully but its not looking as bad as i thought good she said sleepily excellent have you been worrying he asked sounding bemused i guess ill worry if its about to drop off she said speaking of dropping off you want me to carry you to bed im fine here the thought of going out to her apartment at the back of the house seemed suddenly unbearable you are fine he told her some of that initial swellings already subsiding i think youve simply given this one heck of a bang i suspect the xray tomorrow will show a nice big haematoma at the back of the knee and nothing else excellent then life can get back to normal she hesitated you know i dont really need you to stay i need to stay he said you banged your head you shook your daughter about and you need to be in hospital under observation if thats not possible youre stuck with me or youre stuck with us im sorry forget it he said roughly and then looked contrite sorry its okay though just forget the sorry and think of it as one colleague helping another you look like you need far more help than i can possibly give but one night out of my life isnt much put like that it even sounded reasonable that he stayed she thought and there was no way she was arguing any more not when she wanted him to stay so much for all the right reasons she told herself hastily for very sensible reasons which had nothing to do with the way her insides did this queer little lurch when he looked at her you want to use grans settee she managed you want me to stay here with you she did it sounded wimpy and she had no right to ask him there were plenty of spare bedrooms but this rooms warm so it is he said and suddenly he was smiling iit seems a waste to heat another it does he agreed and itll mean i can check your vital signs during the night without getting up also itll mean i dont need to get my sleeping bag from the car you dont need to check my vital signs but the night was getting fuzzier and she was getting past arguing you have a sleeping bag for camping at the music festival not that i needed to my friends organised us a camp thatd make a bedouin sheikh jealous your friends fiona did most of the organising shes a radiologist and shes a very organising person fiona he had a girlfriend then of course he did anyone with a smile like that would have a partner there was no reason then why her somersaulting insides would suddenly somersault in a different direction it was too much she was too tired she needed to sleep and not think of problems and how she was going to manage with an injured knee and how she could check gran through the night when she was so tired and what she was going to do tomorrow without max who had a girlfriend do you need help with the bathroom he asked and she had to think about it before answering i can manage she said with another of her dumb attempts at dignity really really very well he said and smiled and lifted her eiderdown and tucked it up under her chin and then before she knew what he intendedbefore she could even guess hed thought of such a gesturehe bent and kissed her it was a feather kiss maybe a kiss of reassurance of warmth and of comfort but surely such a kiss should be on the forehead not on the lips but on her lips it was his mouth brushed hers and it was as if the heat of the room was suddenly centred right there and it was a surge of warmth so great it was all she could do not to reach out and hold him and lock the kiss to her only her hands were under the eiderdown thankfully because to hold this man to hold him would be a shout that she needed him that she was alone she was bereft and he was everything she most wanted but could never have william she made herself say her husbands name in her head but it didnt work there was nothing there william gone max here all male goodnight maggie he whispered and she could have wept as he drew away goodnight she made herself whisper back she closed her eyes she didnt want to but she did william william william as a mantra it had no strength at all max she wanted him to stay right here right now for ever chapter five she woke and sun was streaming in the windows max was kneeling in front of the fire and it was morning it was well into morning her eyes flew open she stared at the sunlight flooding the room and thought this was no dawn light her eyes flew to the grandfather clock in the corner and as if on cue it started to boom nine booms nine oclock and how any of you ever sleep with that thing is a mystery max murmured kneeling to blow on the embers as she stared at the clock as if it had betrayed her the embers leapt to lifeof course would they dare not if this man ordered he lookedhe looked much cleaner than last night for a start he looked like hed showered he was wearing clean jeans and a clean shirt though he had the sleeves rolled up as if he meant business he looked like he should always be here making her fire in the mornings living in her house just being here but then he turned to her and she saw the strain on his face and inappropriate thoughts went right out the window betty died at six oclock this morning he told her and her world stilled died you were sleeping so soundly that short of a bucket of cold water i couldnt rouse you i couldnt bring myself to do it im sorry betty she whispered and she felt a wave of grief for the old lady a grief so strong it threatened to overwhelm her though shed known betty by her correspondence and via william for longer shed only known betty personally for a few months for most of those months shed been angry betty had conned her into coming had trapped her but despite her anger shed never doubted bettys motives shed manoeuvred maggie into coming for love of a son for love of her son she had no other way to protect maggies hands went instinctively to her own belly as her baby gave a fluttery kick inside her who knew what shed do to protect this little one when did a mothers love die angus she whispered angus was with his mother when she died angus was she stared at him incredulous in the whole time shed been here angus had never been in the house it was almost as if he was afraid of it i thought theyd both want it he told her squatting back on his heels and meeting her gaze with steadiness and truth i thought if angus has been farming for years hell understand what death is but how did you make him come i told him what was happening i told him what i thought he should do and he agreed but to make him listen i know i went over to the haystack he backed away so i simply said his mother was dying and needed him to sit with her then i came back and sat on one of his tractors until he came it took him half an hour to work up the courage but he came i stayed on the tractor and told him what bettys condition was and finally he decided he could come into the house betty woke just for a moment as he arrived he held her hand until she died oh max she said awed and then oh i should have done that i think your body was simply demanding you stopped he said gently and to be honest maggie it wasnt you betty wanted she had a tiny sliver of awareness left and it was all for angus oh max she said again and burst into tears he moved then like a big cat covering the distance between them as if it was nothing shed half risen but he gathered her into his arms as if that was where shed been heading all along and he held her close and maybe his arms were where she had been heading she didnt knowall she knew was that right now she needed him she clung to him he held her close and in those first few moments of grief she let out the emotions that had welled within her for years how long since shed wept even the night william had diedhis parents had been there and theyd been angry with her because she and william hadnt consented to some new and amazing treatment theyd heard of in the states it didnt matter that william was far too ill to travel by the time they came on board with their offer to send him their anger had surrounded her deflected her grief making it seem like she had no right to a grief that was all theirs so now here she was three years later sobbing out grief for williams grandmother instead being held in the arms of a complete stranger letting it out letting it out she didnt care she simply sobbed until she was done and when he laid her back on the cushions and she finally managed a watery smile she knew the time for crying was over thank you she said simply if betty had angus with her then yes she had everything she wanted and she saw him with the calves last night and he saw her with the calves max agreed he knows they were a gift from his mother hes back with them now he even talked about burials he smiled he seemed to think the back paddockd be a good place but i managed to talk him out of it we discussed where his father was buried and thought thatd be okay i believe youll be able to talk it through with him when youre ready but ive organised the undertaker to come in a couple of hours he said and ive rung the coroner he agrees that since the old doctor left detailed notes before you arrived outlining bettys condition as terminal i can certify her death even though i didnt see her until last night how did you know all this she asked dazed you have her medical file on the dresser he said i read it during the night she took a deep breath this was huge she couldnt sign bettys death certificate herselfnot when shed been sharing a house with herbut without a certificate from a treating doctor the police would have had to be called a coroners inquest required max had circumvented it all youve been awake all night most of it he admitted and motioned to the grandfather clock and grinned ben here kept me company you could have moved she said but then she thought back to vague memories of the night once or twice early in the night shed stirred she knew she had both times max had been right by her asking about her pain just there until shed drifted off again shed slept because hed been right beside her clearly not all the time i checked on betty just after midnight he continued i thought she was slipping then but it was faster than i thought oh max she gulped and swallowed not knowing what to say there was nothing to say theres more he said if youre up to listening more ive had the night to think he told her in between bens timely announcements to the world maybe i should warn you that my theatre staff consider me a little bitwell maybe their term might be domineering and organised maybe to the point of obsession i do like a good plan he shot her another of his disarming grins so ive done some preliminary planning i dont understand i know you wont be able to take it all in right now he said sympathetically so just listen and take in what you can ideally you need time to say goodbye to betty to plan her funeral to let your leg heal and to get over the shock of the last twentyfour hours i think you need to lie on this settee for the next weekpossibly even until your babys born only theres no one to take over your work i took four days off for the music festival which gives me today clear but thats it i have a huge surgical waiting listi do all the major public gynaecological surgery for south sydneyso like it or not after today im no help at all so i need to act fast first we get you showered we objection at step one he demanded quizzically youre hardly steady enough to shower alone if youve already showered she said with another of her futile attempts at dignity youll see theres rails and a seat set up for betty betty so much emotion okay you have rails max conceded watching her face obviously seeing her need to get independent fast next item on list is letting people know about betty williams parents will they come your own parents not happening she shook her head trying to rid herself of a wave of selfpity of want of need because her need wasnt for her parents whod been a tiny part of her life before theyd sent her to boarding school at six or williams who simply wouldnt care enough to come but for this man who shed known only since last night and she had no right to need at all friends betty has a town full of friends but if youve let the undertakers know the word will be around town already okay he said thats easy so now we move to stage three of my plan your plan for world domination she asked cautiously trying to smile better ive found you a locum max yeah i know this is way too much organisation he said and raked his fingers through his dark hair with the air of a man who wasnt sure where to start but hell maggie youre a basket case what imperceptibly her spine stiffened and her eyes flashed what did you call me a basket case i am not a basket case okay only a tiny bit of a basket case he said hurriedly the rest of you is pure brilliant competence but for the little piece of you that might need to put her leg up for a timemaggie do you need the income from your medicine for a moment she thought about not answering this was so not his business but he was looking at with such concern how could she not i have williams insurance she conceded excellent so if you arent emotionally committed to practising medicine for the next few months then you dont need to you know youve had two calls this morning already two calls neither of them serious both of them ive referred to the medical tent at the festival he said but i can hardly leave you to run yourself into high blood pressure im not like alice no he said and caught himself no so so nothing he said suddenly cool and professional blood pressure or not youve been overworking and undereating and it has to stop so heres my plan grief and shock had taken a back seat for the momentfascination had taken its place this was a man in moveamountain mode bemused maggie decided it might just behoove a girl to lie back and let him move it i have an internist friend whos looking for work max said johns a fortyyearold doctor from zimbabwe his wife margaret is a dentist johns a highly trained doctor and hes just finished his supervised assessment for accreditation in australia he had a job lined up in northern victoria but it fell through last week i rang him this morning and sounded him out about taking on the position of locum here for a while you rang him just to check hes still available he said still sounding clinically detached as if he was handing out a prescription but to say hes eager is an understatement he has two young daughters who think the beach sounds great and hes free right now if they can stay here while they size the place up they can be here tomorrow john can act as locum and if youre interested in a longterm arrangementeven a partnershipthat might work too tomorrow she said and flabbergasted wasnt too strong a word for it i have a surgical list first thing tomorrow morning so i need to leave tonight he said apologetically but i rang the firstaid people at the festival until john arrives theyre happy for you to divert your phone through to them theyll cope with minor stuff and call for help on the big stuff so today and tonight are covered and thenjohns great im sure he and his family will be sensitive to angus and to your independence maggie itd mean someone would be here when you went into labour and the professional detachment was gone he was suddenly sounding hesitantcoaxingas if he was trying to persuade her to do something against her will against her will was he out of his mind shed advertised for a locum but thered been no applicants yet here was max pulling doctors out of hats to have another doctor here youre kidding me right im not kidding he said seriously and ive done nothing you cant undo why would i want to undo it she demanded feeling breathless i mean i havent met john but if you say hes good hes good they could stay here she said trying to take it in i meanfor the short term but theres lots of places in town for longterm rent they might prefer it you need someone to be here when you go into labour whoa you sound like my mother then she heard what shed said and corrected herself in her head you sound like my mother ought to sound like or not there was nothing maternal about max ashton there was nothing maternal about the way she was feeling about max ashton or the way the concern in his eyes made her feel im very maternal he said and grinned and wham there it was again that smile she couldnt afford to get sucked into that smile what was she thinking betty was dead she reminded herself frantically that ought to be enough to deflect her she should be grief stricken but after last night no grief had very little place here she and betty had grieved together during the final stages of the illness now there was an aching sense of loss but with it a huge relief that betty had gone as shed wanted in her own bed with her son by her side knowing all was safe with her world and that was because of this one overbearing domineering doctor with a heartstopping smile whose plans she had to focus on because she was feeling as if she was about to be swept up in a tidal wave any minute now hed offer to paint her babycrib pink or not she looked again at his face and saw strain behind his smile and thought this was hard for himplanning for her when he wanted nothing to do with pregnancy you dont need to worry about me in labour she said fighting to get her face in order im having my baby in sydney you are that was about my only sensible stipulation before i came here she said ive organised an apartment in sydney before and after the birth i told betty i was doing that before i even came to the farm she gave him a shamefaced smile thinking she sounded a wimp i thought thered be a family doctor here but i wanted backup and yes i realised going to sydney will leave yandilagong without a doctor but theres nothing i can do about that i cant be on call when im in labour you dont think he demanded and suddenly the tension was easing whats wrong with you what a wuss i am she said and discovered she was smiling back at him and morethe lump of grief around her heart since shed learned that betty was dead was lifting away was she fickle as well as cowardly hey he said softly and he cupped her chin with his middle and index fingers lifting her face so her eyes met his its not wrong to smile now he said softly betty knew it was her time she planned everything and it happened exactly as she wanted he smiled gently into her eyes forcing her to smile in return yes she might be somewhere now where she has inside knowledge that her carefully orchestrated grandson is in fact a girl but she can hardly come back and demand a rerun so lets send her up a little message that girls can run farms too accept that she died happy and move on i will she said and suddenly inexplicably she sniffed it was the way he was looking at her like he cared what was it about this man he was turning her into a sodden heap good girl he said softly will you accept john and his family to help you iyes what else was a girl to say great are you sure you dont want help with that shower no thank you she told him but it was a lie shed have loved help with her shower only she was a big girl and big girls didnt lean on big boys doctors didnt lean on their colleagues maggie didnt lean on max without max it would have been a ghastly morning as it wasshowered and fresh she said her goodbyes to betty while max hovered in the background filling in technicalities smoothing the way for bettys departure it was he who contacted the priest from bettys church and who let him in as maggie finished a needfully long shower it was max who hiked his brows as maggie produced a list of instructions as long as her arm to give to the priest it seemed betty had planned her funeral right down to the wellingtons and moleskins she wanted to be buried in but it was max who went through the list with the priest ensuring betty could have exactly what she wanted it was max who stood beside her as she rang williams parentsas she heard their irritation that bettys death had come at such an inconvenient time and really they couldnt come right now told you so she mouthed at max as they talked and he smiled and gave her a thumpsup youwereright sign and what would have been an appalling call was made lighter then he made calls to more distant relatives for heryes sadly betty was dead no sorry maggie couldnt come to the phone right now she was understandably upset the funeral arrangements would be in the local paper tomorrow if they wanted to come while maggie nursed her third mug of tea for the morning and watched and thought this was hero material and all max needed was a superman outfit and hed be right up there leaping tall buildings with her tucked neatly under his arm no one could deny superman so calls made he accepted no more arguments but put her in the car and headed for yandilagong it took half an hour to navigate the main street as the festival was still going full swing but finally they reached the clinic this had been set up by the old doctor and maggie now used it as her surgery she went to clamber out of the car with her crutches but there were crowds of people on the pavement and someone jostled her and max swore and was at her side in an instant picking her up yet again and carrying her through regardless of her protests superman still but then he paused max it was a shout from across the street max turned with his burden still in his arms a woman was running lightly across the road beautiful sleek cream jacket casual jeans lovely silver ballet flats gorgeous blonde hair straight and glossy as a shampoo advertisement the fringe pushed back with designer sunglasses a wide white smile fiona fiona the girlfriend lois to supermans clark kent while the wimp in his arms was simply some woman hed rescued before he moved onto the next task i thought you had a call back to sydney fiona said clearly astounded i did he said but i had an accident on the road and was forced to stay fiona meet my accident dr maggie croft meet dr fiona hamilton i told you about fi last night shes a radiologist hi maggie said feeling really really at a disadvantage lying back in supermans arms was scarcely a way to endear yourself to lois or to fiona this woman was also a doctor that made three of them but there wasnt a lot of professional recognition in the way fiona was looking at her well what do you expect if you go around carried in supermans arms she demanded of herself she was the victim here the rescuee supermans armful you didnt go back fiona said blankly looking from maggie back to max no as i said i was stuck you really did have an accident fionas gaze shifted to the aston martin as if to verify the claim there it was a smashed headlight a crumpled left panel and a crack running the width of the windscreen oh your car she said in horror and put her hand to her eyes as if she couldnt bear such hurt oh your gorgeous car maggie was hurt too he said brusquely im taking her in for an xray youre xraying her here apparently its not as much a backwater as you might think max said i gather theres basic xray equipment i dont understand fiona said why are you carrying her because hes bossy maggie said finally deciding she needed to be helpful if she was ever going to get this over with max wont let me use crutches the fact that i was fine on them last night max stayed with you last night fiona asked incredulous yeah and with grandma and angus and our cows and our dog she said deciding to preempt trouble before it got a hold he was really useful but i dont want him to drop me so ill come in with you fiona said sounding bemused and stood aside and let them both pass you stayed with her last night max you stayed in the same house as real people dont be impertinent max retorted and fiona grinned as if it was a shared joke great she so didnt want to be here maggie decided if they were in superman territory she wouldnt mind a telephone box to disappear into or was she thinking doctor who a bit of time travel to a different place but there was no avoiding practicalities max had to let her down to unlock the building she opened it entered her security code then sat down speedily in the chair next to the door because to tell the truth both knees were wobbly now she could cope with max here but fionas presence completely unnerved her she made her feel about ten the xray machines in there she told max pointing to the next room if you set it up ill come in when youre ready how out of the ark are we talking max said cautiously while fiona looked on in obvious bewilderment state of the art maggie retorted or she added honestly it was state of the art ten years ago the old doctor got it second hand from gosland hospital when they extended for nice plain skull and knee pictures its fine youve used it recently it really is fine she said growing incensed what you think we should have brought a small animal to test it on first how about if fiona volunteers a toe maybe that was uncalled for dumb really she didnt know this woman and to include her in a stupid joke but fiona looked as if she hadnt even heard she tugged open the door and stared through at the xray equipment becoming efficient ill check it for you max she said briskly wow she muttered i have my own gynaecologist and radiologist she was ignored they were both in clinical mode she had a sudden vision of them both back in sydney two hugely qualified specialists totally focussed on their work beside them she felt like a country hick a patient to be cared for with clinical efficiency and kindness thats what max had been doing all night she thought dully caring for her with kindness theres nothing complicated here fiona called so what were you intending to do today make sure shes okay and then come back to end the festival with us she shes the cats mother a saying used to teach children it was impolite to refer to people impersonally she the patient she the inanimate object causing trouble im still heading back to sydney max told her equally brisk just as soon as i know maggies not going to do anything dramatic without waiting for a responseor an okayhe lifted maggie again and carried her through still talking to fiona we were always going back separately anyway you know i have a list in the morning and clarissa and doug are staying until it ends i cant wait until then its pretty dreary fiona said max laid maggie down on the prepared trolley and fiona manoeuvred the overhead xray machine over her knee she slid a pillow underneath with the ease of a professional as if shed done it a million times before as she must have this was a simple technical procedure she wasnt xraying a patient she was xraying a knee clarissa and doug are bickering she said brendas boyfriend turned up and ive had enough music ill come home with you as soon as youre ready fine max said are you okay there maggie fine she repeated feeling like a sack of potatoes wanting pathetically to say hey this is about me do you have leather shields fiona demanded still not looking at her we need to protect the pregnancy the pregnancy not the baby not her baby in the side cupboard she said through gritted teeth and max fetched them and set them up so they formed a barrier between the xray machine and her belly her daughter annie not archibald she had a bit of thinking to do on that one chloe didnt seem right any more right keep still fiona said hold the position max get out of range so max moved back behind the door and fiona clicked and then clicked again and her head max said her head why she gave it a bang when we hit last night so why didnt you xray it last night maggies grandmother died last night we couldnt leave her she died of old age maggie said wearily not wanting any more questions wanting this conversation to be over thats why max stayed he was wonderful but i dont need him any more and you both need to be in sydney can we get on with this please because like you i need to go home her xrays were fine beautifully read by fiona torn ligaments in her knee that would heal in time nothing wrong with her head fiona wished her all the best for her recoveryand for her pregnancyand left to go back to their camp to pack max drove maggie back to the farm and the closer to home they got the drearier she felt why had meeting fiona made everything seem worse heavier they pulled into the driveway and she recognised the vehicle at the front gate who wouldnt a silver hearse is unmistakable in anyones language max cut the motor and went to get out but she put her hand out and stopped him you dont have anything inside no but but then its time for you to go she told him trying to make her tone firm and sure a man and a woman were waiting for her on the veranda dressed in sombre grey that was her future she thought grey grey with a baby daughter she gave herself a mental slap to the side of the head and made herself smile maybe grey until shed buried betty and her knee stopped hurting but in the long term shed be fine more than fine max had conjured up a locum even the sight of the staff from the yandilagong funeral parlour didnt have the capacity to dim that youve been wonderful she said but fionas waiting shes not you know she is and i dont need you any more last night i did need you and ill always be profoundly grateful that you were here for me and youve found me a locum you have no idea how grateful i am for that you know that john might stay long term if you want to share i might just want to she said but thats for the future so thank you again she tugged her crutches over from the back seat and opened the car door maggie she turned back to him i could stay another night and leave at dawn i dont want you on your own i have a sore knee she said pushing herself out of his gorgeous car thats all i can manage by myself and besides i have angus and cows and dog and tractors whats alone about that meanwhile you have your own life you need to get back to thank you he looked across at herand then before she knew what he intended he was out of the car coming around to her side taking her crutches and placing them against his precious but increasingly battered car maggie thank you he said heavily youve reminded me he paused reminded him of what she thought but she looked at his face and knew he wouldnt answer knew he didnt know how to answer johns good he said inconsequentially and she nodded if hes worked with you i imagine he must be he can work with everyone kids babies hes okay are you saying youre not okay she asked gently because you no longer work with babies im fine i hope you are and then because he lookedlost no surely that was too strong a word for it just a little bewildered as if supermans world was a bit out of kilter and he didnt know how to put it right and she thought why not why not she really wanted to do this she wouldnt see this guy after today what was the harm when she really really wanted to do it fiona or not what difference would a kiss make and before she could examine the thought any further her hands came up to take his face and draw his mouth down to hers only his mouth was already moving to hers and for one long sweet moment sanity flew out the window there was nothing sensible about kissing maggie there was nothing planned he only knew that her lips were on his that his hands were on her waist drawing her into him feeling a blast of want and need so great it threatened well it didnt threaten it simply did did remove sanity did remove acknowledgement of how crazy this was how inappropriate how stupid nothing mattered but the surety that he was kissing her she tasted of honey honey he thought and had a flash of recall hours ago sharing toast and honey it must have stayed or maybe honey always clung to this woman as did sweetness as did heat for heat was what he was feelingheat surging through the linking of their mouths through the fire he felt in his hands at her waist through the way her body curved and clung as her lips parted to welcome him into her she was aching for him to deepen the kiss showing a need that was at least as great as his own did he need her that was a crazy thought too for of course he didnt need her he never could need to expose himself to that sort of painno so hed leave this afternoon and never come back shed get on with her own life and hed get on with his but strangely unaccountably it made his immediate need even greater knowing that this might be the only timethis would be the only timethat he could hold her in his arms and let desire hold sway she was so lovelyachingly lovely she was simply dressed in pregnancy jeans and windcheater she was battered and tired and very pregnantyet lovely had been one of the first things hed thought when hed seen her and he thought it again now her body was all soft curves her pregnant belly moulded against him and he found himself curving to accommodate it a man taking his woman unto him he was deepening the kissdeepening deepening deepening until all he felt was her and all he knew was her and the rest of the world could float away for all he cared only of course it didnt it couldnt the woman on the veranda was clearly not amused at being kept waiting shed walked down to meet them shed stopped four feet away from them and coughed a cough that said this wasnt appropriate she could understand sympathy this morning but she couldnt understand passion dammit he felt maggie shift in his arms withdraw become conscious again of her surroundings and he wanted to shout no and tug her closer but the woman coughed again and he wanted to strangle her reluctantly achingly he let maggie pull away then stood holding her at arms length gazing down at her bewildered eyes her mouth was lush and full her lips just kissed but behind them the woman was looking confused dr croft she said thats me maggie said and there was a definite shake to her voice im sorry ive kept you waiting dr ashton was just kissing me goodbye goodbye the word stungbut thats what this was for one long moment he teetered a part of him wanting to say no its not goodbye this is just the beginning but then archibaldor was it ernestinekicked and maggie glanced ruefully at her abdomen and so did max and there was her baby between them reality slammed back and remembered pain no he wasnt ready for this hed never be ready exposing himself to the pain hed felt six years agono and no and no where to go from here nowhere to leave seemed impossible to leave seemed like leaving part of himself behind fionas waiting maggie said im sorry about the kiss you dont have to tell her fionas not max just go she said and her voice was really trembling please i can cope myself i will be fine ill be better if you go i dont want to leave you you must she said gently you have your world and i have mine her chin jutted a little and she forced herself to smile you go and get back to your life but thank you for being wonderful my hero she hesitated for a moment then lightly stood on tiptoe and kissed him again only this time it was different it was a fleeting final kiss of farewell and then very deliberately she turned her back on him she nodded decisively to the woman waiting lets go inside ive kept you waiting long enough she made her way slowly on her crutches up to the veranda and he watched her go and she didnt turn back once max was free to go she didnt look back if she had she would have wept as it was the woman from the undertaker kept giving her odd glances this was a small community itd be all over town by nightfall that shed kissed a strangerthat dr maggie had a love life she didnt have a love life shed kissed him and it was entirely inappropriate he had a girlfriend what was she thinking she was grief stricken she decided as she let the two undertakers into the house of course she was that was it anything could be excused on the basis of shock and loss she wasnt herself tomorrow shed wake up and be back to nice sensible maggie who knew her place and was properly horrified by todays behaviour was he gone it was so hard not to look back he drove back to town to collect fiona and the further he drove the worse he felt hed left maggie alone with the undertakers how would she cope shed cope magnificently she was one magnificent woman she was bereft alone and hurt shed kissed him there were so many conflicting emotions he didnt know where to start sorting them into any sensible order for of course there was no sensible order and when he collected fiona and she started talking serious clinical medicine serious hospital politics and the difficulties of progressing up the hospitals hierarchy he was grateful medicine blocked out the white noise hed learned that when alice died and he retreated back to it now onlywhen he arrived back to the hospital the white noise followed him ready to descend at any sliver of opportunity he worked until midnight he did a session in the gym and confusion followed him to bed maggie maggie maggie hed organised her a locum john seemed delighted at the chance to help and he was having a tough time not shoving him aside to take the job himself he was jealous how stupid was that really stupid but still he lay and stared at the ceiling until dawn maggie babies family the whole heart thing he could still feel daniel in his arms he could remember every wrinkle every precious feature of his tiny son he could remember the joy of being married to a woman he loved but superimposed on that joy was aching tearing loss to open himself again to that sort of pain no so stay away but the funeral he could bear everything else but the thought of maggie at bettys funeral was too much the thought of her standing at a graveside as once shed stood at williams grave as hed stood at alices and daniels no sothis last thing hed do for her hed arrange work so he could go to the funeral hed stay well backif possible she wouldnt even see him if she was surrounded by family and friends then he didnt have to go near if she saw him he was simply paying his respects visiting john to see if things were working out taking his car for a run no harm there the decision released a twist of pain in his gut and he closed his eyes in relief but still he didnt sleep maggie chapter six as funerals went it was a biggie betty had lived and worked in yandilagong all her life so even though it rainedsleet in facthalf the population of the district turned out for the service but as bettys only close family member maggie was left alone regarded with deference and respect when william had died her friends and colleagues had surrounded her no one in this community knew her well enough yet to think they had that right so the undertakers assistant held an umbrella over her while she tossed roses down onto the coffin in the little graveyard overlooking the sea and she felt more alone than shed ever felt in her life angus hadnt come of course not hed said his goodbyes the night his mother had died and that was that he was okay though maggie thought for now he had two little girls intruding on his solitude john the locum max had miraculously found had been at the farm for three days now it had taken johns childrensophie six and paula fiveabout three minutes to find the calves and bonnie angus was attached to them so they attached themselves to angus angus watched them with the same kind of wariness he used for anything he didnt understand but after only a day he decided they were just like the calves not posing any threat to his personal space neither did their parents john and margaret seemed wary about sharing a house with maggie cautious of her privacy and carefully respectful they were lovely people but they let her alone but right now she didnt want respectful isolation she wanted to be hugged it wasnt going to happen the ceremony was over she turned away from the grave and the undertakers assistant left to bring the car close people moved respectfully back from her she looked bleakly out toward the roadand max was coming towards her he was dressed for a funeral in a dark suit and tie a magnificent deep grey overcoatcashmereand a vast black umbrella he looked absurdly handsome he was moving toward her as others moved back she was still on crutches he waited until she reached him and then he smiled that crinkly tender smile that made her heart do back flips why are you here she asked suddenly breathless i thought you might like me to be he glanced around at the crowd backed to a respectful distance im so sorry im late i had an emergency at dawn that took a lot longer to sort than i expected and i couldnt leave halfway through but now im here can i help do you want a ride to the wake or do you need to ride in the hearse i donti dont ive put my hood up he said enticingly and he sounded so eager she almost smiled she did smile it was so good to see him and then he had his arm around her waist tugging her against him so she was under the shelter of his umbrella with him she was wearing a raincoat with a hood it hadnt been working now she was held hard against him protected from every quarter it was so good to feel him i came via the farm he told her as he ushered her into his lovely car john and margaret told me where to find you hed had the paintwork fixed she noticed she was glad she really liked this car or maybe it was the way she felt about its owner maybemaybe she should listen to what he was saying john thinks this place is great he said sliding in behind the wheel taking charge with smooth authority he cant believe the medical setup i gather margarets already talking about setting up a dental practice you guys have done a lot of organising in three days he was deliberately making his voice practical he must know instinctively that emotion was the last thing she needed now of course he knew hed been to funerals himself theres work for half a dozen doctors in this district if i could ever get them to come she said struggling to come to terms with too many emotions and match his composure that was what she neededcomposure no matter that the man beside her made her feel so breathless she was practically gasping no one wants to be the only doctor in a small town because theres no backup she managed to find john was a miracle you want to wave your magic wand and produce more im no magician no she paused maybe no was the wrong word he felt like a magician her personal genie appearing when she most needed him no family at all he asked gently looking back at the clusters of people dispersing into their cars and his look acknowledged that she wasnt a part of any cluster no surely theres someoneeven back in englandsomeone who cares hey this was getting personal what about composure i have lots of friends she said drumming up indignation and he smiled im sure you do but do you have any friends who might drop everything and race to the aid of a maggie who needs them i dont need them she said with dignity ithank you for coming though my pleasure he hesitated if im welcome i thought id stay for the wakeor whatever you call it here weve both done this he added strongly as she made to shake her head ive buried alice and daniel youve buried william this cant be nearly as bad but from what i remember its an endless process of standing tepid tea in hand thanking thanking thanking she couldnt think what to say she glanced across and saw in his eyes the recognition of shared pain a funeral of an old lady should be a celebration of a life well livedand this wasbut it inevitably brought back memories of funerals that hadnt been timely funerals where pain had been raw and deep youve got the whole day off she asked ive rearranged things i need to be back in sydney tonight but i thought i could give you this day gee thanks she retorted before she could help herself and his smile returned deepening making his grey eyes dance nobles my middle name and im addicted to tepid tea you want to make use of me or you want me to go away what was he asking was he mad did she want to stand in the funeral parlours reception rooms as hed said alone drinking endless tea receiving words of consolation from hundreds of people she didnt know or did she want maxs solid presence beside her just there if she needed him there if she just wanted him this was an extraordinary gesture if hed phoned last night and said should i come shed have said no but he was here now he was here and itd take a stronger woman than shed ever be to knock back his offer yes please she said in a rush before either of them could change their minds he was offering his strength for a day and shed take it secretly she knew shed take anything this man was prepared to give it seemed as hed predicted an endless day and at the end of it when everyone had gone when the last neighbour had wrung the last bit of nostalgia from the occasion max drove her back to the farm it was still raining they drove along the long line of tractors and maggie felt herself trying to work out a way she could make him stay longer that wasnt fair she knew it but would you like to come in and have dinner she asked as they pulled to a halt margarets cooking for me as well tonight iim sure therell be enough to share she already asked me he said gently i refused oh his face grew suddenly grim maggie i dont think i can ever go down the road i went with alice i cant get involved again well that was blunt to say the least involved she said cautiously i think we both know what i mean whoa suddenly things were going where they had no right to be going at least he was being direct but youre thinking im on the catch for another husband she whispered and suddenly anger was there surging whether she willed it or not she did will it he thought she was a victim she thought suddenly incensed by the knowledge a passive needy woman who might cling a woman whod kissed him the last time theyd met whether hed willed it or not and he probably hadnt willed it he was probably just being kind to a sexstarved widow seven months pregnant with another mans child i dont think that he started just as well she retorted so what about fiona fiona your girlfriend fiona is my colleague i dont have a girlfriend theres been no one since alice how very noble she snapped i hope alice is up there polishing your halo ready for you to join her look its just that i cant do relationships any more he said forcing out the words trying to explain something he didnt fully understand himself the impotence and the grief of not being able to help his lovely alice and the knowledge that such pain again would kill him its not fair to mess you around but maggie wasnt looking at him with sympathy or with understanding whew anger was good here anger was great it pushed away any embarrassment gave her the words that needed to be said and the dignity to say them how can you be messing me around she said stiffly and coldly i kissed youyes i did kiss you and very nice it was too given half a chance id do it again only thats all it wasa kissnothing to do with my life and if you think im about to turn into some helpless clinging female i didnt say that you didnt need to she gritted her teeth thank you very much for today it was very kind youve been very kind to me all round and if theres any way i can repay you please let me know but i dont need anything else im sorry you cant stay for dinner because you know what john and margaret are fun and the kids are gorgeous and it would have made a grey day better you might even have enjoyed it but for anything else forget it okay enough thank you again and she grabbed her crutches from the back and climbed out of the car the rain was pelting down he grabbed the umbrella and headed for her side of the car but she turned away from him no she threw over her shoulder go away you dont want to get involved and neither do i and you never know when a desperate widow might change her mind grab you by the hair and drag you into her lair before you can fight back get out of here max ashton and keep safe i didnt mean yes you did she retorted and limped away fast through the tangle of garden yes you did she yelled again go find some other maiden to rescue this ones been rescued enough so you need to move right on chapter seven she was right he needed to move on he didnt hear from her for six weeks he put her right from his mind or he tried to work was his salvation but he extended his operating schedule to the point where anton his anaesthetist finally said cull it or find a second anaesthetist to share the load that break was supposed to do you good he said morosely instead youve come back ready to work the rest of us into the ground you know what we were hoping you and fiona might have worked something out you could both do with a love life i dont want a love life he growled but you need one anton said bluntly anton had a wife a threeyearold and oneyearold twins he was permanently sleep deprived and he thought the rest of the world should join him in his glorious domestic muddle a good woman and half a dozen kids would take the edge off your energy and protect us all you do the procreating for both of us max growled youre good at it im not practice man just find the right lady ill admit fionas not perfecti cant see the chief radiologist of sydney south having much time for diapersbut there must be someone to suit you somewhere there was max thought grimly hed found her he just didnt have the courage to take it furtherto step into the abyss of commitment so hed stay clear of entanglement and hed work but like it or not as he worked he realised he was feeling the same rollercoaster of emotions he had felt in the months after hed lost alice there was an abyss in front of him only he didnt know where if he put his foot down he wasnt sure the ground would still be solid the feeling left him even more sure that the only way forward was to keep right away from maggie but his thoughts werent staying away from maggie a dozen times a day he wanted to get in his car and go to her only the fact that his workload was horrendous saved him he was always needed in theatre in the wards in his consulting rooms the situation wasnt sustainable hed thought the inexplicable magnetic attraction hed felt for her would fade but if anything it strengthened and then at the end of the sixth week he had a phone call from john at the farm hows maggie he demanded before he could help himself were all fine john said jovially its working out brilliantly theres so much work here and its a great little community but hell max the place is the epicentre of a medical desert im run off my legs already and the moment margaret put up her plate she had so many teeth coming through her door she was tempted to take it down again yeah but maggie shes fine too exceptthats why im ringing except what he was right back there again feeling the terror hed felt when alice had shown the first signs of preeclampsia leaning against the wall for support knowing this was illogical and emotional but there was nothing he could do about it margarets worrying why because shes alone he said and maxs world righted itself again alone that wasnt terrifying it wasnt great though alone why the hell was she alone she cant have the baby here john said the only doctors me and im not prepared to give obstetric support without backup all the women from around here need to go to the city to have their babies mind if we had a really good obstetrician get on with it max growled damn hed sussed john was good but he didnt appreciate him being this goodnot only helping maggie but starting to put pressure on others to help namely him okay john said chuckling and max thought briefly through jumbled emotion that zimbabwes loss was maggies gain its just maggies organised herself an apartment at coogee for the next couple of weeks until she has the baby she chose coogee because its a beach location where she can walk and swim and its close to the hospital shes booked into which also happens to be our hospital i mean your hospital coogee a suburb of sydney not ten minutes drive from where he was taking this call max drew in his breath suddenly feeling trappedpulled towards the abyss shes coming here shes already there she left on sunday so i thought id give you a heads up so you could look out for her the implied responsibility rattled him further shes not a friend john he said before he could think about it and there was a moments stunned silence from the end of the phone he could almost see johns brows snap down in surpriseand disapproval fair enough maybe he even disapproved of himself maybe what hed said had been stupid and cruel but would maggie think of him as her friend maybe not he conceded shed been so angry the last time hed seen her shes my friend john said at last gently chiding and max caught himself sorry i meani was just thinkingwhy did she book herself in here for the birth there are many hospitals in sydney i believe she booked herself into sydney south before she even came to australia john said growing more disapproving by the moment i dont believe she did it to annoy you but if you dont think of yourself as her friend i do he raked his fingers through his hair sorry of course i mean i guess i do its just that i hardly know her you came to her grandmothers funeral the locals said you held her up all afternoon physically she needed holding up well maybe she needs holding up again now john said brusquely shes left here and gone to stay in a hotel apartment until the babys born she doesnt know anyone in sydney and were worried so worried in fact that margaret says if you wont promise to keep an eye on her then shell leave me here with the kids and go and keep her company herself so im asking you to check on her shell want solitude he said clutching at straws youre kidding me right john demanded shes not like angus shes a sociable chirpy intelligent colleague the girls and i are already half in love with her we cant bear to think of her being alone but if as you say you dont see yourself as her friend all right he said goaded and then heard himself heard his anger and felt small sorry he said ive had one hell of a morning im run off my feet yeah im hearing that too john said so why are you running yourself into the ground theres work and theres delegation john said you ever heard of it yeah i know its none of my business only margaret and i worked in that place ourselves and gossip travels fast we still hear things so you met maggie you hugged her all through the funeral but you havent phoned her since youre working yourself into the ground and now you react like a scared wimp when i suggest you keep tabs on her why would i be scared you tell us and well both know john said cheerfully okay margaret wouldnt let her go without giving us her address you want it or do we have to figure some other way of taking care of her max raked his hair again did he want her address short answer no long answer long and very complicated answer of course he did yes the beach was glorious and she had it almost to herself it was early september there were lifesavers watching her with lazy care and she liked that she also liked it that she was almost the only one in the water apart from a couple of german tourists whooping it up in the shallows it was wednesday a working day even those not at work thought it was too cool to swim too bad for them she thought backstroking lazily along the backs of the waves shed swum this morning and now in the late afternoon she was swimming again after the rush of the past few months this was bliss she had nothing to do but swim and float and watch the expanding bump that was her daughter she was sooo pregnant her belly button had turned inside out she felt the size of a small whale a whales natural environment was water she thought rolling happily over and over in the surf this was where she was meant to be wallowing ooh it was lovely to be off her feet ooh it was lovely to be here even if she was alone she wouldnt be alone for long she told herself she had a week to go give or take a few days very soon now shed have her daughter it wouldnt stop her being lonely now that was crazy talk she gave herself a mental scolding as shed been doing a lot since shed left the farm she wasnt alone in the least john and his family had moved into the farmhouse they were lovely and they were giving her all the support she needed angus was happy with his tractors and his calves and his dog so she had john margaret sophie paula and angus plus the community of yandilagong after bettys funeral shed learned just what belonging to a small community really meant she had enough tuna casseroles and jelly cakes and cream sponges in her freezer to last her a lifetime her future looked far less isolated and a lot more calorie laden than shed ever dreamed possible so why was she lonely its because im alone right now she told herself in the manner of one talking to someone being deliberately dullwitted lonely means alone youve been alone since william died i havent felt alone not for a while now or not achingly alone not until i met max and there it was the crux of the matter one dropdead gorgeous doctor and her whole world had been thrown out of kilter so put him out of your head she told herself for about the thousandth time since max had left just swim and dont think of him she did a couple more laps of the patrolled part of the beach then watched the german couple decide it was time to call it quits maybe it was time for her to do the same reluctantly she turned toward the shoreand saw a man striding down the sand toward her a man who looked vaguely familiar really familiar she stared in disbelief thinking she was dreaming she wasnt dreaming max for a moment she thought wildly about swimming out to sea the last time shed seen him shed been so angry so humiliated she tried to dredge up that anger nowand failed she floated and watched him greet the lifeguards haul his shoes and socks off roll up his chinos and stroll down to the shallows he was shading his eyes with his hand so he could see better she was doing the same treading water shading her eyes trying to watch him max a wave bigger than usual rose behind her acting on impulse she caught it and let it carry her all the way to the beach or almost all the way her bump grounded her about twenty feet before the rest of her would have she surfaced wiped the water from her eyes pushed her curls back and he was about six feet away what are you doing here she managed and he looked down at her for a long moment without replying as well he might she thought shed decided buying a pregnancy swimsuit was a waste of timewho was there to appreciate it except her her modus operandi was to wear a sarong to the beach tug it off at the last minute and get into the water fast she was wearing a faded pink bikini the top was respectablewell almost though her bust had grown considerably bustier in her pregnancy she couldnt see her bikini bottom it was somewhere under her bump max on the other hand looked cool collected and casually fabulous business shirt without a tie and the top buttons unfastened rolledup sleeves he was carrying shiny black shoes socks tucked inside very neat she conceded whereas she she didnt want to think about what she was john said i should check on you he told her and she winced of course it wasnt like he was here because he wanted to be im good she said john should have called i would have told him i was okay and spared you the trouble of making the trip i wanted to see you she stood up awkwardly because of her bulk he made an instinctive movement to helpand then stopped she saw it he didnt want to help he didnt want to touch her okay then she stood knee deep in the shallows and shook herself like a dog her curls flying every which way shed braided her hair but it refused to stay braided in the surf she looked whalelike and wild she thought not max ashtons sort of woman at all so there you go she said tightly youve seen me okay maggie can we talk if you get any closer you might mess with me that was a dumb thing to say he said im sorry i said it she glowered but then she thought no this was childish she could be the grownup here maybe itd even make her feel better to act magnanimously its okay she conceded graciously i was acting a bit needy i needed to be pulled up you didnt i was out of line im sorry was this what happened when you were magnanimous you got someone feeling nicely off balance and guilty in return excellent thank you she said still attempting grace apology accepted she didnt move though walking forward out of the water seemed a bad idea and walking closer to him seemed worse not to mention the fact that her walk was now more like a waddle not a lot of grace there you swim amazingly he said still sounding stilted for an englishwoman she finished for him eyeing him with caution trying to figure where to go from here william spent most of his summers at yandilagong betty taught him to surf and he taught me just after we finished medical school we did a rotation at durness in scotland do you have any idea how cold the sea water is around scotland this place is a sauna in comparison was she gabbling maybe she was this still looks wintercold to me max said and yes he was looking at her as if she was gabbling he still seemed wary did he still think he had the capacity to get to her however true that might be she refused to be got to youre dreaming she eyed him challenging he looked so collected so not part of this beach scene she desperately wanted to get things on an equal footing its not cold she lied come in and try it she raised her brows in mock challenge i dont have swim gear are you wearing boxers or jocks i he seemed thoroughly disconcerted as well he might be she thought even more excellent she wanted him disconcerted and she wasnt backing off well boxers he conceded reluctantly then wheres the problem she demanded amazing herself at her effrontery what was she doing she didnt care though what was there to lose your audience would be two male lifesavers and me youd hardly be playing to a packed gallery dr ashton hed never do it or would he she stayed right where she was and watched the cool collected man of the world his expensive jacket flung over his shoulder his italian brogues in his hand think about his dignity saw the exact moment when he decided to lose it he gave her a long considering lookthen walked twenty yards up the beach dropped his jacket and shoes on the dry sand and then dropped everything else except his boxers taking her breath away the first time shed seen him shed thought he did serious gym work stripped to his boxers she was sure of it this man was a doctor he spent his days in hospitals with sick people what was he doing having a body like this it was all she could do not to gape maybe she did gape but luckily he was already hitting the water running into the waves as if he was a man decided on a mission and determined not to let a little thing like icy water stand in his way she saw the first shock as he hit the water and she saw his determination deepen she watched as he launched himself into the surf by diving head first into the first wave swimming out past the breakers and then bodysurf back in again she watched and she thought there were serious things going on here serious things in her head that she didnt know what to do with he was worried hed mess with her head he already had she had to get herself together he surfed back to her right to her feet then stood up water was streaming down his face his hair was flopping wetly onto his forehead he looked ten years younger ten years moremore whoa this seriously pregnant woman does not need complications she told herself and knew she already had complications in droves you lied this is ccold he muttered abandoning bravado and she grinned and sank back down into the water and rolled herself over and over in the shallows wuss ive been in for half an hour then she relented okay at first its cold you need to swim to warm up youve been swimming that long and loving it im getting wrinkly nowits time i got outbut if you want to keep swimming ill join the lifesavers on guard duty maggie just swim she advised him kindly you look like youre a man who needs to get something out of his system i dont know what it is but whatever the problem ive always found exercise helps off you go and enjoy yourself youre not going to swim with me closeness isnt a good idea she said and she knew that she was suddenly sounding stiff and formal but she couldnt help it you said it yourself you get the gremlins out of your system dr ashton but you need to do it alone it was a weird almost outofbody experience he swam the length of coogee bay and back again twice then a third time for good measure up on the beach maggie was wrapped in what looked like an enormous beach towelbright blue with yellow splodges she was sitting on the sand chatting to the lifesavers watching him he was too far away to see their faces to have any idea what they were saying but they looked cheerful maggie was waving an expansive arm in his direction was she talking about him did it matter maybe it didbut that thought wasnt going anywhere he put his head down and swam some more hed checked on her she was obviously coping splendidly by herself there was no need for him to have come there was no need for him to stay so finally he surfed to shore and strolled up the beach maggie was laughing at something the lifesavers were saying and they were laughing back they seemed at ease together like old friends but then he got close enough to watch the guys faces and he knew that pregnancy or not they were totally aware that this was one attractive woman was he jealous yes he conceded yes he was which just went to show how dumb this whole set up was get out of here he told himself get out of here fast but then maggie rose to greet him and he stopped thinking about anything but maggie her towel was amazing it was vast sky blue and dotted with brilliant yellow sunflowers draped around her very pregnant body she lookedshe looked like an elephant she said before he said a word and he blinked pardon thats what these guys here say i resemble an elephant with sunflowers elegancerus you look cute he said lamely and the lifesavers looked at him like he was a sandwich short of a picnic which maybe he was cute didnt cut it sexy did though i dont think anything this big can be classified as cute maggie retorted but im going for whale rather than the elephant a cute little sexy mama whale you say im cute the guys here say im sexy i say im just enormous she twirled around full circle grinned and unwrapped herself then proffered her towel meanwhile would you like to borrow this you need to dry yourself or youll get cold and before he could stop her shed handed her over her sunflowers he was dripping he had no other towel so itd be churlish to refuse but her towel smelled of her there it was again that faint citrusy thing mixed now with the salt from the sea she must use it in her washing powder he thought or maybe it was just maggie maggie exuding lemons and limes tangy clean and beautiful she was smiling happily at him as if she was really pleased hed dropped by and she was really pleased that hed seemed to enjoy the swim shed persuaded him to take yep beautiful and sexy and cute the whole lot wrapped together but she was reaching into her bag fetching out a sarong and wrapping it round herself sliding her toes into sandals preparing to leave that was wonderful she said it was great to see you again max but it is getting cold thank you for coming goodbye so there it was hed been dismissed his duty was done he could leave youre not going to ask me back to your place for a drink he said before he could stop himself and she looked him up and down appraisingly risky she said risky why you know why thats ridiculous he said and id rather not drive back to my place covered in sand your apartments just over the road it was your concierge who told me where to find you that was what his mouth was saying was he out of his mind he needed to leave yet here he was arguing something was driving his tongue that wasnt his head youd be second in line to the shower she said cautiously its my shower i get to go first deal he said and that was that the lifesavers looked almost disappointed as maggie turned to them and waved see you tomorrow craig simon she said happily unless youre in hospital tomorrow one of the men said and for a moment a shadow flitted across maggies face was she worried about it then the birth of course she would be how many pregnant women had max cared for every single one of them worried but maggie was putting on a cheerful front and he watched her deliberately put the shadows aside im not due for a week she told them and first babies are always late im guessing theres two more swimming weeks to go well good luck if theres not the same guy said and let us know what happens were starting to feel like we know your daughter already they walked up the beach together slowly max had tugged on his clothes but he still feltdifferent maggie had introduced the lifesavers to her daughter shed made them her friends this woman could make friends with anyone she was beautiful the word was echoing over and over in his mind she had the sunflowers draped over her shoulders she was a huge blue and yellow whale gorgeous i wouldnt mind an ice cream she ventured as they neared the street so max bought two ice creams and in silent consent they sat on a park bench and ate them she was a very neat icecream eater max noted methodical cute and youre a biter maggie told him and he stared pardon you bite your ice cream ive never been able to figure why people do that you risk freezing your insides lickings much more sensible how did you know what i was thinking i just know she said smugly and then relented as she saw his look of bewilderment you have a very readable face gee thanks my pleasure i practise reading peoples faces she explained so much more dependable than palmreadingand i like doing it i dont like you doing it whatever she said happily but biting icecream cones is nuts youve finished already and mines only quarter way down sodo you always take your pleasures this fast she eyed him sideways her eyes twinkling deliberately appraising deliberately teasing and he felt himself respondmaybe exactly how she hoped hed respond trying not to blush like a schoolboy first the boxers now this she was enjoying herself at his expense hed found her expecting her to be lonely maybe anxious maybe depressed maybe she was all those things but she was making a good job of hiding it when did you last have an antenatal check he demanded trying to get back to sounding businesslike but instead sounding like he was feeling out of his depth and flailing yesterdaydoctor she said raising her brows still laughing still teasing im being very good she had him off balance and she knew it all he could do was flounder on so what did he say she a lovely obstetrician called helen she says my babys heads not engaged yet so i could be at least a week so what are you doing with yourself reading she said and looked virtuous reading reading reading and nodoctornot a romance or a thriller or even a trashy magazine medical journals if im going to be a family doctor im going to be a good one did you know bed bugs are on the rise bed bugs he said faintly world travels getting so common that the little pests are spreading she said apparently if a patient comes in covered in red welts i should check if theyve been in a hotel recently and if a local hotel gets infected then theres a whole list of things that need to be done ive been reading health department guidelines as district medical officerthats me nowi need to know what to look for did you know they hide in the seams of mattresses during the day and you cant just spray the place with an insecticide bomb and move on either theres serious health implications i need to know what to doand i get to close the place down if they wont comply really he said faintly really she said sounding reproving and dont sound dismissive you get bitten by bed bugs and youll be the first to complain to the local health officer theres so much to learn i see there is dont belittle it she said even more reproving and stood up he looked up at herwrapped in her sarong and towel balancing her icecream coneand thought there was no way he could belittle this woman and suddenly the focus was no longer on bed bugs or ice creams or even mischief and teasing suddenly he didnt know where to go from here look id better go she said as he rose to stand beside her that showermaybe its not a good idea maybe its not what was going on here but he knew what he was feeling was an irresistible attraction to a woman who represented everything he didnt want commitment giving himself emotional entanglement everything he didnt want how many doctors did he know thatd take bed bugs on as a commitment but he knew that maggie would take on everything she cared about as a commitment the farm angus the community of yandilagong him see there it was he looked down into her eyes and thought he could read her if he wanted her he did want her no to leap into that abyss maggie no she said softly you dont really wantwhats between us not now maybe not ever its better you go john wants me to keep checking you can ring me at the hotel john can ring himself if he wants come to think of it he does already so you neednt bother is there anything at all that you need no so thats it then yes she said and turned away and then they were standing near where pedestrians were streaming over the road from the beachside park to the shops beyond the traffic lights across to the shops didnt appear to be working at some subconscious level while theyd been eating their ice creams max had been conscious of confusion cars slowing honking at each other pedestrians scurrying between cars the car came from nowhere overtaking others that had slowed to a crawl its tyres were screeching into acceleration where others were braking it was bearing straight down on the intersection like there was no question it had right of way it was travelling way beyond the speed limit a crazy speed even if people werent there only of course people were there families were leaving the park tourists were holding ice creams and cameras chatting to each other as they headed to the shops a couple of office workers their suits at odds with the casual crowd looked like they were heading home a young mother was pushing a stroller all were frozen by the noise of a car out of control there was no time for screaming just the roar of the cars engine it didnt even slow it came straight through there was a flash of yellow a sickening thump a crash of breaking glass a body flew high above the cars bonnet all the way over it crumpled to nothing on the road behind the car didnt pause indeed the scream of its engine increased the bright yellow motor with huge wheels and about a dozen exhaust pipes behind simply kept right on accelerating screaming along the esplanade through the next set of lightsalso not litaround the corner up the hill and out of sight leaving behind mayhem chapter eight for a moment nobody moved it was like some sort of greek tragedyplayers turned to statues where they stood then someone screamed and max was gone from maggies side in an instant she hardly saw him go he was simply no longer with her and by the time she could take in the enormity of what had happenedwhat was still happeninghe was crouching by a body crumpled on the roadway dear god it was a child she dropped her ice cream and her bag and ran triage max was with the child what else no one else seemed to have been hit or maybe there had yes there was another a woman was standing in the middle of the road behind a stroller staring numbly at the child who was now more than ten yards away from her maggies eyes dropped from her face and saw her arm which was streaming with blood far far too much blood maggie was with her in a heartbeat seizing her hand and raising it above her head sit she said and the woman looked wildly toward the child max was tending no i help me maggie said harshly to a kid standing bya teenager with greenspiked hair and a tshirt with a message that was shocking if she was in the mood to be shocked she wasnt give me your shirt she said and to the kids enormous credit he peeled it off almost before shed finished saying the words help me sit her down she said and the kid took the womans good hand and maggie gently pressured the woman to sit and then as she sagged to lie down her arm was gushing blood pumping out at a rate that was terrifying maggie had it still in the air she grasped one of the kids hands and placed it on the womans wrist so he was holding her arm up hold it high she snapped keep it there she was twisting his tshirt into a tie twisting twisting grace the woman managed im a doctor maggie said as she wound the tshirt round her upper arm theres two of us here dr ashtons looking after grace while i look after you i need to stop your arm bleeding before you can go to her it sounded simple stop the bleeding stopping a gushing artery was an almost impossible ask shed do it she had the twirled tshirt right round the womans arm now and was twisting it cruelly the woman cried out in pain ambulance to maggies astonishmentand reliefthe kidspikewas holding his cellphone with his spare hand barking orders the kid looked all of about fifteen yet he was acting with the responsibility of a trained paramedic esplanade coogee traffic accident two hurt bad bleeding all over the place get here fast im going to be sick someone moaned faintly behind them the kid turned and snapped get away from us before you do then and give us your cardigan we need a pillow great she said as someone else handed over a jacketnot the woman who was threatening to vomit but it didnt matter who gave it as long as they had it keep that hand raised got it the kid saidand not for the first time maggie thought how impossible it was to predict from any group of people who could be called on to help who was helping max did he need her she couldnt look not yet the bleeding was slowing thank god heaven only knew how much blood the woman had lost in those first secondsher arm had been ripped almost from elbow to wrist and spilled blood was impossible to quantifybut the bleeding was easing now to almost nothing i need another shirt she yelled back into the crowd and someone handed one over and a towel shed dropped hers and there was no time to return to the side of the road to fetch it but someone handed one over in seconds shed fashioned a pad to fit over the whole wound she placed it on then wrapped it tightly with the shirt using the sleeves to tie and tie again she now had a tourniquet and pressure on the wound itself and spike was still holding the arm high grace the woman moaned again and finally maggie let herself glance across to max he was working furiously alone no one had moved to help him there was a gathering crowd of onlookers but that was all they were onlookers she had spike to help her and the womans bleeding was controlled triage said she had to move on can you tell me your name she asked and the womans painfilled eyes stared up at her like she didnt hear your name she said again softly but urgently and put her hand fleetingly on her cheek its okay spike and i have stopped your arm bleeding youre going to be okay but i need your name jjudith the little girlshes yours iyes thomas is in the stroller grace isgrace is dr ashtons looking after grace maggie told her hes good hell take good care of her ill go now and see how she is thomas thomas is fine she looked around her at the onlookers met the eye of an elderly woman who was looking shocked but was already turning away as if she was about to leave that was what sensible people did at the scene of an accident if they couldnt help they left she wanted sensible can you help with the baby in the stroller she called and the woman paused and pointed to herself me please whats your name mary i know these people she ventured they live near me great she motioned her to come close so judith could see how comfortingly grandmotherly she looked judith marys one of your neighbours and shell be looking after thomas spike here is holding your arm up until the ambulance arrives so it doesnt start bleeding again youre going to be fine i need to help dr ashton with grace if you promise to stay still then therell be two doctors looking after grace go the woman whispered without hesitation go he heard her in the background and he blessed her for it hed never questioned her competence but nowshe was skilled and she was fast and she was sure people jumped when she said jump recognising her natural authority even if she was nine months pregnant covered with sand and dressed in a bright yellow sarong there was so much bloodthe woman maggie was working on must have torn an artery but he couldnt help her he had urgent work to do himself vaguely he heard the voices in the background the womans voice naming her children the blonderingletted child under his hands was dressed endearingly in a pink tutu over a bathing costume stained with rainbow ice cream she was called grace she was conscious just considering the force with which shed hit the road consciousness was a miracle but like her mother there was far too much blood from her leg torn femoral artery it must be hed ripped his shirthe was getting good at thisand was twisting a tourniquet slowing the bleeding her leg was twisted at an appalling angle there was a gash across her abdomen bleeding sluggishly and the bitumen had ripped her skin like sandpaper her tutu was bright with blood its okay sweetheart he murmured as he worked and she gazed up at him in pain and confusion and shock its okay the car hurt your leg im a doctor and i need to fix it mmummy and then her eyes rolled back in her head her tiny body was suddenly limp no blood loss haemorrhagic shock he dropped the shirtcumtourniquet he was working on and moved to cup her face in his hands breathed hit her chest her leg started spurting blood again but suddenly maggie was beside him kneeling on the bitumen taking in the situation in one sweeping glance ill stop the bleeding you get her breathing she muttered go he had help it was blood losslack of blood pressurethatd caused her heart to stop he knew that he had to get her breathing but it was no use getting her heart to work again if the blood loss didnt stop the task was impossible but with maggie beside him he no longer had to think about the bleeding he could move to cpr as hed practised it so many times at medical school and afterwards breathe one two three breathe one two three the ambulance is on its way maggie snapped as she worked and he glanced across to where a kid with spiked hair was supporting the mother so did maggie the kid gave maggie a thumbsup sign and she turned back and kept on working breathe one two three im shifting this leg she said the compound fracture means well never stop the bleeding while the arterys this exposed but she hadnt stopped to speak she was simply doing she was twisting the shirttourniquet one last time holding it in her teethin her teethtaking the leg in both hands one fast movement and the leg was suddenly in alignment not that max had time to care breathe one two three please breathe one two three and the little girls chest heaved heaved again all by itself dear god maggie whispered and max was saying it too over and over in his head please please please the child was breathing the bleeding was slowing again now but not because of death not the ambulance maggie whispered and he heard it then the scream of the siren above the traffic help was on its way plasma iv fluids for both mother and daughter if they could get them on board before the little girls heart shut down again she stood a chance and then the professionals were there there were suddenly four skilled paramedics assessing in an instant what max and maggie were doing skilled hands taking over smoothly efficiently iv lines were going in oxygen masks pain relief stabilisation stretcher boards transfer curt questions to the point to each of them who was involved the bloodwas any of it maggies maxs spikes the baby in the strolleridentification i know who they are mary said the elderly lady had lifted the toddler from the pram and was cuddling him if you want ill come to the hospital and hold the baby until someone can come for him i can give you details and you the ambulance officer turned to maggie do you need help im ffine she managed knowing she didnt look fine nine months pregnant soaked in blood shocked ill look after her max said and his arm came round her waist and she let herself lean into him i feel funny spike said suddenly and there was another moment of drama where the paramedic moved fast before the kids knees buckled under him hes a hero maggie said shakily as they loaded spike too into the ambulance and the paramedic looked at her and then at max it seems we have a surfeit he said dryly we were lucky to get here as fast as we didthe powers off all over the city and the traffics crazy but in the meantime you guys seem to have saved a couple of lives and then they were gone the police were taking statements and were collecting fragments of broken glass for forensics someone had started cleaning blood from the road in a few minutes all evidence of the accident would have disappeared the stone had been tossed into the lake it had splashed the ripples were moving outward and in minutes life would be smooth again only maggie didnt look the least bit smooth maggie you know we agreed that shower wasnt a good idea max murmured and she looked up him and he saw her react to what he must look like which was a reflection of what she looked like texas chainsaw massacre version two im not sure theyll even let us into the apartment block now she muttered and her voice was shaky you should have gone with the ambulance why my voice always shakes after drama im fine she shook her head of all the criminal dont think about it come and get clean youll talk your way past my concierge ill do whatever i must to get this off us he muttered grimly but we did good maggie we did didnt we she saidand burst into tears she sobbed she sobbed all the way back to the apartment while max told a stunned concierge what had happened the power was out and the reception area was dim theres been power outages a couple of times already this week a shocked concierge told them as he ushered them toward the stairs thatll be what happened with the traffic lights maggie was no longer listening she was simply limp what was wrong with her shed done her share of stints in emergency rooms she was a doctor for heavens sake what was she doing collapsing like a sodden rag but collapse she had she couldnt stop shaking if max hadnt been holding her up shed simply have sat where she was and not moved until morning her tears had stoppedfinallybut the numbness was ongoing she made no protest as max propelled her into her apartment into the bathroom and straight into the shower then as she stood limply under the warm water sagging against the far wall he swore pulled his shoes off and came into the shower with her he tugged her close and held her while the water ran and ran and the red slowly turned to pink and then slowly turned clear max had ripped off the remains of his ruined shirt along with his shoes he was wearing chinos and nothing else she was wearing her sarong it might be clean but it still felt bloody ugh she didnt want it on she hauled it free and the water turned red again with the movement there was a crimson smear on her bikini top she tugged at the strap and max hesitated then helped her unfasten it then as the shaking continued as her bikini top fell to the floor he swore and tugged her in hard against him what was she doing she didnt care she didnt have the energy to care she let herself be pressed to maxs bare chest skin against skin she needed the contact so much she needed him and something else she wanted to be beautiful for him she thought through a haze of shock and tears it was a silly dumb thing to think but think it she did she wanted him maggie his voice was unsteady ssorry she whispered trying to get her voice under control trying to figure out what on earth she was thinking im sorry iits justit must be being nine months pregnant hormones or something im notits not exactly medical treatment youre giving me here im trying hard to feel like your treating doctor he said and she felt a fierce stab of denial no you dont feel like my treating doctor she whispered the warm water was running over them there was no light apart from the filtered daylight from the window in the bedroom beyond she felt like she was in a warm sheltering cave held by her man she was so close closer than shed felt to william that was an impossible question and the truth was she didnt know but it didnt seem to matter up until now grief had been with her every time she thought of him now shocked out of any trace of a comfort zone thrown into such intimacy with this new man in her life it seemed that william had become a memory that couldnt be betrayed a gentle ghost taking his rightful place in her life watching her move on and with the thoughtmove oncame knowledge of where her heart was taking her and the surge of selfknowledge made her gasp she made to pull away but max was holding her against his chest against his heart her bump was in the way apart from her tiny bikini bottom she was totally naked but she was still huge but max was holding her as if he loved her as if this child she was carrying was his no he didnt want this how could he you dont want this she whispered want what maggie what did she want she knew exactly what she wanted the unsayable but she had to figure another answer you dont want a pregnant woman stark naked against you i dont believe youre quite stark naked i might as well be and im soso beautiful he said softly and then as she looked up at him in confusion he added almost ruefully pregnancys beautiful ive seen this before maggie im a doctor remember that got to her no way was she going down that route she pulled back from him swiped water out of her eyes tried to look up at him with determination youre not my doctor you needed someone you sobbed i didnt need a doctor she managed i needed someone who knew what i was feeling didnt you feel like sobbing too he wasnt answering he was fighting to act as if this was professional care she didnt want to be treated with professional care why had she let herself sob on him what sort of a baby was she enough she hauled open the shower and grabbed a towel it was big but not big enough beautiful ha winding the towel round her as best she could she backed into the bedroom leaving max looking after her still not answering shed fallen in love she admitted as she towelled herself dry with grim intensity with someone who saw her as a patient so get dressed get this finished with fast how had that happened maggie had been covered with blood and shed been distressed shed needed to get her clothes off it was natural that hed help her so he was a doctor helping a heavily pregnant woman in distress he should feel professionally detached he felt no such thing shed asked him if he felt like sobbing the answer to that was easy the way hed feltsobbing didnt come close but what he was feeling was nuts to look at a ninemonthspregnant woman and ache to take her to him it was inappropriate it was mixed up with his memories of alice if she wasnt pregnant would he still feel this desire he needed to get away he thought until after maggies baby was born until he could see how much he wanted maggie for herself he suspected it was a lot so dont rush it he told himself harshly leave her until you can see the whole picture get the emotion of pregnancy out of it meanwhile she didnt need him but damn it he wanted her to need him there wasnt even a light in this apartment thered been a couple of weeks of rolling power cutsapparently there was a major problem with the city grid if he wasnt here shed be by herself in the dark maybe she had enough resourcefulness to buy herself a candle of course she did he thought hauling off his soaking chinos and wrapping himself in a towel it might be seductive to think of himself as a white knight on a charger but she didnt want that and maybe playing the protector now might mess with things later how much later later shed have a baby and a farm and friends she still wouldnt need him he came out of the bathroom and she was at the apartment door thanking the concierge not being needy at all theyll get him home great she turned and he copped another blast of how gorgeous she was her hair was still wet her flaming curls clinging to her lovely face she was standing in bare feet wearing maternity smock and jeans lit by the afternoon sun from the outside window and as he watched her the tangle of emotions surrounding him fell away hunger hit him with such force that he almost took her in his arms right then but she was holding out gym pants measuring them for length the gym pants acted like a shield giving him pause somehow sense prevailed just ive found you some clothes she said cutting across his thoughts with such brisk efficiency that he blinked pardon donthe conciergehas loaned you his gym gear you need to bring it back tomorrow clean umthanks he said resourceful yes she was clinging no you can hardly drive home in your towel she explained quite kindly we both need to get a bit of dignity back here we do right then she said and waitedpolitelyfor him to disappear back into the bathroom to get into another mans gym gear and leave what else was a man to do take her in his arms and kiss her senseless let himself fall into that abyss he was so closebut not close enough for as she turned away he saw her put a hand to her back and wince backache in advanced pregnancy was common but with that tiny gesture the pain hed felt on losing alice came flooding back maggie was beautiful brave intelligentand vulnerable and pregnant and alive how would he feel if he took her to him if he loved her with all his heart and thenand then no and shed turned away she was being sensible for them both by the time he was dressed in dons classy gym gear he was almost thinking clearly but still he didnt want to leave her what had happened seemed too big outside the sun had gone behind clouds and the apartment was gloomy do you have candles he asked and she looked at him like he wasnt very bright of course i have candles i have enough to light the whole apartment we had power cuts for a while last night too if you remember and the night before that did the lights go off where you were no but maybe they had the hospital had its own generator and by the time hed left workat midnightthe power had been on again work that was the way to go he thought get back to work and get a grip on your emotions but to leave her here alone seemed wrong but maybe there was an alternative i do need to go back to work he told her but i also want to check on judith and grace the ambulance was taking them to sydney south would you like to come with me i can put you in a cab to come home afterwards thank you she said picking up her purse just like that yes id decided id go before you offered she admitted i know i should be professionally detached but youre looking at a woman whos so undetached she just sobbed her naked heart out on your manly chest and you know something i might have sobbed even if it wasnt manly so lets not get too personal here so yes please dr ashton i need to find out how they are you should rest he said belatedly so i should she agreed but im never going to rest until i know maggie no more sobbing she promised no more chests just two doctors checking on two patients lets go chapter nine so once again maggie got to ride in his seriously sexy little car but despite her bravado she wasnt feeling sexy or brave or anything other than totally disoriented she was feeling disconcerted by the way shed reacted over the last couple of hours she was feelingbereft because she wanted this to be different for her mind had moved on from drama and was now playing tricks max was driving her to the hospital to see how two people theyd helped were faring that was all that was happening but she was feeling sensation of warm wind in her hair she was watching maxs strongly boned handssurgeons hands she thoughton the steeringwheel and she was feeling like she was part of a couple again she felt cared for she felt like she was a woman beside the man she loved the sensation was insidious in its sweetnessand it was a lie for max was being efficient and kind nothing else but it didnt stop her soaking it up true or not she was holding to the moment thinking if this was all she had then shed enjoy every minute of it but sadly it was only a short drive at the hospital max pulled into his personal parking placeimpressiveand her illusion of togetherness dispersed it was back to being maggie on her own but still she hesitated before getting out of his car holding back for just a moment but long enough for him to come round to her side he was holding the door wide for her looking at her in concern proffering his hands to help tug her unwieldy body upward are you okay he asked uneasily maggie this is too much shall i take you home again im fine its just this cars too low i need a crane she looked at his handsthought about how she should refuse his aid contact with this man was doing dumb things to her headand then she thought no dumb or not shed take any contact she could get she took his hands he tugged her to her feet and she came too fast she was hard against him only she wasnt her bump was in the way she had to get herself under control max was on the other side of her bump holding on waiting for her to steady herself looking at her in concern she steadied took a deep breath tugged her hands away thenspike she said this was exactly what she needed not to look at max not to let him see her need spike was on the far side of the car park accompanied by a couplea man in paintspattered overalls and a woman in the uniform of one of the local supermarket chains they looked about to climb into a battered family sedan spike maggie yelled and then as he didnt respond she put two fingers in her mouth and whistled max hadnt seen spike and he hadnt expected it he was a whole eighteen inches away from maggie and the whistle came close to bursting his eardrums it was a whistle a farmer might use to call a dog in the next county its spike maggie said happily and headed across the car park he followed bemused where did you learn to whistle like that betty she said over her shoulder great legacy huh maggie had spikes attention now of course she did heand his parentsstood by their car immobilised by maggies whistle the whole carpark looked immobilised by maggies whistle but maggies sole attention was on spike the kid still looked pale and subdued dressed in the nondescript clothes that emergency departments give out after accidents his spiked hair was sagging at the tips and he lookedsmaller but max watched his face as he recognised maggie and thought this was a kid whod had a lifeordeath situation thrust at him and whod reacted with courage and honour it had left its mark like maggie sobbing her heart out on his chest lifes tragedies were something that affected both them deeply spike maggie said joyfully as she reached him and she hugged him before he knew what had hit him im ccolin the kid managed trying to sound defiant not spike maggie grinned and turned to max hes colin she said happily our heros colin hero the woman beside spike said faintly hero maggie said definitely is colin your son iyes the woman said and this is his father im really pleased to meet you maggie said warmly we helped at the accident with your wonderful son the hospital called us the man told them glancing at spike as if the thought of colin as wonderful was clearly ludicrous they said colin had been in an accident we were so scared the woman added only then we found out he wasnt actually in the accident hed just seen it and fainted someone needed to explain but even as max thought it maggie was on the case she was like a lioness with a cub he thought bemused maggie fierce and loyal and true he watched the indignation on her face and he thought this was a woman who once she gave her heart would give it for ever spike had earned her loyalty and shed repay it a thousand times over and he wondered suddenlyout of left fieldwhether he could find the courage to ask for that commitment to himself is that what colin told you she was demanding indignation personified that hed seen an accident and fainted what else is there his father asked did he tell you he saved a ladys life the couple stared he just said he saw an accident spikes mother said he said he had to give his tshirt to the doctor and the ambulance guy said he fainted not until he wasnt needed any more maggie retorted tell them max this is dr ashton by the way dr ashton tell them about how colin was just plain wonderful so max told them while spikes parents looked bemused and then disbelieving and finally awed spike flushed and looked like he didnt know where to put himself but he didnt have a choice like it or not maggie hugged him again and then his mother was lining up for her share and suddenly fiercely max was wishing he was somewhere in the middle of that hugging it was dumb but there it was things were shifting inside a huge hunger hed ignored for years was suddenly refusing to be ignored the abyss of emotional connection seemed suddenly no abyss but something wonderful something that if he dared move forward could be his again if he dared maybemaybe that abyss was simply a blockade that had to be battered down it was a blockade built from fear and loneliness but on the other side you must be so proud maggie declared as maxs world shifted while spikes mum took over hugging duty an the doctor said theyll live colin said muffled by the closeness of his mother i asked but i cant believe i fainted bloody sook you didnt faint until the drama was over max said firmly putting his arm round maggie and holding her against him finally taking a hug for himself the hug felt good no it felt excellent it felt right but somehow he had to keep talking to spike and his parents maggie expected it of him he knew this was a lady whod expect a lot of her man colin i fainted for the first time when i was a medical student he told him it was during the first caesarean birth i ever attended the mother was consciousshe told the nurse she thought i was going to faint she even told her to help me colin you did better than the average medical student you did what had to be done and you kept your personal emotional reaction until afterwards that took guts and beside him maggie nestled closer and beamed up at him he had her approval he thought and maybe what he was feeling was corny and clichéd and soppy but corny or not it felt right did he really do that spikes father demanded staring at his son like hed never seen him before he was the only one in the crowd with the courage to help maggie declared and max could feel her wanting to hug spike again he was doing spike a favour by holding onto her but that certainly wasnt the reason he was holding on he was holding on for himself alone maggie and i are trained medical professionals he said hugging her tighter to solidify the maggie and i connection colin came in cold and did brilliantly hey spikes dad said and his eyes were filling hey werent nuthin spike said it was everything max said and then as spikes parents showed every sign of bursting into tears he said farewells for both of them and dragged a reluctant maggie away he held onto her all the way to the other side of the car park hed drag her further if he could he thought there were far too many people around for what he wanted to do for what he wanted to say but itd have to wait maggie wanted to see how grace and judith were faring and something told him nothing would ever get in the way of maggies intentions but then he paused as he heard her sniff maggie he took her shoulders and looked down into her eyes she sniffed again and glared i dont cry she managed i never cry i know that he said managing to keep a straight face so why are you not crying now i just thought she swiped her eyes angrily with the back of her hand and sniffed again i watched their faces his mum and dads they were very proud its what i want she said and she put her hands under the bump that was her baby and tried to smile you know i was at the pictures last year life was grey i was just working just living for me for me for me william had said if ever i wanted his baby i should go ahead but there was no way i could how could i ever have a child on my own only then i went to the pictures and this mum came out arguing with her son it was a silly soppy picturea romanceand shed obviously dragged her kid there against his will he was giving her such a hard time and she was saying leave it alone you loved it as much as i did and he was rolling his eyes at her and she was saying if he didnt say something nice about it shed make him broccoli sandwiches for a week and he rolled his eyes againand then he grinned then he looked around to make sure no one was noticing that hed grinned and i thought thats what i want you want a teenager he said faintly like spike she said all contradictions and prickles and lovely underneath she patted her bump with pride im going to refuse to let her get her ears pierced thatll be such a fight my best friend rachel and i pierced our ears with ice and needles when we were thirteen you didnt my mum didnt even notice she said with a touch of sadness she wouldnt i didnt have that kind of a family but rachels did and she swabbed us with so much disinfectant the sides of our faces were yellow for a week then she marched us both off to her family doctor she and rachel yelled at each other all the time and i loved it i so wanted someone to yell at me youre looking forward to yelling i am she said sniffing again but finally managing a watery smile im going to be the yellingest mother maggie someone pushed past them on the path if he didnt get her to himself right now hed go nuts but she wasnt thinking about him lets go she said and suddenly unaccountably she seemed happy she tucked her arm into his and tugged him forward lets go find judith and grace and make sure what spike said is true im so in the mood for a happy ending so was he he had some figuring out to do but suddenly so was he instead of going into the emergency waiting room and asking through normal channels because max worked at the hospital he took her straight into the emergency room itself he introduced maggie to sueellen the director of the emergency department sueellen greeted maggie with pleasure eyeing her bump with friendly interest what spike had told them was the truth judith was in theatre having her arm stitched shed been given blood and would be fine grace was still being stabilised that compound fracture of her leg needs work shell need grafts for the skin on her tummy but every indicator is that well have a good result sueellen told them and then as if unable to contain her curiosity she said so youre the lady max collided with the weekend of the music festival weve been hearing rumours she grinned at the bump ill assume this isnt fast work then dr ashton sue just kidding she said and gripped maggies hand good to meet you maggie but you dont look like you should be here as a doctor midwiferys thataway theres a while to go yet maggie said and sueellen looked at her bump more closely and raised her eyebrows in polite disagreement really ive had ladies come in looking smaller than you and leaving with a carry cot not all that many hours later not me maggie said firmly not yet im not sticking round here now i only wanted to know how judith and grace are you know theyre probably better than judiths husband sueellen told her and motioned through the glass doors to where a young man sat in the waiting room he was holding a babythomas thomas was asleep in his arms the young father was staring straight ahead holding the baby like his life depended on it he looked grey he came in looking worse than he looks now sueellen said sympathetically i think hell have lost ten years of his life on the way here thats the downside of loving max said flinching as he watched him and maggie cast him a look of reproach dont she said softly you cant keep thinking like that how can you stop youre not cut out to be an emergency physician then sueellen said bluntly sometimes i wonder how on earth can i go home at night expecting bill and the kids to still be there but amazingly they are you just have to keep faith she smiled and motioned to maggies bump like you theres a mound of hope if ever i saw it good luck with it oh and max antons been looking for you have you had your phone turned off theres a crisis upstairs she disappeared leaving them standing by the admissions desk expecting them to leave hed have to leave a crisis max swore under his breath of course hed slipped out to see maggie during a quiet time hed called anton after the accident saying hed be longer than expected and it had still been quiet but peace in his department never lasted long anton needed him hed have to go but what should he do with maggie maggie was looking through the glass doors that led into a waiting room shed be wanting to go and hug the young father he thought but then the door to the waiting room swung wide and marythe neighbour whod helped at the sceneand a couple of other people arrived grandparents in moments the young father was surrounded others were doing the hugging and maggie was looking almost wistful i need to go home she said and suddenly he knew she was fighting not to sound forlorn he badly didnt want her to go back to the hotel by herself why had he set up his department so he was indispensable of all the stupid if you wait until ive checked with my department i might be able to take you he told her knowing already how doubtful it was that he could and maybe she heard it in his voice a cabs fine she was still looking through the glass oh i wish there was something i could do youve done enough max said in truth he was having trouble pulling his attention away from the little group as well theyd come so close to the edge hed been over that edge so had maggie surely as a professional she knew she needed to protect herself but was it possible to protect yourself he thought hed built armour that was invincible only nowsuddenly he didnt know where that armour was ill just go talk to them before i go maggie said and her eyes were glistening again but thank you max i meanjust intending to visit was great even before the accident it was very nice of you ill come back to the hotel after work to make sure youre okay he growled ill be asleep she said two minutes after i get home of course im okay theres no need to worry there is a need the thought of her going back to her hotel alone seemed unbearable maggie have you arranged for anyone to be with when you go into labour i dont need anyone you do need no ive learned not to i could no because you dont want to she said bluntly we both know theres stuff between us thats messing with your head maybe my mess is getting clearer maybe my head is saying loud and clear that i want to help maggie i want to be involved that gave her pause she gazed up at him for a long moment and then she shook her head no she said and he thought she was trying to sound firm for both of them not after today i just sobbed on you naked in the shower and if that didnt confuse the issue then i dont know what would she hesitated but then her voice became more certain okay max ill be honest here and confess that right now i look at you and my knees turn to water now if thats not a confession to make you run a mile i dont know what is but im also thinking that maybe its my hormones playing tricks would any ninemonth pregnant woman be hardwired to latch onto the first available male and cling ive never been pregnant before i have no idea whats hormones and whats not i only know that this isnt the time to find out and i also suspect you dont ever want to find out you see that pain she motioned out to the waiting room where the young father sat in a surge of hugs and tears thats what i want to be part of she confessed thats why i made the decision to have williams baby i want to open myself up for all that again hurt grief but the joy that goes with it thats what i want but i dont think you do she tried to smile tried to make him smile with her but he wasnt smiling he glanced out at the little family and saw again the grief that hed sworn never again to endure he turned again to maggie and he knew he was exposed again like it or not but they were standing in the middle of the emergency room the woman behind the admissions desk could probably hear themhe could practically see her ears flapping in another part of the hospital patients were waiting for him and he knew theyd be urgent how could he talk to her now he needed time to sort his head out he needed time to get the words right all he could do now was to address immediate need which was to keep her safe maggie i will not let you go back to the hotel he said lets find you a bed here until i can take you home are you kidding she demanded astounded im not staying in hospital if you go into labour then ill come back im not stupid look he said and suddenly he was in no mans landno longer sure of anything reason had gone out the window he only knew that this woman had changed his world and to leave her now seemed physically impossible maggie i dont know what the hell im feeling but i cant let you go home by yourself the reluctant martyr she groaned what and suddenly she was angry how do you think this makes me feelthat youre being dragged into my life by your toenails kicking and screaming butt out maggie i ive already confessed how i feel she snapped how much pride have i lost theres only one thing you can say after a confession like that and its goodbye i dont want to say no and neither do i she confessed still furious but we dont have a choice maybe we can think about things after the birth after i get some normality back into my life but not now you need help stop it she said just cut it out or youll have me agreeing with you and how scarys that its not in the least scary what to have me clinging to you maggie stop it she ordered max just cut it out and go back to your life please do you really want me to of course i dont but its the only sensible thing to do do you want to be sensible no she was practically yelling at him patients were looking at them staff were looking at them maggie glanced around and suddenly she shrugged and a spark of mischief replaced the anger mischief and something more of course i dont want to be sensible but i do need to go home but if youre really intent on followingmaybe id better warn you what youd be in for if you really let me need you lets see me not be sensible and before he knew what she intendedbefore he could begin to guessshe seized his shoulders she stood on tiptoe and kissed him and this was a kiss it was a seize the day claim the man take what you want for there might be no tomorrow kind of kiss and it possessed him utterly from the time her hands grasped his shoulders from the time her lips met his from the time she melted into him for that was what she did she melted her lips were like fire and the heat she gave him the strength the passion the suretyit took his breath away it took him away his sensible self the max who thought things out logically the max who thought he was in control this was a man and a woman and between them was a need as primitive as time itself he was holding her close and he was fallingfallingfor it was no longer maggie who was doing the kissing he was kissing her holding her taking her to him claiming her as his own and they were being cheered at a subconscious level he heard the cheers and knew he should pull away only that would mean letting her go and to let her go was impossible hed never felt such heat never felt such fire her mouth was open under his and he felt her tongue start its own sweet exploration his hands tugged her closer and he kissed her back demanding as well as giving taking passion taking sweetness and heat taking joy the clapping and laughter around them was growing louder more raucous and then there was an apologetic murmur a hand on his shoulder was tugging him back there was laughter right beside him and the hand on his shoulder was insistent someonenot maggiewas determined that he move reluctantly he propelled maggie away from him holding her by her shoulders until she was steady she stood back looking astonished at her own temerity while around them patients and staff erupted into applause the guy at his shoulder was an orderly at the head of a trolley wanting to get past the patient on the trolley was laughing too but the orderly was inexorably pushing them both aside bedrooms are upstairs mate he said smiling its young love an old lady on a nearby examination table said at it like rabbits a kid on a trolley called out and max found himself blushing from the toes up i just rang anton and told him you were here sueellen called from behind them apologetically he needs you right away and to maxs astonishment maggie grinned at their audience and gave sueellen a cheery wave take him she called hes all yours now i dont think i want him sueellen said grinning back hes looking used if hes second hand ill take him the old lady called he looks like theres still a bit of life in him yet all the sameout of here sueellen said laughing if we cant deliver your baby maggie youll have to leave weve got an influx expected trouble max asked fighting hard for composure and sueellens smile faded probably this power grid problems not going away and half the city seems to be affected the power cuts over the last few days seem to be minor in comparison youd think drivers would think no traffic lights means slow down try telling that to the moronic driver who caused your accident were hearing theres accidents all over the place the only reason were not rushed off our feet already is that the traffics so gridlocked its taking ages getting ambulances to us and it seemed as if the outside world was breaking in from all directions max through the swinging doors burst anton where the hell have you been ive been trying to contact you weve got a bleeder theatre three maggie if the traffics a problem max started but maggie was already backing away it wasnt a problem on the way in maggie said even if it is ill just find a café and sit it out until the power comes back on i dont want you no she said giving a firm nod you dont you have work to do and im in the way max anton said warningly this cant wait goodbye max maggie said and tried to smile she walked away leaving him staring through the glass doors after her max anton said again sounding more urgent im coming should i find someone else anton demanded watching his face no no he repeated more firmly shell be okay she has time time until the babys due or time until you go after her anton said he didnt answer but he didnt have to he knew what maggie wanted her body had just told him and he knew he wanted the same how soon could he go to her there didnt seem to be any cabs so maggie took a bus and as sueellen had warned the traffic was a nightmare every set of traffic lights was out the city was descending into darkness but weirdly people were being friendlier than shed ever known the lack of traffic lights the series of mostly minor accidents at uncontrolled intersections meant that traffic was going nowhere people sat patiently on maggies bus discussing whether the supermarkets would be open for candles where they could get longlife milk ice something for dinner that didnt need cooking someone had a tiny keyring pig from a christmas cracker that oinked every time he shone its nose light im going to do my supermarket shopping by pig he told his fellow passengers as after two hours on the bus everyone gave up waiting and decided the only way anyone was getting anywhere was on foot maggie tried to smile normally shed think this was fun but too much had happened today and her back was starting to ache she was still half a mile from her apartment when the bus stopped weariness and the shock of the day was taking its toll she really didnt want to walk there were no cabs she had no choice it was hard to keep herself steady on the pavement without streetlights people were jostling goodhumoured and laughing but with each step maggie felt less like laughing her back hurt this was tiredness she told herself shock shed been bending over the two accident victims not being careful shed been swimming before that shed done too much andshe wanted max maybe shed never see max again she deserved not to see max again she told herself dismally shed kissed him like alike a hussy ooh she gave herself a mock hoot of horror a hussy she didnt feel like a hussy she felt alone and clumsy and huge and as she walked steadily onward she was also starting to feel more than a little scared a stab of hot pain jabbed at her back and she thought no it couldnt be please she had to be sensible if there was a chance she was in labourno she was imagining things she was over three miles from the hospital nowit was impossible to walk back shed be okay but her back hurt a lot her feet slowed what to do what would she tell a patient to do call an ambulance that was good advice she was nine months pregnant with bad backache calling an ambulance was only sensible the decision made she felt better she stopped walking and searched in her purse for her phone it wasnt there damn she could see it her phone sitting on the charger on the bedside table in her apartment shed left it there when shed gone swimming and shed been in too much of a rush when shed left with max to think about taking it dont panic dont panic she had no phone here but she could get to her apartment and phone from there she could phone max or not what could max do that an ambulance couldnt she kept walking she could see the glimmer of the moon over the sea the sea was where her apartment was great two minutes walk and shed be there shed let herself in make herself a cup of tea ring the ambulance and then watch the moonlit sea while she waited no power she wouldnt be able to make tea oh for heavens sake she was crying again she wasnt a hussyshe was a total wuss chapter ten max spent the night with his thoughts returning again and again to maggie uneasy and getting worse as the citys traffic became more and more gridlocked the hospital became quieter apparently people were abandoning their cars and walking or finding accommodation where they could once the traffic was truly gridlocked accidents lessened and even when they happened ambulances couldnt get through the blocked roads contact your local medical centres if you need to radio announcers were telling those with batteryoperated radios suburban doctors were operating emergency clinics the population was coping as best it could tomorrow thered be questions asked in parliament max thought heads would roll over this unprecedented mess only only maggie dammit maggie he needed to know that shed got home safely but he rang her apartment block between patients at ten and again at midnight and got no answer he fretted about it to anton as they worked together on what they hoped would be their last surgical case for the night and anton provided an answer most small apartment blocks dont man their front desks at night he explained patiently as he monitored their patients air supply phone in the morning when the concierge comes back on duty there should be an afterhours emergency number every apartment will have its own number anton said staying patient maggie will be able to ring out if she needs to i need to ring maggie you dont have her cellphone number no he snapped so harshly the nurses looked at each other and thought whoa tread lightly here surgeon annoyed he just needed to know shed got home the radio was reporting total gridlock even when he finished here he wouldnt be able to drive and find out in desperation when he finally finished in theatreafter two in the morninghe rang john and margaret at the farm woke them frightened them for nothing no maggies apartment number didnt work at night but if he rang in the morning the concierge would put him through her cellphone number actually shed given her usual phone to john because the locals used it at need shed said shed buy another for private use but no she hadnt given them that number either why hadnt they asked her for it why hadnt he asked her for it so whats the problem margaret asked sharply max caught himself and said no its only that the citys in the grip of a blackout and he was probably worrying unnecessarily he left the ward and walked slowly across the quadrangle to his apartment thanks to the hospital generators everything seemed normal he felt stupid but he also felt increasingly apprehensive and the feeling wouldnt go away maggie this was not how it was supposed to be and as he stood there he thoughtthey were supposed to be together one man and one woman and one baby the knowledge was suddenly so strong it was almost primeval kicking in where any pretence at intelligence left off maggie and her baby werent here so why was he here he stopped and stared southward toward coogee three miles or so as the crow flew how long would that take him to walk how long would it take him to run the pain wasnt too bad if she lay still she lay still the backache grew it seemed to be coming in waves the apartment was dark she was not afraid of the dark she was afraid okay get sensible yes the contractions were indeed contractions yes they seemed to be getting stronger and closer together she rang the ambulance yet again theres a massive traffic jam a sympathetic operator told her im trying as hard as i can to get a car to you can someone take you to your local medical centre can you call a neighbour ill call a neighbour she agreed sweating she staggered up from the settee went to the door unlocked itjust in case the ambulance could get here looked out into the pitchblack hallway tried to remember seeing any of her neighbours tried to figure which door she could knock on thought again she was being stupid this was her first baby she was hours away from delivery maybe a day no she decided as the next contraction hit not a day but hopefully hours it was stupid to stumble about in the dark waking neighbours she didnt know she groped her way back into her darkened living room and collapsed back onto the settee dammit she wasnt going to lie here in the dark and be terrified she wasnt max dont think of max she told herself between gasps between contractions max has less chance of getting here than an ambulance does so theres no use even thinking of him think of your daughter instead do you want her to meet you sweating with fear in the dark no so do something about it she took a deep breath which was supposed to be steadying but wasnt this isnt a scary time she told herself trying hard to believe it its looking more and more like its your daughters birthday so put your party hat on when the ambulance arrives i want to look brave as if at least light some candles okay i think i can do that she gasped clutching at her back and trying not to cry out maybe if i dont have something else happen first three miles wasnt very long as far as marathons went but this wasnt a marathon this was a sprint max was fit but he kept fit by working out between cases in the hospital gym he had strength training he didnt run he especially didnt run in the dark without benefit of streetlights itd be a sight easier if his heart hadnt been hammering in his chest before hed started the more he ran the more it kept right on hammering he was being dumb he told himself over and over again he was imagining problems when there werent any there was no reason at all for a sane doctor to run across a darkened city growing more fearful by the minute but the mantra had started in his head and once started it wouldnt go away maggie maggie maggie hed let her go home of all the stupid criminal irresponsible it wasnt stupid the sane part of him said hed assumed the electricity would come back on as it had come back on last night and the night before hed never imagined this totally irrational certainty that hed lose her she wasnt his to lose the sane portion of his brain reminded him but the sane portion of his brain was getting smaller by the minute replaced by raw emotion maggie was his woman his heart was telling him that with every sound of his feet hitting the pavement and his woman was having his baby his irrational maybe but it didnt matter he knew truth when he heard it and he was running and in an apartment in coogeei will not have my baby in the dark i will not have my baby in fear i will not have my baby lying on a rented hotel apartment settee with no beauty not her apartment block loomed solid and black in the night there was a faint light coming from one of the terraces above his head but none of the windows were lit maggie hadnt lit her candles then of course not maggie would be asleep she wouldnt thank him for barging in and waking her terrifying her for nothing he made himself slow made himself catch his breath went into the foyer wondered why the door into the foyer was unlocked then thought maybe it was attached to some electrical security system that wasnt working if the concierge had faced the choice of locking tenants out or letting the foyer stay unguarded overnight thats what he would have done so he could climb up the stairs to maggies apartment just walk up and knock thats what he was intending to do walk up and knock its three in the morning wake up maggie im here breathe breathe breathe surely the books hadnt said it hurt this much breathe you can do this i cant he knocked on the door and the impact of the knock had the door swinging inward what the she hadnt locked it she hadnt even closed it properly the corridor he felt his way down was in complete darkness so was the apartment through the door maybe stopping to fetch a torch would have been sensible he wasnt feeling sensible he swung the door wide and called maggie nothing did he stumble round in the dark and see if he could find her hell hed scare the living daylights out of her he raised his voice maggie still nothing it wasnt completely dark there was a faint glimmer from the hall mirror reflecting light from outside his eyes were finally adjusting to a darkness that was more intense here than in the moonlight outside but it was still a less intense dark than the corridor he could see shapes a bench in the kitchenette a hall lamp the livingroom settee maggie he was feeling his way in wondering if he had the right apartment there were four doors in this corridor and hed got here by feel itd be just his luck to have the wrong apartment im a doctor he called just in case some stranger was sitting bolt upright in bed preparing to have a heart attack because of a prowler in their apartment im looking for maggie im looking for a pregnant woman in trouble he sounded stupid he thought edging into the sitting room as he called the drapes were wide open and he could see the moonlit sea beyond then as he drew further into the room he saw there was another light source outside low light hidden until now by the bulk of the settee he moved cautiously forward hit his knee on a coffee table and swore maggie he tugged open the big glass door to see where the light from outside was coming from maggie did you bring gas a voice demanded from floor level and the words were a series of breathless painfilled gasps if you didnt kill me now oh max shed set up a birth centre she was on the tiled balcony floor but on bed of sorts a mound of soft bedding right at the edge of the terrace where the open protective rails gave her a sweeping vista of the sea beyond there were candles everywhere she was surrounded by a sea of light a complete circle apart from the line of sight between her and the sea the moon was hanging low casting a silvery trail of moonbeams over the ocean they looked almost a ribbon reaching out to touch the woman on the cushions at his feet apart from the hushhush of the waves on the sand below there was complete silence all this max absorbed in a fraction of a second and then mmmmmmmmmpf it was a long low moan so low that unless he was right next to her hed never have heard it for max whod delivered a thousand babies or so it was the quietest birthing moan hed ever heard forget the moonbeams he was frantically shifting candles so he could get to her he wanted so much to take her in his arms but there was still a part of him that was sensible obstetrician goes up in flames wasnt a headline he wanted to hit the newsstands any time soon obstetrician maybe he was indeed he was for even as he took in what was happening even as emotion hit him like a kick in the guts his professional side was kicking in as well making him sensible making him take the time to make the scene safe before he could kneel beside her and tug her into his arms and hold her close it took seconds and then he had her mmmmmmmmmmmpf another contraction already he held her tight until it passed and then he kept on holding her yes he needed to be her doctor but first there was an urgent need to bemaggies man max she whispered and he simply held her until the next contraction hit and beyond maggies man some truths were beyond question then no gas she demanded i didnt bring my bag he said ruefully i ran you ran dumb he said like you having your baby in the middle of a power strike you didnt think to call for help ive called for help to me i called the ambulance youre not an obstetrician she said with a breathless attempt at dignity im an obstetrician can you bear me to examine you mmmmmmmmmmpf that was a yes he didnt want to be maggies doctor he thought he wanted to keep right on holding her he also wanted a full birthing suite a full obstetric team i did callthe ambulance she repeated hours ago i hoped the ambulance could get through i didnt think you could id have been here earlier if youd phoned me you want me to apologise for not phoning she gasped you didnt bring gas im holding it against you for ever mmmmmmmmmpf im holding you against me for ever he said shakily but he couldnt he had to set her down again on the cushions and be her doctor imi think im going to push she managed try not to till ive seen then hurry up and see she said and moaned again you want to yell he asked ill wake the neighbours someone might have gas he said did you think of that if you yelled someone might have come and helped you i only want you mmmmmmmmpf the head maggie shes crowning dont care mmmmmmpf you do care he said hauling the candles closer to where he needed to see then as another contraction rippled through and he realised how close she was to delivering he suddenly changed direction shifting candles cushions shoving maggies whole makeshift bed and maggie with it along the balcony so she was hard against the wall so he could haul her into sitting position and leave her propped up gasping fighting bearing down so she could see so she could see her daughter enter the world and thenthere was moments stillness a moments peace where the world held its breath where even the moonlit sea seemed to hush until she screamed a scream to wake every neighbour from coogee to bondi a truly excellent birthing scream that came with that last triumphant push slowslow he said urgently and she did backed off stopped pushing while his fingers foundcord not a problemhe had it free in seconds oh thank god he was here go he said and she sighed and groaned and held her knees and pushed with one mighty heaveand managed to see as her baby daughter slipped into maxs hands and into the world no one came the scream that could have woken the dead evoked no response at all there was no sound at all as max cleared the babys airway checked her breathing felt this tiny perfect being come to life in his hands maggies daughter didnt cry she simply stared upward dazed incredulous vernixcoated slippery as hell and inside him something that had been missing for a long long time settled back into his heart and stayed what could ever be more perfect than this this moment of birth and this birth was the best delivering maggies babyquite simply he felt like the luckiest man alive and as he slipped the tiny girl onto maggies breast watched the baby slide against her mothers skin saw maggies hands cradle her daughter watched her eyes fill with tears saw the two of them mould into one moment of absolute perfection he knew his world could never be the same again he knew he could never want it to be the same he didnt speak instead he simply watched and smiled and smiled and smiled finally maggie looked up at him her eyes shimmering with tears and whispered simply thank you max it was my privilege he said softly i believe that i love you the world held its breath once more she stared at him for a long moment awed then slowly the corners of her mouth curved into a smile it took only that she whispered and the world started again back on the beach the waves began again life began again oh max my love my heart she was smiling and smiling her eyes misty with love and with happiness for you to love mehow can you mean it i never say things i dont mean maggie how can i not love you she hesitated and he saw her smile falter but but he didnt want to hear a butand he wouldnt do anything to mess with that smile maggie i wont rush you into anything he said quickly touching her face lightly with his fingers wondering how this wonderful woman could possibly call him her love her heart but with that one wordbutreality had broken in a little sense was starting to prevail the professional side of him was still playing a part right now maggie was at the most vulnerable moment of a womans life the emotion she was feeling must be overwhelming to take her to himto claim her as his ownwas what he wanted to do more than anything in the world but not now ill not push you further he whispered not this night i swear ill feel the same now tomorrow and for ever but if it takes months for you to believe me then so be it ill wait for however long it takes he was watching maggies daughter find her breast take her first taste of maggies milk wondering how she could doubt his love but if maggie needed time he had to give it to her oh max i do love you she whispered and he felt the last trace of the heavy load of armour hed placed around his heart disappear to nothing my max but her instinctive but still had him shaken it had reminded him that this was no time to demand commitment it wasnt fair there was a reason laws were in place to protect the doctorpatient relationship he thought forcing himself to be sensible he wasnt about to play on her gratitude and her emotions he must hold back whatwhat will you call her he was struggling hard to return to being professionalhe needed to because the birthing process wasnt quite over but as far as maggie was concerned it was done life was here now complete for all of them rose she said is that a name you and will picked out we didnt choose she whispered we didnt dare to think thered ever be a baby i did wonder about chloe only now i see hershes just rose and ill add an elizabeth for betty she smiled shyly up at him looking almost anxious what do you think pretty much perfect i think so she said stitches nothing to stitch too perfect she said shy giving way to smug she was relaxing again now and she was looking just about as happy as it was possible for a woman to be im so good at this right he didnt mention the cord around roses neck there were some things maggie didnt need to know how close she might have come it didnt bear thinking about id like you up this end of the bed maggie said sounding suddenly like the old maggie like the strong and imperious woman he loved i believe i need to clean up it can wait she said i need to be kissed so much for the doctorpatient relationship he touched her face again loving her with every part of his being he still needed to be sensible he still needed to remember that instinctive but okay maggie needed to see that what he was feeling wasnt the result of need and loss and all the things that had been messing with his head for so long but right now max right now im holding my daughter and i believe my world is wonderfully amazingly fabulous she whispered loving him with her smile the only thing that could make it more perfect is if you kissed me so so hed never know how she was going to finish that sentence for he had her in his arms her daughter gently cradled between them and he was kissing her as she wanted to be kissed as he wanted to kiss her which was pretty much as perfect as a kiss could be they sleptor maggie and rose slept and max lay with maggie in his arms with tiny rose wrapped and snuggled between them if he slept he might move too close put in peril this tiny precious creature who already felt a part of him he had her nestled between them so maggie could feel her daughters closeness but max could feel the babys warmth as well her tiny snuggling movements her flawlessness with the roads still blocked from the night the usual sounds from the street below were silent there was only the ocean the moonlight over the water this woman this baby life was perfect there were complications he knew it he was a surgeon in a major teaching hospital and maggie had committed herself to be a country doctor and farmer were the two compatible could maggie leave yandilagong to be with him the decision was too hard for now they needed time to think only there wasnt much space in his head to think all he could think was how right maggie felt in his arms and how wonderful life felt right now maggie stirred some time toward dawn it was still dark she could close her eyes and sleep again only right now she was too happy to sleep she felt her daughter nestled beside her maxs arm was under her shoulders his chest was her pillow she was cradled against him and she felt so happy she was almost floating yet shed said but why it had been an instinctive reaction a stab of acknowledgement of every barrier that lay between them but its impossible that you love me only right now she couldnt even think what those barriers were so why had she said it it had changed things she thought no matter how hed reassured her shed told him shed loved him but hed moved onto practical things again she had allowed the real world a glimpse in but she wanted to love him in the real world as well she wanted to be with him in maxs arms with her daughter by her side she felt like the luckiest woman in the world there were problems even within her haze of relief and love and happiness she could dimly acknowledge that maybe thats what her but had been about shed promised betty that shed care for angus shed care for the farm shed even told her the medical needs of yandilagong were settled how could she simply abandon that promise and walk into maxs life she would if he asked her she must shed find a way max loved her how wonderful was that how wonderful was life it was too wonderful to let herself think about problems right now she thought dreamily problems were for tomorrow right now she was in the arms of the man she loved with all her heart and her daughtertheir daughterwas between them she smiled a catgotthecream smile and she nestled closer into max his arm tightened instinctively around her she was loved she slept chapter eleven soon after the sun rose when the power finally came on when the city slowly came back to life an ambulance arrived maggie was bundled up to be taken to hospital so rose could have all the checks she needed and maggie could be cared for if maggie had her way shed stay right where she was but it wasnt possible max couldnt stay with heror wouldnt the impulsive declarations of the night were over for we do need to take this slowly he told her as he helped lift them both into the back of the ambulance i need to go back to work you need to go back to the farm i dont want to go back impulsive stupid or not that was an absolute but max was made of sterner stuff than she some time during the night a decision had been made maggie i said i wont rush you and i wont he said last night you had a baby youre an emotional mess i am not she said ready to be indignant but he smiled and placed a finger on her lips of course youre not but theres all sorts of things to be thought out before we decide where to takewhat were feeling for each other you promised betty youd stay on the farm yes i her face clouded yes todays not the day to make a decision to break that promise he said gently i love you and i want you but i will not pressure you you go to hospital then you go back to the farm and well take things from there maybe in three months three months she was on a stretcher settled into the ambulance and she said the three months as a wail if she hadnt been cradling her daughter she might have got up and told him where he could put his three months but maxs expression was firm a decision had been made maggie its lifechanging decisions were talking here he told her and he kissed her lightly on the lipsand then as if he couldnt help himself he kissed her more deeply i want no regrets when we move forward together he added will you still want me in three months ill always want you he said simply and he kissed her again so deeply this time that the paramedics sighed and looked at their watches he pulled away at last smiled ruefully and climbed out of the van off you go then you and rose ill clean up here and bring a suitcase to you later and thenim working in the same hospital my love i wont be far away three months my maggie well live that long only if i have you waiting for me at the end she muttered but she knew in her heart that what he was saying was sensible she even managed to smile back oh max i love you so much three monthswhy had he said it but even as he questioned himself he knew he was right maybe the time frame could be shorter but he doubted it there were so many things that needed thinking through at least he hadnt been stupid enough to say hed stay away from her yes she needed space to think yes her need of him might be hormonal yes it was fair to give her time to recover from the emotions of the birth and yes he needed time to work out an idea that was still only a vague possibilitybut staying away from her was impossible so maggie was admitted to south sydney and if he happened to pass her ward a dozen times a day it wouldnt be proper not to check on her rose decided to be jaundiced and there was another reason for him to be there yes maggie was a doctor but she couldnt be dispassionate about her own daughter it was hard enough for max to be dispassionate watching this tiny creature wearing her sunglasses under the lights this tiny girl who held his heart in her hands almost as tightly as her mother did their hospital stay was thus extended but finally the jaundice resolved and when roses colour faded from golden back to pink it was max who drove them both back to the farm and if he hugged maggie as he helped her into the car if he kissed her as he closed the car door and if he drove down the coast road feeling all the smugness of a man with a new family who could blame him beside him maggie smiled and smiled she was happy to be going home he thought and there was another stab of disquiet home to the farm how to make this work angus was watching for their arrival from the back of an ancient lanz bulldog angus was a part of maggies family there were complications everywhere how could he ask her to abandon angus he couldnt he wouldnt maggie had attempted to raise the issue with him but hed shushed her its not time hed said and he wouldnt be budged his wonderful idea was growing there were still so many factors though somehow max had to figure a way around them was three months long enough it had to be he had to figure out a way focus on now he told himself harshly one step at a time angus was watching them and maggie was smiling at him angus wasnt smiling back he was holding onto his tractor as if it was his refuge she needs headlights max called as they pulled up beside anguss tractor i might know a source where i can find some yeah angus said leave it to me max said and then offhand you want to meet your niece the elderly farmer stared at both of them in apprehension but maggie didnt move didnt speak and max didnt either slowly angus ventured down from the tractor max flicked the switch of the sunroof so it slid back exposing rose in her cocoon in the back seat swathed in pink gazing in astonishment up at the sky angus edged nearer neither maggie or max said a word nearer he put a hand on the carand then cautiously cautiously put a finger out to touch roses little hand was just there he touched her fingers and they curved and held and angus stared down at her in incredulity no one spoke but max felt a knot of emotion in his chest that had lots to do with the expression on maggies facebut also something to do with angus himself with this farm with the night of betty and the calves in the haystack family and the ideas that had been drifting since roses birth became more than ideas an ambition no a certainty if he could pull it off he must and then there was a whoop from the house and sophie and paula were tearing along the driveway to meet them angus backed away but only as far as his tractor youve met her first angus not fair sophie yelled and then margaret and john were outside too and maggie and rose were enveloped max could go now only maggie clung to him and he had no intention of leaving until he must in truth all he wanted was to bundle maggie and rose back into his car and take them back to sydney to leave them here seemed wrongbut there were plans to make if he could do it in three monthshe must he needed to get back to sydney and get things moving right now but still he stayed and had dinner with them knowing hed been a fool for not accepting dinner the night of the funeral one dinner missed was one too many then maggie walked him out to the car and it was entirely logical that he take her into his arms and kiss her and kiss her and kiss her i love you he whispered into her hair for it seemed impossible not to say it i love you right back she whispered max three months is crazy it is he said ruefully but i need to sort stuff out can you bear to be patient what do you need to sort out a happy ever after he said if thats what you want how can you doubt it then be patient he said and kissed her againbut then as roses indignant wail sounded from inside the house he put her away from him i need to go and so do you go feed your daughter youll come back soon thats not soon enough she said distressed max hush he told her hush my love lets take this one day at a time lets figure out where we go from here she went back into the house to feed her baby feeling bleak empty lost that he was returning to sydney without her he was giving her room to make her decisions he was being honourable she didnt want honourable she wanted max and why had she made those promises to betty the promises were closing in on her now back in sydney shed thought she could break them it had seemed possible but here with echoes of betty all around her it seemed less so for her to walk away from angus and the farm and the community oh but to walk away from max inside the house margaret met her holding rose out for her to take when she saw maggies face she hugged her oh my dear hell be back will he of course he will margaret said stoutly but for how long maggie thought but she didnt say it max seemed to have faith in their future maybe she should too he stayed away for almost a week and that was long enough then he made a mercy dash back to give angus his headlights and bonnet badges hed found for his newman wd that was a good moment angus almost smiled maggie did then he found someone to take over part of his role in sydney so he could work reasonable hours his car soon seemed to know the route back to the farm all by itself and the more he visited the more sure he was of what he felt his thoughts were finding a centre a purpose but three months might not be long enough to finalise his plan would she agree once the emotion of the birth had faded would she still feel the same he darent ask not yet but he rang twice a day sometimes more and the pleasure in her voice said she might she must your grins getting fixed anton told him its stretching your face yeah he said dont do it anton said morosely three kids and its the end of life as you know it would you want your old life hell i cant remember my old life anton said its in the bottom of my wardrobe with my blue suede shoes figuratively speaking that is im not quite that old i just feel it but for all the whinging yeah i wouldnt give it back anton said smiling at his friend and if you take that final step neither will you she loved him she loved him she loved him she wanted him here that he wasnt next to her seeing roses first smile waking in the night next to her loving her felt wrong the promise shed made to betty seemed more and more impossible to stay here for ever when the man she loved was in sydneyhow could she but max wasnt asking her to go to sydney his phone calls and visits were all about now all about what rose was doing how the farm was going what was happening with the ancient sift td diesel max had found and had shipped to the farm so whos the tractor fanatic maggie teased just taking a polite interest he said innocently and she laughed to think of him her swish sydney surgeon now with a secret passion for tractorsmax her man he wouldnt keep coming unless he wanted her and she knew that shed go with him despite her promise but the promise still lay heavy on her heart the problem was that shed become part of this community betty was gone but her ghost lingered through the house a gentle approving presence maggie felt as a blessing all around her betty had manoeuvred this into a happy ending for the farm for the community and for angus and in a sense maggie had her happy ending as well she had her precious daughter who was already gurgling her delight at her world she was surrounded by people who loved her she and rose had their own part of the house the apartment betty had built was large sunfilled and lovely but sophie and paula were constantly in and out fascinated by rose bringing the house to life with their chatter and laughter and john and margaret were wonderful they were looking to buy their own home but there was no rush no rush at all this situation could extend indefinitely maggie thought if not for max three months he was gently patient but she knew now that patience disguised steady purpose he loved her he wanted her and he was making her fall more and more deeply in love with him at every visit a couple of months after roses birth maggie started doing two clinics a weekmorning sessions with no house calls it took some of the load from john and it felt good she was back to serving the little community of yandilagong that had been such an important part of williams past the reason she was here the farmthe second reason she was herewas great as well the tractors were like benign spirits with angus as their leader his calves were halfgrown now and friendly maggie watched angus and the calves and sophie and paula with bonnie and she started to think maybe a pup of her own would be fun but if she was to move to sydneymax had a hospital apartment a pup no how could it matter how could she put a pup above max he loved her there was no doubt about that and every time she saw him she knew deeper in her heart that this was the man she wanted to share her life with so what was the problem she could sell the farm to john and margaret she knew that theyd take care of angus and she could visit constantly shed done the best she could for betty for angus for the farm for williams beloved community it was onlyonly no she loved max and every time he phoned every time he visited she knew that her love was returned and more she was his woman his gaze lingered on her his kisses told her he wanted her that he was waiting only from some misguided sense of chivalry the wait didnt mean he didnt want herthe warmth of his voice on the end of the phone confirmed it hed said three months and he was sticking to it but after thatshe belonged to him as he belonged to her so she knew how this must end at the end of three months she knew hed come to claim his own and she knew what her answer must be and three months to the day he came hed rung the night before tomorrow hed said in a tone she couldnt mistake hed hardly said anything about three months forwell for three months but here it was and of course hed remembered ill be there at lunchtime he said wear something pretty so here she was at lunchtime wandering the house feeling like like shed made her decision and it was the right one even if it did involve a sense of loss rose was asleep in her little pink crib in her bedroom overlooking paddocks that swept down to the sea maybe they could find a house by the sea in sydney maybe her longing to be a country girl had been irrational shed be with max if he still wanted her he wanted her for months the sizzle had been building it was in his voice in his laughter even in his silence she couldnt mistake his desire for she felt exactly the same about him he made her toes curl speaking of toesshe looked down at her feet she was wearing skyblue opentoed sandals and shed painted her toenails crimson she was wearing a blue and white gingham dress with a bow at the back and sophie had tied her hair up in a blue ribbon hed ordered pretty she felt a bit like sandy from grease before the leather he was late what time are we expecting him margaret called from the kitchen my roastll spoil she wandered out to join maggie on the veranda and then turned toward the road is this him now maggie gazed out sizzle building like petrol on wildfireand then her sizzle faded this wasnt max it was an suv bright crimson with two surfboards on the roof rack wrong place margaret said so whats behind it john asked joining them the suv was slowing and turning into the driveway and a truck was following a huge truck big enough to hold the contents of a small house maybe angus has ordered another tractor john said looking out to where angus and bonnie were sitting on the sift td diesel that max had found the sift had been built in in france maggie knew that now she was starting to feel almost as affectionate toward the tractors as angus shed be able to come home to visit back she reminded herself sharply not home home would be in sydney with max max or not the truck and the suv were certainly coming in the suv drove slowly along between the tractors followed by the truck who was in them the sun was in her eyes but as the suv passed angus the window slid downward hey angus hey bonnie it was definitely max but what was with the truck had max brought angus another tractor a goingaway present she hadnt told angus she was going away she hadnt told john or margaret but maybe theyd guessed she didnt know herself yet she reminded herself sharply but that was stupid there was no choice max but why was he driving an suv with surfboards both truck and suv were pulling up now under the gums by the house a couple of burly guys climbed out of the truck and stood waiting max climbed out of the suv he was wearing jeans and boots and an opennecked checked shirt with his sleeves rolled up his hair looked sort of unruly he looked great she thought he lookedfree he reached back into the suv and lifted out a black and white ball of fluff set it gently on its feet a puppy a border collie like bonnie ten or twelve weeks old cute as a button the puppy looked around in astonishment and bonnie was off anguss tractor in a flash bounding down to check out the new arrival the puppy rolled onto its back while bonnie sniffed from all angles paying special attention to the rear no one moved it was like a very special test was being conducted but then bonnies tail wagged the puppy righted itself put a paw up and gently swiped at bonnies nose bonnie bumped him gently with her nose in return wagged her tail then turned and bounded back toward angus puppy in tow hey hes for maggie max called and angus even grinned share he said not if im going to sydney maggie thought wildly but still she couldnt say anything but he wasnt walking toward her max was unroping the surfboards from the roof of his car he lifted them down with loving care and laid them on the ground behind him the men had tugged open the van doors they were carrying outa sea kayak arent you going to help max demanded of the group on the veranda im paying these guys by the hour and john gave maggie a push that nearly sent her off the veranda without benefit of steps go help your man he said hes not maggie max called sounding exasperated ive brought you a surf board all the way from sydney and you dont even want to come see it oh and the front berth in this kayak is for you but and theres more stuff he called it might be a bit of a squash but it seemed too much bother to rent storage in sydney we can sort out what we dont want later but said maggie i think youd better go see dear margaret said smiling and smiling i might go in and turn the roast down john girls inside all of you dont leave me she didnt say it she thought it she was feeling like the veranda was swaying under her come and look max called peremptorily this time and finally she did walking cautiously down from the veranda and out through the garden the puppy came bounding to greet her and that gave her a moment to get her thoughts together or as much as she could kneeling to hug a squirming mass of black and white pup how had he known she wanted a puppy well never keep him happy in sydney she said and then heard what shed said and blushed from the toes up she was making all sorts of assumptionsor shed made assumptions and now they were being stood on their heads in a good way i always wanted a dog max said and she rose and watched while the pup wheeled back to bonnie her names bounce so hes not a gift she said cautiously hes a gift but you said you want a dog hes a gift to all of us i dont understand maggie this is a moving van he said motioning behind him as if she might not have noticed the van the two burly removalists the sea kayak the vast leathertopped desk they were now carting out its full of my stuff last time i was here i checked out a couple of empty sheds out the back i was hoping i might be able to unload it here whywhy would you want to do that ah he crossed the distance between them in a heartbeat but stopped six feet away as if reminding himself not to rush i was hoping youd guess he said he motioned back to the surfboards im also hoping you might teach me to surf you know how to surf she said struggling to breathe i can bodysurf i cant stand up i didnt have william to teach me so you brought all your furnitureso i could teach you to surf not all of it but i did bring my grandfathers desk isnt it great its big enough for both of us we can teach rose to read at this desk then theres my greatgrandmothers piano i have this really strong feeling that rose will be a piano player it cant go in the shed by the way itll need to have a bit of the sitting room do you think it can have a bit of your sitting room im living in a onebedroom apartment at the back of the house she said with an attempt to get things clear yes well theres moves afoot to change that he said smiling so much her heart felt like it was turning somersaults i hope i havent preempted things preempted you see john thinks this place could be a really wonderful medical centre here yandilagong he said patiently the town itself is small but the surrounding farming population is enormous the farmers all end up going to the city for their major medical needs but if there was a really good medical centre they wouldnt need to john and i have been talking to the politicians and theres nothing but enthusiasm john and you john and i her head was spinning so whats this got to do with pianos youre not giving me time he complained but still he smiled his lovely slow lazy smile and her heart was giving up somersaulting and going into freefall do you know how beautiful you are no i someone ought to tell you he said only that someone needs time like a lifetime max youre right im getting ahead of myself he said they were still standing about six feet apart stupidly formal his eyes werent leaving her face john thinks a big medical centre would work here he said hes a family doctor so are you margarets a dentist thats two and a half medicos already if we count you not going back to work full time i need to go back to work full time but do you want to with rose so young if there were supports in place so you didnt need to max maggie dont distract me he said or dont distract me more than youre already doing blue hair ribbons hey you said you wanted pretty i let sophie and paula choose sophie and paula have fine taste he said and grinned and then schooled his features into mock gravity enough let me get it all out in one hit so i can figure whether i should unload this van or just hightail it out of here she was trying to figure out whether he was laughing or he was serious she wanted to be closer to him but still he stood back watching her as if he had to lay it all on the line before any movement was possible we need more doctors he said more doctors for our hospital he explained as if she was a little bit thick you know the old hospital out on the headland its used now as a holiday camp but apparently its still government owned theres such medical need in this area its becoming a political hot potato and i have assurances that if we can guarantee staffing theyll reopen it so johns written to a friend of his whos also emigrating from zimbabwe shes a surgeon her husbands a farmer and her sons dream of surfing they think this place sounds great and then theres anton my anaesthetist his wifes going nuts him leaving home at six in the morning and not getting home until well after the babies are in bed this place is just what he needs as well youve donejohns done nothing you cant undo he said smiling and smiling was all he had to do to have her so deeply in love she could never climb out all you need to do is say the word he said john and i didnt want to say anything to you until we knew it was possible but were almost sure now so sure ive quit youve quit you sound like a parrot he said and his smile widened my beautiful parrot yes ive quit whwhy because i want to be a baby doctor again he said simply and surely maggie i want to deliver babies theres a huge population of young families locally and if anton and i are here then the mothers wont need to go to sydney for their confinements so thats what i want its what i want almost as much as the thing i want most in the world the really big thing the thing on which everything else depends i donti dont you dont know what that is he paused a long drawnout silence where the world stretched out before them infinite in its possibilities i told you the night rose was born he said softly im saying it again now maggie weve both been battered he said softly but we both know what love is and how wonderful it is that weve found it again its time now we acknowledged it took it in both hands and never let it go the night rose was born i knew that you had my whole life in your hands i love you maggie with all my heart for now for ever his words took her breath away it was like there were suddenly a thousand gifts showering down like the christmas morning of a childs dreams only better and better and better i also want to live here he said and it was like a tiny prosaic jolt that had her thinking no this wasnt dreaming this might even be true why didnt he move why didnt he take her in his arms was this a dream she couldnt quite believe it could be real johns found another farm max said and there was that in his eyes that said he understood exactly what she was feeling maybe he was feeling like that too hes put in a provisional offer provisional provisional on you marrying me she loved this man marriage soso let me get this right she stammered you want to leave sydney and come here foralways i never wanted to live in sydney anyway he said and his smile was a caress all by itself when alice died i walked away from my career and i didnt much care what direction i was heading theres a few of us like that at sydney south john escaping from the troubles in zimbabwe anton who came from france after a broken love affair and never left and then theres johns friend the surgeon theres a whole queue waiting for you to say the word the word yes he said softly just say yes there was too much to take in shed spent three months trying to work out how to break a promise yet here was the man she loved with all her heart telling her she neednt break it that the dream that had started with william was still precious but he was willingno he was demandingthat she share it it was too big it was making her head explode youd seriously come here to live she whispered awed and work its what i should be doing maggie he said his smile fading i should be taking care of mothers having babies thats what im trained for and i should be taking care of you i dont need to be taken care of i think you do but maggie if i can take care of you i promise to let you take care of me right back he said it quickly as if he seriously thought she was going to argue i want you to yell at me if you think im spending too much time working and not enough time with you id even like you to yell at me if i squeeze the toothpaste the wrong way i might yell back but if thats what you wanta spot of yellingi dont see me objecting i want you to teach me to surf and i want us both to teach rose i want to help angus with his tractors i want to help train bounce i want us to have more babies you want most of all i want what you want maggie he told her i want a happy beginning a family love and laughter from this day forth so what do you say maggie will you marry me youre too far away she whispered and he was with her before she finished saying it taking her in his arms he smiled down at her loving her with his smile and then suddenly he was kneeling before her and suddenly margaret with rose in her arms and john and sophie and paula were out on the veranda again not making a sound bearing witness suddenly the removalists had put the desk down to watch and suddenly angus was standing up on the tractor holding a dog firmly under each arm as if he was afraid they might interrupt nothing interrupted marry me max said again and he took her hand in his and held it to his lips this was crazy mad it was muddy he was kneeling in the mud asking her if shed marry him she had an audience hanging on her response joy began to well up inside herclearly this could be no dream she knelt down too your dress he said in mock horror blue and browns great she said and her eyes were inches from his she had both his hands in hers she had him right where she wanted him ask me again she said i think ive forgotten what was the question something about marriage right that he said sounding dazed and then he swore i knew i forgot something hang on a minute and he reached round to his back pocket and found a box a tiny crimson box he flicked it open it wasnt a ring it was a single diamond perfect sparkling in the sunlight making her catch her breath with wonder i didnt know how youd like it set he said so i thoughttheres so much youve done because you had no choice i thought if you said yes if i said yes if you said yes he went on resolutely we can get it set any way you want we can surround it with rubies we can embed it in gold or mount it on platinum you can have a woven plait band or a smooth one anything you like my love as long as you take me a package deal huh a package indeed he said and cast an amused look around at their audience a family a medical centre a medical partnership love all or nothing my beautiful maggie so im asking you again and im thinking surely this time you need to answer maggie croft love of my heart please will you marry me and what was a girl to say to that she put her hands on his face she drew a deep breath and she smiled into his loving eyes and she cast her future to the wind to blow where it willed with this man beside her yes she whispered yes i will my love my heart my life bachelor dad girl next door by sharon archer chapter one luke daniels ran an idle glance over the sleek silver motorcycle stopped in the lane beside him at the traffic light through his closed windows he could hear the throb of the powerful engine an unexpected spark of interest fought with deep unease itd been years since seeing a bike had had any sort of effect on him how odd that it should be now when he was back in port cavill to stayat least for the yearlong term of his contract but perhaps that was why port cavill the scene of his first medical failure are we nearly there his daughters sulky voice interrupted his dark thoughts not far allie he rolled his neck feeling the tiredness and tension in his muscles alexis she corrected with all the disdain a tenyearold could muster luke stifled a sigh he wasnt popular and there wasnt anything he could do about it except get on a plane back to england even the weather conspired to make things unpleasant the earlier sunny heat had given way to oppressive humidity which the cars airconditioning was struggling to cope with glowering banks of cloud still pressed down with the threat of more rain to come he studied allies sullen profile and debated whether to point out again that theyd only be here for a year long enough for him to help his father get back on his feet long enough to seem like a lifetime in a childs eyes times like this he longed for sueellens wise counsel but his wife allies mother had been buried two years ago so loving so giving and too damned young to die that person on the bikes waving at you dad who is it he looked in the direction of allies pointing finger i dont know the pillion passenger began pulling at the riders shoulder until the person must have retaliated with an admonition to keep still catching allies eye luke smiled kind of hard to tell with that helmet on isnt it his daughter shrugged letting him know a moment of shared humour couldnt woo her the lights changed and the bike pulled away sedately enough to merge into his lane ahead following slowly he allowed the distance to stretch because of the wet road the pillion passenger turned to check behind luke shook his head in irritation the action would shift the weight unbalance the bike he felt a twinge of sympathy for the poor rider movement from a side road caught his peripheral vision a car fishtailed into the intersection had the motorcyclist seen it heart pounding hands clenched on the steeringwheel he waited for the inevitable disaster suddenly the rider reacted the brake light flicked on too late luke muttered countersteer a split second later the rider obeyed his command relief quickly swooped into despair as the wheels skidded precariously on the slick surface in the time it took for rider to control the bike graphic memories of another less fortunate motorcycle leapt out of the past to assault him a battered racer twisted metal the smell of hot tar and spilled petrol the smell of blood his cousins moans of pain a line of sweat chilled lukes upper lip as he remembered the helplessness the hopelessness when hed realised the extent of kevins injuries nausea rolled through his stomach supersensitised now to the progress of the bike and the actions of the cars around it luke could feel irrational burning anger growing hed successfully suppressed the anguish for the thirteen years since the accident now in the blink of an instant it was all there raw and powerful he wished the rider would turn off so he could stop worrying about them but they were travelling inexorably in the same direction slowing more he let the distance widen until several other cars filled the gap by the time he got to his turnoff theyd disappeared relief was shortlived he turned into his parents driveway to see the bike parked on the gravel still helmeted and astride the machine the rider seemed to be delivering a welldeserved lecture to the dismounted pillion passenger thats aunty megan said allie hell luke clenched his jaw as a cold chill swept his body what was his baby sister doing hooning around port cavill on the back of a bloody motorcycle stay here he ordered his daughter as he flicked his seatbelt catch off he stalked towards the pair at the bike relishing the thought of tearing strips off them after the fright theyd given him luke megan launched herself at him enveloping him in an enthusiastic hug he clamped her close intensely thankful for her vitality and safety determined to make sure she stayed that way we werent expecting you until tomorrow we came straight through from the airport he said after a moment holding her away from him he frowned your bad luck i was here to see that stunt you and your friend here pulled back in town you think i want to spend my first day home scraping you two off the road oh dont you start too megan threw her hands up terri was just going off at me about it yeah luke aimed a black look at the rider maybe hell think twice before he takes you on the bike again but terris in fact lets make that official god hed been back in town for less than half an hour and he was already standing toe to toe with his sister part of his anger was tiredness but most of it was fear if he had the power to prevent it he wasnt going to lose another member of his family and this was definitely within his power youre grounded honestly luke megan planted her hands on her hips does mum know what youre up to im nearly eighteen her chin jutted defiance as she glared at him is that a no no its not a no she doesnt mind if im with terri she will after ive spoken to her he said grimly but terris a really careful rider too bad i dont want to see you on the back of this bike any bike again he directed a narroweyed look at the rider brown eyes so dark they were nearly black watched him the hint of wry amusement in them had him clenching his jaw against a scathing comment the motorcyclist took off the padded gloves and began fiddling with the helmet strap luke was reluctantly impressed that the boy was prepared to stay in the face of the conflict look terry this is a family argument you dont want to get involved mate all you need to know is megans off the social circuit until further notice theres no point hanging around gee thats going to be kind of tough luke said megan smugly since you guys are going to be working together what he turned on his sister you mean mums letting you go out with one of the hospital staff one of the doctors the sly look she slanted him should have been a warning terris taught me heaps luke felt his anger crank up several notches thats a recommendation i can do without said a husky feminine voice beside him the tirade hed been about to unleash faltered on his tongue the rider slipped off the helmet and balanced it on the handlebars long black hair slithered over the protective leather jacket as the woman dismounted and turned to face him hello luke long time no see terri he gaped his stunned brain struggling to put the name together with the evidence before his eyes theresa oconnor close enough how are you she held out a hand and he stared at it stupidly for a long moment bloody hell theresa oconnor he used her hand to tug her into a hug it was quick lasting only a second meant to be social asexual nothing to precipitate the volcanic heat that swept through him he swallowed and set her away at arms length her continued stillness her composure unsettled him out of all proportion especially the small smile curving her lips suddenly luke remembered the last time hed seen her on the moonlit beach at the bottom of the hospital grounds could it really have been twelve years ago the memory felt too intense she hadnt been so calm then though neither had he hed just kissed her he focussed on her mouth those lovely full lips had been soft and hesitant then eager even demanding beneath his until hed pushed her away he blinked and dragged his gaze back to hers she stepped away unruffled by their contact except for a telltale wariness in her eyes its terri mitchell these days yes of course he had so many questions but he felt oddly tonguetied his bodys unexpected response to her that hot fizz of recognition left him unbalanced his memory tripped in with details supplied over the years by his mother and theresas brother ryan theresa was widowed her husband killed when theyd been working with an aid organisation in africa an explosion shed been injured too he cleared his throat before speaking into the lengthening silence theresa i was sorry to no harm done she cut him off quickly a tiny flare of dismay in her dark chocolate eyes the smile on her lips looked stiff unnatural and he realised her misunderstanding had been deliberate theresa didnt want to hear his words of condolence she glanced behind him her smile warming you must be alexis your grandmothers told me all about you alexis this is an old friend of the family luke drew his daughter forward leaving his arm across her shoulders as he made the introductions he was pleasantly surprised when she leaned into his side instead of shrugging him off she glowed under theresas attention gone was the surly uncooperative child of mere minutes ago theresas serene surface was so firmly in place the moment of panic seemed as though it was a figment of his imagination still there was somethinga hint of sadness shadowing her eyes and smile with her attention on allie he could see it much more clearly after a few minutes theresa said ill leave you all to catch up properly mum said for you to come to tea tonight terri megan said oh thank your mum for me megan but i have some paperwork to do before tomorrow see you later alexis her friendly smile faded as she raised her eyes to his luke he wondered if her refusal of the dinner invitation was because of his arrival or if the paperwork excuse was genuine she mounted the bike slid the helmet over her luxurious hair her long slender fingers worked quickly to buckle the strap beneath her chin before she reached out to turn the key in the ignition the machine throbbed to life much to lukes surprise she rode down the extended driveway beside his parents house so i guess that means i can keep riding with terri megan said he sent her a noncommittal look well see luke he grinned at her wailed protest and slid his question in casually is theresa staying in the beach cottage terri she prefers terri terri then he raised an eyebrow uhhuh shes been renting it since she came back he wondered why his mother hadnt told him when shed been giving him updates on the latest port cavill gossip and that was what six months ago about megan shrugged its a hovel thats when you used to live there luke terris done it up really perhaps he might find an opportunity to wander down for a visit see how his old bachelor pad had scrubbed up learn more about the intriguing tenant or perhaps not he was here for a year and would have his hands full with the hospital his father and allie meeting terri again like this had tipped him out of kilter that was all he was tired maybe even a little jetlagged not thinking straight the last thing he needed was to complicate his life especially with someone who must thrive on excitement if the bike and her previous job were anything to judge by seeing her had plunged him into an odd time warp where he relived their kiss on the beach could it really have been twelve years ago he hadnt treated her particularly well that night rejecting her soft sympathy allowing his bitterness and guilt over his cousins death to colour the things hed said still she was obviously made of stern stuff shed gone on to do her medical training hed had no interest in women during the two and a half years since sueellens death how damned inconvenient that the sexual spark missing in his life since then should choose to wake up now in port cavill of all places with a colleague someone he needed to work with for the next year the time and place and person couldnt be worse terri parked the bike beside the cottage thankful to have made the short journey without disgracing herself by stalling or missing a gear or dropping the bike she huffed out a long breath before putting down the stand and dismounting on shaky legs luke was back helmet tucked under one arm she collected her handbag from the top box shed known he was coming home of course most of the daniels family had been in a happy buzz of anticipation for the last couple of weeks except for will daniels hed been upset that despite his recommendation the board had appointed luke to the position of hospital director a position shed been acting in since wills myocardial infarct worse was that the notification had only come yesterday terri had stifled her disappointment so she could reassure her convalescing boss that it didnt matter but it did matter shed been relishing the responsibility it was good for her challenging restoring her sense of self giving her a muchneeded focus for her shattered life she sighed perhaps even more distressing was her ridiculous fluttery reaction to luke how long had it been since shed felt that disturbing feminine awareness of a man such lightness had had no place in her life for so many years to have it now felt wrong frivolous she crossed to the door and let herself into the cottage her hand lingered on her helmet for a moment after shed placed it on the hallstand when luke had confronted her and megan the temptation to stay inside the fibreglass dome and hide behind the smoky perspex visor had been overwhelming behaviour much more in keeping with the starryeyed teenager shed been last time theyd met why couldnt she have been caught on the ward performing some marvellously complex medical procedure saving lives saving the world she mocked herself silently that would have been too perfect she slipped off her jacket and hung it on the peg by the door naturally luke had to arrive a day early catch her kitted out in motorcycle leathers and then mistake her for megans boyfriend still she thought shed handled the meeting with reasonable aplomb thanks to the helmet shed had a chance to gather her wits a little before revealing herself if anything it had been luke whod been nonplussed embarrassed by his mistake probably hed hugged her spontaneously she wrapped her arms around her body remembering the feel of his firm hold his torso pressed to hers for those long seconds not that it meant anything the daniels family was naturally delightfully demonstrative unlike the oconnors unlike the mitchells her husbands family had saved their affections for their causes and those theyd pursued with dedication and passion no sacrifice too great she grimaced chiding herself for her disloyalty hating the bitterness of her thoughts in the kitchen she filled the kettle while she waited for the water to boil she scanned the scrubby trees that bordered the back yard the sandy path to the beach was well hidden astounding that shed had the temerity to follow luke down the track all those years ago what a crush shed had on him poor sad child that shed been she shook her head then spooned a scant teaspoon of coffee into a mug that was the past this was now and she wasnt an angstridden teenager any more shed been marriedand widowed the explosion that killed her husband had ripped her life apart shed come to port cavill to give herself a chance to recover to regroup shed come here for peace nothing more as she contemplated the future she pursed her lips stepping into the role of director had given her a new sense of purpose shed been doing a damned good job even if the paperwork part of the job wasnt her forte now she had to step aside gracefully lukes return was difficult on so many levels peace would be in short supply while he was around she sighed at least their first meeting was over now next time she encountered him shed be working for him chapter two dressed only in jeans luke stood in the darkened room at the back of the house and stared moodily across the moonlit lawn he could make out the hump of the small cottage sheltered by trees at the edge of the lawn theresas place no not theresaterri was she tucked up asleep he glanced at his watch half past one in the morning hed be willing to bet she wasnt lying awake thinking about him the way he was about her he leaned his forearm on the wooden windowframe and contemplated his reaction to her that afternoon surely it had to be a product of his recent upheavalsthe move travelling worry over his father and alexis hed had eight happy years of marriage to sueellen hed loved his wife damn it during all the time theyd been together and since shed died he hadnt looked at another woman yet one tiny and very public hug with terri had evoked such a powerful memory that hed been swept back twelve years to the last time hed held her in his arms to a fiveminute interlude on the beach ridiculous potentially disastrous luke rubbed his jaw feeling the rasp of stubble perhaps he was overthinking this perhaps it merely demonstrated that it was time he did start thinking about a relationship or at least start preparing allie for the possibility that he might one day date bring someone a woman into the family he tried to picture that day but long dark silky hair and hot chocolate eyes stayed stubbornly in his mind he gave up let his thoughts dwell on the brief meeting that afternoon the way terri had deflected his condolences made him wonder about her was her grief still raw did she suffer any longterm posttraumatic stress symptoms a gnawing ache settled in his chest for the pain shed been through he could only begin to imagine the difficulty of losing someone the way she had so brutal and sudden he and allie had had time with sueellen poignant time for words of love reassurances promises heartbreaking but enriching moments to cling to in the days weeks years that followed her death terri hadnt had that shed had no chance to say goodbye before her husband had been snatched away he needed to be mindful of that sensitive to her needs and be ready to offer counselling in a professional capacity if she needed it as hospital director the welfare of his staff was paramount he was feeling the natural concern of a doctor for a colleague plus terri wasnt just a colleague but the sister of a friend the least he could do was offer support to ryan oconnors sister yes that was more like it he just needed to apply a bit of sound reasoning through the loosely screening shrubbery he saw the lights of the cottage come on almost as though the intensity of his musings had woken terri he snorted out a small breath how hopelessly fanciful so much for the power of common sense a few minutes later she walked across to the hospital in the moonlight the ends of a stethoscope looped around her neck dangled darkly on her pale tshirt she seemed to look up at his window a queer shaft of excitement made him draw a quick breath before he could block it one tiny glance from her and his heart was flopping around in his chest like a freshly caught flounder he shook his head in disgust terri was obviously the doctor on call tonight as his system settled he watched her disappear through the back door of the hospital and then reappear in the glasswalled corridor by angling his head he could follow her progress until she turned the corner leading to accident and emergency he should go back to bed and yet something held him at the window a moment later slow revolutions of lightblue red blue redbegan flickering off walls and gutters signalling the arrival of an emergency vehicle on the other side of the building he straightened and moving quietly walked back through to the main house to find a tshirt since sleep was so elusive tonight he might as well spend the time working with his new colleague propinquity in a hospital setting would be the best cure for this inconvenient fascination baggy unflattering clothing surgical caps masks booties that should take the edge off her appeal quick smart for his sanity he needed to start the therapy now familiarity bred contempthe had to believe it anticipation quickened his pace as he retraced her footsteps along the silent hospital corridor no sign of any staff in the casualty waiting room the ambulance was gone he skirted the main desk and entered the treatment area a palefaced woman sat in an open cubicle clutching a bowl her eyes closed and head tilted back to rest against the wall the nurse attending the woman turned and frowned im sorry sir you must stay in the waiting room and ring the bell if you need to see the doctor she yanked the curtain of the cubicle closed as she came towards him is dr mitchell around yes but you must im luke daniels the new director and you are oh dr daniels the line of her mouth thinned even further im dianne mills one of the nurses terris busy with an urgent case at the moment im here to help where is she ill take you through to her the womans subtle unfriendliness seemed to say that his assistance wasnt required or particularly welcome luke smiled grimly as he grabbed a gown from the shelf and followed her maybe she was right judging by the praise heaped on her by his parents terri was a very competent doctor shed recognised the signs of his fathers myocardial infarct even though will daniels had insisted it was just indigestion what had the stubborn old cuss been thinking a call to the cardiologist had confirmed that terris prompt actions had minimised damage to the cardiac muscle tests had shown lifethreatening partial occlusions in several other vessels and his father had been whisked in for triple bypass surgery whats the urgent case he asked as he tugged the gown over his clothes an unconscious teen brought in by two friends the girls couldnt wake her when they got her home weve got food poisoning cases coming in as well i was just about to call for backup she sent him a speculative look ill cover he smiled we can reassess later with dr mitchell if necessary dianne nodded her brief response wasnt encouraging perhaps he needed to work on his people skills they were still a distance from a closed curtain when luke heard a young womans clipped voice say i thought she should sleep it off but i ssaid we should bbring her here added a second shakier female voice even ththough its like two oclock in the morning youve made the right decision for your cousin terris even husky tones sent a light shiver over his skin sudden doubt needled at the belief that familiarity with her would help him he swallowed are you sure she hasnt take anything drugs terri asked um shshe no of course not said the aggressive voice of the first girl never luke stepped through the gap in the curtain and took in the situation with a sweeping glance two young women in their late teens stood to one side of a gurney dressed to the nines in their party clothes heavy makeup smudged beneath their eyes and an array of coloured streaks adorned their heads he caught the tail end of the ferocious glare the taller of the two girls used to browbeat her friend terris eyes lifted to his briefly in a moment of intense silent communication it was obvious she didnt believe the girls denial her eyes slid away and she moved to the head of the gurney where she bent over the patient laryngoscope in hand temperature up another halfdegree to fortyone point five terri said a nurse as she pulled up the patients skimpy knitted top and placed the diaphragm of her stethoscope on the pale skin thanks nina terri glanced up dianne could you get us some ice packs stat on my way dianne slipped out of the curtained cubicle keeping an eye on the activity at the gurney luke crossed to the teens im dr luke daniels he said calmly youre on your way home from a party a rave the taller girl gave him a superior look she was busily chewing gum and her eyes had the dilated pupils of someone whod taken some sort of substance over at portland apical pulse one forty bp seventy over forty sats seventy per cent folding her stethoscope the nurse turned away to collect a monitor from the side of the room luke turned his attention to the other teen was your friend able to walk out of the rave on her own wewe kind of um had to hhelp her was she talking to you then nno out of the corner of his eye he saw terri slide in the endotracheal tube airway in ready for the ventilator nina she straightened moving aside so the nurse could attach the unit stepping back around the gurney terri unwound her stethoscope and listened to both sides of the patients chest and her abdomen luke looked back at the shorter girl shivering beside him deliberately holding her eyes he said gently we need you to be honest and tell us how long ago she took something was it a tablet ththree hours shona well shshe did we all did they were only llittle pills jjust to give us a bboost thank you for your honesty said luke touching her arm to reassure her they were only es said the taller girl tossing her head theres nothing wrong with me and shona so it cant be the that those socalled party drugs affect everyone differently luke clenched his teeth against the urge to shake some sense into the girl you two have been lucky youre friend hasnt jjessie had leukaemia when she was a kid is that why shes so sick now a wave of despair at their folly cramped his chest and stomach he was aware of terris eyes on him but he refused to meet her gaze he didnt need to see the pity that she undoubtedly felt for him shes ggoing to be okay isnt she were doing everything we can for her he ushered them towards the curtain well get you to wait outside dianne came back in with cloths and the cold packs ill organise those dianne thanks said luke taking them from her can you show the girls to a room where they can wait and get nextofkin information from them please ccould we have something to drink luke met the nurses concerned eyes a glass of fruit juice for them please dianne and perhaps see if theres an apple or two in the staffroom as dianne showed the girls out terri said im going to have to set up a central line for fluids right you scrub well monitor jessie and get your equipment set up he said wrapping the cold packs and placing them in jessies groin and armpits hed organised a trolley with the required sterile packs by the time terri had finished at the sink gown gloves he nodded to the second trolley the soft rustling noises as she gowned up tormented him while he concentrated on opening the catheterisation kit and dropping drapes onto the sterile work surface do me up please he turned to see her encased head to toe in surgical green her elbows bent and gloved hands held relaxed in front of her maintaining her sterile working space he knotted the straps at the nape of her neck then reached down to do the same at her waist the warmth he could feel on the tops of his fingers made them clumsy try as he may he couldnt close his mind to the enticing curve of the small of her back she turned to face him brown eyes huge and dark stared at him from above her mask his breathing hitched he was a fool to think hospital clothing would instantly dissolve terris appeal hed never seen anyone look quite assexy while preparing for an aseptic procedure luke he blinked looked down to see she was handing him the tab for the outside string she turned in front of him and took back the string thanks he swallowed perhaps he should have gone back to bed after all let dianne call in the emergency backup turning away he snipped across the shoulder of jessies top exposing her clavicle and neck nina came back with a bag of saline and began to set up the drip monitor a moment later dianne stuck her head around the curtain ive got contact details for jessies mother theyre down from melbourne staying with relatives for the weekend thanks dianne ill make the call now he took the paper from her and went to the phone with the line ringing at the other end luke tucked the receiver under his ear terri the ambos are at your uncles place dianne said hes aggressive and hypotensive theyre concerned about trying to establish an iv so i suggested they scoop and run good idea terri said hows mary going with the rest of the racepicnic followups all done now dianne said shes just managed to get through to matt in garrangay about the macintoshes ill go and set up a cubicle for your uncle thanks dianne terri said nina can you see if theres any word from the lab tech on call well really need to be able to run some bloods through tonight will do luke pressed redial when the ring tone timed out with the receiver held to his ear he turned to look in terris direction her work was quick neat methodical he congratulated himself on being able to view her nimble fingers with detachment sure she was a pleasure to watch but then he always enjoyed seeing someone perform a task well the peculiar feelings that keep threatening to muddle his mind when he was close to her had to be a product of his stressful few weeks organising his trip back here hello the sleepy voice pulled his attention back to the phone a short time later he hung the receiver back on the wall cradle and allowed himself a brief moment to close his eyes weariness washed through him as his sympathy went out to jessies mother what a nightmare for a parent he straightened and turned around to find terris eyes on him as she stripped off her gloves and mask the beauty she brought to the everyday movements stopped the words in his mouth shes on her way in yes he cleared his throat relieved when muscles moved back to normal function stepping back to the side of the gurney he said her brothers bringing her in terri moved to stand beside him even with the pervasive smells of the hospital he was piercingly aware of the subtle scent of soap she brought with her of her vitality her fineboned femininity the warmth in her dark eyes this must have been a hard case for you on your first night here his mind abruptly went back to the night of the kiss the parallels with the sympathy shed shown him then he wanted it just as little now he wasnt sure what it was that he did want from herbut he knew it wasnt that he rolled his shoulders its always hard seeing someone as young as jessie taking risks like this with the rest of her life yes her lashes lowered but not before hed seen a quick flash of hurt at his brushoff an apology hovered on his tongue instead he picked up jessies chart and began detailing her treatment were looking at an icu transfer for her i havent made the call yet the first priority was getting her stabilised her voice was all cool business he must have imagined the moment of vulnerability he nodded and recorded another complete set of observations the girl seemed to be holding her own with her oxygen saturation and blood pressure markedly improved her temperature was steady youve done a good job terri the curtain rattled beside them terri your uncles two minutes away thanks dianne be right there you happy to take micks case luke asked glancing at her as he slotted his pen into the shirt pocket under his gown yes of course he nodded ill call the air ambulance organise jessies transfer the numbers on the wall by the phone terri turned to leave he couldnt stop his gaze from following her for the few paces it took her to clear the cubicle he breathed out a sigh aware of the odd tension ebbing from his body with her disturbing presence gone his physiology was more like that of a teenager he was a grown man a widower with a daughter he dragged a hand down his face the effect she had on him had to wear off soon for his sanity it had to be soon terri hurried through the department confusion churning through her stomach luke had shut her out just as he had all those years ago on the beach well what had she expected they werent friends ryan had been his friend she was just ryans bratty little sister it was probably all the years of hero worship and then that kiss on the beach that made her feel as though she knew luke better than she did she sighed still hed be good to work forwhich was a relief she could see that much from this short stint it had been a pleasure the way hed fitted in so well picking up the reins knowing what she needed and facilitating treatment hed deferred to her position as the doctor on call while still commanding respect from everyone in the cubicle the nurses the teens herself the teens rebellion had melted away in the face of his charm information just flowing out of them under his nonjudgemental questioning the way hed spoken with jessies mother had been wonderful his velvety voice so full of compassion and caring and hed complimented her handling of the case in all the years of working with peter her husband had never done that lukes praise meant a lot more than it should not good scratch the surface and there was still a really bad case of hero worship going on underneath she was going to have to keep clear of him as much as possibleat work and away from it which might be difficult as she lived at the bottom of his parents garden still she had no reason to think that he would seek her out shed been the one doing the chasing all those years agoeven if she hadnt realised it at the time things were different now she wasnt chasing anyone she had enough on her plate to try to find her courage to learn to like the woman she was chapter three terri met the ambulance at the door desperately trying to look as professional as possible her uncle lay still and pale his beloved face slightly distorted beneath the oxygen mask a large white dressing was taped to his forehead seeing him like this made her heart twist but she pushed the feeling away he needed her competence now not her love frank began his handover as they wheeled the trolley through to the treatment room she was aware of dianne and the police sergeant following them between them they transferred him to the hospital gurney frank stepped back and continued his report there was a smashed bottle of beer on the floor looks like hed slipped in it and hit his head on the corner of the sink ive dressed the laceration on his forehead it hadnt bled much he said we found him sitting against the kitchen cupboard after we got the goahead to scoop and run all the fight went out of him hes been as quiet as a lamb okay thanks frank terri leaned over her patient her hand on his shoulder as she tried to rouse him uncle mick open your eyes if you can hear me the lashes flicked up and his dry lips stretched into a smile that was more of a grimace he fumbled with the mask and terri helped him pull it away noting the sweetish ketotic odour of his breath tee he used his nickname for her and for some reason that gave her an instant of misgiving should she have stayed with jessie handed this case over to luke as hed offered whatre you doing here love she shook off the doubt responsibility for the emergency department was hers tonight luke being here was a bonus not an opportunity to get him to deal with her family do you remember what happened uncle mick but his eyes closed again and he mumbled an indistinct response bp is ninety over sixty said dianne right terri slipped her stethoscope on and listened to the irregular rhythm of his heartbeat lets get an ecg going please dianne as the nurse snipped off his tshirt and began attaching the leads terri slipped a tourniquet on micks arm and bent over his hand after a moment she moved on to his wrist and then quickly to his elbow beneath her fingertips she could feel the telltale springiness of a small vein good enough to establish an intravenous line she hoped so it would be so much quicker and less complicated than putting in a central line the sooner mick started rehydrating the sooner they could get him stabilised im going to put a needle in your arm uncle mick she slipped the cannula into place and released the tourniquet permitting herself a moment of relief as she taped it securely she carefully drew off a syringe of blood hows that ecg looking typical hypokalaemic changes replied a deep voice luke terri took a breath willing her heart to settle surely jessie hadnt been picked up already ninas specialling jessie he said as though hed read her mind shell call me if she needs me the transfer chopper is still half an hour away she glanced over to where he examined the ecg strip he tilted the readout so she could see the flattened t peaks thanks its what i expected lets get him started on normal saline iv with thirty millimoles of potassium im on it dianne pivoted away to the bench luke held out his hand for the syringe the lab techs in youll want a priority on the electrolytes and glucose when they can for the cbc urea and creatinine yes please thanks shed just opened her mouth to add a request when he said ill organise a strip reading for the blood glucose so you can set the insulin infusion right there it was againthat intuitive understanding of her work rhythm it was fantastic and a little unnerving with anyone else she was sure shed have revelled in the experience but because it was luke there seemed to be a level of intimacy associated with it that she badly needed to deny but what could she say stop reading my mindstop doing such a great job terri shrugged mentally and settled for thanks she turned back to her patient and flicked on her pen torch im going to shine a light in your eyes uncle mick she lifted each eyelid and watched as the pupils in the deep brown irises expanded and contracted readily equal and reactive at least it looked like he didnt have a head injury to complicate things further blood sugar twentythree said luke okay dianne appeared beside her the nurse reeled off the potassium level in the saline bag then held it so terri could check the label correct terri said she walked around to the other side of the gurney so she could more easily examine the wound on his forehead i want to have a look at your cut uncle mick fluids set terri said dianne thanks a jagged flap of skin had curled back from the triangular laceration but the area looked quite clean a simple irrigation and suturing job no no her quiescent patient erupted into unexpected action so quick one moment she was lifting the dressing and the next she was flying across the room in slow motion she watched the horror on frank and diannes faces from the other side of the gurney their hands uselessly reaching towards her she saw the sergeant step forward his mouth tight as he restrained her flailing patient any moment now she was going to hit the floor paradoxical that she had so much time to notice everyones expressions but none to organise her limbs to save herself from the inevitable painful sprawl but it didnt happen hands reached her catching her from behind cradling her against a hard warm body her uncle lay back down in the milliseconds in which she struggled to understand what had happened she turned her head and looked up into lukes grim face how had he managed to get across the room to save her are you all right pain bloomed in her cheekbone replacing the numbness of a second ago his face dissolved and she realised her eyes were tearing up yes thanks she tried to move away but his hands held her firmly preventing her escape short of an undignified struggle she was helpless to free herself luke was so large and hot and solid she felt fragile insubstantial utterly feminine though it must have only been seconds time seemed elastic stretching to allow her to feel every square inch of contact he turned her slightly she could feel his bracing arm behind her back the fingers that curved around the top of her arm go and get some ice on that he sounded gruff his eyes still fixed on her face were dark she blinked the tears into submission embarrassed at this sign of weakness i have a patient to attend to im taking over i need to you need to stand down and let someone else handle this dr mitchell his voice lowered losing its sternness i can feel you trembling terri you need to go and sit down her defiance ebbed away making her realise how shaken she felt yes okay he frowned suddenly and tilted his head to look at her more closely his fingers tightened on her flesh you have a slight nosebleed do i as soon as she spoke she could feel the trickle just below her nostril knowing there was physical evidence of her injury made her feel even more vulnerable an uncomfortable sensation she pulled out of his grip and this time he released her go and clean up ill finish here then come and have a look at you he turned back to her uncle on the gurney she hesitated briefly then realised that the others had meshed into a team around luke to treat her uncle she spun on her heel and left the room i found you at last at the sound of lukes voice from behind her terri jumped the boxes of twelvegauge needles shed been handling scattered across the shelf i wasnt hiding she said not entirely truthfully how long had he been standing there watching her hmm how are you feeling im fine when shed restacked the boxes and regained some of her composure she turned he was leaning against the doorjamb his arms folded one foot crossed over the other a plain black tshirt stretched over the chest shed so recently been clamped against good lets have a look at you then shall we a slow smile curved his mouth as though he read her reluctance and thought it amusing i dont think we need to but thank you anyway she said shooting him a discouraging stare shed never appreciated how absurdly claustrophobic the long narrow room was with the wellstocked shelves towering along the walls it was all his fault of course the way he was blocking the only exit i think we might let me be the judge of that his smile took on a distinctly determined edge just think of it as my self interest terri picked up her clipboard and hugged it tightly in front of her torso self interest in what way if i dont think youre up to it ill take over the rest of your shift he waited with an expression of polite interest as she thought of and discarded several weak excuses oh all right lets get it over with then she muttered the thought of his hands on her even in a professional capacity was nerveracking the imprint of their earlier contact still plagued her her back to his chest his fingers on her arms as he turned her she forced down a swallow and pushed away the distracting memory where do you want to do it he raised a brow and his lips tilted she felt heat leap through her system oh god had she really said that please let the floor open up and swallow her now the exam cubicle three is empty still grinning he moved to one side and stood with his back pressed against the shelf did he think she was going to squeeze past him no way after you he shrugged sure she breathed a sigh when he moved but it was shortlived relief with his back to her she could appreciate the broadness of his shoulders the way his torso tapered to his waist and hips the long long legs the easy way he moved her mouth felt suddenly dry just outside the door he turned looking back at her one brow raised quizzically she realised her feet were still planted in the middle of the supplyroom floor silently cursing her distraction she tightened her fingers on the clipboard and hurried to catch up she walked stiffly to the curtained area aware of him striding beside her his lithe trim body moving smoothly unlike her limbs which felt all angles and awkward gracelessness perched on the edge of the bed she watched him bend to wash his hands her eyes were irresistibly drawn to the denim pulling over the line of his buttocks when he straightened to rip a piece of paper towel from the dispenser she looked away quickly as he stepped in front of her she let the deep breath shed taken trickle out this was a professional examination one colleague of another hospital director of staff doctor it would only take a few minutes look past me you know the drill hmm focus on a point on the wall he raised his hand and shone a thin beam of light into her eyes have you had bleeding from the nose before um a couple of times she was acutely aware of his face near hers as he assessed her pupil recently no how long ago he moved to her other eye and again bent towards her to do the examination oh um years then she remembered the exact occasion the landmine blast which had killed peter and killed her future nausea rushed down on her sweat popped out of her pores leaving her clammy and chilled itwasum aa couple of years there was a small silence are you all right terri youve gone very pale the blood abruptly rushed back to her head filling her face with heat sweeping away the faintness yes yes really im fine at least he hadnt commented on her stumbling hesitation youyou asked about nosebleeds its been a couple of years nothing since he frowned as he straightened up seeming to weigh her response for dissimulation she looked away from the measuring blue eyes the last of the nausea receded no how heavy were your previous bleeds she frowned and pulled back pulling herself together at the same time ive had a tiny nosebleed here not an arterial haemorrhage yes of course he appeared to shake himself mentally as he slipped the penlight back into his top pocket im going to examine your cheek fine she said through tight lips closing her eyes hoping to shut him out so close so threatening to her peace of mind a rustle of fabric the tiniest feather of air across her skin had he moved closer just the thought made her heart kick into a frantic irregular rhythm she was too scared to open her eyes to check a few tense seconds passed why didnt he just get on with it then the subtle torture began gentle probing fingers travelled down her nose across her cheekbone around her eye socket nasal bone glabella maxilla zygomatic breathe in and out in and out perhaps if she recited the muscles there were so many of them she couldnt think of a single name closing her eyes had been a bad idea sure it meant she couldnt see him but the other sensory information was overwhelming the heat of his body reached out to her his smellpart soap part tantalising masculine musksurrounded her small whispery sounds of each inhalation exhalation how much more measured and normal his breathing was than hers his touch was warm and deft the skin beneath his fingertips was alive with nerve endings nearby cells seemed to quiver in anticipation of their turn she swallowed feeling so thoroughly shaken now that she didnt dare open her eyes lest he read her ragged state think of something else now work the emergency department hows uncle mick she said dismayed to hear her breathlessness uncle mick he sounded preoccupied oh yes mick after a moment he cleared his throat im just waiting for the blood results to come back particularly the sodium level i noticed you had a halfstrength saline bag standing by yes she pushed the answer out working hard to keep her tone even concentrate on work on the technicalities that would surely bring her back to an even keel i was worried about hyperosmolar hyperglycaemia his fingers stopped moving the tips resting softly on her skin the moment hung oddly alive with possibilities had he finished finally she opened her eyes and looked straight into his so close he looked almost puzzled his pupils were huge making his eyes dark and intense for a second she thought she read a match to her own helpless awareness in the inky depths was it real or was she desperately trying to see something so shed feel better something to tell her that she wasnt the only one caught by this sensual spell hard on the heels of that thought she realised it would be better if the weakness was hers alone how much more difficult might it be to resist the temptation to explore this if she knew he felt the same way dr daniels diannes voice broke the spell shock shuddered all the way to terris toes luke snatched his hands away from her face as though she were contaminated he blinked and the earlier intense look was gone now his expression was easy to read shock plain and simple the labs just rung through the results for the sodium and blood sugar on mick butler said dianne seeming not to notice anything amiss terri felt heat rushing to her face she wanted nothing more than to cover her cheeks with her hands bowing her head she brushed a crease on her scrubs results yes good luke cleared his throat his apparent discomfort was a small balm to terris frazzled system er what are they sodium one hundred and forty glucose twentyfour right thanks dianne the rasp had gone from his voice we wont need to change to the halfstrength normal saline out of the corner of her eye terri saw him dig his hands into his jeans pockets hows your nose terri asked dianne that was a real thump mick gave you im fine terri looked up making her lips stretch into what she hoped was a reassuring smile no lasting damage just a bit tender are you sure diannes hazel eyes searched her face yes oh god think of something to say before dianne says anything else the woman was a fantastic emergency department nurse but no diplomat but terris rattled brain didnt produce anything in time youre looking very flushed almost feverish do you think youve got a temperature will you be all right to stay on duty terri scowled as she slipped off the bed yes of course ill be right to work the rest of the shift if i look flushed its because the two of you are looking at me as though im something squashed on a microscope slide perhaps you could both take yourselves off and find some other poor specimen to peer at unconcerned by the tart response dianne grinned then delivered her parting comment youre going to have a shiner such a good look for an accident and emergency doctor terri muttered she glanced at luke are you going home now will you be okay for the rest of the night his voice was low and warm yes of course she said briskly she needed to take herself in hand his concern was professional she couldnt let that lovely rich voice fill her with this inappropriate neediness thanks for your help and um for catching me no problems he smiled briefly ill leave you to it then she watched him go if her roiling confusion was anything to judge by it was going to be a physically and mentally draining twelve months perhaps it was time to consider moving on her contract only had six months left but she didnt want to move shed been thinking about extending her contract it felt wonderful to be home comfortable safe reassuring after the trauma shed been through it felt like the best place for her while she got back on her feet port cavill had everything wonderful people gorgeous setting a great hospital a worldclass motorcycle track unfortunately it also had luke but it only had luke for a year could she survive that long chapter four terris cottage door was open but there was no answer to his knock through the window luke could see the small sitting room a subdued golden glow from the lamp made it cosy and welcoming in the dusk a far cry from the cramped and messy look hed cultivated while using the cottage as his bachelor pad in his late teens he hesitated she couldnt be far away perhaps down on the beach should he follow her down there perhaps he should take her absence as an opportunity to slide away unnoticed hed been calling himself all the fools under the sun for coming down here anyway but when his feet moved it was to follow the path around the cottage past her bike tucked in the rickety garage the shushing of waves grew steadily louder as he approached the line of trees edging the grounds he picked his way through the grove and paused on the open sand breathing in the salty tang of the ocean moonlight washed the scene with a ghostly aura a short distance away terri stood at the edge of the water her hands tucked into the back pockets of her jeans a floppy knitted top clung to her slender curves her head tilted slightly as she stared out to sea she paid no heed to the wave ripple creeping towards her naked toes at the last moment it paused and slid away again without daring to touch she seemed lonely sad he had a powerful urge to reach out to her to offer comfort or was it something else hed kissed her on this very spot hard to believe it was a dozen years in the past he could remember how she tasted sweet with a promise of spice remember the night of the schoolies party the question was out before he could think better of it she had a powerful effect on hima walk down memory lane with her was a torment he could do without besides that night didnt reflect well on him of course slowly she turned her head to look at him dark shadows from the bruising beneath her eyes made her look mysterious almost exotic reminding him how little he knew about her i wasnt kind to you that night hed wanted to take what shed offeredand more much more hed wanted to grab to hold on to lose himself in her sweetness her gentle sympathy somehow hed found the sanity and strength to pull back to send her away but he hadnt done it graciously she shrugged and looked away i wasnt asking for your kindness i only wanted to talk to you about getting a medical degree i know he frowned had the kiss that came back to haunt him after all these years meant nothing to her she sounded so indifferent that he felt an inexplicable urge to push to get a reaction from her im surprised i didnt put you off you werent that bad she took her hands out of her pockets and bent to pick something up he swallowed unable to look away from the unconscious provocation of jeans pulled tight against her curved buttocks the knitted top rode up exposing a small wedge of pale skin gone in a flash as she straightened she bent to examine a curved shell in her long fingers her face hidden by a curtain of wavy dark hair it was a little shorter now than it had been when hed buried his fingers in it twelve years ago he pulled his mind back to the conversation wasnt i perhaps the incident loomed much larger in his mind because sobriety the following day had brought sneaking shame at his behaviour that isnt how i remember it you were grieving for your cousin she slanted him a look as she pushed the thick curls back over her shoulder this must be a first for gender interaction he huffed out a small laugh feeling irrationally frustrated with her im trying in a roundabout way to apologise for the things i said and youre busy making excuses for me i took my anger out on you she grinned at him her teeth gleaming in the subdued light would you feel better if i said youd been callous and cruel and ive never recovered that im bitter and twisted with an abiding fear of beaches he felt suddenly foolish maybe not but he realised that some tiny part of him wanted a sign that their exchange on that longago evening had meant something to hereven as he recognised his folly her hands tipped the shell from palm to palm as she contemplated him for a moment want to walk she said waving a hand vaguely along the beach just along to the rocks and back sure he levered off his runners and hooked his fingers into the heels sand sifted between his toes in a soft caress when terri moved away he fell into step with her the gentle sibilance of the waves filled a small silence he felt an odd mixture of relaxation and intense awareness of every move that she made you said something important to me that night her voice was deliciously husky easy to listen to now i am worried wisdom brewed in a beer bottle he grimaced should he be embarrassed or pleased that she apparently remembered something after all what pearl did i drop that one of the hardest lessons is not being able to save everyone ah yes an echo of his harsh feelings trickled through his memory such bitterness and anger at the senselessness of his cousins death what chance had terri had to soothe his pain yet shed tried after hed pushed everyone else away and shed succeeded to a degree their kiss had distracted him it was that he remembered most clearly about that night not his grief you were right failure can be hard to live with she sounded sombre was she thinking about her husband had she tried to save him after the explosion he was trying to frame a diplomatic question when she said you were talking about kevin werent you a shadow darkened his mood for a moment his cousin had been young full of promise full of male bravadoa reflection of himself mmm i was still pretty raw she tilted her head to look at him you were very close we grew up together the simple sentence couldnt begin to describe their relationship his throat grew thick mum used to say that we were more like twins than cousins they reached the rocks and silently turned to retrace their steps she stopped to throw the shell into the water then scrubbed her hands together when she turned her gaze met his dad said you were working on kevin when he arrived at the scene hed forgotten that her father had been the local police sergeant at the time itd been her father who had pulled him away from kevins body when the paramedics had arrived a band of stiffness tightened around his larynx he cleared his throat it wasnt enough in the small pause that followed he watched a wave ebb its highest point marked by a thin line of froth i felt responsible for the accident why her voice held only curiosity nothing more would she judge him when she knew the whole story every now and then he still wondered if hed done things differently if hed picked his words more carefullybut thinking that way was pointless he flexed his shoulders feeling the old weight of his dereliction wed argued about his recklessness kevin rode as though he was immortal he lifted his eyes back to hers hell i suppose we both did he didnt even make it through the first bend i saw him hit the car head on oh luke he could hear her distress felt unexpectedly soothed by the knowledge it was for him i grew up after that it wasnt your fault she put her hand on his arm he stared down into her eyes for a long second feeling his heart twist still got that soft heart havent you terri i know it wasnt my faultnow at the time he shrugged after a moment he reached out to stroke her cheek her skin soft and cool beneath his fingertips she shivered and desire punched into him shortening his breath tightening his gut would she resist if he pulled her close folded her into his body covered her lips with his finished what theyd started all those years ago right here right now the connection stretched then she snatched her hand back removing it from his elbow and folded her arms he dragged in a huge breath and took a mental step back youre cold we should go in yes head down she made a beeline for the trees at the top of the beach almost as though she was trying to escape had she sensed the desperation with which hed held himself in check he smiled grimly surely if she had shed be running the silence between them wasnt comfortable touching her had created a tension that hadnt dissipated even though the physical link had broken so how are you settling in and alexis terri sounded slightly out of breath still because of him or was it the cracking pace shed set he grasped at her change of subject relieved one of them was functioning above waist level okay he thought of yesterdays asthma attack and the dramatics which had preceded it allie says ive blighted her young life by dragging her halfway around the world to the back of beyond she wanted me to leave her behind with one of her friends she must miss them terri said softly were only here for a year shell make new friends if she gives herself the chance he was dismayed by the defensiveness he could hear in his voice in reaction to terris gentle compassion for his daughter frustration mixed with selfdisgust at least talking about this took his mind off the other source of frustration walking up the sandy path ahead of him though not entirely even in the dim light he could see terris slender hips swaying in her pale jeans what are her hobbies hobbies oh hobbies yes god get a grip man what were his daughters hobbies soccer she plays soccer theres a junior soccer league she can join he reached up to push a low branch out of the way actually thats a damned good idea thanks a years a long time when youre her age she said a few steps later itll be a bloody long time when youre my age if shes going to sulk for the whole time terri chuckled thanks for the sympathy he muttered holding back a selfdeprecating smile sorry im not really laughing at you kind humour mixed with the understanding in her soft words it must be difficult for both of you mmm im only being spoken to when she cant avoid it the way shes behaving ill need to get her intensive counselling to recover maybe i should book some for myself while im at it he was making light of the situation but his heart was weighed down by the knowledge of his daughters unhappiness there was no way around it he was committed to helping his father for this year im sure youll work it out terri stepped onto the veranda of the cottage well this is my stop he should go but her obvious relief made him push his welcome just for a few minutes more a chance to work on his familiarity plan give it another opportunity to kick in besides he needed the small respite before facing the tension back at the house i wouldnt say no to a cup of coffee her pleased look faded he suppressed a smile and waited wouldnt you she turned her head slightly as though she made a quick inventory of the rooms it made him wonder what she didnt want him to see but all she said was youd better come in then thanks they wiped the sand off their feet at the door itll just be instant she said glancing at him as he followed her into the compact kitchen in the artificial light he clearly saw the purpleblue smudges forming under both her eyes and a faint bruise on the bridge of her nose coffee she froze with the jar clutched to her chest as he stepped closer what are you doing hows your nose cupping her face he tilted it to the light her carotid pulse jumped against the edge of his hands masculine satisfaction surged through him fine no sign of any problems after last night her skin felt soft and smooth beneath his finger tips no none she scowled have you finished was he his gaze dropped to her mouth if he leaned forward just a little he would discover if reality was as delicious as his memories of their kiss temptation wrestled with good sense then the opportunity was gone as terri pulled back out of his light hold you wont get your coffee unless you get out of my kitchen she said tartly why dont you sit at the table he stifled a sigh and retreated slipping onto one of the chairs and allowing himself to follow her with his eyes watching her was like indulging in a visual feast filling the jug getting out the mugs spooning in the coffee commonplace everyday things but there was nothing commonplace about his reaction he shifted on the chair easing the snugness of his jeans to take his mind off her he looked around the room ochre walls made the little room cheerful at the end of the bench a distressed dresser displayed an eclectic collection of china the cupboards had been stripped back and varnished to show off the warm grain of baltic pine youve made the place nice a vast improvement on when i lived here thanks she smiled slightly and switched off the jug i must admit i prefer butterscotch paint to walltowall centrefolds god were they still up an unexpected wave of selfconsciousness threatened to heat his face as though he was an awkward adolescent every single anatomically enhanced one of them she slid him a cheeky look if id known you were coming back i could have saved them for you he snorted his momentary embarrassment evaporating i like my women more natural these days like you the unspoken words reverberated in his head she smirked at him obviously comfortable again now that he was at a distance the devil in him wanted to see that composure shaken again to know that he wasnt the only one affected by this inconvenient attraction theres another reason why i was so hard on you that night on the beach she eyed him warily there was oh yeah he drawled i fancied the pants off you no her mouth opened in a perfect circle of shock she blinked at him then burst out laughing nervous laughter that only lasted for a moment before she stopped and stared at him again yes he grinned enjoying her reaction oh come on her movements were jerky as she turned back to the bench to pick up a spoon the staccato clatter of metal on china filled the room he could imagine her marshalling her defences after a moment she said you barely knew who i was oh i knew all right he murmured as she turned with the hot drinks in her hand the only sign remaining of her agitation was the heightened colour in her cheeks you used to haunt your uncles racetrack she handed him a steaming mug thanks he considered her over the rim as he took a small sip your brother warned me off ryan did he she wrinkled her nose in disbelief sure he warned off a few of us hed have dismembered me if hed known some of the things id thought about you things hed have liked to share with herwould still like to share with her i never realised i must make sure i thank him for his interference she shook her head her lips curved with amusement and here i thought i was the most unpopular girl in school all the boys wanted to be my friend but never my boyfriend it was selfpreservation he grinned raising the mug to take another mouthful flirting with her was funregardless of whether it was a good idea it had been a long time since hed done something just for the fun of it i half expected a visit from your brother after i kissed you that night you thought id run home and tell she gave him an oldfashioned look and signalled for him to follow her along the hall over her shoulder she said why would i advertise the fact that youd rejected me i wasnt rejecting you he said as she led the way into the lounge oh yes i was kissed by the local heartthrob and then told he didnt want to babysit that was a rejection in my book she curled into one of the overstuffed chairs and looked at him with a small enigmatic smile on her lips local heartthrob his cheeks warmed this woman could really throw his system for a loop give me a break tsk im telling this story not you she waved an airy hand dismissing his protest my poor seventeenyearold ego was thoroughly battered luke grinned at her you seem to have recovered just fine some scars dont show she arched an expressive brow at him he felt his smile slip god she was so tempting the offer to make amends was ready to leap off his tongue with an effort he stifled the unruly impulse that was not the sort of familiarity he needed to cultivate with terri shaking himself mentally he looked around the room his eyes settling on a collection of photographs on the mantelpiece he stood and crossed the room to pick up one of the pictures an unsmiling man stared out of the frame tanned goodlooking intense he glanced at terri is this your husband yes her fingers curled around her mug and she blew on the liquid as though cooling it was the most important thing in the world the easy relaxed atmosphere was gone in an instant and he was sorry to have been the one to destroy it he hesitated then said mum told me he was killed in a landmine explosion yes her monosyllabic answers discouraged further questions she was obviously troubled and he wanted to get past the barrier she was putting up yesterday he put the picture back and moved to the sofa you cut me off when i was going to offer my condolences she shrugged nothing will undo whats happened you were with him when it happened he said gently as he sat down yes her expression was shuttered were you injured i walked away she hadnt really answered the question and he sensed there was much more to the story it must have been traumatic you could say that she hunched over her mug resolutely keeping her gaze averted the healer in him wanted to help find the key so she would let him in anguish radiated from her and he couldnt let it rest any ongoing problems her head snapped up and she glared at him why are you worried about working with me remembering his own grief after kevins death and then with sueellen his heart ached for her maybe im worried about you terri its not necessary and its not your place her lips barely moved as she grated the words out ive done the counselling learned to live with it i dont like giving people acquaintances chapter and verse on my lifes tragedies he ignored the sarcasm hearing the residue of pain behind it he knew well the twin burden of grief and guilt regrets over sueellens death still tugged on his conscience what about friends he asked softly were friends at least arent we she stared at him coolly a tiny tremble of her chin betrayed her before she set her jaw well if you need to talk he opened his hands making a small conciliatory gesture youll be the first to know she said flippantly with a toss of her head im sure i wont but the offer stands any time he smiled gently hed failed to reach her worse than that he suspected hed caused her more suffering with his wellmeant probing there was a small silence and then she said was there a particular reason for your visit tonight luke he stifled a sigh his communication skills with the opposite sex were not good at the moment hed alienated allie and now he was doing the same with a colleague and friend i wanted to see how you were after last night plus were going to be working together and so youll be making these cosy calls on the other staff members as well will you she looked at him then one eyebrow raised challenging and i wanted to thank you for taking such good care of dad with his mi he continued smoothly ignoring her interruption you saved his life her shoulders moved in a tiny shrug i was just doing my job i know but in this case the job was my father so thank you he was lucky you were at the barbecue when it happened mum told me how stubborn he was about his indigestion its hard for some people to face physical vulnerability especially someone as vital as your dad she studied the liquid in her mug was she speaking from experience he couldnt ask not tonight hed already asked too much definitely worn out his welcome his heart squeezed and he felt the same frustrating helplessness as when allie shut him out the samebut different this feeling was mixed with a potent attraction more than anything he wanted to scoop her into his arms to comfort and reassure bad idea they had to work together for a year the sexual chemistry between them made it impossible for him to judge where altruism ended and lust began he had to keep reminding himself she was a colleague keep striving for that day when hed know her so well this fizz of awareness would be a thing of the past the silence was broken by the catarrhal cough of a possum outside id better go thanks for the coffee he placed his mug on the low table and waited a beat ill let myself out shall i at the door he looked back at her she hadnt moved goodnight terri that air of fragility about her tonight was probably entirely in his overprotective imagination night terri sat for a long time after luke left waiting for her equilibrium to return inviting him into this room had been a disaster why hadnt she thought of the photographs realised he might be curious but at the time shed only thought of sitting somewhere other than the tiny kitchen table where their knees would have touched every time they moved her eyes touched on the picture of peter her hand automatically sliding to her belly protecting where there was nothing left to protect tears stung her eyes pushing to escape she thought shed finished with crying shed been wrong chapter five terri stared at the nowsilent cb receiver in her hand noting the tremor in her fingers with an odd detachment the radio unit clattered slightly as she returned it to the base cradle a baby eight months fever of one hundred and two degrees for several hours part of her knew she should have suggested continuing with fluids and waiting another couple of hours before coming in but the rest of her couldnt bear to take the risk not today babies were special the small lives so precious of their own volition the fingers of one hand splayed across her abdomen her own baby would have been eighteen months old if she hadnt miscarried eyes closed she bowed her head abruptly her sensory memory delivered a staggering tableau the pungent stench of cordite clogging her nostrils peters cries ringing in her ears the cramping pain in her stomach as shed crawled to try to help him so much damage so much blood the very air had coated the back of her tongue thickly with the metallic taste she could still feel the puff of peters breath on her ear as he struggled to talk to apologise to ask her to look after their child in his final moments a connection between them one that had all but vanished after theyd married a spasm low in her abdomen reminded her how shed failed them all peter her baby herself in the aftermath of the trauma her body had rejected its precious cargo today was the second anniversary terri luke her eyes flew open and she spun round to face him luke the room seemed to rock for a second and she put a hand on the bench to steady herself he stepped forward his hand wrapping around her arm above the elbow the warmth of his fingers a tiny comfort against the chill she felt concern filled the blue eyes drilling into hers are you all right oh yes she managed faintly even to her own ears she sounded less than convincing but she was all rightor she would be hed just caught her at a vulnerable moment come and sit down beforesit down and tell me what the problem is his compassionate bedside manner flowed over her making her want to believe he cared she swallowed and stood firm really im fine in a way her turmoil was his fault talking to him the other night had left her more vulnerable than usual that was all his kindness his offer to help had left her raw shed coped so well with the first anniversary this second one was ambushing her ruthlessly exposing the cracks in her defences the skills she had used to keep herself functioning for the past two years felt fragile and unreliable twentyfour months would any amount of time be long enough to blunt the pain perhaps shed have taken today in her stride if lukes visit hadnt unlocked her vault of painful memories pitching her back into the emotional maelstrom of the tragedy but she would get past it she had to terri lukes voice snapped her back to the present and she barely suppressed a start if she didnt pull herself together hed be afraid to have her working in the department tonight and she needed to workshe couldnt go home and sit alone with her thoughts she had one constant her ability to focus on her work she was good at her job and that wasnt going to stop now she couldnt let itwork was all she had left she took a deep steadying breath with her eyes on the notes shed made she concentrated on the details weve got two patients on the way in a thirtyyearold male involved in a quad bike accident required resuscitation at the scene he has head chest and leg injuries her voice was level and calm no sign of the turmoil so close to the surface right and the other patient her fingers tightened and the paper she held crackled a protest she swallowed the other patient is a febrile eightmonthold some vomiting and diarrhoea with a temperature of a hundred and two for several hours theres no indication that his case is anything more serious than a childhood fever but ive suggested bringing him in for examination mums extraanxious because her niece had meningicoccal disease last year the family live out of town and dads away on business so she clamped her lips to stop the flow of words her reasoning was feeble the product of personal anxiety rather than professional concern she needed to marshal a better argument so you didnt want to leave mum isolated in case things deteriorate during the night luke shrugged thats part of the reason were here isnt it better to have a patient come in and prove to be a minor case than to have us miss something major terri opened her mouth to defend her case for having the child brought in and then his words sank in he wasnt questioning her decision as shed expectedas she deserved um yes grateful as she was for his attitude the quick acceptance of her position made her feel like an inexperienced rookie she suppressed a sigh and acknowledged the truththe mood she was in tonight meant that whatever response luke made she would be hard to please she set the paper aside and glanced at her watch the eta on the quad bike victim is any minute now the febrile infant will be at least twenty minutes as soon as shed finished speaking an ambulance glided up to the entrance red and blue lights revolving lets get to work he said grimly heading for the door with lukes attention directed towards the unconscious patient being unloaded by the paramedics terri felt a subtle release of tension in her muscles the quiet air of strength and competence that he radiated should have made him a pleasure to work withit did make him a pleasure to work with but it was also subtly threatening he saw too much and she had secret agonies she couldnt bear to have exposed hed already encroached where no one else had by asking her about the explosion that had killed peter other people tiptoed around the issue relieved when she moved the conversation away to safer topics but not luke had he sensed there was a problem she had to find the resolve to keep him out not let his compassion weaken her the guilt and responsibility the burden for the terrible loss was hers and hers alone luke watched the diminishing lights of the helicopter ambulance for a moment longer before turning wearily to walk back into the hospital the future of the quadbike victim was in the neurosurgeons hands now the mans wife had wanted absolute reassurances that hed recover but luke couldnt give them to her even if her husband survived hed probably have months of rehabilitation ahead of him he and terri had done everything they could the skull xray had shown an intracranial haematoma as hed suspected from the blown right pupil with the help of a telephone consult to a melbourne neurosurgeon theyd evacuated an epidural clot through a burrhole they werent ideally set up for the procedure but theyd had to do it as soon as possible for the man to have any chance of a full recovery now stabilised with the pressure on his brain released the accident victim was on his way to facilities where he could be monitored by regular ct scans the only good thing about the situation was that the couples fiveyearold daughter had hopped off the bike moments before the performance of the tragic stunt luke stripped off his bloodstained gown lobbing it into the laundry bin beside the sink before scrubbing his hands he wondered how terri was getting on with the dehydrated infant odd how shed behaved earlier when hed first come on shift shed been so obviously upset that all his protective instincts had gone on high alert demanding that he do something anything to help after avoiding him for the best part of a week shed seemed positively delighted to see him a disproportionate leap of pleasure had rushed through him in that split second when shed turned to look at him her eyes shining until shed put her hand out on the bench to steady herself and hed seen the desperation underlying her veneer of composure for a moment hed been afraid she was going to collapse at his feet but thered been no sign of hesitation or diffidence when shed helped him with the quadbike trauma case hed watched for it been ready to take over if shed faltered but shed been great better than great shed been fantastic since day one taking direction from him with no hostility at all after his father had explained to him the hospital boards poor handling of the filling of the position hed wondered how their working relationship would function but it was a pleasurein every way and if there were any undertones of resentment he couldnt detect them if anything he was the one giving out the mixed signals he enjoyed working with her and on a personal level he enjoyed being close to her perhaps just a little too much since that first night when hed had his hands on her hed wanted nothing more than to touch her again professionally it was a potential time bomb she impressed the hell out of him as a doctor she was strong and competent as a woman she was an enigma one he wanted to solve the more he knew about her the less he understood her those occasional flashes of uncertainty and fragility he saw in her cut straight to his heart they were so out of keeping with the rest of her what had upset her tonight obviously not the trauma patient could it have been the infant it didnt make sense that case appeared to be so straightforward perhaps terri had been a little on the cautious side but he preferred that in the staff he worked with than someone who was negligent about cases he knew terri had taken the infant and her mother through to one of the double rooms the woman had a toddler to look after as well and terris suggestion of a family room for them had made sense his runners made no noise as he padded through to the quiet corridor at the door of the room he stopped dead terri held the happy chortling baby on her knee he could see her profile see the loving smile on her lips the boys trusting eyes looked up into terris face as a stream of unintelligible words tumbled out of the rosebud mouth the fingers of one chubby hand wrapped around terris thumb and he tried to stuff it between his lips arent you a gorgeous wee man cooed terri her voice a warm maternal caress lukes breath choked up in his throat ga said the child responding enthusiastically to her tone yes you are the sight rocked luke to the core raising ageold masculine instincts to protect to possess he swallowed hard waiting for the world to settle he adored being a father from the moment hed laid eyes on his daughter his soul had been filled by her sweet invasion of his life a sharp uncomfortable hunger stirred in his heart as he watched terri with the child he must have made a small noise because terri looked up suddenly her smile was filled with a warm uncomplicated love that slammed into him the charged moment was packed with intimacy his heart made a slow painful revolution in his chest and a shudder of recognition fizzed through his brain he wantedhe refused to let his mind finish the thought terris smile faltered and he wondered what she read on his face then she blinked and a quick puzzled look filled her lovely dark eyes before she looked away she was still seated in front of him but he had the oddest feeling shed withdrawn from him mentally fled he moved closer compelled by a wholly male desire to pursue someones looking a lot happier he sat beside her putting one hand on the back of her chair as he leaned towards the child he suppressed a grin when terri flicked him a wary look her senses were spot on though he tried to present an unthreatening appearance she had stirred a primitive corner within him he smiled as he stroked the babys soft cheek with the back of one finger the small mouth drooled saliva as it made chewing motions on terris knuckle teething as well is he yes which is possibly why he wasnt settling for his mum her voice was soft and tender poor little fellow lukes eyes were drawn to terris profile she wore her hair up twisted in a loose bun on the crown of her head making it easy for him to study her profile the curve of her cheek the neat straight nose stubborn chin another wave of need spiralled through his gut he hadnt felt such compelling sexual awareness for a long time experiencing it now so powerfully was exciting and unnerving he had some thinking to do his situation with terri was a sensitive one he was her boss they worked in a small hospital they were both here for a limited time but there was something between them would terri allow him to pursue it or perhaps the more important question was was pursuing it wise come on kiddo you cant sit there all day lukes head lifted at the sound of his sisters voice coming from just outside his line of sight he knew allie was reading a book on the patio his fingers paused on the pawn hed been about to move as he strained to hear his daughters mumbled response he picked up his fathers black knight and left his piece on the square not deterred megan chirped its time for some girl stuff lets go and see if terris home terri a hot thrill streaked through him before he could suppress it sharp angles on the chesspiece dug into his palm as his fingers clenched around it god he had it bad if just her name being spoken unexpectedly could affect him like this i dont know if dad will let me allie sounded bored and sulky you wont know unless you ask him will you bunny come on hes just inside playing chess with dad megan stuck her head around the corner of the french door hey luke im going down to see terri okay if allie comes with me his daughters head appeared beside megans her face anxious was she worried about going or worried he wouldnt let her everyday life required the skills of a wiser man than he do you want to allie he asked keeping his tone neutral i guess sure its not like theres anything else to do she shrugged trying to look nonchalant but hed seen the gleam of interest in her eyes more than hed seen in a long while okay then he said letting her comment slide dont stay too long thanks luke megan grinned as she turned to allie see what did i tell you luke watched them go his silent daughter walking beside his ebullient sister it should have been the other way aroundthe teen with the worldweary attitude and the tenyearold with the naïve enthusiasm he was failing her in some way that he couldnt understand the things hed tried to reach her fell dismally short of success he was beginning to wonder if they needed a counsellor to help them through this patch but if allie steadfastly continued to refuse to talk then the sessions might just cause more of a problem than they solved what would terri make of his unhappy child this week hed found out that she was great with children of all ages maybe she could see what was troubling his daughters spirit he would ask perhaps when the girls came back he could wander down to the beach cottage yeah right and perhaps terri would see through him shes not settling is she said his father allie luke said earning himself a quizzical look no shes not maybe you should have planned a day out with her today he met his parents faintly critical gaze i did she didnt want to go ah his father nodded sagely and turned his attention back to the board luke contemplated the elegantly carved black and white chess pieces white was in a hopeless position the defence was shot and he had no offensive pieces in good positions in short no matter what he tried now he was going down his thoughts drifted back to allie every approach hed tried had been grimly rebuffed hed hoped the move to australia might have ultimately sparked some interest in her hed know it wouldnt be easy but he hadnt expected it to get so much worse he had to do something soon he couldnt stand by while his daughter sank into depression his father made a move taking the white queen with his remaining knight well maybe she needs some female company meggie and terri might sort her out maybe he hoped so megans been great since weve been here his father grunted wants to be a nanny did she tell you no but shed be good at it he castled without much hope of salvaging his position she got allie moving which is more than i can do these days your mother and i have christened her the relentless angel there was a small pause luke looked up to catch the thoughtful narroweyed look his father gave him over the top of his glasses so how are you finding terri to work with i hope youre cutting her some slack after the way the board treated her terri doesnt need any slack to be cut from anyone least of all me as you well know well just so long as youre doing the right thing by her his father said gruffly i dont want the hospital to lose her neither do i and his concern wasnt just for the hospital shes been through a lot that girl yes luke looked back at the table has she told you what happened to her husband just the basics shes not much of a talker no so it wasnt just him that she was shutting out thought luke grimly hell of a tragedy losing someone that way yes his father grunted then leaned forward to move his queen checkmate hey got time for a couple of pests always terri looked up to see megan walking around the side of the cottage a moment later to her surprise allie followed out for a walk as far as your place megan said with a cheeky smile i see terri grinned back in that case let me finish planting the last of this punnet then ill get us something to drink cool megan said terri was aware of allies solemn eyes following her every move as she and lukes sister chatted the child was much too quiet even allowing for natural shyness megans irrepressible bubbliness wasnt succeeding in drawing her into the conversation do you like gardening allie terri asked when there was a small silence allie shrugged these are herbs when they grow bigger ill be able to use them for cooking mummy has some allies toe dug into the dirt as she muttered had some did she terri patted the earth into place around the last seedling as she thought about allies slip and then correction what did she have another shrug you dont remember allie shook her head when these little guys grow up they might look more familiar i wont be here then well if you are they dont take long to grow now about that drink i promised terri led the way into the kitchen and went to the sink to wash her hands when she turned allie was standing by the hutch one tentative finger was stroking her old china soup tureen do you like that allie the girl snatched her hand back her cheeks tinting mummys have the same pattern i cant remember what its called her expression was infinitely sad and terris heart ached for her its the willow pattern my greatgreatgrandmother brought a whole dinner set over to australia with her on the ship when she came from england same with mummy not the ship but it was from her great um grandmother allie said i think theyre pretty i think youre right terri smiled and was rewarded with a tentative smile in return she was about to ask if allies mother had the full set when an urgent beeping broke the moment megan dug in her pocket for her phone uhoh its my study partner she wants to go over our english lit assignmentwere presenting it next week the teens vivid blue eyes pinned terri with a speaking look is it okay if i leave allie here with you sure thanks obviously feeling that shed delivered whatever message shed been silently sending megan bounced to her feet see you later allie cat in the silence that megan left behind terri and allie eyed each other i suppose you want me to go allie said colourlessly stay for a bit longer if you want to cancan i sure you can help me in the garden for a while i hate seeing a willing pair of hands go unusedeven an unwilling pair terri teased gently she kept up a steady patter of information about different plants and answered allies occasional question as terri had hoped working in the garden helped the girl to relax a little there she sat back on her heels and looked at the garden bed theyd finished preparing havent we done a great job allie looked at it doubtfully its just dirt ah yes but its happy dirt thats going to nourish and pamper my next crop of tomatoes which will taste extragood better than anything youll buy in a supermarket she smiled then glanced at her watch let me clean up and then ill walk you home i can go by myself allie sounded belligerent ready to defend her position im sure you can said terri mildly but todays special because its your first visit and id like to take you home ookay as they walked across the yard together terri had the impression that allie wanted to say something after another handful of paces the girl finally blurted out so if this was my first visit yes does that mean it would be okay if i visited again please i dont see why not as long as its okay with your dad it wont bother him she said flatly the corners of her mouth pulled down why do you say that the slender shoulders twisted into a shrug because it wouldnt im sure thats not true allie another shrug the girl had turned the gesture into a whole new language of subtle nuances no wonder her father was concerned terri felt for both of them allie seemed to be stuck in denial about her mothers death which left luke with the sad task of helping her face the sorrow anyway maybe i can help with your garden some more if youd like to terri smiled ii used to help mummy sometimes did you well id be delighted to have you come and help me sometimes too luke was sitting on the patio when he saw allie and terri come through the line of bushes allie was talking animatedly to terri much more like her old self and terri waswellterri looking gorgeous in shorts cut just above the knee and battered tennis shoes the thin knit material of her old tshirt clung in all the right places her hair draped in a ponytail across one shoulder the ends curving around her breast he stood shoving his hands into his pockets and walked across the lawn to meet them terri lifted her head and gave him a small smile a moment later allie saw him her face falling he suppressed a sigh had a good time he said to his daughter ignoring her sudden mood change yes terri said i could visit again as long as its okay with you her tone was terse so may i he raised one brow and his daughters eyes slid towards terri in a shamefaced look please luke glanced at terri who gave him a small nod all right he said slowly as long as you understand that terri might have to say no sometimes yes okay then her quick thanks were perfunctory but the grin she gave terri was more open thank you terri thank you for your help in the garden terri smiled luke cleared his throat nanas nearly ready for dinner allie so how about going in to wash up he watched his daughter disappear then turned to find terri watching him her dark eyes filled with soft sympathy he realised abruptly that it was not the look he wanted to see when she focussed on him allies struggling with her mothers death isnt she shock and hope jolted through him had terri managed the impossible did she talk to you not really i just got the impression that she hasnt accepted whats happened youre right she hasnt i cant seem to reach her or get her to open up at all terri looked towards the house her face pensive she opened her mouth as though to say something then must have thought better of it whatever you were thinking just thentell me he demanded she gave him a startled look please he said moderating his tone dont worry about offending me just say it he could see her hesitate but after a small silence she said your daughter seems almostangry with you conscious of a sense of disappointment luke slowly released the breath hed been holding unreasonable though it was hed expected terris answer would provide a breakthrough for him with his daughter too true he gave her a wry grin but its more than that luke watching her with you just now its like shes made up her mind not to let you get close she gazed off into the distance again maybe shes punishing you for something her words came haltingly as though she was choosing each one with great care or or her deep chocolatebrown eyes came back to his the expression in them puzzled or maybe its herself shes punishing she shook her head but for what i cant imagine neither can i he silently turned over what shed said perhaps there was an answer in her impression he just had to find it use it to untangle whatever was going on in allies mind after a moment he said i dont know what the answer is but youve obviously worked some magic with her today me i havent done anything i think youd be surprised its the most enthusiasm ive seen in her for a long time so thank you poor little girl she said softly as she stared in the direction that allie had disappeared luke ran his eyes over terris profile taking in the thick spiky black lashes that fringed her eyes the lovely apricot tint of her cheeks her lack of awareness of a tiny smudge of dirt high on her cheekbone was endearing without thinking he reached up to brush it away for her she jerked back her eyes wide and alarmed what are you doing you have a bit of dirt just he indicated on his own face as she so obviously didnt want his touch oh well thanks she scrubbed it as she eyed him warily i um id better go then bye see you tomorrow terri yes tomorrow she swung away her long easy stride carried her quickly out of his view with a small sigh he turned towards the house terri making sure allie got home safely was laudable but now his excuse for dropping in at the cottage was gone he smiled wryly at his disappointment probably just as well how are you going joe asked terri a few days later as the patient on the bed wriggled slightly okay got an itch hold still just a little longer im nearly finished using the dissecting forceps she pulled back the last section of the skin flap and pushed the curved needle through the subcutaneous tissue the needle holder made soft ratcheting clicks when she grasped the sharp tip to pull the thread through with the final neat stitch secured she snipped the ends and disposed of the needle in the sharps bin luke wasnt on the same roster as she was today she should have felt relief but when she tried to define her feelings they werent at all clear cut if anything she feltflat as though some indefinable ingredient for sparkle in the day was missing she frowned that nonsense needed to be stamped on quick smart all done joe we just need to dress that before you move joe arched his neck to look at her handiwork woah cool a thank you would be good joey said his mother thanks dr mitchell the freckled face flashed a puckish grin youre very welcome terri susan poked her head around the curtain weve got a tenyearold with ard on the way in okay thanks susan im just finishing up here an odd look crossed susans face as she hesitated a second shall i send someone in to dress that for you okay and a tetanus booster too thanks something was definitely worrying the nurse she stripped off the gloves and said to her delighted patient youll need to keep the dressing on and dry for twentyfour hours and well see you back here in a week to have the stitches removed okay the wound was very clean she said to joes mother but if you have any concerns dont hesitate to come back and see us thanks terri someone will be here in a minute to put a dressing on that and give you a sheet of instructions terri smiled and excused herself she found susan in the office making a note on the patient tracking board problem terri said maybe susan looked up frowning the message was a bit confused but i think the ard patient is lukes daughter terris hands stilled what makes you think that the teacher who called it in was very shaken but she kept saying it was alexis and asking for dr daniels ambulance dispatched terri swallowed a stab of foreboding luke had mentioned allies worsening asthma attacks no the child was already in transit with one of the other teachers when the call was made right whats their eta now the class was on a field trip to the museum they decided to make the dash straight here rather than wait for an ambulance as theyre only a couple of blocks away terri suppressed a sigh she could understand the temptation to make the dash but it was precious minutes that the child should have been having treatment okay i agree lets assume that it is alexis have we got medical records for her ive rung admin said susan theyre on the way great thanks terri glanced at the clock ten oclock she wondered what luke had planned he wouldnt be too far away because he was on duty this evening she didnt want to page him unnecessarily but she knew hed want to be there if it was allie having the attack lets confirm the identity of our patient she trailed off as a car drove into the emergency dropoff point and the sliding doors swished open the child in the passengers seat was hunched forward so that she couldnt see a face but the bob of straight dark hair looked all too familiar her stomach swooped call luke stat please susan she called picking up an oxygen cylinder and mask as she raced for the door chapter six oh doctor thank goodness gasped the young pale woman rushing around the car to intersect with terri at the passenger door the attacks so bad i didnt think we were going to make it terri leaned into the car conscious of the teacher hovering behind her as she ran a critical eye over allie hunched shoulders hands pressed to her sides as she laboured for breath audibly wheezing with each hardwon lungful hi allie can you understand me the glossy head gave a tiny nod im going to put an oxygen mask on you she fitted the soft plastic mask over the bluetinged lips and flaring nostrils frightened blue eyes clung to hers briefly before closing ive got a gurney here terri said susan okay lets get her inside terri was shocked by how frail the child felt in her arms she settled her on the gurney seating her as upright as possible susan wheeled the gurney through to a cubicle as terri took a set of obs allies slender shoulders rose and fell at a rate of about forty respirations per minute beneath her fingertips terri could feel the childs radial pulse rocketing at one hundred and sixty beats per minute i know its hard sweetheart but i want you to try to relax as much as you can slow down your breathing terri clipped a pulse oximeter onto one dainty finger another slow nod were looking after you now and well have you comfortable in no time she said soothingly wheres daddy hes on his way sweetheart susans taking your shirt off now so she can attach some dots to your skin with the clothing stripped away terri could see the way each desperate breath hollowed out the soft tissues around allies clavicle leaving skin gleaming white over angular bone terri placed the stethoscope diaphragm on allies chest and listened to pounding heartbeats accompanying the harsh wheeze in the girls lungs no sound at all would have been a very bad sign do you think you could do a peak flow for me the dark head bobbed and allie reached for the tube good girl terri glanced at the scale on the side of the tube the baseline reading was forty percent of what shed expect for a child of allies age and size allie have you been taking preventative medication didnt take what about your puffer sweetheart did you have it with you at the museum today the cubicle curtain clattered and suddenly luke was beside the gurney allie raised shadowed eyes to her father then looked at terri and shook her head tiredly okay sweetie terri said susan a gown large and a pair of gloves please allie honey what happened luke stroked the hair off her forehead with hands that shook visibly try to relax sweetheart he looked up at the oximeter and then pinned terri with a fierce look whats going on her oxygen sat is only eightynine per cent why isnt she on a nebuliser were just about to start one terri said gently luke you have to let us do our job your job is to be calm for allie his face worked as he pulled himself back under control when he spoke his voice was rough but more measured im staying i know susans beside you with a gown and gloves for you so lets get this nebuliser started she was aware of him moving pulling on the gown as she broke an ampule of bronchodilator into the nebuliser cup oxygen gurgled noisily through the liquid delivering a fine mist of lifesaving bronchodilator the clear plastic frosted with allies urgent rasping breaths terri glanced at luke how hard it must be for him to see allies battle his strong features reflected the suffering his daughter was going through the naked emotion brought a hot lump to her throat she turned away to check allies readings little response she prepared a second inhalation and bent to swap the nebuliser cup do you think you could swallow something for me allie the girl nodded have you got a favourite jam another nod apricot the dark head shook strawberry luke said his voice hoarse a nod from allie susan could you mash prednisolone in jam please were going with the strawberry luke watched terri smile at his daughter he could see the situation was desperate as a father he wanted to yell and rage and demand she do something to help allie to relieve his daughters suffering to make it better stat as a doctor he knew everything that could be done was being done thank god for terri calm competent caring confidenceinspiring he was grateful for the small tasks she assigned him he was there to be with his daughter thats what mattered it helped him that he was doing something no matter how small three hours later terri opened the door to allies room and tiptoed across to the bed where luke sat keeping watch theyd worked for two hours to stabilise allie hed been ready to slay monsters to save her if necessary his protective concern appealed deeply and terri realised she felt acutely vulnerable having seen him this way only now that the frightening attack was over could she admit how serious the situation had been the thought that she might have failed luke failed allie sent a shaft of nausea into her stomach she touched lukes shoulder he stirred turning to look up at her his expression was dazed shes going to be okay now yes thanks to you thanks to the team she looked at his drawn face lines of exhaustion etched around his mouth and her heart squeezed take a break get something to eat and drink luke he opened his mouth refusal in his eyes just for a few minutes ill stay here with allie she could see he still wanted to refuse i promise ill be right here when you get back okay he stood slowly and arched his back thank you i wont be long i know she smiled alone with allie terri smoothed the sheet at the edge of the bed and allowed herself a moment longer to watch the sleeping child it was a pleasure and a relief to see the steady respirations and better skin colour to check the monitor and see pulse oxygen saturation and respiratory rate all nearly within the normal range a stark contrast to the girl who had presented in the emergency department for the initial one hundred minutes of her admission it had been all too possible that her condition could have deteriorated disastrously shed been so tired using accessory muscles as shed fought for breath terri stroked allies forehead watching the fragile eyelids flutter open above the oxygen mask blue eyes startlingly like her fathers flickered and focussed slowly hey sweetheart terri said softly how are you feeling okay allie smiled weakly her pale skin contrasted with the purplegrey crescents that shadowed her eyes as her eyes cleared she looked around your dad will be back in a minute said terri hes been sitting with you since you came in i know i dont know why she said her voice filled with pain as she closed her eyes and turned her head away terri blinked and stood lost for words for a long moment what do you mean allie the girls mouth trembled hhe hates me oh honey denial sprang to terris lips her tongue started to form the words she stopped stifling the automatic response allie believed what she was saying can you tell me why you think that allie flicked her silent sideways glance her eyes tortured beneath the lake of brimming tears your dads very worried about you terri said softly he loves you very much and he wants to help you i think hes sad because he doesnt know how maybe if you talked to him you dont understand the soft tortured words were ripped from a deep anguished place and tears spilled over to stream down allies cheeks i dont deserve to be happy oh allie terri reached for the slender shoulders drawing the crying girl into an embrace tell me what you mean sweetheart terri rocked her gently and waited ddad was wwith me when mummy died its mmy fault oh sweetheart terri murmured as she rubbed the girls back and listened to the story of guilt and anger and unresolved grief that tumbled out interspersed with sobs and hiccups it wasnt easy to understand but she didnt interrupt the flow finally allie wound down its not your fault that your mum died terri squeezed her gently her heart swelling when allies arms crept around her waist and clung youre grieving and your thoughts are all jumbled up arent they it ffeels bad i know sweetheart i know she stroked the girls hair and pressed her lips to the top of her head have you tried to talk to your dad about this at all no came the whispered response i cant tell him hell understand allie hell be angry never he might be sad for not seeing why youve been so unhappy but hed never be angry with you for the way youre feeling now eyes framed by spiky drenched lashes lifted to cling to hers panic and a tiny growing spark of hope swam in the blue depths your dad will be back in a few minutes what say we tell him together then yyoull help of course in the meantime how about i check you over sit forward for me so i can listen to your chest terri recorded allies obs while she kept up a steady stream of chatter and questions to keep the girls mind occupied terri knew the moment luke slipped quietly into the room all her senses quivered with awareness heres your dad now allies smile dimmed and terri suppressed a sigh she waited until luke was standing on the other side of the bed allie told me some things shes been worrying about luke shes going to be very brave and tell you about them allie thats great sweetheart he said softly allie terri prompted after a pause the girl plucked at the sheet her eyes averted lukes eyes filled with baffled hunger as they settled on his daughter the silence felt thick with accusation terris stomach clenched painfully in her eagerness to help had she made a monumental error would professional counselling have been the wiser course but she was so sure they didnt need an intermediary they just needed to start terri bit her lip as she debated what to do next her instincts told her it would be better if allie could tell her father herself much more therapeutic but perhaps the stress was too much for the child allie darlingi know youre unhappy lukes voice was gentle and coaxing i know its not easy but i want you to know that you can tell me anything anything at all i wont be cross with you terris throat blocked with tears and pride for the man as he tried to connect with his daughter his words were just right so honest and brave and perceptive no defences no armour hed lost people close to him and yet he was still prepared to put his feelings on the line for those he loved perhaps this was a lesson she needed to learn shed thought shed lost her physical courage in the landmine explosion but maybe shed never had what really countedthe raw emotional courage she was witnessing now between father and daughter allies head stayed bowed her shoulders rounded lukes eyes were soft with hope and love i promise ill listen and between us well try to find a compromise there was a long tense silence terri held her breath and willed allie to answer luke glanced up and she gave him a tiny nod of encouragement his throat moved as he swallowed then he looked back at the top of his daughters head and even if i cant make it better he said i will always love you allie how can you the girl sucked in a slightly wheezy breath her arms wrapping tightly around her thin body terris heart ached at the sight of the defensive movement then in a tiny unsteady voice the girl said mummy died because of me no the last vestige of colour drained from lukes face he laid his arm on allies shoulder no baby yes she whispered oh allie his face twisted why sweetheart why do you think that you could have fixed her bbut you were looking after me so she ddied tears streamed down allies flushed cheeks and her words came out haltingly between spasmodic sobs shed still be alive if it wwasnt for me no allie im sorry luke could hardly get the words out through the constriction in his throat why hadnt he intuitively understood the cause of his daughters anguish he was her father for gods sake i wouldnt have been able to fix your mum bbut i get sick she said you always ffix me sweetheart your mums sickness was different the cells in her blood multiplied and multiplied and we couldnt find a way to stop them he sat on the edge of her bed wanting to gather her into his arms but not wanting to push while she was so defensive im sorry allie i didnt realise you were feeling this way i let you down no with a choked cry allie suddenly launched herself at him he hugged her close her thin arms wrapped around his neck tightly the frail body against his shook with great sobbing shudders he breathed deep his child his baby had thrown herself into his arms the stamp of this small persons scent affixed itself on his soul all over again it had all been made possible by one extraordinary woman he lifted his head in time to see terri swiping her hands across her cheeks as she turned to leave terri she hesitated a moment then lifted brimming eyes to meet his his chest swelled at the unsteady smile she gave him he owed this woman more than he could ever repay he wished he could reach out and draw her into the circle of his embrace with allie thank you he murmured she nodded nudging a box of tissues along the bedside dresser until it was within easy reach for him ill let the switchboard know that im taking your calls until further notice his heart was full as he watched her slip out of the room shutting the door behind her he held allie until her sobs subsided in a small silence he grabbed a couple of tissues and proffered them thanks she blew her nose with unselfconscious vigour then sighed after a moment she said i miss mummy the wobble in her voice tore at his heart i do too allie we left her he frowned when we came here yes wwe left her behind she tilted her head to look at him we left all the places she loved she loved it here too he said with his thumb he wiped the moisture from her cheeks remember last time we were here together she taught you how to snorkel yes but its not the same her voice was thick with unshed tears we left her garden i know baby i know luke understood immediately the garden had been sueellens pride and joy shed lavished love on her plants with the same generosity shed lavished it on her family he swallowed as a quick stab of grief pierced his heart you know mr owens is looking after it for us he laid his cheek on the top of her head but its not the same as us being there is it allies hair rubbed his skin as she nodded he wont love it as much as wwe would her voice shook anew i know he gave her a quick tight squeeze the silence was comfortable soothing he rubbed her back in slow circles enjoying the closeness after so many months of friction tterri said maybe we could get a plant to remember your mum by would you like that how brilliant how elegantly simple bless terri and her insight allies head cuddled against his chest nodded i think thats a great idea we can go to the nursery and you can pick something out i already know what i want to get a pink rose like the one we had by the front door she lifted her eyes to his the lashes spiky with tears the climbing one okay well get the very best pink climbing rose in the nursery allie rewarded him with a radiant smile a glimpse of the healing process that had begun the moment was precious can terri come too when we get it luke quelled a pinprick of apprehension terri both he and allie wanted more of her in their lives it seemed like a potential disaster he didnt want allie to get hurt for him the want the need was on a very different level in an instant of uncomfortable clarity he realised he was projecting his fears for himself onto his daughter he didnt want to get hurt didnt want to risk losing someone else that he cared about didnt want to put his heart on the line he stifled a sigh he was afraid that his options for choice in the matter were well gone can she dad of course if she wants to he shook off the shiver of disturbing selfawareness a family outing with terri might help to take the magic out of her presence give him a bit of perspective where she was concerned well talk to your granddad too and see where we can put the rose somewhere special somewhere extraspecial thanks dad she reached up and hugged him spontaneously again the lump in his throat got bigger i feel better so do i allie so do i he had his daughter back right now this was what counted allie relied on him to make sensible choices for her and for him a short time later terri filled out a biochemistry form requesting urea and electrolytes and slipped it into a laboratory collection bag with a tube of blood as soon as shed finished her mind strayed towards the room at the end of the emergency department where allie had been moved once shed been stabilised how were luke and his daughter when terri had left them half an hour ago luke had had his hip perched on the edge of the bed and allie wrapped in his arms a cocoon of paternal protection a beautiful snapshot of love between parent and child terri swallowed what sort of parents would she and peter have been her hand ran down the flatness of her abdomen she already knew hed had no time for her pregnancy the changes in her body which had so delighted her had left her late husband cold she tried to imagine him enfolding a child their child in his arms that picture wouldnt come suddenly she needed to see luke with allie to see that affirmation of pure unconditional love her feet carried her past the curtained cubicles to the door of allies room there they were she rested her fingertips lightly on the glass of the window and felt the tension in her chest ease they were going to be okay this father and daughter who had each carved a niche in her heart as she watched allies arms came up to wrap around lukes neck the scene in the room blurred terri lifted her hands pressed her fingers to her eyelids as she willed away the unexpected rush of moisture the moment between parent and child was infinitely precious theyd been through some very tough times but they would get through it together and be even closer on the other side as though hed felt her presence lukes head lifted and looked straight at her her pulse gave a treacherous leap he smiled crookedly tilted his head in an invitation to join them terri swallowed then opened the door hi she said softly her smile felt wobbly weve got something to ask you havent we allie lukes voice was husky yes allie grinned her cheeks were tinged with pink and the strain had faded from her eyes she looked like a normal happy tenyearold please will you come to the nursery with us when we chose the plant for mummy please say you will please of course id be honoured whens the big day or havent you got that far in the planning yet theres no school tomorrow i think sunday week perhaps luke touched his daughter on the nose terri and i are rostered off then and itll give your granddad a chance to decide where he wants the garden terri blinked in surprise he knew her roster that far ahead she stifled a foolish glow of warmth he probably knew everyones shiftsit wasnt as if they had a huge medical staff sunday week then she said luke smiled well let you know what time okay she slid her hands into the pockets of her coat id better get back to work i just wanted to look in and see how you were were good arent we dad we are indeed his eyes were filled with light and warmth and something more something that made terris heart lurch ill catch up with you before you go off duty terri sure she managed im off at five all being well i know his slow smile sent a hot shaft of excitement sizzling along her diaphragm its a pleasure edith terri said as she opened the door to let her last patient out keep off that foot as much as possible and well see you again next week next friday thanks again dear leaning heavily on her walking frame the woman hobbled a couple of steps then stopped in the doorway oh luke how are you good thanks edith his smile seemed tense to terris eye but he stopped to exchanged pleasantries with the elderly woman if youll excuse me i need an urgent word with terri with dr mitchell of course dear well chat another time absolutely he nodded a muscle rippled in his jaw as though he was keeping his emotions on a tight leash while he chatted with edith he stood aside so she could move through the door you can count on it as soon as the patient had gone he shut the door the latch snicked loudly in the silence and he stood for a moment with his hand on the doorknob terris mouth went dry luke is there a problem with allie no no just the opposite his voice was gruff as he turned terri found herself scooped into a tight hug for a split second she froze as sensations tumbled into her brain the feeling of his solid body aligned with hers the heat and strength of his arms wrapped around her the fresh essence of him faintly tangy masculine and clean she flattened her hands on his back feeling the hard ridge of muscle on either side of his spine she shut her eyes savouring the contact as her knees turned rubbery the embrace felt wonderful and for a magical instant his touch erased her sorrow and filled empty places in her spirit in his arms she felt more whole than she had for a long long time after a moment he held her at arms length his eyes burning down into hers thank you his throat worked as he struggled to speak i owe you more than i can ever repay oh luke this glimpse into his vulnerability was wrenching terri ached for him she reached up to cup his cheek he brought his hand up held her fingers more firmly to his face the very faint roughness of his cleanshaven jaw tingled on her skin her heart squeezed you saved my daughters life and youve performed a miracle by getting her talking to me his head dipped and his lips touched her palm for a tiny thrilling moment she sucked in a quick breath at the caress reminding herself that it meant nothing luke was naturally demonstrative and this moment was an emotional one for him his love for his daughter and his relief at their reunion was spilling over into his actions but her stubborn heart somersaulted wildly refusing to listen to common sense youve given her back to me terri with her senses so overloaded with physical awareness she struggled to bring her mind back to their discussion allie you never lost her luke she loves you very much you know she does shes just confused right now you were the person she asked for when she was brought in today was i thank you his grip tightened on her hand briefly when she tried to withdraw her fingers after a moment he released her and a grin lit up his face she hugged me yeah she did terris smile felt quivery i saw he sobered my poor baby thinking her mothers death was her fault i didnt see it i still dont know how she could have believed it children have their own view of the way the world works she curled her fingers into her palm as though by holding tight she could lock the sensory memory of his skin on hers maybe part of the reason she had been able to tap into allies feelings was because of her hypersensitivity to the girls father they sometimes feel responsible for things in a way that an adult wouldnt consider yes he paced away from her lifting one hand to his forehead his fingers furrowed through his hair leaving endearing tufts standing in their wake terri allowed her gaze to stray over his broad shoulders the soft woven fabric of his white shirt showed off his powerful torso to perfection with the sleeves rolled up to elbow level she could appreciate his muscular forearms she smiled wryly shed always had a weakness for nice arms and hands and firm thighs and posteriors she sighed the navy denim of lukes jeans fitted him very well indeed he spun around and his eyes drilled into hers heat crawled into her face as though shed been caught doing something she shouldnt no wonder i couldnt reach her i should have listened to you the other day when you suggested she was punishing herself he moved restlessly to the side again and terri released the breath caught in her lungs she was so ill i cant get the picture of her struggling for breath out of my mind luke he looked back at her fiercely i nearly lost it in the emergency room but you didnt only thanks to you treating me like a raw intern allie is your daughter of course it was difficult for you i dont know what id have done if stop this right now she knew too well how hed have felt she might not be a parent in the full sense of the word but she knew what it was like to lose a child the guilt could be paralysing stop torturing yourself allie has recovered and she needs her father all of him not someone fractured by guilt its a pointless emotion when you should be concentrating on each other yes youre right he dragged a hand down his face then gave her a gorgeous lopsided smile thank you for everything including the pep talk you see things beyond the physical it makes you an extraordinary doctor terri terri swallowed and looked away she shoved her hands into her coat pockets his praise was almost more than she could bear because she knew exactly how limited her abilities were he trusted her it was priceless it was an almost intolerable burden she wanted to warn him not to think too highly of her warn him how very flawed her judgement could be luke please her voice was croaky she cleared her throat before continuing i was just doing dont say you were just doing your job it was much more than that were lucky to have you here at port cavill he looked deeply into her eyes and there was no doubting his sincerity im lucky to have you here the warm approval was too much she needed to shrug it off find a way to keep him at a distance to quash this intimacy that seemed to have sprung up between them well she said struggling for a light note im glad you think so please remember this when i do something to blot my copy book her smile felt ghastly as she blinked back the urge to cry she needed to go find somewhere private to pull herself back together she cast unseeing eyes in the direction of her watch and said i must catch the lab tech before she goes for the day she all but fled not caring what he thought as the barrier of the door clicked shut behind her she sagged with relief too much too soon being close to him showed her how very flimsy the shell of her carefully mended persona was she wasnt ready for the powerful conflicting emotions that luke awakened she wondered if she ever would be she shivered how long would she be able to hold the façade together under the pressure luke stared at the door after terri had gone he frowned shed seemed embarrassed by his thanks more than that shed seemed ashamed as though she was somehow undeserving of them but that was ridiculousshed saved his daughters life today hed been there hed seen how hard shed worked seen her skill and determination he couldnt praise her highly enough for what shed done he owed her he respected her and he wanted her needy hunger that clawed at him hed held her in his arms twice nowembraces that had started out with the very best platonic intentions but hed felt the heat grow in his lower abdomen on both occasions giving the contact with her a sizzling inappropriate energy familiarity wasnt kicking in as quickly as hed hoped he just had to keep holding himself in check until it did he huffed out a breath an armful of terri mitchell would test the restraint of a saint all he had was the very tenuous control of luke daniels and it was no match for the temptation of her chapter seven luke pushed open his car door and stood listening to the high pitched howl of hardworking motorcycle engines he was escaping just for the day at his mothers behest hed left allie with her for a girls day out shopping his daughter was really excited about it he smiled wryly hard pressed to think of anything hed like to do less he was also escaping from the lure of terri she had the day off but he had no good excuse to invade his colleagues offduty hours other than the fact that he wanted to with allie gone for the day he couldnt casually suggest a walk on the beachvia terris cottage on the off chance that she was around having her so close at the bottom of the garden was a refined form of torture he sighed rather than hang around home testing his selfdiscipline he was going to face a personal demon hed loved hanging out at the racetrack with his cousin kevin and terris brother ryan he hadnt been back since kevins accident hadnt been on a bike either but that was something to tackle another dayperhaps for now being here was an accomplishment hed talk to mick butler while he was here too an informal followup after the diabetic episode he smiled wryly maybe he would earn himself some brownie points with terri he walked through the tunnel under the track to the pit area and watched the speeding bikes for a few moments just an initial tightening in his chest he noted dispassionately nothing unmanageable he took a deep breath and looked at the people standing trackside his lips curved when he spotted a familiar profile terris uncle gday mick the man turned luke daniels their palms smacked together as they used the handshake to draw into a quick hard embrace of uncomplicated masculine friendship mick stood back his wide smile and dark eyes familiar and uncannily like terris about time you showed your face around here yeah i know luke shrugged time gets away you know how it is i know mick patted his arm the gesture awkward but the emotion behind it genuine i was sorry to hear about sueellen she was a bonzer girl luke nodded yes she was thanks i got your card hows that gorgeous daughter of yours giving me grey hairs luke smiled it gets worse mick chuckled i remember when my girls he was interrupted by loud whoops and clapping from the men nearest them micks head whipped back to the course shes just taken russ called one of the appreciative audience boy hes going to be dirty about that she a corkscrew of unease twisted through lukes gut no it couldnt becould it terri mick craned his neck following the action shes on the yellow honda lukes heart leapt into his throat his eyes followed the motorcycle as it tipped into another sweeping bend in a blur of red leather and yellow bike thats terri terri oh god desire and fear congealed into a solid lump of cold ice in his gut leaning leaningsurely the bike must slide from under her that long crouching form would be thrown fragile bones crushed gentle curves mutilated how dared she risk her precious life like this the woman was going to drive him insane yeah good isnt she couldve gone pro if she hadnt been so set on medicine obviously unconcerned terris uncle turned away as one of the other riders came in good good luke wanted to demand that she be called off the track stat he folded his arms feeling the tightness pinch around his eyes and mouth acid churned in his stomach hed been watching the speeding riders with reasonable detachment congratulating himself for managing that degree of calm the accident which had killed his cousin had been years ago past time for him to let go his visceral antipathy to motorcycles but now now he knew it was terri on the track he felt sick and angry angrier by the minute two circuits later she slowed and pulled into the pit area oblivious to his glowering presence she stopped to chat briefly to a couple of the mechanics further along the lane her long legs braced on either side of the machine with a quick nod she rode forward slowly the machines throaty growl sounded a protest at the restrained speed as she turned into the empty garage luke stalked across the tarmac driven by the desire to give her a verbal blast he turned into the wide door terri stood beside the bike stripping off her gloves the skintight red leather suit moulded to her lithe body his gaze was drawn irresistibly down over each feminine curve breast waist hip thigh at the knee the bright supple covering disappeared into long black boots luke swallowed his steps slowing as an unexpected shudder shook him his eyes made the return trip she was gorgeous sensual dangerous to his sanity as he watched she unclipped her helmet and shook out waves of long dark hair perfection and she would risk it all for a thrill a momentary pleasure his daughter had made a confidante of this reckless creature allie wouldnt be able to cope with another flood of grief in her young life terri needed to consider that when she indulged her whim for danger bubbling anger dimmed a tiny internal alarm that sounded in his brain walk away dont do this dont do this walk away now his entire system twitched with the need for an argument even relished the prospect in a perverse way his feet moved purposefully until he was only a few feet from her she turned the radiant smile on her lips tilted higher he could see the high of exhilaration was still pumping through her system hi luke her buoyant greeting was the last straw i suppose youre proud of that display out there he said softly she tipped her head slightly to one side the riding yes the riding he grated oh yes i suppose i am a bit did you see she still hadnt realised his dangerous state of mind enthusiasm shone through her voice she stuffed her gloves into the hollow of the helmet and then stood with it dangling from one hand i saw he said grimly what sort of example do you think youre setting example wella good one i hope i was in absolute control of the bike at all times she said her voice confused all it takes is a loss of concentration for a split second he ground his teeth together the muscle tension in his jaw was painful people rely on you patients up at the hospital my family my daughter and me what about me how am i going to feel if your broken body ends up in accident and emergency he managed to clamp his mouth shut before the telling words escaped you have a responsibility to this community he sounded foolish but even realising that he was powerless to stop himself luke i what if something happened to you she gave him a long searching look her expression melted into a look of profound compassion oh im so sorry this is about kevin isnt it how insensitive of me i know it was hard for you the way he died but you cant hold onto that grief luke for your sake and for allies its time to let it go he swore a brief earthy oath you think this is about kevin well yes her beautiful face was uncertain and he could see her trying to read his mood isnt it no god damn it this is about you terri she took a step back retreating from the fierceness he knew he was radiating ii think you need to calm down and then maybe we can talk about this perhaps later she pivoted and started to walk past him for now i without thinking he reached out snagging her elbow the force of her momentum spun her around and landed her hard on his chest one hand braced at his waist his fingers flexed around her upper arms where hed reached out to steady her her wellworn leathers felt warm and soft oddly intimate against his palms he gulped in a lungful of air starting the move to set her back on her feet then she lifted her head her lips trembled only inches from his and all his good intentions evaporated terri his voice so ragged sounded shockingly needy desperate luke his name was little more than a whisper dark nearly black eyes held his for a long moment before slipping heavylidded to his mouth instead of freeing her he pulled her closer tilted his head slanted his lips over the fullness of hers no awkwardness no hesitation the delight of unexpected familiarity mingled with the wonder and excitement of discovery she made a small humming sound almost a moan the hand at his waist relaxed then tightened again before creeping around his back as she pressed into him the pressure of each fingertip burned through the thin fabric of his shirt he revelled in the touch wanted more wanted it on his skin all his anger with her carelessness his fear for her safety everything drained away her lips parted in a sweet moist caress so soft and mobile delicious a thrill streaked through him blotting out coherent thought reducing his world to the sensation of her body pressed to his she made him want to give moretake morethan was sensible a single resonating crunch ripped through the moment terris head jerked back her torso arching away from his she stared up at him eyes wide and stunned as he watched the dazed expression cleared from her eyes her hands which had been clasped across his back now flattened on his chest as she shoved herself away from him he swallowed his system was revved heart pumping muscles ready to take on dragons the only thing he wasnt ready for was terri she looked utterly shattered her breasts rose and fell shakily with each shallow rapid breath the helmet the source of the noise rocked back and forth on the floor beside them terri started to raise her hand to her face and he saw the tremor in her fingers as though she suddenly realised what she was doing her fingers closed in a fist that was pulled sharply back to her side what did you do that for im sorry his voice was hoarse the words meaningless he wasnt sorry not at all given the option this moment hed take up where theyd left off youre ssorry her voice rose and she looked momentarily as shocked as he was by the note of hysteria she glowered at him then her face slowly crumpled oh god what have you done i was okay when i though it was just m she trailed off her expression appalled just you his heart bumped she felt the same way he did she stiffened pulling herself together before his eyes justthis thinguswe cant she touched her forehead with her fingers rubbing hard at the skin oh what am i saying there is no us were colleagues nothing more do you hear me she looked up at him then the expression in her eyes desperate daring him to disagree she was wrong though he couldnt point that out not right now not when he could see how devastated she was not when his own system was shaking and shuddering in the aftermath of the kiss he didnt understand what was behind her reaction but he needed to find a way to soothe her he lifted a hand to reach out make a tiny physical connection she nearly leapt away from him terri i have to go he watched her long legs powering her away from him agitation clear in every rapid step she didnt want anything more than a professional relationship that much was clear but it didnt alter the fact that shed kissed him back wildly wantonly he felt like a teenager giddy and stupid after the voluptuousness of his first kiss and it was a firsthis first passionate kiss since his wife had died he scrubbed his hands down his face why had he done it he hadnt felt as though he had a choiceonce she had been in his arms blind instinct had taken over for both of them he didnt want to think about replacing his wife he wasnt ready was he he could almost feel his reality shifting around him he swallowed maybe he was ready kissing terri didnt feel like the betrayal hed have predicted if thered been time to consider before acting quite simply the kiss was the most important thing to have happened to him as a man for two and a half years itd been electrifying physical demanding consuming utterly sublime twelve years ago her kiss had been sweetly innocent with a hint of the spice to come now her flavour was piquant rich and complex terri tasted right he wanted to kiss her again explore the spark between them to rejoice in being alive and savour the stirring of his masculinity but they had some issues to sort out first luke huffed out the breath he was sorry hed upset her the last thing he wanted was to hurt her he needed to talk with her find out what the problem was help her deal with it he made up his mind she had until tomorrow to calm down then he was going to apologise for ambushing her and get to the bottom of her reaction he walked out slowly to find mick the next day luke spotted terri at the bench in the emergency department kitchenette he ran his eyes hungrily down then back up the green scrubs that draped her slender body he smiled wryly she had no business looking so damned desirable in the baggy work gear her hair was caught in a loose bun at the nape of her neck and he itched to tug out the tortoiseshell comb holding it in place sink his fingers through the long silky strands he took a deep breath and dredged up some selfcontrol he was here to apologise smooth over any awkwardness not create new problems he needed to talk to her pave the way for them to discuss what had happened at the racetrack arranging his face in what he hoped was an affable nonthreatening expression he went into the room her head was bent the nape of her neck looked so vulnerable he wanted to reach out to comfort she seemed to be staring into the drink she was preparing she held an empty teaspoon over the rim of her mug as though she was trying to decide what to do with it terri she started violently jerking the handle of the mug in her hand dark liquid slopped over the bench she muttered something under her breath put the teaspoon down and reached for the dishcloth luke a quick flush of red ran under her pale skin he stopped beside her im sorry he said gently i didnt mean to startle you did you want something her voice was even as she mopped up the spill the pattern on the bench would be scoured off if she was any more thorough he stifled a sigh i wanted to see you well here i am she still hadnt looked at him i wanted to see how you were im fine terri voices in the doorway made him glance round at least one of the people obviously intended to come into the room and luke didnt want to be interrupted or risk the discussion being overheard we need to talk somewhere private talk as hospital director to doctor on duty or something else she rinsed the cloth under the tap and hung it over the tap refusal was plain in her stiff spine and he was tempted to lie something else personal in that case no i cant spare you any time just now she topped up her mug from the urn then flicked him a brief glance if youll excuse me he held his hand out in a motion of appeal and she froze then took a small step back and looked at him fully her eyes were puffy and tired and all the colour had drained out of her cheeks she looked fragile as though she hadnt slept well he nearly groaned with the need to put his arms around her terri i need to go please the words were calm yet he had the distinct impression she was holding herself together by willpower alone guilt stabbed at him of course he curled his fingers into his palm and dropped his hand she waited until he stepped aside before she moved past him his gaze followed the graceful sway of her hips until she turned into one of the offices she must intend to catch up with some paperwork he ran a hand through his hair and smiled philosophically terri wasnt going to make it easy for him sueellen would have his wife had smoothed his life for him wherever she could hed appreciated it their love had been a quiet comfortable emotion not a grand passion nothing like the volatile mixture of emotions he was starting to feel for terri he sighed she was complex combustion to sueellens serenity terri tested the limits of his selfcontrolwhich to his chagrin were diminishing with each passing day what the hell was he going to do about her he had to think of something or they were both going to be wrecks by the end of their time together though he realised he didnt like thinking of that in terms of a finite period chapter eight terri sifted cool sand through her toes beneath a shallow wave her walk along the beach had restored a degree of calmness seeing luke today being near him after the explosive embrace yesterday had been impossible shed reacted like the gauchest schoolgirl embarrassing but shed been unable to help it hed seen of course the pity in his eyes had been hard to take what did he think of her now shed wager that the glowing opinion hed expressed the other day had been amended she turned and walked up to the path through the trees a small part of her wanted to know what hed been going to say in the kitchenette most of her was just plain afraid she wasnt sure what scared her the mostthat the kiss meant something to him or that it didnt how contrary as she approached the cottage a figure rose from one of her verandah chairs she stopped luke her heart stuttered then raced into an erratic uncomfortable riff damn damn damn she longed to turn and run but that was ridiculousespecially as hed seen her forcing her feet to move she squared her shoulders and climbed the steps i guess you get to see me after all she was proud of the drawl she managed her internal tremble was scarcely noticeable a miracle considering the way her traitorous heart was still pounding at her larynx i wont stay long he said softly his expression sombre i wanted to make sure you were okay you were upset today she shrugged hoping for nonchalance you caught me by surprise after after yesterday he finished for her i owe you an apology for the way i treated you at the track an unexpected dart of pain lanced through her chest that was one question answered her first kiss since her husbands death and the man whod given it to her was falling over himself to apologise while he wished it hadnt happened shed been shattered by the terrifying beauty and power of it she couldnt let him see how much oh that she managed praying she didnt sound as brittle as she felt lets consider it forgotten shall we im not apologising for the kiss terri she stared at him trying to make sense of his words you scared the daylights out of me with the way you were riding that motorbike he held up his hand when she would have spoken i know youre a good rider better than goodyoure outstanding thank you she said faintly i guess dont thank me i wasnt watching you and admiring your technically brilliant performance he smiled thinly the way you threw that bike into the corners made me angry angry i dont want to lose you she swallowed looking away uncomfortably we dont want to lose you allie and me weve lost too much already youre her new best friend and confidante she needs you i needi dont want to see her hurt of course you dont her heart melted he was such a good father neither do i i know there was a small silence then he smiled at her a slow delicious smile that curled her toes her heart skipped a beat and then tripped over itself trying to catch up she should excuse herself send him home now hed said his piece dodo you want to come in for a drink she heard the words leaving her mouth with a sense of astonishment er dont feel you have toi justill understand if youre busy nothing pressing he said firmly thanks i would like a drink right she stood indecisively for a moment then turned away to open the door coffee or a cool drink maybe a beer a beer would be great he followed her inside even with her back to him she felt as though she was aware of every sound and movement he made as he followed her through to the kitchen ive only got light beer she opened the fridge stubbie or would you prefer it in a glass stubbie will be fine thanks she handed him the bottle his fingers brushed hers and a ripple of sensation ran up her arm its um a nice evening lets sit on the chairs out the back sure he held the door open and ushered her out as she settled into the wicker chair she suddenly realised how romantic the setting was with the rapidly dimming pink wash of sunset the golden glow from the kitchen light behind them did nothing to dispel the illusion of cosy intimacy the glare of a harsh fluorescent tube would have helpedbut to get that shed have to get up and walk past the source of her angst to the switch luke twisted the top off his bottle as he subsided into the chair beside her cheers he leaned forward there was a small musical clink as he lightly tapped his bottle to hers yes cheers she watched as he lifted the bottle to his mouth his lips settling on the rim looking away hastily she took a swig from her own bottle the liquid fizzed in her throat as she searched for something to talk about something other than the thing that suddenly filled her mind his mouth his lips his kiss seconds crawled by as she sat in tonguetied discomfort her mind utterly stuck on the interlude in the garage she glanced sideways at him only to find him watching her intently his face thoughtful she could almost see him gathering words for a discussion she didnt want to have not the kiss she really didnt want to discuss that terri she had to forestall him do you think youll ever get back on a motorbike as soon as the words left her lips she felt ill he grimaced im not quite ready for that yet oh god luke her voice shook with her distress im so sorry i dont know where that came from dont worry he lifted one shoulder the thought did cross my mind at the track that was before i saw you of course then all i could think of was talking some sense into you he gave her a lopsided smile and look what a good job i did of that she wet her lips oh dear he was back to the kiss she knew it talking about it meant acknowledging it out loud holding it up to the light for examination making it even more compelling she wanted it to fade away as it would surely do given enough time and no discussion with the man whod made her feel so raw and conflicted when she didnt say anything he said refusing to discuss it isnt going to make it go away terri she raised her eyebrow and sent him a sidelong look how can you be sure he laughed softly i know some of how youre feeling its a shock isnt it a shock yes thats one way of putting it she said with a sigh of resignation its two and a half years since i lost sueellen i loved my wife youre the first woman ive kissed since my wife died and you knocked me sideways i never expected to feel this way again ever terri contemplated the bottle she held loosely in her hand luke and sueellen had obviously had a very happy loving relationship terri was surprised by the shaft of grief she felt by the time the landmine explosion had killed peter she and her husband had had no marriage left to betray her stomach cramped at the memory she was a fraud letting luke assume she was in the same predicament as he was he was right about one thing though her equilibrium hadnt been this upset by a kiss since shed been eighteen and it had been his kiss then too heat swept through her what i really want to do is kiss you again he said soon i would do it right now in a heartbeat if i thought you would let me but im guessing thats not going to happenis it no oh her pulse bumped hard he wanted to kiss her again you shouldnt we mustnt but it was what she wanted tooregardless of all her good sense telling her otherwise i figure ill give you a bit of time to get used to the idea her breath caught gget used to the idea she managed before i do it again his eyes tracked down to her mouth and lingered there for a moment im only human terri and im attracted as hell to you ive tried to ignore it but that isnt working for me he tilted his head giving her a selfdeprecating smile when she remained silent am i mistaken in thinking you feel the same way we cant do anything about it we mustnt why not he paused do you feel like youd be betraying peter coldness gripped her at the sound of luke speaking her late husbands name thats her throat closed and she had to force the words out itsnot the same she stood and held out her hand its getting late have you finished your drink he frowned staring up at her for a long moment before slowly handing over his empty bottle she knew she was handling it clumsily but for the life of her couldnt think of a smoother way to signal that the evening was over she walked past him into the house hopefully he would go now bottles in hand she walked to the sink and stopped not the samehow lukes voice was soft persuasive she turned slowly to see him standing across the room just inside the door his expression was tender with sympathy she didnt deserve how such a simple little question but the answer had the power to rip her apart could she bear to see disgust in his eyes once he knew she was a foolish woman whod stayed too long in a danger zone a sad tragic creature whod been too slow to accept her husband didnt want her or the baby she carried her folly had cost her everything her marriage her husband and the biggest price of all her baby perhaps luke had been right that evening in her lounge perhaps he did need to know the worst about her as a colleague as her boss as a friend maybe most of all as the doctor to whom hed entrusted his daughters wellbeing my marriage wasnt like yours luke we hadproblems how laughably feeble and mild that sounded solemn blue eyes examined her face calmly tell me whatever it is i wont think less of you her throat closed on the urge to be sick she knew better her hands tightened on hard smoothness and she looked down surprised to see she still held the bottles peter was taking me to the airport when the explosion happened her larynx felt raw and tender i wanted to come home he ddied because i wanted to come home oh terri in two strides he was there in front of her she watched numbly as he removed the bottle from one hand then the other with her hands empty he gathered her into his arms his body heat was startling you cant think that way he said youll destroy yourself she wound her hands around his waist with her ear pressed to his chest she could hear the steady beat of his heart after a long silence she said we were arguing when the car hit a llandmine poor sweetheart he murmured and you feel bad because of that she didnt deserve his understanding she had to make him see push out the ugly facts until he turned from her as he should if hed been ppaying more attention he might have seen something to warn him a flaw in the road surface or something hush luke hugged her tighter you know its pointless to think like that he probably wouldnt have seen anything thats why mines are such bloody awful weapons you know that his body curved over hers holding her as though she was precious reminding her of the way hed been so protective with allie with his strong nurturing instinct he was so unlike peter peter had loved mankind he hadnt had time to cater to the needs of a wife his need to serve had been noble and laudable but so very hard to live with shed felt petty and selfish asking for more for herself for needing more being enveloped in lukes caring was glorious and it was torture she wasnt entitled to his good opinion he still didnt know everything she swallowed and gathered the courage to let go the next piece of poison i was leaving him luke my marriage was over i ccouldnt be the person he needed me to be i failed him i ffailedi failed the words to make him understand the rest choked in her throat no you didnt marriages dont always work sweetheart its sad but its life he thought shed finished but she hadnt she couldnt bring herself to tell him the worst shed failed again she was a coward his warm hand cupped her neck the fingers stroking her sensitive skin gently she stood passively in his arms her attention on each delicate movement storing the sensory memories for the future whats so bloody unfair for you is the way you lost peter and the timing but its not your fault terri dont she squeezed her eyes shut as a hot lump in her throat threatened dont what just dont she turned her head pressed her hot face into the cool skin of his neck feeling the steady bump of his carotid pulse against her forehead he shifted and her awareness of the hard body clasping hers changed abruptly her pulse sped up she should pull backstarted to move his head bent slightly and his breath whispered across her cheek if she tipped her head a little and reached up shed be able to press her mouth to his it wouldnt be right to take more than the comfort hed given so generously especially when she had so little to offer in return but suddenly she didnt care she wanted something for herself a kiss his kiss whatever he was prepared to give her in this moment she wanted to feel desirable again to remind herself how that felt she tilted her chin but still he didnt move another millimetre nearer and still he waited with infinite patience each beat of her pulse pushed her a little closer and then the perfect heartstopping moment when her lips touched his just the gentlest caress the barest pressure exquisite his mouth moved on hers rubbing nibbling until the nerve endings in the sensitive skin were alive a gift to herself the beauty of it held her enthralled she whimpered when he pulled back not enough more she wanted more his hand lifted to tidy a strand of her hair she suppressed a gasp as he tucked it behind her ear as his fingers touched the rim she could feel the tremor in them her heart squeezed painfully his hand dropped back to her shoulder and after a moment he said i should go should you oh god terri with his forehead resting on hers he rubbed his hands slowly up and down her arms this is too important for us to rush i dont want you to do anything that youll regret i wont i wouldnt be he pulled back and looked down at her his throat moved in audible swallow and then he smiled dont tempt me he said with mock severity im trying to do the right thing here i know if she pushed him now he would give her what she wantedsweet relief from the thoughts in her head he was as vulnerable to the chemistry between them as she was but she couldnt do it he deserved more we need to talk some more before we go any further luke she suppressed a sigh you cant solve everything by talking about it he cocked his head his smile teasing is this the same woman who solved my problems with my daughter by getting us talking that was different in some ways we do have to talk and we will but not now he pressed a quick kiss to her forehead and stepped away from her sleep well darling yes she said knowing she wouldnt thank you my pleasure he reached out again and stroked his fingers down her cheek as if he couldnt resist touching one more time see you tomorrow sure tomorrow terri watched him go knowing it was for the best much as she ached for his embrace he was right she should be grateful hed decided to leave before she did something theyd both be sorry for she wondered what hed have done if shed begged him to take her to bed if shed begged him to help her forget for a whole night not just the precious minutes when his kindness his touch his kiss had given her respite from her pain shed wanted to be selfish to beg cajole humiliate herself until he gave her more until he gave her everything her marriage had been far from a meeting of soulmates friendship with luke was richer and more fulfilling than all the sacred vows shed taken with peter too valuable to risk on the fleeting satisfaction of something more physical besidesluke was her boss her colleague and most importantly luke was a father with a daughter who needed him very much right now terri took a deep breath and faced the truth the last thing luke needed was someone as broken as she was clinging and demanding his time and attention luke jammed his hands into his jeans pockets and took a deep lungful of air the sweet smell of freshly mown grass mingled with the damp of the evening helping to soothe his frazzled nerves leaving terri was torment but if he was to have any integrity at all he had to he blew out a long breath shed opened up to him told him things that made his gut ache with the agony of them hed held her slender frame felt the silent bottledup grief in her trembling body and hed wanted to weep for her regardless of the state of her marriage having peter ripped from her life like that was a tragedy almost beyond comprehension any hopes any dreams any chance of reconciliation had been lost in an instant cruel senseless irrevocable he was almost sure there was more but why hadnt she told him she was a very private person perhaps telling him as much as she had was all she could handle to start with he could respect that and when she was ready to tell him more hed be there for her theyd made a start and hed been content with that until shed instigated the kiss then his altruism had evaporated and hed wanted everything a redblooded man wanted from a beautiful woman hed wanted to break all his selfimposed rules he wasnt proud of himself knowing that given the tiniest bit more encouragement hed have taken shameful advantage of a griefstricken widow hed nearly been unmanned when shed looked up at him with her big brown eyes shed seen worse things than he could imagine hed wanted to take away her pain and heartbreak to hold her kiss her touch her but he knew it wasnt that simple and rather than risk the small progress theyd made hed chosen caution it had taken all his strength to let her go do the honourable thing he didnt want her to do anything shed regret their relationship was new complex and far too fragile for a quick tumble into bed why then did he have the nagging feeling that hed let her down tonight his restraint hadnt been what shed wanted but he knew it was what she needed could she have read his retreat as rejection his footsteps slowed he could go back explain he wanted her more than life itself explain he wanted them to get it right that it was too important for a quick grab at gratification undecided he stood looking at the cottage then with a small sigh he reluctantly turned for home going back now wouldnt be a good idea hed make sure they talk again soon hed make sure she understood how much he wanted her chapter nine the next day terri hung her white coat on the hook on the clinicroom door and turned to look at her reflection in the mirror she smoothed her hair straightened her shirt and ran a quick eye over the profile of her lower half in the new black jeans then she looked herself in the eye and wrinkled her nose how much more comfortable it was to fuss with her appearance than to think about the thing that was really bothering her luke she didnt want to run into him yet last night hed seen her at her worst shed been so vulnerable so needy she didnt want to remember that he had the strength to resist her advances he did a charming line in rejection very gentle but firm she grimaced too much selfrespect to allow himself to be used she should appreciate thatshe did appreciate that but a tiny part of her couldnt help but think it would be nice to have someone lose their head over herjust a little at least shed slept well last night and for that she was grateful to luke his insight his pushing it had helped rather than harmed to talk about peter shed expected to relive the explosion in vivid torturous nightmares after luke had gone but she hadnt her sleep had been dreamless and refreshing she moved across to the desk and stacked the patient records shed used that morning scooping them up into her arms she walked to the door with her hand on the knob she paused and took a deep breath no point skulking in the office seeing luke was unavoidable as they were both on duty for the day her only hope was that hed been called out for an emergency case but that seemed unlikely as she hadnt been notified that shed need to take cases from the second list she marched out of the room and was nearly at the front desk when surprise had her halting in midstride uncle mick perhaps she wasnt finished after all what are you doing here tee his smile was quick and nervous almost guilty have you got an appointment now she asked i didnt see you on my list but i can see you now if you like um no didnt want to trouble you love so i um well you knowshould be running along colour ran into his cheeks and he shuffled his feet are you sure you seem upset terri was perplexed fine im fine love i just her uncle cleared his throat and then his gaze slid past her his expression was a mixture of relief and consternation um thanks luke ill er catch up with you about those results his face turned even redder see you at the track tee frowning she watched him hurry away she turned to see luke slide his used files into the tray he added a couple of blood tubes to the laboratory test basket she glanced at the name on the top file uncle micks been to see you yes luke looked a little uncomfortable look lets grab a cuppa and have a chat is there a problem no of course not her spirits plummeted there must be if hes asked to see you its just that i thought after id diagnosed his diabeteshes been feeling so much betteroh dear this is such a backward stepi thought he finally believed that i knew what i was doing after all he does your uncle has nothing but praise for you luke leaned across and wrapped his hands around the records she held she released them quickly as his fingers brushed the skin on her forearm he placed the files into the tray and said on second thoughts lets have lunch weve got some other things to discuss as well and but he cant be happy with me if hes come to see you terri there are some things that make a man draw a line oh is he still embarrassed about the incident the other night she frowned i thought wed got past that i told him it wasnt his fault that he only behaved that way because he was so ill yes but thats not why he didnt want to come to see you then there was another reason she suppressed a squeak of surprise when luke took her by the elbow and ushered her towards the door nina were going for a bite of lunch at home page us if you need us sure thing boss imi dont know if i want to eat lunch with you feet still moving in the direction he was guiding her terri looked back over her shoulder at the grinning nurse sure you do i make a mean cheese omelette and weve got the kitchen to ourselves today as mums taken dad into melbourne for a checkup and besides you want to know why micks been to see me yes i do but will you please stop making a spectacle of us by dragging me around the hospital he muttered something under his breath and released her he stopped when she did a muscle in his jaw rippled giving the impression of tightly leashed emotion they stood alone on the pavement between the hospital and his parents house terri mick is fifty five years old i know so dont you think that he might be a little uncomfortable getting his first routine prostate check from someone who used to run around in the backyard with his own children oh she swallowed feeling like an idiot she was dimly aware of his hand in the small of her back ushering her down the path of course how stupid of me its thanks to you that mick was in here getting the checkup today luke said evenly he said apart from the hiccup after the races the other night hes never felt better there might be something in this prevention is better than cure rubbish he opened the back door of the house and gently steered her into the kitchen thats a direct quote oh his coming to see me had nothing to do with lack of faith in your ability terri a quick expression flitted across her face if hed had to define it hed have said it was pain her vulnerability punched him again well thatsgood then he saw the faint frown on her face as she stood in the kitchen looking around she looked lost almost as though she wasnt sure how shed got there god he wanted to look after her protect her smooth out the bumps in her life for her hed set himself a hard task terri mitchell was fiercely independent at least with the surprise of micks visit there hadnt been a chance for her to feel any awkwardness after last night hed wondered how their first meeting would go this morning one bump had been avoided but it had created another that he didnt understand now cheese onion mushroom he turned to the fridge and put the items on the bench as the reeled them off im sorry for the omelette im making you for lunch you dont have to make me lunch heres the grater for the cheese we dont need much he said pleased when her hands automatically began the task hed set for her he started breaking eggs into a bowl this is a good opportunity for us to talk actually youre right we do need to talk she stopped grating what on earth were you thinking when you told nina you were taking me home for lunch she was grinning like the cheshire cat heaven only knows what rumours will have started circulating by the time we get back to work i dont care he wiped the mushroom caps then sliced them thinly with a sharp knife what do you mean you dont care this isnt london she said tartly were doctors in a small community you have to care nope do you want to cut up the onion for me he looked at her hopefully no damn it i dont want to cut up your blasted onion pity okay ill do it suppressing a smile at her palpable frustration he began slicing the vegetable thinly luke are you listening to me absolutely he leaned down and got a fryingpan out of the cupboard and put it on the stove over a low heat youre worried that the hospital grapevine has got us over here indulging in a bout of hot sex a quick glance showed him that she was standing with her mouth open he would be willing to bet that it wasnt because she was speechless much more likely that she had too much to say and didnt know which scathing retort to fire at him first knives and forks in that drawer salt and pepper on the worktop he whisked the eggs and tipped them into the warm pan using a spatula he lifted the edge of the mix to stop it from sticking with the eggs cooking gently he risked another look at terri dont you think the people youve worked with for six months have a better opinion of you than that maybe she sighed probably he spread the chopped and grated filling over the top of the egg and reached up to grab a couple of plates out of the cupboard with a deft flip he folded the omelette then cut it lets eat he said carrying the laden plates across to set them on the table terri followed slowly and slipped into the chair opposite his thank you bon appetit he reached for the pepper out of the corner of his eye he could see her pick up her utensils they ate in silence for a few moments youre right you do cook a mean omelette she said its delicious thank you my pleasure feeding her filled him with a warm glow basic instinctive primal he was surprised how much he wanted to provide food and shelter for this woman get close to her to pet her and love her to have her return his feelings he waited until she took the last mouthful of omelette there was no easy way to start this discussion so he may as well plunge right in if were going to have a relationship we need to set some ground rules up front she stared at him her mouth stopping briefly in midchew then he could see her trying to force the food down her throat he got up to fill a glass with water then took it back to the table and held it out to her here she waved it away a relationship are you crazy no not at all he put the glass on the table we agreed last night that were attracted to each other theres chemistry between us she gave him a hunted look and pushed away her plate yes good he let out his breath for a moment hed thought she was going to deny him but she was no coward luke this is a small country town we work together youre my boss any sort of entanglement outside work has disaster written all over it well go slowly be sensible start off with normal social interaction everyday routine stuff see where it takes us he watched the expressions flit over her face im not suggesting that we flaunt it with public displays of extravagant affection but neither do i want to hide it away as though its a furtive holeinthewall affair what if we get down the track and realise it isnt working were adults professionals we deal with it she looked at him sceptically what about allie shed be delighted my daughter thinks youre the best thing since sliced bread i know you care about her and i know that wouldnt change he leaned his elbows on the table and looked into her eyes even if you thought her father was the biggest swine this side of the black stump she gave a snort of surprised laughter and is he he tries hard not to be terri was still looking at him doubtfully but luke sensed hed crossed some invisible boundary with her he smiled so how about it slow and sensible as you want and may the powers give him the strength to keep his word without causing him physical injury a loud discordant beep made her start she reached for the paging unit on her waistband and looked at it tucking it back into position she got to her feet id better go hell was she going to leave him in limbo luke swallowed and stood to pick up the plates surely she wouldnt be so cruel a second later she looked him squarely in the eye all right then yes slow and sensible he stifled the yell that threatened to rip out from gut level and managed a moderate great she nodded see you back at work yes as soon as the door closed behind her he let his smile escape yes now all he had to do was get the balance right he didnt want her to feel crowded or stampeded by him but he did want them to spend as much time together as they could terris heart somersaulted wildly shed just agreed to have a relationship with luke daniels should she applaud herself for bravery for taking the step or chastise herself for being foolish apologise to luke for leading him on for not telling him all the reasons why he shouldnt get involved with her she was too weak the love that shone between him and allie beckoned her closer made her want to catch some of the warmth for herself was it so wrong of her somehow she would find the courage to tell him what he had a right to know soon before they got too deep first she would store precious bright moments in her memory she shivered as she walked through the warm spring afternoon was she fooling herself everyday routine stuff hed said she was very much afraid that the normal everyday could be addictive with luke chapter ten five days since terri had agreed to a relationship with him five days of caution and restraint five whole days not long in terms of world affairs not even a week in terms of selfcontrol it was an aeon luke looked across to where allie was showing terri the information tag on another nursery plant at his daughters behest terri obediently bent to sniff a white bloom helpless to resist he watched the way her red shorts clung to the curve of her buttocks as she leaned forward a familiar tug of desire caught him low in his gut and he suppressed a groan frustration was his constant companion these days hed played it cool all week not making any overt moves not giving terri any excuses to retreat to change her mind the first few times hed joined her for coffee in the staff tea room hed felt her wariness as though she expected him to say something do something in front of the other staff as though shed known how hard hed had to tether his need to stake a public claim on her by the end of the week shed almost relaxed and he congratulated himself that his softly softly approach was working allie flitted to another plant like an overly fussy worker bee her face radiated enthusiasm as she turned over the tag read it then moved on he smiled shed inherited her mothers love of gardening his eyes slid back to the woman who followed a pace behind his daughter long dark hair formed a thick gleaming mantle across terris shoulders five whole days since hed kissed her since hed held her in his armsthreaded his fingers deep in her hair the sable silk would look glorious spread over his pillowas her lips moved in a mysterious womanly smile inviting his kiss inviting his touch inviting daddy the plaintive cry slapped him out of his fantasy he focussed to find himself staring straight at terri her soft brown eyes held a quizzical expression his pulse stopped and then lurched into an erratic bounding rhythm hell what was she reading from his face he swallowed sorry miles away he walked towards them forcing his mouth into the best smile he could manage it felt feeble what did i miss i want this rose for mummys garden allie looked at him anxiously do you think mummy would like it dad its not exactly the same as the one at home but the colour is so pretty he looked from his daughters wistful face to the plant with its cluster of small coralpink buds i know your mum would love it because you chose it sweetheart its perfect allie beamed cool can we get some small plants too i talked to granddad and he said we should he gave me a list to choose from did he then if granddad said so wed better get some he grinned we need a trolley theyre over there allie pointed then skipped away its lovely to see her so happy terris husky voice sent a quiver down his spine yes he watched as his daughter manoeuvred an awkward flatbottomed trolley back towards them he tilted his head towards terri his eyes following the line of her jaw to her stubborn little chin have i mentioned how much i appreciate you giving me my daughter back you might have a time or two her grin was alive with mischief perhaps i should mention it again he murmured reaching out to capture a ringlet of hair that had caught on the simple gold chain of her necklace masculine satisfaction surged at her quick shiver as he stroked the strand back over her shoulder its not necessary there was a slight catch in her voice and when her eyes darted up to his they held a dark flare of awareness his gaze moved down to her mouth watched as she caught her bottom lip her teeth sank into the tender flesh until he wanted to protest wanted it to be his teeth nipping at the plump cushion terri she blinked and looked away a strained smile curving her mouth well done allie lets grab your rose and see what else we can find rooted to the spot luke watched as one of the attendants lifted the pot of the chosen rose onto the trolley his daughter chattered to terri and pushed the trolley a little further along the aisle when they stopped a trick of the light bathed the two of them in a glowing ethereal halo terri bent her head towards allie whose upturned face was filled with trust and hope and love he stared at their smiling profiles the seconds moved with a syrupy slowness as his heart compressed painfully a shudder ran through him as though a foundation had shifted deep in his psyche he blinked and looked away waiting for normality he wanted terri badly he ached for her but this sensation was something more something powerful elemental frighteningly important hed promised to take things slowly and sensibly but there was nothing temperate about the emotions storming through him he frowned abruptly certain he didnt know enough about her shed opened up so much the other night wrenching details about her marriage and about her last moments with her husband was there more if there was shed baulked at the idea of sharing it with him why what could be worse than the things she had told him perhaps his unease was because he sensed the trauma of the explosion and her husbands death had left terri with even deeper emotional scars than those shed revealed how could it not did a soul ever truly heal from such cruel wounds despite the heat of the sun on his back a chill spread across his skin as though an unseen threat lurked just beyond his comprehension he huffed out a long breath shrugging away the shiver of unwelcome intuition the only thing he could do was take it one step at a time build trust hope theyd create something worthwhile together okay you two lets get this show on the road he aimed a smile at them as he strode forward plants we need plants allie youve got the list so youre in charge of choosing terri youre with me behind the trolley allie giggled and relinquished the handle to him luke captured terris hand and tugged her to his side now ive got you right where i want you he said under his breath so only she could hear luke her gaze flew to where allie was comparing a tag to the list she held what im only holding your hand he gave her a wicked grin he lowered his voice and said would you like me to show you what i really want to do no she all but yelped no absolutely not behave then youd better hold my hand tight hadnt you sweetheart he said his gaze roving over her anxious face what about allie terris eyes were fixed on his daughter she cared very much for allies wellbeing suddenly his peculiar mood dissolved and he relented dont worry ive had a talk to her about going out with you you have terris eyes came back to his wide and uncertain she thinks its a good idea in fact i think ive gone up in her estimation see what a good influence youre being on me mmm her lips pursed in a moue of doubt and his pulse spiked conversation concentrate on the conversation yes she even wanted to give me some dating advice he strolled down the aisle towards allie who had moved on further i should take you to the movies and buy you ice cream apparently its what all the girls like he gave terri a thoughtful glance what do you thinkwill it get me to first base not likely she muttered darkly you promised we wouldnt flaunt it i also said we wouldnt hide it i think we need to have a discussion on definitions yours versus mine her tone was astringent im starting to sense a lack of compatibility im always ready to discuss our relationship with you he grinned at her just say the word he laughed when his impertinence was rewarded by an oldfashioned look this subtle dance of courtship between them was a pleasure it had been a long time since hed done something just for the fun of it at the checkout he said casually mums issued a nottoberefused invitation to you for dinner tonight hasnt she allie oh yes please come pleease said allie dad said you used to be a regular at chez daniels before we arrived it was short notice and his pressure was less than subtle but he didnt care he didnt think terri was the type to play games if she was free she would come if she wasnt he wouldnt like it but hed have to be philosophical he layered on some more pathos wed hate to think wed scared you off wouldnt we allie yes his daughter looked faintly confused but game to agree since you asked so nicely id love to terri said her narroweyed stare letting him know exactly what she thought of his tactics he grinned unrepentant and tried hard not to look too smug judging from the look terri gave him he hadnt succeeded he was falling hard and quick too hard too quick his senses told him terri mitchell was solid gold his doubts werent about her they were about her past and the pain she was still carrying with care and patience they could handle anything that was thrown at them he was sure of it he pushed away a second shadowy whisper of prescience chapter eleven terri youre here squealed allie lukes head snapped around as his daughter dropped the cutlery shed been setting out on the table to race over and hug their guest hard to believe from allies behaviour that shed seen terri only a matter of hours ago though he certainly couldnt chip her on her overenthusiasm given the great line of somersaults his own gut was doing come and see where weve put the rose i picked for mum said allie we planted it as soon as we got home granddad had the garden all ready give terri a chance to say hello to everyone else before you start dragging her off allie luke said placing the chairs hed been carrying around the table give her a chance to say hello to me hi luke terris smile was wary as he drew near and put his hand on her shoulder he leaned forward to give her a peck on the cheek low down right beside her mouth her skin was soft beneath his lips she smelled delicious fresh soap light fragrance all woman all terri i brought a bottle of wine she stepped back and thrust a bottle into his hands he looked at the label giving himself a precious moment to regroup a south australian white wine thanks you must be psychic mums baking fish on the barbecue not so psychic she grinned i spoke to vivienne when we got home from the nursery earlier clever then the back door opened about time you showed yourself around here young lady said will as he carried the large bowl of salad to the table and then crossed to hug terri i was starting to wonder what that new hospital director had done with you unexpected heat crept into lukes face he knew what the new director had been doing with her and what he planned to do given half a chance oh just the um usual you know work work work terri said with a weak laugh her cheekbones flushed becomingly as her eyes slid in lukes direction and then quickly away will frowned humph i still say the board did the wrong thing by you luke stifled a sigh when his father shot him an ambiguous look i told luke he was stepping on toes you did an excellent job as acting director thank you will but its working out well having luke in charge this time when she slanted a look at luke she met his eyes he enjoyed the tiny conspiratorial moment weve got the new boy licked into shape now and you know how much i detest paperwork we dont let luke go home until hes cleared his desk like me with my homework said allie with a big grin the way his father and daughter responded to terri was beautiful exactly like that terri smiled as she ran a hand down allies stubby ponytail yes i think your fathers proving to be quite satisfactory allie she looked at him from under her lashes all things considered thank you for that faint praise luke murmured feeling close to tonguetied she was flirting with him his heart wobbled and then melted oh its important to give encouragementwhere its deserved of course she said obviously struggling to keep a straight face her lovely brown eyes were alight with laughter and a reprimand where its not im sure as the new director youd agree luke i do agree luke smiled sending a promise of private retribution in his gaze her answering smirk had his overworked pulse leaping about in anticipation his fathers expression eased into a relieved grin as long as the two of you are working it out luke could see terris teasing had been a thousand times more effective than all his attempts to soothe his fathers concerns now can i show terri the garden said allie in longsuffering tones sure said luke dont be too long though dinners nearly ready come on terri allie took terris hand and tugged her along the path as they disappeared round the side of the house his father said perhaps i should go too terri might appreciate my tips for growing roses perhaps another time dad with only the smallest trace of guilt luke handed the wine bottle to his father terri brought this would you mind putting it on ice he set off down the path after terri and allie leaving his father to draw his own conclusions oh this is gorgeous said terri when she saw the neatly laidout garden dad put up the arch and we both planted the rose see itll grow up all over the trellis allie waved her hands expansively to demonstrate i put in the little plants where granddad said and we have this bench come and try it allie sat on the concrete seat and patted the area beside her theres thyme on the ground underneath it grows flat so when you stand on it it smells nice youve all done a fabulous job the fresh clean aroma of the herb rose to greet terri as she sat on the bench yes allies face held deep satisfaction dad said mummy would like it im sure hes right terri said a lump in her throat sueellen had been a muchloved wife and mother what a wonderful epitaph to have earned yes allie leaned sideways and rested her head on terris upper arm the simplicity of the moment was a gift that had terris heart stuttering a snug warm band tightened around her chest as she looked down on the dark head and how are you now allie she asked softly im good daddy said you and him might go out sometimes did he terri swallowed well we might is that okay with you i think itd be cool and id be able to come too sometimes wouldnt i like today with the plants of course id like that terri looked up and saw luke hed propped one shoulder against the smooth trunk of a gum hands in the pockets of his jeans hed obviously showered and changed not long before shed arrived because his hair was still dark and spiky with dampness his face as he looked at allie glowed with love and pride but when he moved his eyes to her terri read something different altogether dangerous seductive irresistible her heart jolted her defences crumbling in that moment she realised she had little hope of protecting herself against this man and his daughter by sharing themselves so unconditionally theyd made a serious chink in her armour it was more than shed ever thought shed have in her life more than she deserved a shadow passed over her spirits would she end up letting them down failing them in some way she couldnt predict she would have to make sure she didnt terri worked her magic effortlessly on his whole family luke realised as he looked around the table a couple of hours later he took a sip of wine as he watched his mother her face was alight with laughter at something terri had said as the two of them stacked the dishes from the meal his mother obviously adored terriand this from the woman whod given him and kevin such a hard time about their motorcycles carrying a pile of plates terri set off towards the house luke ran his fingers absentmindedly over the rounded belly of his wineglass and down the stem to the base as his eyes followed her slender figure she moved gracefully with effortless elegance womanly curves nicely proportioned long long legs he suppressed the urge to gulp altogether a very nice package earth to luke he started slightly and glanced up to find his sister standing beside him a grin on her face have you finished with your glass he handed it over silently and megan walked after his mother and terri his sister another member of his family under terris spell it was megan who had sensed that terri might help allie by taking her down to visit at the beach cottage a link had been established between his daughter and the woman who had saved her life only a matter of days later that link had set up the trust that had enabled allie to confide her agonising guilt and set her on the road to recovery his father had thawed completely after terris banter anxiety that she felt displaced by the hospital boards decision was understandable at least now with concern eased luke would be able to get a better idea of how the man was coping psychologically after the heart attack it was a relief because the faint ongoing hostility hadnt been good for any of them they were all putty in terris handsincluding himself any way she wanted to handle him was just fine with him any way at all the sooner the better for his sanity nice girl his father broke into his thoughts something special luke swallowed and hoped the rush of heat warming his face wasnt visible in the dusk he yanked his thoughts back into line and looked across at the older man terri his father clarified arching one eyebrow at him luke cleared his throat yes she is allie likes her she does so does your mother mmm luke looked into his fathers interested gaze what are you getting at dad nothing just making an observation will brushed the leg of his shorts your mother would like to do some travelling would she it was a curious segue luke wondered what was coming next shes been at me again to retire has she how do you feel about that i used to think it was a ridiculous idea he sighed then continued after a moment but since the heart attack youre thinking about it seriously then today anyway a wry smile curled his fathers mouth maybe tomorrow ill change my mind anyway i thought id float the idea at you just in case im sure the board would look favourably on you taking the directors job permanently if you wanted it okay thanks for the heads up would you want it im not sure dad id have to think about it sound allie out i promised her wed only be here for a year she seems to have settled in she has now thanks to terri there was a companionable silence for a few minutes and then his father said well its something for you to think about yes it is the back door opened and terri came out with a coffee pot in hand allie her faithful shadow was beside her holding the sugar bowl his mother followed a few steps behind with the mugs conversation meandered through various topics for another half an hour and then terri stood i should make tracks she said turning to his mother thank you for a wonderful evening vivienne you know you are always welcome terri dont be a stranger luke rose too ill walk you home oh no need terri tucked a curl behind her ear i can practically see my place from here thats a good idea luke said his mother luke blessed her and her fondness for observing the niceties never mind that terri wandered backwards and forwards between the hospital and the cottage at all hours of the night when she was on call good manners would be observed and in this case it definitely worked to his advantage he smiled at terri who made a small grimace at him ill be back shortly allie he said no worries dad allie beamed at him dont hurry ill go up to bed she gave a theatrical yawn you can kiss me goodnight when you come back er right he stared at her as she kissed her grandparents confident of her welcome allie walked over and put her arms around terris waist for a quick hug thanks for coming shopping with us today thank you for asking me allie i enjoyed it terri smiled her face soft with affection as she looked at his daughter goodnight with one last fierce look at him allie set off towards the house as he crossed the grounds with terri luke was aware of everything about her the way her slim arms swung slightly at her sides the way her hair slipped forward when she bent her head this is so silly you walking me home her voice was light and quick he detected the tiniest telltale catch wicked anticipation curled through his gut its what a wellmannered boy does at the end of a date she rolled her eyes at him this wasnt a date it was an invitation from your mother i seem to recall ah good point that makes it even more significant than any ordinary date he nodded sagely out of the corner of his eye he saw her misstep and reached out to steady her sorry youve had your feet under my parents dining table he left his fingers curled around her arm as he expanded on his theory in dating traditions thats an important milestone there was a small silence and then she teased does it count when its outdoor furniture surely its much too casual a table is a table tradition isnt fussy it certainly isnt when youre making up the rules she laughed as they approached the narrow line of trees that separated the house from the lower yard tsk im starting to wonder if youre going to renege on that other timehonoured endofdate tradition her cottage was just ahead too close it depends which tradition youre thinking of she said not backing down an inch some traditions might earn you a slap for your trouble heat sizzled along his nerve endings as his imagination conjured a scenario that would definitely earn him a slap he swallowed the groan that crept up his throat being with her like this made him want to throw caution to the winds and find out thats not what you said the other night he followed her up the front steps that was then this is now besides a gentleman wouldnt remind a lady of her moment of weakness at the door she turned to face him he braced his hand on the frame and looked down at her her light fragrance teased his senses he resisted the urge to lean forward and breathe deeper im not feeling much like a gentleman tonight arent you nope invite me in and find out i dont think so she flicked her hair back in a quick nervous gesture that made his pulse leap youre in a peculiar mood yeah i am he murmured reaching out to run his fingers along her jaw so how are my chances for a kiss goodnight then if were taking things slow and sensible they should be zero her voice was ragged as he curved his fingers around the back of her neck and tilted her chin up with his thumb should be he bent and brushed his mouth across hers once twice she resisted him on the third brush her mouth softened moved heaven sensitive nerve endings in his lips revelled in the warmth and sweetness his muscles quivered as he ruthlessly suppressed the need to take more take it deeper take it all he caught her lower lip between his and sucked gently before moving his mouth across her cheek to the column of her throat just below her ear when she arched her neck slightly to give him better access he nibbled his way down to the nape oh you are too good at this she moaned as a shudder ran through her wwe should sstop now please he took a deep breath inhaling her scent as he reached for control he closed his eyes and rested his forehead in the curve of her shoulder her skin felt warm and alive beneath his brow this is a bad idea right this minute it feels pretty good to me yes she breathed me too he pressed his lips to her throat felt the frenzied beat of her carotid pulse felt her muscles move in a swallow his heart leapt with the confirmation that she was as affected as he was but thats in this moment her voice was more determined she shifted inching away he let her she was going to make him go he moved back his hand still braced on the doorjamb his eyes moved over her face taking in each fine feature you dont think we should seize the moment explore the possibilities its not necessarily a bad thing to leave possibilities unexplored only if were fainthearted are we going to be fainthearted terri tonight iyes yes i believe we are goodnight luke she groped behind her back and the door swung open he saw a gleam of white as she smiled then backed inside thank you for the escort home see you on monday he smiled back monday the door closed gently he lifted his hand spread his fingers on the wood and after a moment said softly lock your door terri i will her voice came from just the other side of the door the latch clicked into place in spite of his frustration there was some small comfort in the thought that shed loitered there was she as torn as he was hed like to think so terri pressed her hand to her sternum feeling her wild thump of her heartbeat begin to settle as she listened to lukes footsteps she felt so much wanted so much when she was near him he made her wonder just how truly deep and beautiful a relationship between a man and a woman could be made her wonder what it could be like between them how foolish shed been to think they could agree on slow and sensible and keep things under control her hunger was unnerving and she sensed lukes matched it they were both too eager to take the next step it had taken all her willpower to resist inviting him inside regardless of how tempting it was to throw caution to the winds there was too much at stake for both of them professionally personally and emotionally chapter twelve two weeks later luke shrugged into his grey suit jacket and straightened his red tie red for confidence red for determination red for passion and daring excitement spiralled through his lower abdomen he hadnt been this wound up about a date since hed been a teenager an evening with terri alone just the two of themhe chuckled softly and a restaurant full of people of course he picked up his car keys and wallet from the end of the bed then walked along the hall to his daughters bedroom allie lets go he tapped at her door there was no reply allie the door was slightly ajar so he pushed it open to see his daughter sitting on the edge of her bed looking glum he frowned honey whats wrong nothing she studied the tips of her new sandals refusing to meet his eyes shed been fine half an hour ago when hed gone to have his shower and get dressed for tonight what had happened between then and now are you sick a shake of her head he crossed to sit beside her his hand automatically moving to her forehead her skin was cool to his touch and she wasnt having any obvious trouble with her breathing silent alarm bells went off was it a return to the troubled days where allie had been sullen and uncommunicative his earlier excitement fizzled out abruptly he wasnt going to leave it this time he wasnt going to let her shut him out maybe allie didnt like the idea of him dating terri after all theyd discussed it but perhaps shed changed her mind now that it was about to happen come on allie whats going on her bottom lip wobbled im staying right here until you tell me you cant he took a slow deep breath in and let it out as he strove for patience he couldnt believe it over the last couple of weeks he and allie and terri had spent a lot of time together itd been fantastic but now it looked as though allies morose mood was to do with terri i can you and i are getting to the bottom of this even if it means i have to cancel tonight terri will understand oh no allies gaze flew to his wide with dismay you cant do that her vehemence made him raise his eyebrows so talk to me she looked back at her shoes he clenched his jaw and set himself to wait for as long as it took after a moment she mumbled i dont see why i cant come too ill be good and i can help help he heard the strangled note in his voice the relief was so overwhelming he had to work to suppress a great shout of laughter allie was happy for him to go out with terrishe just objected to being left behind yes she looked at him her face suddenly alight with enthusiasm you know with ideas and stuff we had heaps of fun at the movies didnt we and terri likes me we did have fun and i appreciate that you want to suggest things to do he said carefully but id like some time with terri so we can talk about things that would be boring for you you mean like work things and that like that he nodded will terri want to do that too allie looked doubtful yes he said firmly she will oh all right then i guess she plucked the hem of her shorts will you kiss her definitely absolutely one hundred percent guaranteed but was allie ready to hear that yet she was used to seeing him and terri holding hands but was more going to be difficult for her to handle yet a split second later she said i think you should otherwise she wont know that you like her he swallowed okay then ill make sure that i do are you ready to go over to nana and granddads yep a small resigned sigh escaped as she stood and picked up her backpack got your pyjamas toothbrush he reeled off the items as they walked through to his parents wing yes dad inhalers drawing book yes dad she said with a roll of her eyes pencils rubbers a kiss goodnight for your father she giggled probably after hed dropped allie off with his mother luke jogged down the steps to his car it was his birthday he knew what hed like from terri as a present perhaps shed let him put his order in he grinned or perhaps not whatever happened he was looking forward to having a great time slow and sensible might be agonising for him on one level but it was worth it terri was letting down her defences relaxing with him that was worth every bit of physical suffering terris heart lurched when she heard the knock at her door luke fortifying herself with a deep breath she smoothed her hands down the heavy silk of her cheongsam and walked through the hall shed shared wonderful family outings with luke and allie recently but this was different this was their first real date the man waiting for her at the front door was starting to mean more to her than was sensible she turned the handle and opened the door her pulse tripping crazily he looked formal and so handsome dressed in a charcoalgrey suit hi her grin felt wobbly hi yourself his voice was husky the broad smile on his face faltered as he ran his gaze down her length and slowly back up you look fabulous his eyes were dark and intense when they focussed on hers again his mouth moving in a small enigmatic smile that had her catching her breath thank you she managed you too he stared at her a moment longer ready to go yes i just need to get my purse from the kitchen she should have brought it with her to the door she thought as he followed her down the hall she grabbed it off the table and turned to find him right in front her her eyes were level with his mouth he leaned forward still not touching her her fingers tightened on her purse the tiny beads pressing into her skin as her breath caught in her chest all she had to do was step back she didnt move his head tilted moved closer lips hovering over hers closing her eyes she waited sensations bombarded her the musky scent of his aftershave his breath feathering across her cheek and finally the delicious touch of his mouth on hers light and sweet and lingering with a hint of leashed passion her system quaked as she recognised a deep feminine desire to surrender he pulled back and she opened her eyes slowly mmmnice his blue eyes were slumberous and inviting i have it on good authority thats how i can let you know i like you laughter gurgled up her throat catching her unawares relieving the heavy sensual tension allies been giving you dating advice again she has he grinned miss tengoingontwenty his hooded gaze slid down to her lips though i think shes onto something with this idea i should tell youi like yo he waited a beat before adding a lot she laughed again as he waggled his eyebrows at her ill consider myself duly warned i was afraid youd say that he smiled wryly and held out his elbow shall we go your chariot awaits my lady she braced her jellyfilled knees and took his arm feeling the strength there allowing herself to be swept along by his oldfashioned chivalry terri followed the waiter through to their secluded table by the large window lukes hand was spread over her spine just below the small of her back the contact felt intimate made her acutely aware of her body her movements the sway of her hips the tiny brush of her stockingclad thighs against each other the way her buttocks moved with each step she took in her high heels did he realise how astonishingly seductive it felt she wanted to wiggle just a little to see if he would slide his hand even lower heat raced across her skin radiating out from his hand and spreading deep into her abdomen she took a quick gulp of air and huffed it out she didnt have to worry about luke behaving tonightshe was doing a fine job of seducing herself regret and relief vied for the upper hand when the wicked tempting hand was removed so luke could pull out her chair thank you she murmured she looked around as luke took his seat the restaurant was in an old converted warehouse adjacent to the wharf the seafaring theme was tastefully done with gleaming brass fixtures and dark wood panels strategically placed fishing nets had been draped across the upper walls with glass floats dotted here and there candles in thick glass bowls graced each table and cast a romantic light id heard this place had been done up she said meeting lukes gaze across the table ive been meaning to come here for a meal i brought sueellen he stopped his mouth twisting in a grimace sorry i didnt meanits not a good way to impress my date for the evening is it dont apologise why wouldnt you mention her she was a big part of your life yours and allies its good for allie that you talk about her mother thank you his voice was gravelly youre a very special woman terri she grinned making light of the comment im glad you think so the waiter returned with the menus and wine list any preferences for wine luke asked white as were having seafood but other than that im leaving it entirely up to you she looked over the delicious selection of dishes on her menu the waiter took their orders and returned a few minutes later with the bottle of wine he filled their glasses and snuggled the bottle into the ice bucket when the man had gone luke lifted his glass to us to slow and sensible to slow and not so sensible terri bit her tongue to prevent the amended toast from escaping she quickly tapped her glass to lukes and concentrated on the wine the cool rich liquid left a delicious lingering taste of oak mmm lovely good choice she met his eyes across the table allies spending tonight with vivienne and will all night no no no she wasnt going to ask that she didnt need to know reluctantly yes luke gave her a wry smile she wanted to come with us to make sure we had fun shes worried about whether ill be able manage on my own ah more dating advice yes we he cleared his throat and she wondered what hed been going to say after a moment he continued i must remember to remind her about this in a few years when she starts dating terri chuckled shell be mortified im counting on it his quick laugh made her pulse skip he put down his glass and reached across the table to cover her hand with his his voice was soft and husky as he asked so how am i doing are you having fun oh definitely with an effort she managed to keep her tone light i promise to send you home with a glowing report card lots of gold stars his eyes sparkled with a dark sensual invitation in that case i promise to do my best to earn every single one her heart did a slow painful somersault into her throat completely blocking her ability to reply when his hand slid away from hers a moment later in a smooth caress she nearly protested it wasnt until his gaze released hers that she realised the waiter was standing beside them holding their meals she let out a slow breath and looked at her wineglass only one tiny sip and good sense had deserted her she felt sinfully frivolous intoxicated luke she was tipsy with the heady influence of his company thank you she murmured to the waiter as she smoothed the napkin on her knee shed ordered panfried fillets and they looked delicious with their crispy goldenbrown coating and side order of thick roastedpotato wedges a bowl of tossed salad sat in the middle of the table for them to share everything all right she looked up to see luke watching her her world seemed to tilt even further off its axis yes perfect she forced her mouth into what she hoped was a reassuring smile and picked up her knife and fork this looks wonderful now all she had to do was eat it laughing and flirting with luke had wiped out her appetite for food completely did i tell you dads talking about retiring he said thank goodness a safe topic something to take her fertile mind off her overwhelming sensual awareness of the man opposite her is he she cut off a small forkful of fish relieved when it melted in her mouth and slid easily down her throat mmm i know your mum would like him to take things a bit easier but i got the impression that he was adamant that it wasnt going to happen any time soon a second mouthful she was getting the hang of this hes mentioned it twice now with no prompting so i think hes seriously considering it viv would be pleased even if he only scaled back his hours yes she would luke rested his knife and fork on the edge of his plate and reached for his wineglass there was a small silence during which terri managed another couple of mouthfuls dad asked if id be interested in staying on in the directors position the potato seemed to congeal into an unswallowable lump in her throat luke staying here not going home to england she couldnt make up her mind if it was excitement or dread fizzing along her nerve endings she grabbed her glass and took a mouthful using it to push the potato down her throat did he she put her glass back on the table what do you think youll do he shrugged slightly im not sure theres no hurry to decide right now but its something to think about his gaze captured hers its been good to come home her chest tightened she looked down at her plate went through the motions of taking another forkful of food how do you think allie would feel about it id have to talk to her of course he swirled the liquid left in his glass but again its not something i need to do immediately shes made great progress since you got us talking i dont want to throw anything disruptive into the mix yet yes although i think shes quite resilient now that burden of guilt has gone shes really blossoming she is isnt she maybe ill sound her out to see if her ideas about port cavill are more open now his smile was filled with affection what about you me her eyes flew to his you have to make the best decision for you and allie thats true his eyes narrowed and she had the feeling his attention was suddenly scalpel sharp but what i was really asking was what is your vision for your future oh she pushed half a wedge of potato aside then carefully laid her knife and fork together in the space shed created her fingers returned to adjust the position of the utensils before she moved the plate when i came here ii didnt have a vision beyond putting myself back together after after peters death yes she touched the base of her glass twisting it slightly with her fingertips after peters death what about now now now that things have changed with his elbows on the table he steepled his fingers and looked at her intently now that youre in a relationship how do allie and i factor in your life oh imim not sure i want to look too far ahead if she did shed have to face the fact that she hadnt been scrupulously open with him shed have to face the things shed baulked at telling him his expression fell for the tiniest instant before he covered his reaction shed disappointed him hurt him shame cramped deep in her chest she looked through the window at the lights reflected on the glasssmooth water of the sheltered port in a way luke had offered her a safe place in the haven of his family and all she could do was selfishly protect herself he deserved better she wanted to give him something lukeyou and allie are the most beautiful things that have happened in my life for the longest time her voice choked with emotion youre both very dear to me more than i can say thank you he said softly his fingers curling around hers his smile was so sweet that the tears gathering at the back of her eyes pressed for release im glad youre very dear to me to us there was a small silence part of her wanted to hide from the power of her feelings the other part revelled that she could feel so intensely excuse me sir would you like to order dessert now no thank you luke said still not taking his eyes off her i think what wed like to do now is have a dance yes she whispered that would be lovely as the waiter cleared their plates away luke took her hand and threaded his way through the tables to the dance floor dreamy notes from the string quartet had lured many other dancers to the floor already he stopped at the edge of the floor and took terris other hand guiding her into his arms she came to him smoothly fitted perfectly as hed known she would her lithe body swayed to the rhythm in easy seductive movements he held her right hand cradling it close to his chest with his right hand splayed across her back he felt the deep inhalation expanding her rib cage then her exhalation whispered on the skin above his collar a groan lodged in his throat it was heaven and hell to hold her like this he smiled slightly he was going to enjoy every torturous delicious moment of it he tucked her closer this is nice yes it is he could feel her fingers stroke along his collar god did she know what she was doing to him he held his needs on a tight leash they were making progress sure it was slow but they were working towards something special something lasting a grab for quick gratification would ruin that he felt another inhalation a tiny shiver through her slender frame luke mmm her footsteps slowed to a halt and she leaned back in his arms wide and dark eyes looked into his ii want to stop being sensible a hot streak of electricity jolted through him and his hand tightened on hers he couldnt have spoken to save himself take me home luke please hold that thought he steered her back to their table where the waiter met them with the dessert menu im sorry but were going to have to go would you mind organising the bill for me please ill pay at the front register of course sir luke helped terri with her lightweight shawl his hands lingering on her shoulders before he tucked her hand into the crook of his arm he was almost afraid to stop touching her in case the loss of contact gave her time to reconsider foolish if she changed her mind he would find a way for that to be okay he brought her hand up to his mouth kissed the delicate knuckles then let her go so he could sign the bill in the car he drove feeling the weight of her silence was she even now thinking shed made a mistake hed hurried her out of the restaurant with indecent haste he glanced across at her when he stopped to giveway to traffic at a roundabout she was watching him a small smile playing around her lips she looked unexpectedly serene while he felt like a bundle of nervous energy at the beach cottage she unlocked the door he followed her inside waited while she gracefully slid her shawl from her shoulders and draped it over a hook on the hallstand she turned to face him then stepped close her hands reaching for his tie he laid his hands over hers stilling the fingers loosening the knot are you sure his voice was husky how strange hed been so worried shed change her mind but now it was him giving her the opportunity to reconsider she sighed her hands flattening on his ribs yes and no no he made an effort to disguise the need that was thick in his voice was it possible to die of selfcontrol i dont want you to do anything you dont want to darling i want to make love with you luke but im afraid ill disappoint you i couldnt bear it you wont you couldnt he gathered her into his arms feeling his own nerves subside as he searched for the words to reassure her this is us terri not a competition not a race well take it slow we might have some hiccups but it doesnt matter well get there in the end darling together together iid like that her lips pressed softly to his jaw sending a thrill dancing through his body thank you he turned his head captured her mouth felt the last tiny moment of hesitation evaporate as her lips opened for him and she kissed him back she reached up to wind her arms around his neck her body pressed to his her breasts flattened on his chest her belly aligned with his they stood hip to hip and his heart nearly burst with huge solid beats she pulled away and reached for his hand come with me he followed willingly and found himself standing in her bedroom moonlight shone through net curtains spilling across the double bed i heard its your birthday yes he murmured ii wondered if you like the wrapping on your present she took his hand and laid it on the line of toggles along her collarbone i love it he swallowed am i allowed to unwrap it now yes please his eyes on hers he released the first fastener moved to the second terri ran her hands up the smooth thin fabric of his shirt feeling the heat of his body on her palms she released the buttons impatient now to feel his skin on hers this man made her feel so special so cherished at this moment she wanted him more than shed have ever believed possible she wanted it all something to remember something to hold dear in the future he treated her with such care and affection that she wanted to weep they seemed to fit as though made for each other no fumbling no clumsiness she revelled in his touch her skin coming alive beneath his clever hands it was special satisfying overwhelming enriching she felt exotic and wicked and daring and courageous he gave her all of that and more much later luke propped himself up on one elbow and looked down at her my heads spinning he said as he leaned forward to kiss her lips she looped her arms around his back and smiled not caring if her heart was in her eyes mine too he spread her hair over the pillow slowly as though he was enjoying running his fingers through the strands ive been having fantasies about doing this really oh yeah he smiled broadly remember that day at the nursery allie had to yell to get my attention she laughed softly she did have to call you a couple of times you looked so guilty when you finally answered his smile slowly faded you know its too soon for me to spend all night here with you i know id like to youve got a daughter who needs to be your first priority and thats the way it should be as long as you know i want to stay maybe soon hush lets not try to make any time lines luke she put her fingers to his lips to stop the words it was too soon and she wanted to revel in this moment bask in what theyd created here together in the cocoon of her room her bed she didnt want to think about the outside world the things she still needed to tell him lets enjoy what we have right now he growled deep in his throat and gathered her close i dont have to leave quite yet mmm good she ran her hands up his back loving the feel of his hard muscles tensing as he moved over her later she rolled on her side as he slipped out of bed with her hand splayed over the sheet still warm from his body she watched him dress im not going because i want to he repeated as he shrugged into his shirt promise me youre not going to read anything into me leaving you like this darling i promise she said obediently he fastened his trousers why do i get the feeling youre just saying that she laughed at him now whos reading too much into things as long as im the only one he said with a sigh ill give you a ring tomorrow well do something a barbecue okay okay he stood juggling his keys in one hand obviously still reluctant to go wellgoodnight goodnight luke at the door he turned promise me i do now go home darling she laughed you called me darling he came back to the bed and leaned over to press another lingering kiss to her mouth god i wish i didnt have to go but you do now shoo he sighed okay ill lock the door after me after hed gone she flopped back on the pillow and stretched luxuriously luke was amazing he made her feel like the most beautiful woman alive she laughed out loud at the happiness that fizzed along her veins love she was in love how could she not love the man who made her feel so whole and normal a tiny doubt tried to creep in but she refused to let it refused to listen to the malevolent voice that wanted to remind her about the things she hadnt told him about herself shed faced so much in the last few yearssurely she wasnt so bad for wanting to clasp this moment for herself to hold tight to the present not worry about the past and the future just for now chapter thirteen no rest for the wicked you two terri looked around to see dianne grinning at them from the doorway of the staff lounge whats up luke said three victims of a minor mva on the way in details are sketchy but nothing serious by the sound of it theyve been scooped up by a good samaritan eta about five minutes thanks dianne luke picked up his mug and took a quick swallow as he rose to his feet im on my way no worries the nurse gave them a quick indulgent smile and disappeared terris heart squeezed as luke winked at her he leaned down his breath whispering over her ear as he murmured i wonder how she knows weve been wicked darling she inhaled sharply then sputtered when her mouthful of coffee went down the wrong way as she coughed luke helpfully patted her a couple of times between the shoulder blades it might have something to do with being seen all over port cavill for the last two weeks holding hands she gasped between small coughs good point still nice to have something true circulating on a hospital grapevine for a change he looked so pleased with himself that she couldnt help laughing her own insouciance surprised her the magic of her relationship with luke had infected her with a carefree spirit that she hadnt felt for years her gaze followed him to the sink enjoying a quick feast on the lean length of him she loved the way he moved confident and full of masculine grace he turned catching her eye and his smile filled with mischievous intimacy relax and finish your coffee thanks her cheeks flooded with warmth as she grinned i wont be long a tiny shadow marred her happiness as she watched him leave the room she still hadnt told him everything surely it wasnt so bad if she left it a little longer everyday was bringing her a greater sense of belonging an easiness which meant the words the courage would come soon she sighed as she got up and crossed to the sink the little pact she was making with herself had disaster written all over it this weekend she would talk to luke this weekend that gave her just over three days to find the right way to broach the subject as she walked down the corridor she saw luke and dianne heading towards the front door the mva victims must have arrived she picked up her pace she turned into the main emergency foyer and the scene in front of her exploded into her senses a woman pregnant her groin and legs covered in red screams tore at terris ears my baby i dont want to lose my baby please help me ive hurt my baby the air around terris legs turned to heavy syrup dragging at her steps until she stopped she felt disembodied time jerked past frame by frame pete wheres pete the woman sobbed our baby images flashed onto terris retinas blotting out the scene before her baby in peril mother injured blood everywhere nausea swept up from her toes she couldnt do this not again she couldnt help them she couldnt move each pore on her skin iced over she was failing again failing luke flicked a glance at terri something was terribly terribly wrong she was rigid face as white as a sheet eyes fixed on the screaming woman terri oh god his voice wasnt reaching her he wanted to go to her hold her shield her from whatever nightmare was holding her in its thrall he sensed terris crisis was the bigger emergency but the patient in front of him was rapidly descending into hysteria ive hurt my baby please save my baby the woman clutched at his arm dragging his attention back to her weve got you now he said calmly whats your name nnadia nadia were looking after you and your baby are you in any pain nno she hiccuped and looked at him in surprise not now as he and dianne settled nadia on a gurney luke glanced across the foyer terri was gone it was paint for gods sake nadia and her husband pete had been travelling with an open can of paintthe pregnant woman had been holding it between her knees so she could stir it a contraction had caught them by surprise and peter had driven into their front fence with the impact red paint had gone everywhere a neighbour had piled the hapless pair into his car and brought them into hospital the contractions hadnt continued so no pattern has been established luke suspected it had been a set of braxtonhicks contractions perhaps exacerbated by nadias fear theyd keep her in hospital for a few hours and monitor her to make sure everything was as it should be the babys heartbeat was strong and regular hed packed nadia and her husband off to the showers to wash away the last of the paint and now he had to attend to the real emergency terri anyone seen terri i havent seen her sincethe call about nadia and pete dianne answered and the others looked around blankly if you do page me stat please he ground his teeth same goes for any emergencies im going to find her aware of the circle of concerned faces he walked out of the department leaving no words to soothe their fears he had none urgency drove his steps he had to find terri shed been shattered something about that case had pushed her into some private hell hed seen a glimpse of her terror before shed disappeared more than terror shed looked in danger of disintegrating he worked methodically checking every room would she have gone all the way home for some reason he didnt think shed have been able to get that far shed been like a wounded animal looking for somewhere to tend her injuries a private place he finally found her outside behind the new gazebo she was on her knees with her arms wrapped around her body he could see her knuckles were white as though by gripping tightly she might hold herself together but even that selfhug wasnt enough comfort for her she rocked in a small rhythmic movement that broke his heart weak sun shone on the chocolate of her hair picking out bright threads of red and chestnut in the thick mane he crouched beside her touched her lightly on the shoulder she jerked her reflex beyond a normal fright response he could feel the fine tremors that raced through her chilled flesh terri the rocking started again talk to me darling please no ppoint theres no point it wont help you cant help me noone can ggo away please justgo away he sat on the ground beside her not caring about grass stains and gathered her rigid body close tell me anyway he said as he rubbed her back for the longest silence he just held her rocked with her hoped that his body heat would help to thaw her sso much blood it was red paint but she didnt hear him so much blood she whispered she killed her husband shshe killed her baby no no she didnt terri listen to me her husband is fine shes fine she mightnt even be in labour but the blood she shuddered he took her face between his hands terri look at me her eyes slowly focussed on him it wasnt blood nnot blood she sounded confused as though he was speaking a foreign language paint it was paint ppaint she tested the word as though trying to divine its meaning red paint nadia was in the car with an open can of red paint between her knees she was stirring it i ssaw all the rred i know darling i want you to come back now i ccant i mustnt the bbabyshshell lose the bbaby you cant trust mme what do you mean bbad things happen i killed my husband i killed peter the terrorists killed peter and my bbaby i killed my baby you lost your baby in the explosion oh god how had she coped with that alone having just lost a husband as well his heart ached for her no wonder she was struggling yes my fault it was all my fault why he needed to hear it all as much as she needed to tell him i stayed too long i stayed too long i should have left as soon as i found out but i didnt i killed my baby oh darling no no you didnt he said gently youre a wonderful brave woman whos carried a terrible burden all by herself my baby my poor baby she made a strangled sound deep in her chest and then the tears started in huge shuddering sobs his heart broke for her just listening to her story was painful beyond belief he felt powerless in the face of her grief her arms clung to him desperation in their strength all he could do was hold her be her rock he was going to stand by her to help her heal hold her when she needed to cry encourage her when she was moving forward he would love her and protect her and support her until she was better and then by god she was going to marry him so he could love and cherish her as she deserved for the rest of her life her sobs gradually quieted until the only sound was the distant shushing of the waves reluctantly he broke the moment do you trust me terri yes her voice sounded raw from the weeping still full of tears ready to be shed he was going to ask her to do more to be braver to do something that he sensed she needed to do a first minute step on the journey back to normality i want you to come with me now come and see the young couple who came in earlier nadia and pete nadia and ppete yes i cant she said with the storm of weeping over shed moved into a passive acceptance of hopelessness theres no point its over you can he felt like such a bastard asking anything of her when she was so raw and vulnerable setting his jaw he continued nothing is over theres every point to coming back it was important not to let her withdraw he was afraid for her afraid for himself that he would lose her if he let her retreat now come on wash your face powder your nose whatever it is that you need to do to face the world again today just for a few minutes i cant ddo anything for them i ran away she looked at him through a welling veil of tears i ffailed he steeled himself against weakening you ran away because youre traumatised you havent failed i dont want you to do anything for them i just want you to come and meet them not for long just to see that they are okay come on terri you can do it she looked at him and then finally she took a deep breath and said ill try the bravery in those tiny barely audible words brought a painful lump to his throat thats all im asking darling anxiety pinched at him as he helped her to her feet she felt so shaky and frail the last of her strength and vitality had leached away with her tears leaving this frighteningly fragile husk he clenched his teeth he needed to find out as much as he could about posttraumatic stress disorder stat cuddling her close to his body he walked her back to the building outside the womens bathroom he stopped and opened the door ushering her inside ill wait outside yell if you need me she nodded ill check on you in five if youre not out she gave him a wan smile ill be out okay he shut the door behind him and braced one hand on the wall terri needed his help and she was going to get it whether she wanted it or not he was in awe of the fact that shed come this far carrying the weight of her grief alone but she didnt have to do it on her own from now on she had him to help he wasnt going to let her go she would not shut him out he wouldnt let her he felt a touch on his arm and turned to see dianne looking up at him her face creased with worry is terri all right shes had a shock dianne shell be shaky for a while but shell be all right ill make sure of it he said grimly good if theres anything any of us can do just say the word thanks dianne luke kept the visit to the nowsheepish young couple short and upbeat before ushering terri out of their room in the privacy of the staff lounge he ran the backs of his fingers over her pale cheek go home darling luke i think she took a deep breath in i think id rather keep busy please terriloveyouve had a hell of a shock cut yourself some slack and take the rest of the shift off its only an hour she gave him a haunted look he stifled a sigh tell me honestly do you feel up to being here her mouth opened then slowly closed her shoulders slumping no she whispered no youre right theres no point being here darling go home rest walk along the beach she nodded ill come and see you as soon as i can another nod before she turned and walked away he watched her go had he done the right thing but what else could he do she looked so crushed and utterly defeated that he almost called her back just over an hour later luke took some correspondence back to his office a single piece of paper lay in the middle of his desk cold inevitability gripped him as he leaned across and picked it up a resignation neatly typed terri must have gone straight home to write the damned letter no way was he going to let her run away like this he couldnt she needed help and support from people who loved her specifically she needed his help his support he loved her he practised the persuasive words hed use as he walked down to the beach cottage when he got there the door was ajar but the place had an oddly deserted feel he knocked icy fear thrummed through him when there was no response he yanked open the door then strode from room to room no sign of terri but plenty of signs that shed been here and been busy a suitcase lay open on the bed theyd made love in folded clothes sat in piles waiting to be added to the case as though shed started packing but had been distracted from the task in the kitchen pots and pans had been thrown haphazardly into a box on the bench there was no chance that the lid could be fastened with the way handles bristled above the sides at the other end of the bench was a stack of plates and a collection of glasses without pausing he opened the back door and stepped on to the verandah a halfempty mug of coffee sat on the edge he could imagine her sitting here drinking it staring towards the beach was that where she was now his pulse fluttered as he jogged off the verandah towards the trees he didnt know what to expect refused to think about what he might find she would be there she would be there and she was the tension in his body loosened abruptly leaving his gut aching and his knees rubbery she was sitting on the sand hunched over with her arms wrapped around her shins as she stared out to sea jamming his hands into his pockets he took a deep shuddering breath damp briny sea air filled his lungs and he stood for a moment collecting his wits before he walked closer to his still oblivious target when he was several feet from her he stopped keeping his tone carefully neutral he said youve been busy since i saw you she started as though hed yelled at her you know im not going to accept your resignation he stepped forward and lowered himself to the sand beside her but not touching you should she sounded so cold so remote he had to connect with her so that she would listen to him why should i her head came around at his question and she looked at him a frown slowly pleated her forehead as she thought about her answer because i cant be trusted my judgement is flawed she shrugged and turned to face the water again her voice was too matteroffact for the agony behind the words she spoke im so brittle i feel like i could fly apart terri youre suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder she didnt acknowledge him he tried again you need to get help so you can recover her gaze stayed on the horizon you have so much courage im asking you to use some now he watched her profile for any sign that hed reached her for me and for allie we need you i need you allie she shook her head and her chin trembled for a tiny fraction of a second i dont know if i can be whatever it is that you need whatever it is that she needs you cant trust me to make good decisions i can trust you i do trust you its you who doesnt trust you and you should you have wonderful judgement your thinking is just a bit scrambled at the moment because of your experiences you make it sound easy she shook her head but its not im empty you and allie deserve more than i can give you not true darling we deserve you youre the person who saw what my daughter and i needed youre the person who brought us together after months of grief he felt as though he was fighting a battle with no weapons nothing to hold onto nothing to let him see if he was making headway he was losing her i know its not easy i hear your pain i felt your heartbreak when you cried in my arms stop luke i know i cant understand what youre going through but i know this im here for you he swallowed feeling the crushing pain in his chest i love you terri her hands came up to cover her face and her shoulders began to shake hed reached her but in doing so hed given her more pain he pulled her into his arms and laid his cheek on her hair as he absorbed the tremors that shook her its okay darling its okay he murmured the words over and over knowing how very far from the truth they were at last her sobs quietened i feel broken her voice was still thick with tears youre in pain darling but the bits of you are all there well find help and you can put them all back together again i feel so bad she took a deep shaky breath what if i cant be fixed what if this is me what ifi cant be a doctor any more then you can be anything you like he stroked her hair be my wife he felt shock ripple through her he hadnt meant to say the words not yet but it was what he wanted after a moment she tipped her head back and looked at him marry me he said oh luke her face screwed up in pain i wwant to accept your proposal sso badly but i ccant it wouldnt be fair pain squeezed his chest to whom he asked softly to you to allie she looked into the distance maybe even to me can you tell me why not he smothered the fear that clawed at him and held onto one tiny skerrick of hope she hadnt refused him outright because i dont think i know who i am any more i need help to find out her eyes came back to his holding a plea for understanding what if ive changed im not sure i can handle the weight of your disappointment his spirits swooped but he made himself give her a nod of reassurance then lets find you some help and see where it takes you i want to marry you terri the offer is there no expiry or useby date and no pressure thank you her face was sombre he tightened his arms around her in a quick hug in the meantime i have more news he said dragging up the first change of subject

you to come youre staying and youve talked to allie about it yes and yes um ive been meaning to tell you he teased gently but when im with you i get sidetracked with other things luke thats wonderful i thought so he grinned at her so how about it will you come with us youll know about workable room layouts and allie tells me you have better decorating ideas than i doyou know colours and that sort of thing he dragged out his best hopeless male look ii think i could manage that a relieved smile lifted the exhausted lines on her face his heart swelled with love more than anything he wished he could take away her sorrow and selfdoubt all he could do was wait be there for support and encouragement and hope that when it was all over he had a place in her life her future her heart chapter fourteen two months later not there dad luke looked up from the bucketful of damp sand hed just deposited at the intersecting corners of castle wall whats wrong with here i like it here allie giggleda lovely warm happy sound its all wrong it needs to be back further well ask terri she looked around to see if her consultant was back yet shell know how it should be luke suppressed a smile allie was right terri would know shed been involved in every step of the househunting and under her inspired guidance the house had been decorated to suit a family a perfect home for his family himself his daughter all it needed was a wife and the perfect candidate for the post was coming through the tree line at the top of the beach carrying a picnic basket okay time for a break workers terri called come on ive got sandwiches watermelon fruit juice and biscuits and fresh coffee now youre talking he loped over to shake out the mat theyd brought down earlier as soon as hed laid it terri and allie lowered themselves into neat crosslegged positions he sat beside terri his arm resting on his raised knee dads put the corner thing in the wrong place terri allie accepted a thick salad sandwich has he she looked at him under her lashes tsk its hard to get reliable serfs these days so perhaps you can have two walls youll just have to get your dad to cart more sand cool thats what we can do dad mmm why didnt i think of that he sent a smouldering look terris way as she passed the plate of food to him she grinned and helped herself to a sandwich well if youd put the turret where you should have in the first place he tugged the hair in the centre of his forehead ill try to do better mistress glad to hear it she exchanged a laughing look with him and his heart turned over she was beautiful he was very proud of her he wondered if he realised how far shed come in the past two months a spiral of excitement corkscrewed through him day by day she was relaxing a little more gaining resilience losing the haunted frail look at the hospital she was doing marvellous things theyd discussed her hours and hed pressed for her to come off the shift roster but shed been more than pulling her weight with running health clinics reaching out to disadvantaged members of the community organising preventative health initiatives in his lifehe hadnt been pushing for intimacy in their relationship knowing that he had to leave the pace up to terri last night theyd made love a thrilling heat ran through him at the memory of pleasure beyond anything hed known if he spent the rest of his life worshipping her with his body he would be a very happy man after lunch he cradled his coffee mug and watched allie at the sandcastle she had been joined by another couple of children and the three of them were working diligently shes doing well terri said very he swallowed the last of his drink and put the mug aside those breath exercises you taught her have been terrific shes chasing me to make sure she does them good for her shes been one of my best pupils terri laughed selfdeprecatingly but then i might be a little biased the words gave him a warm glow terri cared wanted the best for allie and for him god he loved her so much he marry me he heard the words leaving his mouth saw the twist of anguish flash across terris face in that one spontaneous moment hed ruined everything why couldnt he have waited too late he wished he could call the words back he felt sick she was going to say no luke she stopped closing her eyes gathering herself he should help her say it was all right say it didnt matterthat theyd still be friends but he couldnt do itnot even to spare the woman he loved from the agony of having to refuse him his face felt numb as he waited for the sentence that would rip his heart out youve been wonderful and i wouldnt have got this far so quickly without your support her throat worked and he could see she was struggling to say the words theres something that i have to tell you something ive been hidingeven from myself she looked at him and the sadness shadowing her eyes clawed at his gut when i lost my babythe placenta was ripped from the wall of the uterusluke i dont know if ill be able to have children a family with him she wanted to have a family with him she looked at him solemnly i cant marry you unless you know that i dont want it to come between us down the track i dont care he caught her by the upper arms and pulled her into his embrace i dont care its you i want only you if we had children together that would be wonderful too but its you i want with his face buried in the crook of her neck and his eyes squeezed shut he took a deep breath ill sorry if it turns out that you cant have children but for you darling not for

scooping her up to twirl her around what are you guys doing allie he laughed then sobered hed started preparing his daughter for this possibility but had he done enough allie sweetheart were going to
