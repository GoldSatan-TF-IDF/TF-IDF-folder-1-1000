michael crichton binary binary any system composed of two interacting elements as in binary stars binary numbers binary gases etc chemical agents lend themselves to covert use in sabotage against which it is exceedingly difficult to visualize any really effective defence i will not dwell upon this use of cbs because as one pursues the possibilities of such covert uses one discovers that the scenarios resemble that in which the components of a nuclear weapon are smuggled into new york city and assembled in the basement of the empire state building in other words once the possibility is recognized to exist about all that one can do is worry about it dr ivan l bennett r testifying before the subcommittee on national security policy and scientific developments november this book was written before it became too embarrassing for the republican party to hold its convention in san diego and i preferred not to follow the convention to miami beach john lange prologue beta scenario the facts are these on august nd seven men flew into salt lake international airport salt lake city utah the men came from las vegas chicago dallas and new york all seven men have been identified they all have connexions with organized crime thus far four have been picked up for questioning and their testimony provides the major portion of this report each man was first contacted in his home city by an anonymous telephone call they were each paid a thousand dollars in cash to do an unspecified job all they knew in advance was that the job would take fortyeight hours and that they must bring heavy boots and dark warm clothing each was given an assumed name which he was to use for the duration of the job the men arrived in salt lake between noon and four pm local time they were met separately when all had arrived they were transported in a white plymouth sedan outside the city the trip out from salt lake was made in total silence after an hour of travel they arrived in ramrock utah a town of persons located in the northcentral region of the state the men remained in ramrock until nightfall staying in a onestorey wood frame house previously rented by an unknown party while in the house the seven men wore surgical rubber gloves so that no fingerprints could be recovered the men changed into their dark heavy clothing in the house and received instructions on their job from the leader a man identified only as jones jones is described as a heavyset muscular man with a broken nose and greying hair positive identification has not yet been made of this person jones told the assembled men that they were going to steal a quantity of insecticide from a train he told them that he had not personally planned the theft that it had been worked out by someone else they believed this when they heard the plans although not formally educated these men had a welldeveloped sense of personality and they all agree that jones who was described by one as a drillsergeant type lacked the acumen to formulate the plans the plans were remarkable for their detail for example the men were told that the train would be travelling at mph according to department of transportation regulations covering shipment of dangerous cargo the men were told the timetable the train would follow from its point of origin in dugway proving grounds utah through the state the men were told of the existence of impedance trip sensors in the rails and were instructed in relay timing mechanisms involved they were told that the insecticide would be stored in pound canisters of two varieties one kind painted yellow the other black they were told that they must steal one yellow canister and one black canister two yellows or two blacks would not do equally important is what the men were not told they were not told that the train would be guarded this is an important point i means either that plans were drawn up for the robbery one month before when there were no guards on the trains or else that the presence of the guards was known by the planners who elected not to inform the men this point is still in debate the men were also not told why they were stealing the insecticide in the first place significantly none of them asked apparently it was a matter of total indifference to them they remained in the wood frame house in ramrock until rns then each man was issued a machine gun and a pistol the machine guns were of the usual variety that is war surplus equipment sold with plugged barrels some other party had simply machined new barrels and replaced the original plugged barrels cf memorandum abuses of war surplus weaponry the men then climbed aboard a land rover which was stored in the garage of the house it had apparently been there waiting for some weeks because it was dusty they drove off into the desert to meet the train they arrived at an unnamed site in northeast utah shortly after am they carried out their preparations quickly and efficiently in the light of a full moon one man was sent down the tracks until he found the impedance trip sensor he blocked the mechanism of this sensor by attaching an electronic override device thus no one knew for six hours that the train had been stopped farther up the tracks it was assumed that the trip sensor had broken down meanwhile four other men walked across the sand towards a halfdozen cattle grazing nearby the robbery site was minimal rangeland and had been chosen specifically because of this the men shot the steer nearest the tracks the other cattle ran off at the sound of the shot the men looped ropes around the dead steer and dragged it across the railroad tracks the animal was doused with gasoline and a timing device was attached to it then all seven men climbed aboard the land rover and rode it to a nearby hiding place behind some low dunes they waited approximately fifteen minutes before the train appeared in the distance the men were surprised to see that it was a government train consisting of three flatcars lettered us government property on the sides they were also surprised to see an armoured caboose at the end of the train the engine slowed apparently as the engineer sighted the obstacle across the tracks when the train stopped the timing device caused the dead steer to burst into flames at that moment six of the men ran forward intending to remove the canisters there was some scattered firing from the armoured caboose one man ran up to it stuck his machine gun into an armoured port and delivered aburst of fire to the interior all five soldiers and one physician inside the caboose were killed the engineer was also killed a few moments later the men unloaded two canisters from the train one black and one yellow each was marked with lettering so vivid that the men remembered it well stencilled warnings to the effect that the canisters contained highly dangerous chemicals they carried the canisters across the desert to a flat location nearby they set them down yards apart and burned a red flare near each two or three minutes passed and then two helicopters appeared over the horizon the helicopters landed in tandem alongside the flares they were commercial helicopters of a nondescript nature the only unusual aspect was that each had been fitted with a nylon web sling to hold a canister the men loaded the canisters onto the slings the helicopters lifted off again into the night the men returned to the land rover and drove back to salt lake city arriving at not on the morning of august rd over the next eighteen hours they flew out of the city to their points of origin none had any knowledge of what happened to the canisters none had any knowledge of the true contents of the canisters it is clear from the foregoing that these seven underworld figures were engaged in an activity closely approximating the band corporation analog scenariosequence called cb w beta these scenarios were prepared in the fall of for the department of defence command and control they considered the options and ramifications of theft of thermonuclear bomb components and chemlbiol agents beta scenario treated the possibility that a relatively small number of men either criminal figures or political extremists might steal these materials for blackmail sabotage or terrorist purposes the consequences of theft were considered uniformly disastrous therefore the scenario outlined ways to prevent this occurrence the chief preventive mechanism was deemed secrecy in transport schedules and methods that is the thieves would not know where or when the material was being shipped as a result of the beta scenario conclusions timetables for shipment were established by a closedcode computer mechanism operating from a table of random numbers that mechanism was regarded as foolproof and unbreakable however it is obvious that these seven men received instructions derived from breaking the timetable it is not known how the timetable was broken enabling the men to easily almost effortlessly steal one halfton of the most potent nerve gas in the world hour los angeles am pdt the grey government sedan was waiting in a deserted corner of los angeles international airport seen from the air it cast a long shadow across the concrete runway in the pale morning light he watched the sedan as his helicopter descended and landed a short distance from the car the driver came running up bent over beneath the spinning blades and opened the door a gust of warm dry august air swirled into the interior of the helicopter mr graves thats right come with me please graves got out carrying his briefcase and walked to the car he climbed into the back seat and they drove off away from the runway towards the freeway do you know where were going graves asked the driver consulted a clipboard oneohonethreeone washington culver city i have i think thats right graves settled back in the seat california numbering hed never get used to it it was as bad as a zip code he opened his early edition of the new york times and tried to read it he had tried on the helicopter but had found it impossible to concentrate he assumed that was because of the noise and the distractions when they passed over san clemente halfway between los angeles and san diego he had been craning his neck peering out the window like an ordinary tourist the president was there now had been for the last week he looked at the headlines trouble in the un arguments in the german parliament about the mark britain and france squabbling he put the paper aside and stared out the window at los angeles flat and bleak in the early morning light good trip sir the driver asked it was perfectly said no inflection no prying just detached polite interest the driver didnt know who graves was he didnt know where he had come from he didnt know what his business was all the driver knew was that graves was important enough to have a government helicopter fly him in and a government sedan pick him up fine thanks graves smiled staring out the window in fact the trip had been horrible phelps had called him just an hour before and asked him to come up and give a briefing on wright that was the way phelps worked everything was a crisis there were no routine activities it was typical that phelps hadnt bothered to let graves know beforehand that he was even in los angeles although on reflection graves knew he should have expected that with the republican convention in san diego all the activity of the country had shifted from washington to the west coast the president was in the western white house in san clemente the convention was eighty miles to the south and phelps what would phelps do obviously relocate discreetly in the nearest large city which was los angeles as graves considered it los angeles became the inevitable choice phelps needed the telephone lines for data transmission it was as simple as that la was the third largest city in america and it would have plenty of telephone lines that the department of state intelligence division could take over on short notice it was inevitable here we are sir the driver said pulling over to the kerb he got out and opened the door for graves am i to wait for you sir yes i think so very good sir graves paused and looked up at the building it was a rather ordinary fourstorey office building in an area of los angeles that seemed almost a slum the building not particularly new was outstandingly ugly and the paint was flaking away from the facade graves walked up the steps and entered the lobby as he went through the doors he looked at his watch it was exactly ins phelps was waiting for him in the deserted lobby phelps wore a lightweight glenplaid suit and a worried expression he shook hands with graves and said how was your flight his voice echoed slightly in the lobby fine graves said they walked to the elevators passing the groundfloor offices which seemed mostly devoted to a bank like this place phelps said not much it was the best we could find on short notice he said a guard with a signin book stood in front of the elevators graves let phelps sign first then he took the pen and wrote his name his authorization and the time he saw that decker and venn were already there they got into the elevator and pressed the button for the third floor decker and venn are already here phelps said i saw phelps nodded and smiled as much as he ever smiled i keep forgetting about you and your powers of observation i keep forgetting about you too graves said phelps ignored the remark ive planned two meetings for today he said youve got the briefing in an hour wilson peckham and a couple of others but i think you should hear about sigma station first all right graves said he didnt know what the hell phelps was talking about but he wasnt going to give him the satisfaction of asking they got off at the third floor and walked past some peeling posters of milan and tahiti and through a small typing pool the desks now deserted the typewriters neatly covered what is this place graves said travel agency phelps said they went out of business but they had a lot of telephone lines yes we took over the floor how long you planning to stay graves asked there was an edge to his voice that he didnt bother to conceal phelps knew how he felt about the department just through the convention phelps said with elaborate innocence what did you think i thought it might be permanent good lord no why would we do a thing like that i cant imagine graves said past the typing pool they came to a section of private offices the walls were painted an institutional beige it reminded graves of a prison or a hospital no wonder the travel agency went out of business he thought i know how you feel phelps said do you graves asked yes youre ambivalent about the section im ambivalent about the domestic activities we all are phelps said he said it easily in the smooth oilonthewaters manner that he had perfected and his father before him phelps father had been an undersecretary of state during the roosevelt administration phelps himself was a product of the dalton school andover yale and harvard law school if he sat still ivy would sprout from his ears but he never sat still how do you find san diego he asked walking along with his maddeningly springy step boring and hot phelps sighed dont blame me i didnt choose it graves did not reply they continued down a corridor and came upon a guard who nodded to phelps good morning mr phelps and to graves good morning sir phelps flashed his pink card so did graves the guard allowed them to pass farther down the corridor past a large banner that read first cws service on coach youve got a guard already graves said theres a lot of expensive equipment to look after phelps said they made a right turn and entered a conference room there were just four of them graves phelps looking springy and alert as he greeted everyone decker who was thin and dark intenselooking and venn who was nearly fifty greying sloppy in his dress graves had never met decker or venn before but he knew they were both scientists they were too academic and too uncomfortable to be anything else phelps ran the meeting this is john graves who is the worlds foremost expert on john wright he smiled slightly mr graves has plenty of background so you can speak as technically as you want decker why dont you begin decker cleared his throat and opened a briefcase in front of him removing a sheaf of computer printout he slipped through the green pages as he spoke ive been working in special projects division for the last six months he said i was assigned to establish redundancy programmes on certain limitedaccess files so that we could check callup locations to these data banks which are mostly located in arlington hall in washington he paused and glanced at graves to see if the information was making sense graves nodded the problem is basically one of accessline proliferation a data bank is just a collection of information stored on magnetic tape drums it can be anywhere in the country to get information out of it you need to hook into the main computer with an access substation that can also be anywhere in the country every major data bank has a large number of access substations for limited or specialpurpose access stations that need to draw out information once or twice a week lets say we employ commercial telephone lines we dont have our own lines to tie in to a peripheral computer substation you telephone a call number and hook your phone up to the computer terminal thats it as long as you have a halfduplex or fullduplex telephone line youre in business graves nodded how is the call number coded well come to that decker said looking at venn for now well concentrate on the system some of the major data banks like the ones held by defence may have five hundred or a thousand access lines a year ago wilkens congressional committee started to worry about unauthorized tapping into those access lines in theory a bright boy who knew computers could tap into the system and call out any information he wanted from the data banks he could get all sorts of classified information decker sighed so i was hired to install redundancy checks on the system echo checks bit additions that sort of thing my job was to make sure we could verify which stations drew out information from the data banks and what information they drew i finished that work a month ago graves glanced at phelps phelps was watching them all intently pretending he was following the discussion graves knew that it was over phelps head just before i finished decker said we discovered that an unauthorized station was tapping into the system we called it sigma station but we were unable to characterize it by that i mean that we knew sigma was drawing information but we didnt know where or how he flipped to a green sheet of computer printout and pushed it across the table to graves sigma is the underlined station you can see that on this particular day july st it tapped into the system at ten oh four rnt eastern time and maintained the contact for seven minutes then it broke out we determined that sigma was tapping in at around ten oclock two or three nights a week but that was all we knew decker turned to venn who said i came into the picture at this point id been at bell labs working on telephone tracer mechanisms the telephone company has a problem with unauthorized calls calls verbally charged to a phone number calls charged to a wrong credit card number that kind of thing i was working on a computer tracing system defence asked me to look at the sigma station problem one ought to say phelps said that the data bank being tapped by sigma was a defence bank yes venn said it was a defence bank with two or three taps a week at about ten pm that was all i knew when i began however i made some simple assumptions first youve got to have a computer terminal in order to tap the system that is once youve called the number that links you to the computer you must use a teletypewriting or crt apparatus compatible with the defence system are those terminals common no venn said they are quite advanced and fairly uncommon i started with a list of them graves nodded then i considered the timing ten pm eastern time is seven rht in california where most of these sophisticated terminals in defence industry applications are located if an employee were illegally using a terminal to tap into defence he couldnt do it during office hours on the other hand it requires an extraordinary access to get into an east coast terminal location at ten at night or into a midwest location at eight or nine therefore sigma was probably on the west coast so you checked the west coast terminals yes because in order to hook into the defence system youd have to unhook from your existing system what corporation r ampd group or production unit had a terminal that was unhooked at seven pm western time twice a week answer none new question what group had its terminals repaired twice a week repairing would entail unhooking answer the southern california association of insurance underwriters a company based in san diego graves said so you investigated the repairman and you found we found our man venn said looking slightly annoyed with graves his name is timothy drew he has been doing repair work on the sc association computers for about six weeks it turns out nobody authorized those repairs he just showed up and but you havent picked him up phelps coughed no actually we havent picked him up yet because hes disappeared graves said thats right phelps said how did you know tim drew is a friend of john wright hes had dinner with him several times a week for the last month or so as he spoke graves had a mental image of drew early thirties blondlooking muscular graves had run a check on him some weeks back and had discovered only that drew was an exarmy lieutenant discharged one year before a clean record in computer work nothing good nothing bad we werent able to find him venn said but were still looking we thought graves said theres only one thing i want to know what information did drew tap from the classified files there was a long silence around the cable finally decker said we dont know you dont know graves lit a cigarette but thats the most important question let me explain decker said drew was an exarmy officer with knowledge of computer systems he knew that he couldnt call in on any old number the callin numbers are changed at irregular intervals roughly once a week but the possible permutations of the callin number arent great with trial and error he might have found it you know he found the number graves said because you know he tapped in the question is what did he tap out from the system well once he was hooked up he still had a problem you need subroutine codes to extract various kinds of information and how often are the codes changed not very often graves found himself getting impatient how often are the codes changed about once a year graves sighed so drew might have used his old codes to get what he wanted yes then we want to know what codes he knew what sort of work did drew do when he was in the army he did topological work surface configurations shipment routings that sort of thing graves glanced at phelps can we be more specific im afraid not phelps said defence is unwilling to release drews work record to us defence is a little defensive you might say about the fact that this tap occurred in the first place there was a long silence graves stared at the men around the table there were times he thought when working for the government was an exercise in total stupidity finally he said how can you get defence to release the information im not sure we can phelps said but one of the reasons youre being briefed is that we were hoping you might be able to shed light on the situation i might yes drew was working for wright after all before graves could answer the telephone rang phelps answered it and said yes thank you and hung up he looked at graves do you have any thoughts about this none graves said none at all none at all well phelps said perhaps something will occur to you in the next hour he gave graves a heavily disapproving look then stood up and turned to decker and venn thank you gentlemen he said and to graves lets go hour los angeles am pdt another conference room another group this room was decorated entirely in tahiti posters it occurred to graves that whoever had owned the travel agency before it went bankrupt was a tahitinut perhaps he was himself tahitian graves began to wonder why the tahitian owner had gone out of business too much time away from the office basking in the sun discrimination against him by angelenos some rare disease carried by coconuts which had made him an invalid gentlemen phelps said and cleared his throat graves was snapped back to the present he looked around the room there were he saw a number of highranking washington people they all looked tired and disgruntled phelps had brought them out to california on a redeye flight let them sleep a few hours then dragged them up for a meeting with john graves john graves phelps said has come up from san diego this morning to brief you on john wright mr graves has been in charge of wrights surveillance in new york and san diego for the past three months phelps nodded to graves and graves stood we have some footage which is quite revealing graves said i thought wed begin with that if we can screen it the men in the room looked confused even phelps who never lost his aplomb seemed uncertain graves settled it by tearing down several tahitian posters from the wall clearing a blank white space he was embarrassed for a moment the tearing noise sounded somehow indiscreet with all these washington guns and the whole business emphasized the makeshift nature of the surroundings phelps seemed to sense it too you must excuse us he said but these are temporary quarters for the duration of the republican convention graves stepped to one side as the room lights dimmed a blackandwhite image was projected on the wall it showed a dapper rather handsome man standing at a podium for a moment there was no sound and then it came on abruptly the voice was sharp vigorous and slightly petulant can a person do in the twentieth century the question is not rhetorical my friends each and every one of us is powerless in the face of giant corporations giant institutions giant government do you think automobiles are badly made do you think your electricity bill is too high do you disagree with the nations foreign policy well theres nothing much you can do about it no matter what you think or i think the wheels continue to spin of their own inertia the film image of john wright paused to take a drink of water perhaps you think that a few people have power high government officials high corporate executives wealthy individuals but that also is untrue everyone is locked into a system which he has inherited and is powerless to change we are all trapped my friends that is the meaning of the twentieth century it is the century of impotence wrights voice dropped lower became more ominous isis face was grim impotence he repeated inability to act inability to be effective this is what we must change and with the help of god we shall there was some applause on the sound track before the film ran out of the camera and the room lights came back on graves lit a cigarette and flipped through the pages of his own file on wright before speaking i showed you that film for psychological not politcal reasons he said because it summarizes most of what we know about john wrights mental state the speech was given last year before the annual conference of the americans for a better nation an extremist group which wright started and still leads youve probably never heard of it its small and has no significance whatsoever in national politics over the last few years wright has poured million dollars into the organization the money apparently doesnt matter to him but the lack of impact the impotence matters a great deal he paused and glanced around the faces at the table they seemed to be paying attention but just barely two were doodling on the pads before them john wright he said is now fortynine years old he is the son of edmund wright of the wright steel family he is an only child his father was a crude domineering man and an alcoholic john grew up in his shadow a very strange child he was a good student and learned quite a lot of mathematics even made a minor reputation for himself in that field on the other hand he was an inveterate gambler horse racer and womanizer the assembled men began to fidget graves nodded to the projectionist who began flashing up slides the first showed edmund wright glaring into the camera edmund wright died of cirrhosis in john wright changed completely when that happened he moved to new york from pittsburgh and became a kind of local celebrity he was married four times to wellknown actresses all the marriages ended in divorce the last divorce from sarah layne occurred in and coincided with a sixmonth nervous breakdown for wright he was hospitalized in mcclain general outside atlanta for paranoid ideation and feelings of impotence apparently he had been impotent with his last wife a picture of sarah layne flashed up the men all stirred uncomfortably as they stared at the image handsome but haughty and undeniably challenging hour los angeles am pdt wright left the hospital against doctors advice and plunged into the political organization he formed americans for a better nation for the next four years he gave speeches and wrote pamphlets in he worked hard to influence the national elections on every level mostly without success he fell into a depression after that recently his interest in politics dropped sharply he seems to have withdrawn from any kind of public life he no longer holds large parties and no longer participates in the social life of new york according to all information he has been intensely studying a variety of subjects that are rather ominous these include sociology radiation theory physics and some aspects of biology he has interviewed experts in several different areas graves flipped the pages of his file including cancer experts civil engineers horticulture specialists and aerosol spraycan designers he aerosol spraycan designers someone asked that is correct there was some head scratching among those present he also became interested in the meteorology of the southwest the men were listening now and looking very puzzled all the doodling had stopped wright was listed as a potential surveillance subject at the end of after he had engaged in some questionable activities to influence the national election as a pss he did nothing out of the ordinary until six months ago then two things happened first wright began to transfer large amounts of money from various accounts in this country and in switzerland as you know we keep an eye on private capital transfers in excess of wright was moving much more than that secondly he began to be seen with known underworld figures the pattern of behaviour suggested a courtship and we became very concerned at that point the slides changed again several times in rapid succession showing smoothfaced businessmen robert trigger cannino sal martucci benny flick gerald tiny margolin these are some of the men he saw during that period the slides now showed wright in restaurants at taxi stands and in central park with these men active surveillance began in june when wright left new york for san diego he was clearly making plans for the republican convention but their nature was not clear and he was giving himself much too much time i ran the surveillance from the start during the surveillance period his contacts with organized crime have substantially decreased he has been seeing only one person consistently this man the screen showed a bald glowering face eddie the key trasker fiftythree a resident of las vegas who lives mostly in san diego he is reputed to be the power behind the teamsters and his influence over all forms of interstate transportation is enormous wright has seen him nearly every week often during the early hours of the morning he has also come in contact with this man timothy drew an exarmy officer with a background in computers the meaning of that association was unclear to me until this morning drew clearly represents sigma station drew tapped out classified defence information for wright we do not know what kind of information or why it was stolen graves sat down and looked at the faces phelps said questions gentlemen mcpherson from the presidents staff cleared his throat i gather from mr graves excellent but rather psychologically oriented presentation that we have no damned idea what wright is up to is that substantially correct yes it is graves said well then mcpherson said im afraid we can do nothing wright has acted suspiciously and is quite probably deranged neither is a crime in this country i disagree corey said sitting back in his chair corey was defence liaison a heavyset man with thick eyebrows that joined over his nose i think we have plenty of reason to apprehend wright at this time plenty of reason mcpherson said but no evidence no charges whitlock from the justice department straightened his tie and said im sure we all agree this is an unpleasant sort of meeting mr wright is a private citizen and he is entitled to do as he pleases so long as he does not commit a crime ive seen and heard nothing that suggests a crime has been or will be committed and what about the underworld contacts corey said whitlock smiled what about them i think thats very suggestive but he has broken no law whitlock said and until hedoes he shrugged corey frowned pushing his eyebrows into a black ominous v an interrogation would be useful even without a criminal act he said i think we have a basis for interrogation here wrights association with timothy drew who has stolen classified information probably for wright cant we pick him up on that i feel we should phelps said speaking for the first time graves spun around to look at phelps i disagree mcpherson said whitlock made some notes on the pad in front of him finally he said perhaps an interrogation is the safest route i think we need to know what was tapped out by sigma station mr corey pick him up mr phelps pick him up mr mcpherson opposed whitlock spread his hands graves said nothing the meeting was over if there are no further questions phelps said we can adjourn you didnt like that did you phelps said as they walked back through the travel agency no graves said i didnt still phelps said i think its best arrest him today on suspicion of conspiracy to commit grand larceny involving classified information isnt it robbery phelps sighed patiently robbery and larceny are different crimes graves said how long can i wait a few hours play with him if you want but pick him up by evening i want to get to the bottom of this graves couldnt make the arrest himself hed need federal marshals youll notify the marshals in san diego theyre waiting for your call phelps said and smiled as much as he ever did graves had fifteen minutes before he had to return to the airport as he walked out of the travel agency he heard a room filled with mechanical chatter curious he paused and opened the door he found that one office had been converted into a temporary hardware room it had once been somebodys office but now there were six teletypes and computer consoles installed there he was reminded that the state department intelligence division and the nsa had more computers than any other organizations in the world the room was empty at this hour he glanced at the teletypes noting their colour when he first started working at state in the early sixties rooms like this had contained five red teletypes and one blue teletype the red machines recorded information from overseas stations and embassies the blue was for domestic data now four of the machines were blue and only two were red there had been a shift in orientation for state intelligence nobody cared any longer about the movements of an eighth assistant deputy minister in the yugoslav government they were much more interested in the number five man in the black panther party or the number three man in the john birch society or the number six man in americans for a better nation he sat down at a computer console stared at the blank tv screen and began typing in wrights call numbers the screen glowed and printed out the categories of stored information wright john hensen file summary personal appearance complete photos personal history complete recent activities week update financial history complete political history complete miscellaneous cross references listing complete graves stared at the categories with some distaste it was disturbing that the government should have so much information on a private individual particularly one who had committed no criminal act at any time then on an impulse he pushed the wipe button and the screen went blank he typed in graves john norman followed by his own callup number he sat back and watched the numbers print out on the screen graves john norman intelligence dept stateinvestigations dom telephone x file contents cannot be displayed on this console without authorization vq he hesitated then punched auth vq authorization vq recorded state name after another hesitation he punched phelps richard d record callup name as phelps richard d file contents cannot be displayed on this console to the abovenamed person callup person is advised to acquire ntk authorization from department head graves smiled so even phelps couldnt call up graves file without a special needtoknow authorization who could call it up feeling whimsical he typed out this is the president of the united states the screen glowed record callup as preside ntoftheunitedstates is this a code name state given name graves sighed computers just didnt show any respect he pressed the wipe button and returned to the question of wright he didnt really know what he was looking for graves had supplied most of the computerized file contents himself but perhaps someone else had added to it he pushed the sequence calling up miscellaneous information that category had been empty two weeks ago now it contained an academic history of wrights work in mathematics prepared by s vessen stateanal whoever that was he had a moment of pleasure at the thought that states analysis people were abbreviated anal it was fitting he turned to the information itself hx academic john wright ibiblio follows wright studied mathematics at princeton under reimann from the start his interest like that of his teacher was heavily statistical and probabilistic his first paper concerned stock market fluctuations this was written in before high speed digital computers were available however without such tools wright decided that the stock market was totally random in its behaviour that is the chance that a given stock would go up or down on any day bore no relationship to what it had done the previous day this fact was finally confirmed beyond all doubt in wright was also interested in sports and gambling in he wrote an amusing short article on being due in it he argued correctly that the ordinary notion that a man is due for a hit if he has been recently unsuccessful at bat is totally fallacious each time at bat is a separate event he was also interested in historical contexts the fact that john adams james monroe and thomas jefferson all died on july th and so on he wrote a paper on assigning causation to historical and political events in this work he was strongly influenced by theoretical physicists he showed that you can never determine the chief reason for the american civil war napoleons defeat at waterloo the fall of the roman empire or any other historical event the chief reason cannot be known in any precise sense for any event there are hundreds or thousands of contributing causes and no way to assign priorities to these causes historians have attacked the wright thesis vigorously since it tends to put them out of a job he was however mathematically correct beyond doubt finally wright turned to the general theory of interactions for simplicity he studied twocomponent interactions leading to a single event or outcome he became quite knowledgeable in this area summary wright is a talented mathematician whose personal interests fall in the area of probability and statistics as they apply to human activities such as sports gambling and the interpretation of history his development as a mathematician disposed him to be interested in twocomponent interactions leading to a single event or outcome graves stared at the screen the notion of twocomponent interactions fascinated him it seemed to have all sorts of connotations he punched buttons and looked at the bibliography which was not revealing he looked at the abstracts of articles written by wright they were equally unrevealing then he saw that a final study was available apparently s vessen had applied a statistical analysis of his own to wrights work s vessen analysis of word frequencies in papers of john wright the following words appear more frequently than expected according to ratios of total wordage for mathematical treatises probability coincidence gaussian instability interaction twocomponent impotence graves frowned staring at the last word then he pressed the wipe button a final time and hurried to catch his plane hour en route to san diego am pdt the aircraft banked steeply over the oil fields of long beach and headed south towards san diego graves stared out the window thinking of wrights file then he thought about his own he wondered what it looked like the information displayed on the unblinking cathoderay screen in sharp white easytoread block letters he wondered how accurate it was how fair how honest how kind graves was thirtysix years old he had worked for the government fifteen years nearly half his life that fact implied a dedication which had never been there from the start his career in government had been a kind of accident in college graves had studied subjects that interested him whether they were practical or not on the surface they seemed highly impractical russian literature and mathematics he was drafted immediately after college and did pushups for five weeks before somebody in the army discovered what he knew then he was sent to the language school in monterey where he remained fortyeight hours just long enough to be tested before being flown to washington that was in and the cold war was grim washington needed russian translators desperately there were fears of a land war in europe fears of grand conquistadorial campaigns conducted by world communism meaning those two friendly allies russia and china at the time the fears had seemed compelling and logical graves worked for two years in the army as a slavic translator and after his discharge joined the state department in the same capacity the pay was good and the work was interesting he had the feeling of being useful of doing necessary and even important work in he married a girl on senator westlakes staff they had a daughter in they got divorced two years later he had a kidney stone and spent five days in the hospital he met a nice girl almost married her but didnt he bought a new car he moved to a new apartment in retrospect these seemed to be the signposts the significant shifts and alterations in his life the years went by he wore his hair a little longer but the hair was thinner exposing more of his temples his trousers got tight then flared and now were baggy again as they had been in the fifties there were cyclic changes in himself and his world but he was still working for the government state no longer wanted russian translators the big push was for chinese and japanese translators graves transferred into intelligence a division of state that was highly mathematical heavily computerized he worked in the foreign division for five years doing a lot of code breaking at that time the foreign embassies were all utilizing computergenerated codes of various kinds and it was challenging work even if the messages usually turned out to be requests for funds to refurbish the ballroom on the second floor or to hire additional kitchen help graves was interested in the codes not in the content in he was moved to the domestic end it seemed a minor change at the time and a change he welcomed he was ready to do something different it was a long time before he realized just how different it was during his fifteen years in the government slowly and imperceptibly his enemy had shifted from the big bear the russkies the reds the chicoms to his fellow americans that was his job now and he hated it it was tapping telephone transmissions and competing with other agencies it was value judgements and it was very very political nothing was clean and direct any more and graves didnt like it not any more graves had been planning to quit state for a long time ever since his domestic work had become distasteful but he hadnt quit what kept him was partly inertia and partly the fear that he might be unable to teach slavic or mathematics at least that was what he told himself he was reluctant to admit the real reason even to himself the fact was that he took a genuine pleasure in his work the pleasure was abstract the pleasure of a compulsive jigsaw puzzle worker who will fit the pieces together without caring what the puzzle really means it was a game he loved to play even if it was fundamentally nasty he also liked the notion of an opponent in the foreign division he had been up against institutions embassies foreign press corps political groups of various kinds in the domestic division it was most often a single individual graves had long ago discovered his skill at poker backgammon and chess games which required a combination of mathematical insight memory and psychological daring to him the ideal was chess one man pitted against another man each trying to calculate the intentions of the other in a game of enormous complexity with many alternatives that was why he had agreed to leave washington in order to follow the activities of john wright in the realm of puzzles and games nothing was more challenging than john wright he and wright were well matched the same intelligence the same mathematical background the same fondness for games particularly chess and poker but now after three months phelps was rolling him up wright would be arrested the game would be called off graves sighed trying to tell himself that this did not represent a personal defeat yet it was he knew it with a low whine the plane began its descent towards san diego skimming in over the roofs of the highest buildings graves didnt much like san diego it was a utilitarian town dominated by the needs of the navy which ran it with a firm conservative hand even its sins were dreary the downtown area was filled with bars pool halls and porno movie houses which advertised beaver films direct from frisco as if san francisco were six thousand miles away and not just an hour up the coast freshfaced sailors wandered all over the downtown area looking for something to do they never seemed to understand that there was nothing to do except possibly to get drunk despite the early hour san diego was hot and graves was grateful for the cars air conditioning lewis drove away from the airport glancing occasionally at graves the marshals checked in with us an hour ago so you know everybody knows theyre just waiting for you to say the word as they left the airport they passed beneath a banner stretched across the road welcome republicans graves smiled im going to hold off for a while he said at least until this afternoon lewis nodded and said nothing graves liked that about him his silence he was young and enthusiastic characteristics graves severely lacked but he knew when to keep his mouth shut well go directly to his apartment he said all right lewis said he didnt ask why what time did wright quit last night nine lights out at nine rather early graves frowned it was rare for wright to go to bed before midnight duly noted on the timeclock sheets lewis said i checked them myself this morning has he ever done that before gone to bed at nine july fifth he had the flu then you remember but hes not sick now graves said and tugged at his ear it was a nervous habit he had and he was very nervous now there were a lot of cops stationed on the road from the airport to the city graves commented on it you havent heard lewis said heard what the presidents coming in today no graves said when was that decided this is only the second day im surprised hed show before hes nominated everybodys surprised apparently he intends to address the convention delegates before the balloting oh yeah lewis smiled its also apparently true that there are some squabbles in the rules committee and the platform committee hes going to straighten that out ah it was making more sense the president was a practical politician hed sacrifice the drama of a grand entrance if he had to get a political job done earlier we just got the word a couple of hours ago lewis said same with the police theyre furious the chief has been making statements about how hard it is to provide security he gestured at all the wait ing cops they were stationed every thirty yards or so along the road i guess he managed looks like it what time is he due around noon i think they drove on in silence for a while leaving the coast road and heading into the centre of town graves noticed that broadway had been dressed up its honkytonk glitter subdued a little but there were a lot of toughlooking girls around lewis commented on it the city fathers are going crazy he said about that he jerked his thumb towards one spectacularly constructed girl in a tightly clinging pants suit i thought it wasnt allowed traditionally san diego was free of hookers despite the large sailor population tijuana was just twenty minutes away those services were usually provided across the border nothing they can do about it lewis said just in the last few hours theyve all been coming in every damned hooker for a thousand miles is here all the girls from vegas and reno and tahoe its the convention but the city fathers dont like it the city fathers hate it lewis said and grinned it was a youthful grin the grin of a person who still found sin amusing risque fun graves could no longer find the fun in prostitution why not he wondered was it age or was it striking some uncomfortable chord in himself but he didnt pursue the thought lewis turned left going up into the hilly section of town towards wrights apartment hour san diego am pdt lewis slowed as they approached a dry cleaning van advertising hour service at no additional charge and plant on premises you want to talk to lewis said yeah for a minute graves said lewis pulled over graves got out the driver in the van wound down his window i hear youre rolling it up the driver said thats right graves said when later today whats proto until then proto was slang for protocol business as usual graves said wheres f off duty today the driver shrugged call them in i want them to pick up the girl this morning oh yeah anything else yeah you got some coffee in theref sure two cups graves looked into the sedan at lewis you want coffee lewis shook his head just one graves said black with four sugars the driver sighed and looked into the interior of the dry cleaning van give the boss his usualhe shouted a moment later a styrofoam cup was passed out to graves youre going to catch diabetes the driver said this is breakfast graves said and walked back to his car in the background he heard the van driver saying to over to over graves got in the car slammed the door to lewis lets go the apartment the apartment wright had taken a fashionable apartment in the hilly northcentral section of san diego not far from the cortez hotel his building looked out over the city and the harbour at this hour people were leaving the apartment house standing in front and waiting until the doorman brought their cars around from the underground garage graves had had some trouble getting used to that when he first came here he was accustomed to the east where people in cities walked to work or took public transportation in california everybody drove everybody wright himself was an exception he had a driver and a limousine but then wright was always an exception he thought wright usually came out about his girl for the night one of five or six he saw with some frequency preceded him by ten or fifteen minutes there she is lewis said graves nodded it was odd how you could yell wrights irls even from across the street they cozld be spotted instantly yet there was no particular physical type no particular details of dress they werent professionals but there was a certain quality about them something blatantly erotic they were the girls a man would choose if he wanted to be reassured graves watched this one who wore a simple white dress and had very long legs as she climbed into a datsun sportscar and drove off to he said speaking into the intercom mounted on the dash there was a crackle of static here i thought we could sleep in today graves ignored the complaint red datsun sportscar convertible california licence zvw got it got it out a moment later a ford station wagon drove past them and the driver gave them the high sign briefly that was graves slumped down in his seat thinking they had not bothered to interrogate wrights girls in recent weeks when they began they had had dozens of interviews with the girls sometimes they had been straight interrogations more often they were casually arranged meetings in both cases the information was monotonously the same john wright was a nice and kind and generous and charming man he was also nervous and definitely conservative he sweated a lot preferred the missionary style kept the room dark and always remained a little aloof hardly valuable intelligence insight why do you want this one lewis asked and then he said here comes the limo a black lincoln limousine pulled up in front of the apartment building the chauffeur george marks got out buttoned his uniform jacket and stood by the door of the passenger side graves had never picked george up for questioning it had seemed too risky now he wondered if that had been a mistake but he could think of a hundred possible mistakes he had made especially today especially when wright was being arrested why are they going to arrest wright lewis asked he hadnt got an answer on his previous question so he was trying another graves lit a cigarette phelps is nervous but this computertapping business isnt enough phelps is running scared just now theres talk of closing down his division of intelligence in fact the new secretary is thinking of closing down all state intelligence work lewis raised his eyebrows whered you hear that graves smiled im in intelligence myself lewis glanced at him a moment then looked back out the window a man emerged from the apartment building stocky neatly dressed moving purposefully theres wright lewis said and started the engine of his car graves had watched john wright get into his limousine every morning for sixtysix days he knew the routine well george opened the door and tipped his cap wright nodded to him bent over at the waist and slipped quickly into the back seat george closed the door paused to tug at his leather gloves and walked around to the drivers side in the back seat wright stared straight ahead or opened his newspaper to read but this time john wright stared across the street directly at graves and he continued to stare until the limousine moved off in the hot san diego morning lewis was now very good at following in san diego traffic he kept pace three cars back after a time lewis said he was looking at you he certainly was do you think hes on to us impossible graves said he thought of the closet in his apartment he had five distinctly different suits in that closet and he rotated them on different days he thought of the three sedans and the four delivery trucks that the department used for surveillance work different manufacturers different colours and a new licence plate every week he had never parked in the same place never waited for wright in the same way he had never presented wright with a recognizable pattern impossible he said again and then graves thought of himself if he were wright would he discover that he was being followed even with all the precautions the safeguards the changes he liked to think that he would and if he would why not wright hes deviating lewis said nodding at the limousine graves saw that it was true normally on wednesday mornings wright went to balboa park where he walked in the gardens fed the pigeons and relaxed but he wasnt doing that today he was going downtown wheres our other car graves said lewis picked up the car radio receiver to where are you there was a hiss of static were at third and b going downtown lewis glanced at graves who nodded very good lewis said and clicked off the second car the dry cleaning van was running in advance of the limousine that was standard procedure one car tailing from the front one from behind in cities on really big jobs they sometimes used four cars working all around the suspect car that made it impossible to lose the suspect but graves didnt want a fourcar tail and in any case phelps would never have approved the expense the limousine went down third to avenue a then turned left going west you have himf we still have him lewis followed the limousine as it went crosstown on a and stopped pulling up in front of a warehouse lewis pulled to the kerb half a block behind they watched as wright got out and went inside graves lit a cigarette and they waited but after only a minute or so wright reappeared and got back into his car the limousine started off wonder what that was about lewis said as they passed the warehouse graves read the lettering he was surprised to find it wasnt a warehouse at all burns bros plastics vacuum moulding containers of all sons damned if i know graves said he made a note of the name and address in his notebook and then looked up at the street the limousine was going north now it went two blocks and turned left then left again it pulled up in front of another warehouse it seems hes doing some shopping lewis said hes in the wrong part of town ill drive past lewis said and continued smoothly past the warehouse and the parked limousine graves looked out of the corner of his eye he saw george the chauffeur lighting a cigarette he saw the large glass windows of the warehouse which was also a salesroom of some kind inside he saw wright standing at the counter receiving a package in the window were displayed various shining pieces of laboratory equipment sanderson scientific equipment and supply serving hospitals and laboratories since graves had to smile only in california would a date like seem proof of ageless service to the consumer well wait for him here he said and lewis pulled over at the end of the block and cut the engine graves checked his watch it was a moment later the limousine sped past them while he was making a note of the scientific supply company and its address lewis followed a short distance behind the limo again went uptown and pulled over in front of a machine shop wright got out and was met at the door by a man carrying a small paper bag wright shook hands with the man who was dressed in dungarees and a blue work shirt then wright opened the paper bag to look inside he removed one small shiny metal object nodded exchanged a few more words with the man and got back into his car the limousine drove off as they passed the machine shop graves noted the address and the name he stared at his list a plastics manufacturer a scientific supply house and now a machine shop he isnt buying presents for his girls lewis said and laughed did you check out that purchase last week the week before wright had also visited several small industrial manufacturers yeah lewis said it was two twelvefoot lengths of flexible hosing very unusual whats unusual about that it was stainless steel meaning lewis shrugged the guy i talked to said that nobody bought flexible stainless steel hosing any more people use either plastic or something like aluminium stainless is only used for piping very corrosive materials such as concentrated dyes corrosive gases that kind of thing the guy said it was pretty uncommon most highly corrosive stuff is pumped through glass piping but of course glass isnt flexible and wright bought two lengths of flexible steel right twelvefoot lengths at eightythree dollars a foot graves nodded and watched the car hes buying a lot of specialized equipment why you mean why is he doing it no graves said i mean why is he doing it himself in person i dont follow you why shouldnt he do it himself because hes too smart for that graves said the limousine went uptown twenty blocks and pulled over in front of another building the sign said harrelson garments and custom goods they watched wright get out of the limo and go inside ill be goddamned graves said what is it lewis said harrelson was in the papers a year ago they made rubber suits and whips and things like that there was a minor scandal lewis shook his head it really is true then what about your memory graves shook his head hed been through all this before i dont have a photographic memory he said i have a better than average memory thats all are you trying to convince me no just telling you you sound sore you better understand graves said that i dont have any special powers none at all i just plod along doing a job here he comes lewis said he pointed to wright emerging from the store with an armful of packages wrapped in brown paper george the chauffeur jumped out and came around to help carry the packages wright indicated that they were to go into the trunk of the car george locked them there then came around shut wrights door and drove off id like to know what was in those packages graves said making notes in his book bet you anything its kinky rubber clothing lewis said what will you bet at that lewis laughed he knew you didnt bet with graves nobody bet with graves he might deny special skills until he was blue in the face but the fact was that graves was the best gambler bettor poker player that any of them had ever seen they followed the car for another five minutes then it pulled up in front of a sporting goods store wright again got out he said something to george who nodded and went across the street to a coffee shop the car was left alone it could not be seen easily from either the sports store or the coffee shop looks like we have our chance graves said pull over as lewis pulled the sedan over graves opened the glove compartment and took out a large circular key ring on it were keys to wrights apartment in new york his apartment in san diego his limousine his alfa sportscar his summer house in southampton his winter house irr jamaica and several others as well they were all neatly tagged lewis said isnt this a little risky were going to arrest him today graves said it doesnt matter now he got out of the car feeling the heat of the morning air he walked forward to the limousine it took just a moment to insert his key in the trunk and open it he raised the trunk lid partway and looked at the brown paper packages there were three closed with strips of tape he opened a c aer of one and peered inside the package contained black rubber belts about six inches wide formed into loops of varying diameters he closed the package and squeezed the others they all seemed to contain belts frowning he shut the trunk and then because he was in a gambling mood he walked into the sporting goods store as he went through the door he glanced back at lewis lewis looked horrified the store was large and spacious he did not see wright immediately walking among the aisles of equipment he finally spotted him in the water sports department wright was gesturing with his hands forming a shape in the air graves walked over and stood beside him at the counter to do so gave graves an immediate burst of excitement he had never been so close to his subject before wright was smaller than he had thought several inches shorter than graves himself and much finerboned a delicate man in an englishcut suit dapper as phelps but without the vanity that made phelps unbearable the salesman said ill be right with you sir and graves nodded wright glanced over at him and smiled vaguely there was no recognition in the glance none at all graves was sure of it they were just two customers at the same counter graves bent over peering down at the glass case which contained depth gauges and underwater watches he could see wrights face reflected in the glass surface is this the one you mean sir the salesman asked graves glanced up and saw the salesman holding a small air tank painted yellow thats the one wright said now do you understand about this tank the salesman said its not the standard seventytwo cubic foot model this one only has twentyfive minutes of air at thats the one i want wright said it quietly but his voice cut the salesman off graves was impressed by the understated authority in the voice and presumably in the man yes sir how many was that three i think we have three in the storeroom the salesman said he turned to graves was there anything in particular it seemed to graves that the salesman was much less deferential to him than he was to wright but perhaps he was being paranoid i need a depth gauge graves said theyre all down there the salesman said pointing to the case be with you in a minute three was it sir ill get them the salesman walked off after a moment graves said i dont know anything about this there was a short ambiguous pause finally wright said diving yes its a present for my son he does a lot of diving wright was being formal polite barely interested wait until put the handcuffs on graves thought oh hes a nut about it but he doesnt really get much chance twice a year during school vacations we go down to mexico thats really all wright said that one there is a good one he pointed to a gauge in the case graves nodded i really dont know anything about this he repeated you dont dive yourself no graves said it always seemed too dangerous to me theres a certain thrill in danger though not for me not at my age you prefer golf poker graves said and looked directly at wright for the first time wright smiled poker can be very challenging he said but its like any other game if you get too good youre limited in your opponents yes ive found that youre good there was just the slightest taunt in the voice the slightest goading yes im good graves found himself saying for a moment the two men exchanged a level appraising look wright broke it he looked down at the counter still he said i admire the young with their exuberance in physical sports it raises the stakes you can be hurt you can be injured you can even be killed but when youre young you dont think of that it doesnt matter oh wright said i think it always matters dying always matters the salesman came back youre in luck mr johnson he said cheerfully you got the last three tanks shall i have them put in your car that will be fine wright said smiling you must be out of your mind lewis said they were back in the car following the limousine not at all i suppose you went up and talked to him as a matter of fact i did lewis smiled i know youve been doing this a long time but still look graves said were picking him up later today but youre teasing him playing a game of course graves said the limousine went up avenue d and pulled to a stop in front of a large hotel a man came out bent over the limo and talked to wright in the back seat the conversation lasted several minutes finally the man turned and went inside the limousine pulled away from the kerb graves snatched up the microphone to here hes all yours from now on stick to him out lewis looked stunned what the graves pointed to the figure of the man going back into the hotel follow that man and see where he goes his name is timothy drew hour san diego am pdt hold out your hands peters held out his hands and waited while the supervisor ran the geiger counter over them it made a soft clicking sound in the cavernous warehouse garage stand still he stood and watched as the counter probe was passed over his chest his abdomen his legs it was a little like being frisked turn around he turned he heard the counter clicking as it was passed down his spine to his feet okay next peters stepped aside and the driver moved forward as the driver was being checked by the geiger counter the dispatcher said to peters first run yes peters said ever done a dc before peters pointed to the counter not like this whatve you done explosives yes this is easier than explosives or flammables the dispatcher said weve got a regulation for two men in the cab and another for staying under fortyfive miles an hour thats it we can take all the roads all the tunnels and bridges much easier than explosives peters nodded what exactly is it the dispatcher consulted his clipboard mostly hospital supplies cases of intravenous saline twelve quarts to the case thirty cases in all cases of pennicillin g fortyeight ampoules to the case fifteen cases in all and two rad cartridges rad cartridges two bars of plutonium oxide thats a radioactive isotope one thousand grammes each theyre packed in lead cylinders thats our dangerous cargo peters asked you bet the dispatcher said the driver finished his check and came over to join them what was that all about insurance the dispatcher said you have to be cleared before exposure to the cargo in order for our coverage to be effective we should also do a blood test but we dont bother he turned to peters reeves this is your rider peters peters reeves reeves shook hands with peters as he did so he gave him a slightly surprised look as if something were mildly wrong the dispatcher nodded across the warehouse trucks over there he said have a good trip peters blinked in the sun and put on his sunglasses beside him reeves sighed bright day he said sure is you new at this yeah whatd you do beforef aeroplane tail assembly lockheed in palmdale tail assembly huh reeves said and laughed loudly they laid me off reeves stopped laughing and nodded sympathetically rough he said and then after a moment laid off the tail assembly and he chuckled some more peters smiled he felt confident about reeves who was fat and sloppy and casual and fifteen years his senior there wouldnt be any difficulty well reeves said since youre new at this you might as well learn the ropes he reached into his pocket and withdrew a plastic bottle of yellow pills he handed it to peters whats this peters asked dex go ahead take one feel terrific peters shook a pill into his hand and paused reeves took one then reached into his leather jacket and produced a flask wash it down with this he said vodka no smell he handed peters the flask peters dropped the pill from his hand letting it roll down between the seats he pretended to swig from the flask then returned it to reeves youll learn the driver said and smiled peters nodded and leaned forward slightly in his seat that way he could see out the sideview mirror and keep an eye on the black ford sedan that had been following them for the past fifteen minutes ten minutes later they were on the san diego freeway moving down the far right lane they passed a green and silver sign hackley rd exit mile peters shifted in his seat reeves was talking about his children theyre good kids he was saying but they dont show proper respect all this screaming about the president all this revolution talk it makes me want to we get off at the next exit peters said no reeves said we dont stop for another he broke off peters had taken the pistol from the pocket of his leather jacket hackley road peters said quietly turn off the ramp and go half a mile east youll see a small dirt road turn right onto that ill be goddamned the driver said they came to hackley road and turned off on the exit ramp they drove east peters glanced in the side mirror and saw that the ford sedan was still following i should have known reeves said hows that i should have known something was wrong when i shook hands its your hands what about them theyre as soft as a babys ass reeves said you never worked in your life turn right up here peters said it went smoothly reeves pulled the truck onto the dirt road and stopped in a clump of eucalyptus trees peters made reeves get out and lie on his stomach on the ground with his hands over his head reeves said nothing for a long time finally he said you going to shoot me not if you stay quiet peters said the ford sedan drew up behind the truck and three men all wearing childrens halloween masks jumped out a driver remained at the wheel nobody spoke as the men opened the back of the truck climbed up on the hydraulic tailgate and went into the cargo area nice and easy peters said standing near reeves with the gun nice and easy reeves did not move the men emerged from the truck carrying two small extremely heavy boxes peters could see the tripleblade radiation symbol on the boxes the men closed the truck and started to load the boxes into the car one of them came over and expertly tied and gagged reeves with adhesive tape then speaking for the first time the man said bets go peters was confused i thought you were going to take lets go peters went with the man who wore a donald duck mask and got into the car the sedan backed out of the road and drove off the men all left their masks on one of them said whats the time nine thirtytwo perfect peters was given a mask of his own a witchs mask with dayglo pink cheeks and wild eyes he pulled it on and said i thought we were taking the penicillin too the plan was changed somebody said but if we just take the capsules the plan was changed this morning we were told to take only the capsules peters frowned and said nothing he felt the change in plan was a terrible mistake by stealing the penicillin they would have confused the issue it might have taken the truckers several days to discover the theft of the radiation capsules but now theyd find only the capsules gone it was too obvious too simple why had the change been made time nine thirtysix the driver nodded and pulled over to the side of the road the men sat quietly not removing their masks peters looked at the backs of their necks noticing the length of their hair the condition of their collars the way they were dressed several minutes gassed time nine forty the driver put the car in gear he drove down the road through gently rolling farm country the morning air was still cool there it is up ahead was another dirt road turnoff with another truck pulled off the road and another man standing over the driver remember we want twenty pounds of it the black sedan pulled up behind the truck peters was given the spool of inchwide adhesive tape he quickly tied and gagged the driver meanwhile the others opened the truck and removed several small packages they were wrapped in clear plastic and looked like bread dough a whitish puttylike substance the men carried two packages each bringing them around to the trunk of the sedan setting them in carefully then going back for more peters gave a mask to the man standing over the driver with the gun the gunman did not speak then peters went around to the trunk of the sedan and began counting the plastic packages when there were twenty he placed them in a suitcase locked the case and closed the trunk the men climbed back into the sedan and drove off time nine fiftyone beautiful the black sedan drove back to the san diego freewa and stopped at the onramp for hackley road peters got out so did the other gunman peters went around to the trunk and removed the suitcase with the plastic packages the other gunman placed the two radiation capsules into the blue canvas gym bag he stood with peters until the sedan had pulled onto the freeway and disappeared then his back to the road he took off his mask peters took off his mask as well the other man removed a paper american flag from the bag with peters help he taped the flag onto the side of the suitcase then peters removed his blackhaired wig and his moustache the other man removed his blond wig and peeled away a reddish newlooking scar on the side of his cheek the two men looked at each other and laughed well done brother peters said and clapped him on the back they waited five minutes and then another black sedan very dusty pulled up an older man leaned out and said give you boys a lift peters said were going to phoenix as he said it he glanced at his brother who was frowning hell of along way the old man said anyhow you want to go south this is the north ramp were just resting a minute the man looked at them as if they were peculiar shrugged and drove onto the ramp his car rattled as he gathered speed and then he was gone they were left by the roadside his brother lit a cigarette you know his brother said this is going to create a hell of a mess that was the idea when are you leaving four thats cutting it awfully close im getting out at three to vegas his brother nodded you chicago you better hope nothing delays that plane on the ground theres another flight at four thirty im booked on that one as well his brother nodded down the road they saw a car approach it was black and white a sedan they couldnt see it clearly but as it came closer they saw the configuration better a police car shit peters said his brother lit another cigarette what if he wants to look in the suitcase what if he we havent done anything wrong peters said he glanced at his watch it was almost ten oclock where the hell was the pickup the police car came closer i dont like this at all his brother said we havent done anything wrong peters said again the police car approached them and put on its blinker the bastards pulling over but the car did not pull over instead it drove onto the ramp and merged with traffic the cop hardly glanced at them they sighed what time is it i have ten on the nose in the distance a car got off the far ramp and made a u turn under the freeway it was a cadillac convertible with a woman driving she came around and started up the ramp going back the way she had come she stopped when she saw them i took the wrong turnoff can i give you fellows a lift were going to phoenix peters said no kidding the woman said thats my home town no kidding peters said which part the right part she said the two men exchanged glances then got into the car placing the suitcases in the back seat the woman said sorry im late and drove off nothing else was said hour san diego am pdt the voice crackled over the telephone line fucking around with the computers phelps said is not my idea of a joke graves sat in the hotel phone booth and stared across the lobby at lewis and a marshal lewis was gesturing to graves to get off the phone it wasnt intended as a joke how was it intended phelps said his voice heavy with sarcasm it was intended as an attempt to recall my own file youre not supposed to do that there are a lot of things im not supposed to do and you seem bent on doing all of them phelps said have you picked up wright yet no youve certainly had time its ten i want to play him a little besides i have somebody else oh timothy drew where upstairs weve got him in a hotel on third weve been looking for him for fortyeight hours phelps said and i mean looking hard how did you find him wright led us to him graves said that was the only thing that bothered graves it was too much like a setup as if wright were giving him drew how convenient phelps said when are you going to arrest him hes already arrested the federal marshals are up there with him i mean wright later in the day graves said you and your goddamned poker games phelps said i want you to call me in an hour all right stop agreeing with me just do it and he hung up graves left the phone booth lewis came over with his notebook open they headed for the elevator whatve you got graves said its pretty strange lewis said at sandersons today wright bought a model scintillation counter retail price two hundred fortyseven dollars a scintillation counter yeah its apparently a kind of highgrade geiger counter reads radiation does it have any other uses nobody knows of any what else the machine shop ground three fittings for him to custom specifications all highgrade stainless steel two of them are onoff pressure valves with special handles the third is a t coupling which brings together two hoses into a common outlet whats special about the valve handles the handles have a series of perforations presumably so the valves can be turned on and off by some sort of machine any information about what kind of machine would be used to turn the valves on and off lewis shook his head but they said the handles are springloaded a moderate pressure will snap them from full shut to the full open position now thats really interesting graves said you mean there are no intermediate positions for the valves yes its either full shut or full open the elevator came graves pressed the button for the sixth floor when did wright order these custom fittings last week rush order really interesting graves said what about the plastics store lewis scratched his head three weeks ago wright ordered two pressuremoulded plastic tanks from them long tanks roughly a foot in diameter and eight feet long specified as triplelaminate things able to withstand pressures up to five hundred pounds per square inch the shop was surprised to get the order well the guy said nobody orders tanks like that in plastic its too dangerous all highpressure tanks are metal and seamless theres no advantage to plastic even in weight plastic tanks if theyre triplethickness are heavier than metal wright wouldnt order something that had no advantage well lewis said the guy thought wright was a pretty strange customer not only did he want these plastic tanks but he wanted them made out of allacron which is a very tough resilient plastic but highly combustible it burns like a bastard so it isnt used much have the tanks been finished they were delivered a week ago to a private airfield hangar in el cajon about twelve miles from here you have the address yeah i tried to call no telephone there graves frowned he was more convinced than ever that wright was playing with him leading him on a chase daring him to put the puzzle together two highpressure tanks of combustible plastic special steel fittings including a t nozzle two steel hoses flexible all that made a kind of sense you had two tanks and two hoses that joined in a t nozzle so that the contents of the two tanks liquid or gas presumably would come together at the t nozzle and then be expelled as a mixture that was easy to visualize but what was the point and what was the point of the skindiving tanks and the rubber strips and the geiger counter the elevator stopped at the sixth floor they both got out and walked to drews room where is wright now i just checked with hes in that apartment on alameda the one he rented last week right the newly rented apartment was also a puzzle wright had apparently leased it on the spur of the moment it seemed to coincide with nothing except with the fact that one girl had been seen leaving his old apartment near the cortez hotel three mornings in a row this was unusual enough to suggest that wright was going to set her up as his mistress talked to the doorman wright told the doorman theyd be moving furniture into the apartment later in the day hmmm that seemed totally unreasonable to graves wright wouldnt spend time supervising domestic arrangements for a girl it was beneath him stopping in the hallway lewis said does all this make sense to you no graves said not yet but i expect to get some help without knocking he opened the door and entered drews room timothy drew sat in an overstuffed chair and said i want to see my lawyer his voice was calm the fact of his arrest and the presence of two federal marshals standing by the doors with their hands resting on the butts of their revolvers did not seem to disturb him at all graves eyes swept the livingroom it was an expensive hotel suite furnished in a heavily elegant style altogether not bad for a man one year out of the army he sat down in a chair opposite drew i want to see my lawyer drew repeated his eyes flicked once to graves then went back to the cops as if he had decided graves was unimportant youll have that opportunity graves said drews eyes snapped back fixed on him in due time graves added i want to do it now were in a hurry graves said his voice was not hurried at all wed prefer to have a statement from you now i have nothing to say graves shrugged and lit a cigarette he never took his eyes off drew this was going to be a kind of chess game he knew and it was a game he could win if he kept his temper i want to see my lawyer drew repeated graves did not reply he just stared that was the simplest form of pressure and he wanted to see if it would work listen drew said who are you guys anyway you havent got the right to push me around you havent got a warrant did you show him the warrant graves said yeah we showed him the warrant one of the marshals said show him again the marshal snapped open the warrant in front of drew then took it away signed by a federal district court judge at nine thirty this morning graves said all in order all perfectly legal youre arrested on a charge of conspiracy to steal classified information it carries a mandatory twentyyear prison sentence if youre convicted parole is not granted for such charges do you know what that means i want to see my lawyer im trying to help you graves said quietly keep your mouth shut and listen you were observed tampering with the computer terminals at southern california underwriters you tapped into classified data banks at known times which coincide with your access to the terminals in question we have traced back the lines furthermore you utilized certain codes known to you but outdated this gives you away its quite straightforward youll get out of prison when youre about fifty graves stood up now think carefully mr drew is it worth it drews face went blank neutral composed i want to see my lawyer graves sighed and walked around the livingroom looking idly at details he glanced into the bedroom and saw a packed suitcase next to the bedhe looked back at drew planning a trip i want to see my lawyer graves walked into the bedroom and opened the suitcase the bottom half was filled with lightweight clothing bathing trunks sports clothes the top was packed with money neat stacks of twentydollar bills held tight in paper sleeves fresh from the bank he counted the stacks it came to roughly twenty thousand dollars in a corner of the bedroom draped over a chair was a sports coat he found a ticket for the noon plane to acapulco in the pocket a firstclass ticket oneway he returned to the livingroom drew watched him wary now planning a trip mr drew i want to see my lawyer thats a lot of money in there mr drew i have nothing to say from your ticket it looks like you were planning to stay down there not come back drew shook his head he did not speak he was sweating but still in control he showed no sign of cracking can you account for all that moneyp no comment i want to see all right graves said he sighed and turned to the marshals okay lock him up the marshals grabbed drew roughly each taking an arm for the first time drew became excited whats going on graves found the reaction interesting was drew afraid of jail was he homosexual did he need drugs graves decided to play on the jail fear we dont have many options mr drew i know its not pleasant but weve got to put you in jail you know theres a lot of paperwork and sometimes people get lost inadvertently deprived of their rights i mean people have spent a day or two in jail and their papers get mixed up so they dont get any food or water or anything but you see nobody knows youre there for a while where are you taking me drews voice was strained now very tense downtown well be talking to you again in a day or so when youre more relaxed downtown san diego yes graves said and he suddenly realized that drew wasnt afraid of jail at all he didnt want to stay in the city that was what he was afraid of you cant do that just watch it happen graves said lighting a cigarette ive got to leave drew said he was now openly agitated i have to leave i have to leave why its my sister shes sick in mexico thats why i have the money i need it you dont have a sister graves said you have one brother two years older than you who sells insurance in portland oregon your father is still alive and lives in michigan your mother died two years ago of a heart attack drews body sagged put him down graves said to the marshals they dropped him back into the chair now listen to me graves said you arent going anywhere without giving us some help drew stared at him i want a cigarette graves gave him one what time is it now drew asked dully ten thirty graves lit the cigarette for him and watched as drew sat back and inhaled listen drew said i have to catch that plane at noon why is that graves said i dont know drew said i swear to god i dont know what do you know i know i have to get out of san diego today because something is going to happen how do you know this john told me john wright yes what did he say he said that the binary would go off today in san diego and what is the binary i dont know he sucked on the cigarette mr drew youre going to have to do better i swear to you i dont know graves paused he let drew sweat and let him smoke finally he said how is the binary related to the information you tapped from the data banks i cant be sure the information was in two areas one was easy to get the other was hard first john wanted supply routings i spent a couple of days learning how to plug into the subroutines to release the information i kept getting no authorization printouts but finally i managed to plug in and extract what supply routings for different things things well john gave me the codes for what he wanted dont ask me where he got those codes one of the codes was for a thing called binary slash i got a supply routing for that and you have no idea what the code represents none except that its obviously defence department material transported by rail how do you know that from the routings themselves you cant be sure whats being transported but you can tell the method air rail other surface vehicle truck convoy you can tell the method what else can you tell you can tell the c and c ratings whats that command and control provides a rating for all material transportation the ratings are in grades grades one through seven one is pretty safe or pretty inexpensive like clothing or spare auto parts that sort of thing seven is very expensive or very dangerous what was binary slash it was grade seven what did you think binary slash represented drew puffed on his cigarette he did not answer for a long time finally he said i thought it was radioactive materials meaning i dont know components for a bomb maybe i dont know graves almost immediately rejected that explanation although it fitted with the scintillation counter what else could it be you asked me what i thought it was i told you you think wright planned to make an atomic bombf i think he planned to steal the components maybe he already has and do what with them i dont know but its going to happen today graves sat back drew put out his cigarette graves offered him another what does a code like binary mean it could be just a random code drew said but they usually have some specific meaning thats why i thought it was atomic components binary meaning a twin system drew said something with two active parts two units nuclear bombs are like that you have two sections of uranium neither of which will explode by itself but you bring them together and you reach critical mass start a chain reaction he snapped his fingers bingo by now graves was convinced that drew believed this explanation graves did not whatever wright planned it had nothing to do with atomic bombs that didnt fit with the tanks and hoses and nozzles all of which pointed to some gas or liquid apparatus hes insane drew said suddenly thats the trouble hes crazy hes convinced that everybody is out to get him and hes convinced that the government is being turned over to the wrong elements and hes convinced that only he can set things right you mentioned that there was something else you had to tap from the data banks what was it that was strange drew said id already tapped the defence routings my job was over then john asked me to tap into the state data banks state state department i said i couldnt he told me to try and gave me some more codes i dont know where he got those either but they worked what was the information he wanted file summary on one person drew said a man who worked in state department intelligence named graves i see graves said did you obtain the information eventually and you gave it to wright yes he wasnt interested in it i dont think except for one part the psychological test scores do you remember anything else no only that john was very interested in the psychological tests he puffed on the cigarette i remember he said when he saw it well this is the final cog in the machine and laughed what did he mean by that damned if i know drew said hour san diego am pdt as they left drews room lewis said by the way theyre still holding the girl the girl graves was distracted thinking about what drew had said the girl we picked up this morning oh yes where is she theyve got her downstairs in the grand ballroom graves nodded and checked his watch theyd held the girl for several hours already id better see her now he said whats her name lewis consulted his notes cynthia lembeck how does she seem lewis shrugged nervous anyone would be nervous graves thought who had to spend much time in the hotels grand ballroom it was a cavernous space with ornate walls and ceiling but for some reason all the tables and chairs had been removed the ballroom was empty except for a girl sitting in a foldup chair near one wall and a marshal standing nearby graves went over to her seen close she was darkly tanned conventionally pretty and older than he had expected in her late twenties or early thirties miss lembeck oh she said in surprise its you that stopped him stopped him cold you recognize me well just your face ive seen your picture where johns apartment i see are you a friend of his not exactly graves said i work for the government something to do with the convention not exactly he switched into a straightforward interrogation mode how long have you known mr wright miss lembeck about a month how did you meet him through friends she glanced from graves to the marshal have i done something wrong no no we just want to ask you some questions what can you tell us about mr wright hes very nice she said were engaged oh that was a surprise yes he bought me an apartment just last week i see its very nice at least it will be the girl was not very bright but she had a sweet sexiness that was unmistakable still he couldnt imagine wright marrying her in the past he had married wellknown women celebrities theres nothing there now the girl said theyre moving furniture in today you must be excited oh i am johns excited too but he has so much on his mind how do you mean well business things hes very interested in politics you know no i didnt know that you didnt she seemed puzzled i thought well anyway he is and this morning we had the news on the television and they announced that the president was coming into town well he got very upset and started making telephone calls a lot of them what sort of calls i dont know they were long distance did you hear any of them no are you sures well i heard him ask the operator for area code thats washington isnt it yes graves said he knew that it wasnt but he could check it later he was very upset and then later he mentioned china he doesnt like the president about china you know she sighed he thinks its very wrong i see you say youve seen my picture only last night she said that was the first time i thought you were related to him or something because he has your picture up all over the place this happened last night yes but he was strange last night anyway nervous i see what about i dont know hes worried about business things he said something about a shipment hes expecting what else was strange last night she hesitated apparently embarrassed go on graves said gently well it was different last night he was very vigorous he did it three times i see graves said outside the ballroom lewis was in a phone booth checking the area code he came out and fell into step with graves eight oh one he said is utah any particular place no the whole state is one area code shit graves said i wish we had a tap on his phone well we did our best to get it lewis reminded him yeah graves said he sighed i never thought id hear myself complaining because we hadnt tapped a phone things are different now lewis said they sure are they went outside into the bright hot morning sun and climbed into the car lewis started the engine where to miss lembecks new apartment the one wright just rented okay lewis said when they arrived at the apartment building they saw wrights limousine parked in front behind the wheel george was reading a newspaper are we fully set up across the street graves said we should be lewis said graves nodded wait here ill go see what theyve found the day before they had set up a surveillance unit in the apartment building facing wrights graves rode to the nineteenth floor got out and walked to room he knocked once who is it graves the door was opened for him he entered the room it was small and bare except for equipment clustered around the windows there were two sets of binoculars on tripods and three sets of cameras four chairs a directional microphone also on a tripod recording equipment film canisters heaped ashtrays and a television set on the tv walter cronkite was saying are trying to get a vote from the alabama delegation which is apparently still in caucus in the background a booming echoing mechanical voice was saying alabama alabama alabama graves ignored the tv whatve you got he asked one of the three men in the room stepped away from the binoculars have a look he said graves looked from this vantage point he could see directly into one window of wrights apartment on the nineteenth floor of the opposite building there were no drapes on the window which made it easy to see in the room was bare except for four peculiar wooden structures standing in the centre of the floor they had drapes on that window too the man said but they took them off half an hour ago from all the windows no just this one graves frowned why did they know they were being observed did they want to make it easier because that was what they had done he could see wright striding around the room directing two other people wright was working in shirtsleeves the windows open graves said it must be hot as hell in there thats right the man said the window has been open ever since wright showed up an hour ago whatre those wooden things on the floor sawhorses the man said we figure they had paperhangers in there paperhangers use sawhorses but theres something funny going on how do you mean well look at the sawhorses closely they have indentations cut in them graves looked he could see a broadly curved ushaped cut in each sawhorse why beats me they just cut them a while back you mean specially thats right theyve been doing a lot of unusual things in there every so often wright sticks his hand out the window and hes got this whirling thing like a kids whirling top he sticks his hand out there for a minute then pulls it back graves looked away from the window describe it exactly it has four arms the man said and at the end of each is a cup to catch the wind sort of a weathervane but there isnt much wind today anemometer graves said a what it measures wind velocity why should wright want to know the wind velocity outside the window of his girl friends apartment why does he care about that the man said graves shook his head and turned back to the window examining the sawhorses through the binoculars each sawhorse with its single indentation in the crossbar four sawhorses two tanks of course the crossbars would have indentations so that the tank wouldnt roll off you seen any tanks in there nothing like that the man said all weve seen is a lot of mechanical equipment what kind of mechanical equipment graves peered through the binoculars he didnt see any equipment at all it looks like pumps and stuff the man said it was right in the middle of the floor he glanced through the binoculars then shook his head they must have moved it to another room they had some electronic equipment too what kind looked like a hifi maybe graves thought of several nasty remarks but said nothing a hifi for christs sake that guy in there must be pretty weird the man said graves turned on him he is not weird he is a brilliant and a dedicated man he is engaged in a complicated plot and he is daring he broke off the man was staring hes not weird graves finished and returned to the binoculars as he watched john wright stepped to the window and extended his hand he held an anemometer the cups spun lazily after a moment wright withdrew the instrument and returned to directing the other men in the room graves turned away from the window and made some calls department of defence public information please just a minute please there was a clicking public information missconover speaking id like to talk to lieutenant morrison please one minute please more clicking lieutenant morrisons office john graves calling for lieutenant morrison just a minute ill see if hes in still more clicking morrison here what is it as usual morrison sounded harried pete this is john graves at state im in san diego and i need some information shoot pete i need to know what a code word represents the code word is binary slash morrison coughed in surprise whered you hear that pete just tell me what it means jesus this is an open line i know its an open line tell me what it means where are you calling from san diego jesus you must be out of your mind i need the information pete and i need it now look morrison said if you dont mind me saying so this is pretty irregular youve just popped a he broke off again honestly he said in his most honest publicinformation officers voice id have to obtain clearances and confirmation of needtoknow from your department and then id have to pass it on to the army and then okay fine do it you have to supply the clearances i havent got time youre asking me on an open line to define a hot new weapons system and break its code and you havent got look graves said if i call phelps can he call you and requisition this information verbal requisition morrison seemed shocked this is pretty heavy stuff for a verbal you sure you dont want specifications on the abm sites while youre at it and maybe polaris submarine coordinates any other minor details graves suppressed his anger morrison was such a bureaucratic ass i need the information he repeated i need it now sounds like this may be a matter for defence to look into morrison said wed be curious to know how you got that coding in the first place why dont you forward us a complete report along with a requisition ab thats the green form i may be able to release the data to you in a day or so and graves hung up this is graves i know who it is phelps said what do you have to say for yourself binary slash graves said its a coding i need to know what it means binary slash phelps said there was a long pause faintly graves could hear him writing it down finally he said are you going to tell me where you came across it its what drew tapped from the system graves said oh phelps said but drew doesnt know what it means either how did he happen to tap in wright told him to well did you ask wright why no why not i havent picked him up yet graves said you havent picked him up yet thats right what are you waiting for a divine edict i thought i already had that graves said but the situation is complicated you see wright asked for more information from the data banks more information about a state department intelligence officer named john graves he pulled my file dont be an ass phelps said pick him up immediately hes on to you thats clear not only is he on to me graves said hes showing me a puzzle and daring me to work it out this is not a fucking poker game phelps said we can convict wright on the basis of evidence we already have and you cant touch him graves said when he cools down drew wont testify against him you havent got a prayer of making a case against wright our only chance is to wait and to get me my own file contents youre joking im not its out of the question i want to know what he knows about yourself yes especially psychological test scores out of the question unheard of youve got to do this for me graves said youve got to get me that file i cant requisition it phelps said without higher authority you know that youre much better off picking wright up not yet i have to go to lunch phelps said call me later i think youre acting like a fool and phelps hung up state department a singsong voice office of the secretary please thank you lilting secretary of state can we help you mr burnett please burnett was one of the secretarys advisers although young he had worked himself up from a speech writer to a close and influential position graves knew him slightly mr burnett has gone to lunch and is not back yet he is expected shortly did he leave a number no im sorry just a moment hes coming through the door whom shall i say is calling john graves state intelligence one moment please mr graves there was a very long wait and a humming sound as graves was put on hold then a click burnett here tom this is john graves calling how are you john its been a long time when was it senator evans party i think you had a very cute listen tom i have a problem i need your help ill do what i can said very smoothly in the manner that all those people adopted sooner or later no promises but very smooth graves paused i need my file your file yes my department file i dont think just a minute no please hold that ill call him right back john im here ill have to call him right back yes in a few minutes absolutely five minutes tell him five minutes john im here graves said again now what was it your file yes i need my own file ive never heard of anyone needing their own file burnett chuckled curiosity yes but tom stop being polite this is department business and its very important perhaps you could stop by the office and i cant stop by the office im not in washington im in san diego oh there was hesitation now the smoothness gone san diego im doing an ss here a guy named john wright i need my own who john wright well why didnt you say so before ill get it to you right away the secretary has directed everyone to cooperate fully with the san diego operation graves sighed that was refreshing he had an enormous sense of relief what was that joke it felt so good when he stopped lets see burnett said ill have to get an authorization i can do that with the undersecretary i dont have to bother the boss then we have to get it to you you dont have access to a photoprinter no well lets see i dont know what sort of facilities are available in san diego look theres one sure bet the police department they have a printer for sure i can transmit the file contents to you over that but itll take time to do the whole thing i dont want the whole thing i just want the psychological test scores you do thats right graves said well burnett said i can have that for you right away theyll transmit in fifteen or twenty minutes okay okay graves said and thanks for christs sake dont mention it burnett said graves hung up downstairs in the car lewis said you look like youve gargled with drano i have graves said he got into the car were going to the police station lewis pulled out into traffic anything interesting happening upstairs theyve found that wright is preoccupied with weather today weather yes i dont get it lewis said neither do i graves said hour san diego noon pdt youre very quiet lewis said as they drove to the police headquarters graves nodded i was thinking of an old story its back in the softdata section of wrights file you know about the murdock killing lewis shook his head it happened in new york five years ago wright was married to a girl named sarah layne and when it broke up she started seeing a man named murdock a texas oil man big spender big ladies man lewis nodded well murdock got an anonymous tip that he would be killed got it about seven in the morning he believed it so he called his chauffeur and had him go over the car carefully the chauffeur found a bomb and notified murdock murdock went down to the garage to see the bomb and had his chauffeur remove it the chauffeur carried it away and murdock who was an oilman and interested in explosives leaned into the engine compartment to examine how the bomb had been wired in and thirty seconds after the first bomb was removed a second one exploded murdock was killed instantly nice wright was questioned but never charged there was nothing to point to him thats the story but whoever did it knew a lot about murdock you think thats the way wright operates i know it is lewis was silent for a moment why are we going to the police station to find out how much wright knows about me graves said the spinning drum produced the transmitted image with almost painful slowness it made a loud distracting clanking sound nevertheless when the first sheet came off the drum graves grabbed it up eagerly and read with intense concentration ignoring the clanking the room the cops all around lewis everything the first sheet was printed out in block letters as wrights file had been psychological testing john norman graves state int dom reason for test five year survey authorization for test dstate special considerations query suitability for domestic work test scores and results rorschach ink blot a test scores of chief interest is the use of colour as response determinant this is confusing on the one hand subject uses colour as a major factor in determining what he sees in the form this suggests emotional volatility and impulsiveness on the other hand he is respectful of the forms of the colour suggesting caution and perhaps over compliance b dynamic content there is a heavy emphasis on themes of masculine aggression war animals fighting weapons and blood recur often a sense of competition and struggle is usually present there is a remarkable lack of guilt expressed in association with these themes subject is apparently comfortable in situations of tension and competition c patterns of thought organization no major insights here except a strong sense of excitement relating to all competitive themes and subjects d test behaviour subject clearly regards this testing situation as one in which he must prove himself in line with his competitive impulses he definitely plays off the tester in a rather unusual manner he does not try to please the tester or win his approval nor does he evidence hesitancy or uncertainty about his chosen answers instead he utilizes the tester as a source of inside information about the test itself he attempts to manipulate the tester one has the sense that he brings all possible resources to any test situation and he regards the tester as one available resource this is not strictly fair of course but there is a certain amoral quality about the subject in competitive situations one feels he will do anything to win thematic apperception test tat competition the need for action the excitement of stress and the horror of failure in competitive activity were frequent themes in certain instances there was a sense of immortality achieved by vigorous competition the subject talked about one picture as showing a man who had cheated death it is worth indicating that in most areas the subject has a strongly developed sense of conventional morals perhaps even an overrestricted sense however wheres the next page graves said impatiently coming off now lewis said and pulled it from the machine he handed it to graves in competitive situations these moralities are abandoned and if there is a conflict such as two men competing for the favours of one woman the subject will cheerfully propose cheating in order to win the day psychogenetically it is clear the subject is competing with his father in a classic oedipal situation stories about the father emphasize the demanding uncompromising and competitive quality of the fatherfigure and the difficulty of winning approval it is likely that the subject lives in a world peopled by his father against whom he must constantly strive and compete failure is abhorrent to the subject he usually does not allow that it might occur physically he equates failure with castration the fear of failure is so great that the subject may be impulsive quickness of response is important to him and a source of pride abbreviated wais iq test rapidity of response was a major factor here in producing an initial test score of the subject felt compelled to finish each section in less than the allotted time testers impression is that the subject has a test score at least points higher than that this is confirmed by past iq tests which have scored the subject in the range the subjects willingness to damage his own performance by overly fast reaction should be noted cronberg diagnostic personality questionnaire subject scores highly in manic scales with some consistent evidence of paranoia this may well relate to his competitive drives summary is there another sheet graves asked its coming its coming lewis said he smiled youre really devouring this arent you i think its important dont you know it all already its about you no graves said its what somebody else thinks of me theres a difference lewis shrugged the third and final sheet came from the printer graves read it in summary we can say that john graves is a highly intelligent imaginative and conventionally moral man with an astoundingly strong competitive drive his need to compete is almost his most outstanding trait it seems to overwhelm every other aspect of his personality it is highly developed and ruthless in the extreme there is no question that he is a good bettor gambler poker and chess player to name hobbies he professes to like if there are any defects or hidden flaws in his behaviour they are his impulsiveness and his desire to finish a test situation rapidly he frequently performs below his maximum level because of a desire for speed he often feels that a problem is solved when it is only half finished or twothirds finished this situation must be guarded against by having a less brilliant but more thorough person checking his work at intervals graves stared at the last page is that all lewis nodded at the photoprinter which had turned itself off the roller no longer spinning looks like it ill be damned graves said he folded the sheets carefully put them in his pocket and left the police station the radio crackled this is we are following the limo east on route five graves picked up the microphone whos in the limo only the subject and the chauffeur nobody else no when did they leave the apartment about five minutes ago all right out graves looked at lewis where now lewis asked route five east graves said and step on it the white grumman gulf stream jet landed gracefully and taxied to a stop near a small hangar the side door went down and two men climbed off several workmen in coveralls boarded the plane after a moment they began unloading two large cardboard boxes standing near the end of the runway of the small private field in el cajon graves squinted through binoculars the heat made everything shimmer san diego was hot but el cajon twelve miles inland was much hotter can you make it out graves asked beside him lewis leaned against theroof of the sedan to steady his arms as he held the binoculars he pulled his elbows up quickly ouch he said he held the binoculars freehand i dont know what they are he said but i know what they look like they look like mattress boxes graves lowered his glasses thats what they look like to me where did this flight originate salt lake a private airfield mattresses from utah did the plane make intermediate stops lewis shook his head i dont know but it certainly wouldnt have to stop its got a cruising range of just under four thousand miles while they watched they heard the tinny sound of the car radio saying the president is due to arrive at any moment the delegates are tense with anticipation no one yet knows what he intends graves reached in and clicked it off meanwhile the workmen carried the two mattresssized boxes into a green hangar he rented that hangar last week lewis said moved a lot of equipment in what kind of equipment nobodys had a look yet graves bit his lip that was an opportunity theyd missed several days ago somebody should have been in that hangar at midnight taking pictures do you want to move in on him now lewis asked graves shook his head hes got five or six workmen there theres two of us and two in none of us have guns he sighed besides what if they really are mattresses they cant be graves didnt think it possible either but he wasnt willing to take a chance he found himself worrying about wrights new apartment in san diego perhaps this was all a diversion a feint to get him away from the apartment while something important was done there he had no confidence in the men sitting across the street observing and filming like every organization in the world the state department hired mundane men to carry out mundane jobs stationary surveillance was the most mundane if the men werent dull when they started they soon became that way well wait he said the mattresses were taken into the hangar and the limousine was driven inside the doors were closed time twelve fortyone lewis said a minute passed and then something remarkable happened the men came out of the hangar and walked over to the aeroplane they stood alongside it ostensibly checking it over but actually doing nothing at all just waiting wright was not among them i dont get it graves said wheres wright he must still be inside their sedan was parked more than yards from the hangar but the wind was blowing in their direction and they heard a faint mechanical sound a kind of thumping or chugging lewis opened the trunk and took out a directional microphone it looked like a miniature radar antenna a dish two feet in diameter with a central barrel protruding he put on earphones and tuned in the microphone what are you getting lewis shifted the direction of the mike slightly it was quite sensitive but had to be aimed precisely wind can you get that not here he gave graves the earphones graves listened with the microphone aimed directly the mechanical sound was clear it consisted of a low hum with an intermittent pulsing thump sounds like a pump to me he said he listened to the sound for several seconds more what do you make of it a pump lewis said glancing at his watch its been going five minutes now graves turned from the hangar to the aeroplane and the men who were clustered around it they had broken up into small groups of two and three talking quietly occasionally glancing at the hangar george the chauffeur was among them several of the workmen asked george questions george kept shaking his head graves set down his binoculars why would you clear everybody out of the hangar he could think of only one reason wright didnt want them to see what was going on but as he thought about it he saw a second reason that wright was engaged in something very dangerous and wanted the others a safe distance away dangerous how radiation explosives what ten minutes now lewis said graves scratched his head he lit a cigarette and stared at the others by the aeroplane it didnt make sense he thought whatever wright intended it didnt make sense if he didnt want the workmen around he could easily have timed it so that they would be out to lunch instead hed aroused their curiosity theyd talk about this episode for days maybe weeks afterwards apparently wright didnt care about that why not and then as he watched the workmen began walking back to the hangar he had seen no signal but they all moved at once lewis took off the earphones fifteen minuses he said the pumps stopped graves checked his watch it was a few minutes before pm he was beginning to feel tired it had been a long day already starting with the call from phelps at am and the trip to los angeles he tit another cigarette and watched the hangar and then things began to happen very fast the limousine drove out and off towards the entrance to the airfield and a second vehicle emerged from the hangar a moving van it followed the limousine graves got onto the intercom this is you got them got them stay with them if they split up follow the limousine forget the van right are you with us no graves said were staying here he clicked off the microphone and said to lewis i want to look inside that hangar hour el cajon pm pdt it took them three minutes to get to the hangar and by that time it was deserted except for an elderly man who was cleaning up with a long broom there were one or two workmen out by the jet but they paid no attention as graves and lewis went into the hangar the old man waved and leaned on his broom you looking for mr johnson yes graves said just missed him the old man said left a couple minutes ago damn graves said you know where he went no idea the old man said hes a strange one i guess rich people get that way he pointed to a corner of the room i mean look at that he said there were several boxes stacked in the corner now what am i supposed to do with that oh bring in plenty of it says mr johnson and then he doesnt touch it graves looked at the boxes whats in them detergent the old man said gallon jugs of detergent he wanted ten of them dont ask me why he didnt touch them when did he ask for them graves said he walked ever and opened one of the cardboard boxes inside was a jug marked kenall industrial detergent last week wanted to be sure he had them whats this stuff normally used for the old man shrugged and continued sweeping this is an airfield he said we use a lot of it to get grease off parts that stuff will cut anything axle grease anything cuts it right off graves nodded across the hangar lewis was bent over have a look at this he said he pointed to a small plastic bag on the concrete floor dozens of those around the old man said all over the floor when i came in graves picked up the bag sniffed it touched the inside surface there was some kind of milky oily stuff inside hes been getting this place ready for a week the old man said bring in equipment take out equipment new stuff old stuff damnedest thing you ever saw for instance he has this washing machine washing machine sure its still here he pointed to the corner youre probably too young to remember those things graves walked over to it it was an oldfashioned handoperated tub washing machine with two rollers mounted above for a wringer the rollers were operated with a crank beyond the rollers was a long flat tray of highly polished metal graves looked at the manufacturers label westinghouse the year was now what asked the old man does mr johnson want with an old washing machine huh graves began to feel nervous for the first time all day he felt that wright was too far ahead of him that the clues were too subtle that the game was beyond him a washing machine lewis touched the roller assembly i guess you could squeeze out a thin strip of anything on that machine he said assuming it had the right consistency a putty kind of consistency plastic bags on the floor boxes of industrial detergent in the corner ordered but unused and a washing machine then he remembered wheres the pump i dont know lewis said but it doesnt matter look over here he pointed to some equipment near the washing machine a canvas tarp was draped over it he pulled it away spray gun and four cans of paint he bent over black yellow white red he was using the pump to spray paint thatd be my guess lewis said graves looked around the room whatd he spray it onto whatever it was he took it with him wait a minute lewis was again bent over have a look at this he moved another tarp to reveal a full rubber diving wet suit a full face mask that covered eyes nose and mouth and a small air tank one of the three that graves had seen wright purchase earlier in the day there were also several black rubber loops of different sizes just one suit looks like it lewis said he moved the suit with his foot spreading it flat on the floor wrights size roughly but these black loops i counted six lewis said four little ones one big one and one medium what the hell did he use them for the old man came over and stood by them staring down at the rubber suit you ask me he said hes just a crazy man rich people get that way he sighed ten gallons of detergent now what am i going to do with that graves was tense in the car going back to san diego lewis asked him what he was thinking about and he said my psychological tests did they surprise you in a way he didnt bother to explain graves felt the same way about his tests that he did whenever somebody sent him a photograph of himself the question in his mind was is that the way you see me really it was surprising there was nothing new no great discovery but the quality the emhasis could be unsettling it was no news to him that he was competitive hed spent enough late nights playing poker with killers and washington had plenty of lethal poker players mood players who got into nothing but twentydollartnte games to know that he was fiercely competitive he liked to win and he hated to lose that was nothing new the idea of his impulsiveness was not new either he had recognized it in himself but the notion that this impulsiveness could be destructive could get in his way that was new he had never considered it before there was a second problem relating to the psychological tests how had he managed to get them in the first place burnett had been reluctant until graves mentioned something about wright then burnett couldnt move fast enough why the car radio buzzed lewis answered it here this is central do you have mr graves theref hes with me lewis said and handed the mike to graves graves speaking we have a washington call for you hold on please there was a clicking an electronic tone and more clicking listen you son of a bitch i want your information graves recognized the voice as morrison at defence what information he glanced at lewis and lit a cigarette look god damn it we had a shipment stolen last night did you graves kept his voice calm but his heart was thumping wildly yes we did and now somebodys got themselves a halfton of zv gas in binary aerosol cylinders and we want to know who you certainly ought to be concerned graves said but this is an open line screw the open you say it was zv gas graves said youre fucking right isnt that nerve gas you get your ill tell you what graves said you fill out requisition form kl and send it over to us and maybe we can get you the information by the end of the week when he hung up he began to feel better the pieces were beginning to fall together wright was no longer so far ahead was he serious lewis asked completely graves said half a ton of nerve gas was stolen right graves said the radio buzzed again graves answered it where are you this is phelps i know who it is im going west on route five from el cajon do you have wright with you no youve made a terrible mistake phelps said binary slash is i know what it is graves said i doubt that phelps said im at the westgate plaza hotel room how fast can you get here fifteen minutes be here in ten phelps said i have somebody you better meet is it wright graves asked but phelps had already hung up the westgate plaza was one of the three greatest hotels in the world if you believed esquire magazine if you didnt it was a pretentious modern dump decorated with a lot of phoney statuary in the lobby and downstairs lounge walking past statues of winged mercury and diana hunting graves took the elevator to room phelps answered the door and said the poker game is over i just ordered them to arrest wright graves said may i come in he was not really concerned he knew the limousine and the furniture van were still en route back to the city there was time to countermand the order come in phelps said as graves entered he said this is dr nordmann from ucsd graves had never seen nordmann before though he knew who he was he was a biologist on the faculty of the university of california at san diego and he was on the presidents advisory council on something or other and he was a strongly vocal opponent of chemical and biological weapons he had been influential in getting nixon to disavow biologicals in november he was reportedly still pushing for a similar disavowal on chemicals nordmann was a tall and ungainly man with a sour expression graves wondered if it was permanent or special for the occasion nordmann shook hands and said with some distate are you in state intelligence too yes graves said but were not all the same phelps gave him a sharp look well im not very clear on the reason for this briefing nordmann said but i brought the film good phelps said theres a projector in the bedroom as they went into the bedroom they passed the tv graves paused to watch it was a demonstration in the convention hall a spontaneous demonstration for the president who stood on the podium smiling waving his arms giving the v sign with both hands theres very little time phelps said graves went into the bedroom drapes and shades had been drawn and it was quite dark graves sat on the bed phelps took a chair nordmann stood in front of the small projection screen which was mounted above the bedroom dresser he said to phelps where should i begin just give us necessary background for the film nordman nodded looking sourer than ever distantly in the background they could hear the chanting of the delegates on the livingroom tv we want the president we want the president you will be seeing nordmann said the final product of more than half a century of research in chemical warfare the official date for the start of chemical war is april nd when the germans launched an attack with chlorine gas it was a primitive business you sat in your trench opened a canister of gas and hoped the wind would blow it towards the enemy if it didnt you were in trouble a lot of improvements if thats the word came in the course of the first world war gas bombs and better agents mustard gas nitrogen mustard and lewisite all oily liquids that burn and blister your skin they could kill you too but not very efficiently nordmann paused second world war a new advance again from the germans remember the germans were the best chemists in the world for most of the twentieth century in they synthesized a complex organophosphorous ester called tabun it was a nerve gas it would kill anybody who breathed enough of it all later developments sarin soman gb vx and zv are just refinements within this basic class of chemical compounds its called nerve gas nordmann said because it kills by interfering with transmission of nerve impulses nerves work electrically but the impulses jump from nerve cell to nerve cell across gaps called synapses by chemical means nerve gases such as tabun sarin and zv interfere with that jumping process the result is difficulty in breathing respiratory paralysis and death now lets talk about potency graves lit a cigarette and glanced at phelps phelps was smiling nodding his head as nordmann talked faintly from the tv they heard hes our man hes our man hes our man and loud cheers tabun and sarin nordmann said or the american gas gb must be inhaled to kill therefore gas masks provide an adequate defence these gases are also relatively weak theyre not produced any more but there is another family of gases like vx which can kill by absorption through the skin as well as by inhalation the smallest fraction of an ounce is lethal am i clear youre clear graves said vx is terribly powerful nordmann said the lethal dose is estimated to be between two and ten milligrammes or a few thousandths of an ounce but powerful as that is its nothing compared to zv zv like vx is an oil its sticky it clings to things it hangs around the environment but a tenth of a milligramme is a lethal dose in other words its about a hundred times as powerful as vx were now talking about extraordinary potency phelps was still smiling still nodding graves felt very cold it is so potent that it has never been manufactured as a single gas instead its a binary that is its produced as two separate gases each harmless by itself but when they mix theyre deadly the gases are designated binary and binary respectively theyre generally stored in yellow and black tanks the film you are going to see is a french army training film showing the effects of zv on a condemned prisoner phelps got up and turned on the projector on the screen they saw a man in denim clothing standing in an enclosed room the man was looking around nervously this subject nordmann said is going to be exposed to the ld dose of the gas that is five tenths of a milligramme it is a fully lethal dose faintly from the other room they heard my fellow americans it is with great pleasure that i at the bottom of the screen appeared the words gas introduced the prisoner did not react moments later gas introduced the prisoner responded instantly he placed his hand on his chest coughed and wiped his nose join you in this great tradition this reaffirmation of the democratic process on the screen early stages running nose chest tightness dimness of vision and i must urge you to follow the vision of our great land to seek the promise to fulfil the expectations let me make one thing perfectly clear will somebody shut that door graves said on the screen the prisoner appeared in closeup his nose was running profusely the liquid dripped down to his shirt his eyes were hard black dots pinpoint pupils a fullbody shot showed the man bent over in evident pain middle stages cramps and nausea the prisoner vomited explosively and the caption stated unnecessarily vomiting very faint now from the livingroom they heard the sound of prolonged applause on the screen the prisoner was clearly confused and in great pain a dark stain appeared on his trousers involuntary urination the man staggered and leaned against the wall his legs and arms twitched and jerked spastically staggering the prisoner looked around briefly but his face was contorted in agony he lost his balance and fell twitching and jerking to the floor the camera panned down to follow him from the other room the applause continued drowsiness the man was not really awake he lifted his head from the floor in short jerks and finally flopped down not moving coma the camera remained on the man his chest was still moving slightly then it stopped cessation of breathing a moment later death the screen faded to dark and the last letters appeared time from introduction of binary gas to death minutes the film ran out the screen was white phelps turned the room lights back on jesus christ graves said he lit a cigarette and noticed that his hands were shaking as i said that man received five times the minimum lethal dose nordmann said quietly had he got less he would still have died more slowly how much more slowly from tests on animals it may take as long as an hour or two that same progression the very same jesus christ graves said again he walked back into the livingroom which seemed glaringly bright through the windows he could look out over the downtown area of the city he stood with his back to the television and listened to the familiar voice saying my fellow americans and my fellow republicans we have come to a momentous time for our nation we face great problems and we face great challenges we must act now to the set abruptly clicked off graves turned and saw that phelps had done it i hope you understand now phelps said wright has half a ton of that gas in the san diego area there are a million people plus some very distinguished visitors we cant afford catandmouse games any longer i agree graves said staring out at the street below there were no trees he wondered why they hadnt put any trees in downtown san diego trees made a difference behind him phelps picked up the telephone and dialled a number he said phelps here i want there was a pause nordmann came over to stand by graves and look down at the street you know he said i told the army four years ago if they kept transporting this crap all around it was only a matter of time before somebody you have phelps said into the phone his voice was excited where graves turned phelps was nodding his head bobbing up and down like a mechanical bird yes yes yes good work well be there in five minutes he hung up and turned to graves followed the limousine back to wrights old apartment house the van split off and went somewhere else but the limo went back to avenue b and they arrested john wright as he stepped from his car graves nodded and tried to feel the same excitement that phelps so clearly showed but he still had a nagging sense of defeat as if he had cheated at the game or had quit too early come on phelps said you can introduce him to me at the apartment house two men were standing up facing the wall guarded by the men from car phelps and graves hurried over one of the men was george the chauffeur he was muttering something under his breath wright was beside him neatly dressed in his englishcut suit graves said you can let them turn around now he glanced at phelps who had a look of total triumph on his face george turned and looked at graves uncomprehendingly then wright turned and it was graves who stared this isnt john wright he said what do you mean phelps demanded ive never seen this man before graves said he isnt wright i we checked the wallet one of the men said he has his identification i dont give a damn about identification graves said this man isnt john wright the man in the english suit smirked slightly who the hell is he phelps said that graves said is the least important question we have to answer and he ran for his car hour san diego pm pdt take it easy phelps said grabbing the door handle graves took the turn from b onto third very fast tyres squealing for christs sake you said it yourself graves said a million people but we have him we know the plot we know how its going together we may not be able to stop it graves said not stop it what are you talking about graves raced down third weaving among the traffic he ran the light at laurel phelps made a gurgling noise wright has been ahead of us all along graves said he must have switched clothes in the airfield hangar and sent somebody else back to san diego in the limousine he himself went with the furniture van well if you know where he is now i know where he is graves said but it may be too late to stop him how can it be too late phelps said graves didnt answer with a squeal of tyres he continued uptown then turned down the wrong way on alameda street cars honked at him he pulled over to the kerb on the wrong side facing the wrong way in front of afire hydrant phelps didnt complain he didnt have time graves was already out of the car and running for the building opposite wrights new apartment house in front of wrights building was the furniture van all the men in the room were clustered around the cameras and binoculars at the window graves burst in and said is wright theref i dont know one of the men said we heard he was arrested but somebody in there sure looks like let me see graves bent over a pair of binoculars it took only a moment to confirm his worst fears wright was there donning another rubber wet suit he was pulling rubber loops onto his ankles his wrists his waist and his neck of course those strips six strips protected the seams of his suit from gas as he watched wright put on a full face mask and twisted the valve on the small yellow air tank the other men in the room cleared out whats he doing phelps said watching through another pair of binoculars graves looked around wrights room the four sawhorses were still in position across them lay two cylinders each about eight feet long one was painted black the other yellow there were stencilled letters on their sides as he watched wright began connecting hoses from each of the tanks to a central t valve which joined the hoses into a common outlet then he turned his attention to other equipment in the room well thats it phelps said lets go get him youre joking graves said not at all phelps said we know hes there weve seen him connect up the hoses so that he can phelps broke off and stared at graves exactly graves said but this is terriblev its not terrible its just a fact graves said theres no way we can break into that room fast enough to get control before he turns on the valves and releases the gas if we go in shooting you risk puncturing the tanks well we cant just sit here and watch phelps said graves lit a cigarette at the moment there isnt much else we can do phelps set down his binoculars his face was twisted the earlier look of triumph was completely gone do you have another cigarette he said graves gave him one and then went to the phone morrison here this is graves weve found your tanks listen you better tell us theyre on alameda street in san diego san diego i want you to get me some people from the navy chemical corps i dont care where you find them or what you do to get them just have them here in an hour make sure some of them have gasprotective clothing and make sure at least one of them knows a hell of a lot about this binary gas graves gave him the address and hung up he glanced over at phelps who was sitting in a corner has somebody notified the president the president of the united states graves said i assume so lets not assume graves said use the other phone and he pointed to a phone near phelps graves started to dial another call i dont know how to get him phelps said in a plaintive voice use the prestige of your office graves said and turned away dr nordmanns office this is mr graves from the state department i want to speak to dr nordmann dr nordmann had a luncheon conference and is not back yet when do you expect him well not for several hours he has a faculty meeting at two thirty to discuss phd candidates and find him graves said and tell him to call me tell him its about binary slash heres my number he gave it to the secretary when he hung up one of the men at the window said look what hes doing now graves peered through the binoculars he saw that wright had removed his rubber suit and was now attaching wires to the floor of the room to the ceiling to the walls he plugged the wires into a central metal box the size of a shoe box what the hell is that box graves said in a corner of the room phelps was saying yes thats right thats what im telling you yes a halfton of nerve gas of course its not a joke graves saw wright attach two small mechanical devices to the valves of the two tanks then he ran more wires back to the box finally he stacked a second metal unit on top of the original box and connected still more wires then wright looked at his watch well somebody better get through to him phelps was saying yes im sure its hard what time is it graves said two forty the gas is called zv phelps was saying an army shipment was stolen in utah during the early hours this morning hes probably already been informed well god damn it i dont care if you dont know anything about it he does yes its here one of the men at the window said he must be insane of course graves said youd have to be insane to wipe out a million people and one whole political party but the fact is that weve really been lucky lucky just see that he gets the message phelps said sure graves said those army shipments have been going on for years theyre sitting ducks anybody with a little money a little intelligence and a screw loose somewhere could arrange for a steal look richard speck knocked off eight nurses but he was an incompetent charles whitman was an expert rifleman and cu that basis could knock off seventeen people john wright is highly intelligent and very wealthy hes going to go for a million people and one american president and thanks to the us army he has a chance of succeeding i dont see how you can blame the army you dont graves asked he watched the other apartment through the binoculars his eyes felt the strain his vision blurred intermittently and he swore wright appeared to be fooling with the two metal boxes in the centre of the floor he had been adjusting them for a long time graves wasnt sure what it all meant it was a control or alarm system of some kind though that much was clear and if it was a control system it required power power as graves watched he had an idea one possible way to beat the system that wright was so carefully setting up a chance a slim chance do it he whispered watching wright do it do do what phelps asked he was off the telephone now graves did not answer wright had finished with the boxes he turned some dials made some final adjustments then he took the main plug in his hand hes going to do it graves said and he plugged it into the wall socket very plainly very clearly he plugged it into the wall hes done it done what phelps said angry now hes connected his device to the apartment electricity so thats a mistake graves said he should have used a battery unit because we can turn off the electricity in that apartment graves said remotely oh phelps said and then he smiled thats good thinking graves said nothing his mind raced forward in exhilarating high gear for the first time all day he felt that he was not only keeping abreast of wright but actually moving a few steps ahead it was a marvellous feeling time two fiftyone and then as he watched wright did something very peculiar he placed a small white box alongside the two other metal boxes and he closed the windows to the apartment then he taped the joints and seams of the windows shut then he left what the hell does all that mean somebody asked i dont know graves said but i know how we can find out hour san diego pm ptd wright emerged from the apartment house lobby wearing a grey suit he carried a raincoat over his shoulder graves was waiting for him along with two federal marshals carrying drawn guns wright did not look surprised he smiled and said did your son like his gift mr graves before graves could reply one of the marshals had spun wright around saying gruffly up against the wall hands wide stand still and you wont get hurt gentlemen wright said in an offended voice he looked at graves over his shoulder i dont think any of this is necessary mr graves knows what he is looking for yes i do graves said he had already noticed the raincoat nobody carried a raincoat in san diego in august it was as out of place as a bible in a whorehouse but i want to know what time it leaves theres only one possible flight today wright said connexions in miami leaves san diego at four thirty the marshal took wrights shoulder wallet and handed it to graves the ticket was inside san diego to los angeles to miami to montego bay jamaica the ticket was made out to mr a johnson may i turn around now wright asked shut up the marshal said let him turn around graves said wright turned rubbing the grit of the wall from his hands he smiled at graves your move in the smile and the slight nod of the head graves got a chilling sense of the profound insanity of the man the eyes gave it away wrights eyes were genuinely amused a clever chess player teasing an inferior opponent but this wasnt chess not really not with stakes like these death in minutes graves thought and he had a mental image of the prisoner twisting and writhing on the floor liquid running from his nose in a continuous stream vomit spewing out graves realized then that he had mistaken his opponent for too long wright was insane he was capable of anything it produced a churning sensation in graves stomach tape him inside graves said to the marshal i want to talk to him the three of them sat in the lobby of the apartment building it was the kind of lobby that aspired to look like the grossest miami beach hotels there were plastic palms in plastic pots and fake louis xiv furniture which apparently out of fear that someone would want to steal it was bolted to the imitation marble floor under other circumstances the artificiality of the surroundings would have annoyed graves but now it somehow seemed appropriate by implication the room suggested that falsehoods were acceptable even preferable to the truth graves sat in a chair facing wright the marshal sat diagonally facing both of them and the only exit the marshal held his gun loosely in his lap wright looked at the marshal and the position of the gun thats what its all about he said and smiled again that insane smile how do you mean graves said wright sighed patiently do i confuse you of course that was your intention i doubt that ive confused you much wright said youve really done very well mr graves may i call you john the condescending tone was unmistakable but graves merely shrugged he glanced at his watch very well indeed wright continued for the last month or so john ive had the feeling that you were a worthy adversary i cant tell you how reassuring that was reassuring i prefer to do things well he said he took a slim cigar from a gunmetal case and lit it i mean elegantly with a certain finesse in a situation like this one needs a proper opponent i was immensely reassured that my opponent was you john wright sighed of course i have another opponent as well he said one totally lacking in finesse elegance and grace the sad thing is he thinks hes a statesman you mean the president i prefer to think of him wright said as that man who rode the bench for so many years why did he ride the bench did you ever think of that the answer is simple enough because he wasnt a good player he was inept he was incompetent he was a bumbling fool you feel strongly about him i feel strongly about his policies china ten years ago wright said if i asked you the name of the american president most likely to institute wage and price controls welfare reform and diplomatic relations with communist china would you have ever thought of this man its insane what hes doing what about what youre doing somebody has to stop him wright said its as simple as that i wouldnt call nerve gas a democratic method graves stared at him what are those metal boxes in the centre of the floor upstairs wright smiled enough politics eh he puffed on his cigar billowing light smoke very well down to business a thought seemed to occur to him but if i tell you how will you know its the truth thats my job true true there are actually three boxes as im sure you observed from your surveillance station across the street i had to get an extension cord in order to place the boxes in clear view of the window very thoughtful i felt youd appreciate it wright said the first box is a timer it controls a rather intricate set of staging sequences for the equipment in the room graves took out a cigarette his hands shook slightly as he lit it he hoped wright wouldnt notice but that of course was wishful thinking wright would notice but wright didnt comment on it the second box he said is an impedance and vibration sensor there are contact points located around the room on the door on the floor on the walls any excessive vibration for example a man walking on the floor of the room will set off the gas its a commercial unit i bought it last week he smiled then a friend made the purchase so that you wouldnt be aware of it the third box the third box is the little white unit alongside the other boxes its a battery we wouldnt want to be dependent on electricity in the apartment after all you could turn that off remotely graves had a sinking feeling and it must have showed because wright laughed oh you were planning to do that were you he shook his head too simple much too simple i wouldnt make a mistake like that whats the voltage of the batteries graves snapped trying to regain control of the situation a very intelligent question wright said i am tempted to lie but i wont it is a twelvevolt unit amperage i havent the faintest idea that doesnt concern you the amperage is adequate adequate for what wright smiled really he said you dont expect me to hand you everything on a silver platter actually i do then youre being naive how do you expect to extract information from me he glanced at his watch there is not a lot of time and although i am sure you could torture me inventively you couldnt get me to talk not fast enough why did you close the apartment windows wright smiled fascinating i was wondering if youd catch that i taped them too yes you did i closed the windows wright said because the mechanism in that room anticipates some action you will take some action i will take yes youre being cryptic i can afford to be cryptic whats the point of the scintillation counter an interesting problem but not so interesting as the explosives graves tried to keep his face blank but it didnt work ah wright said you dont know about the explosives there was a robbery of twenty pounds of plastic explosive compound c i believe its called earlier today on the freeway a hijacked truck im surprised you havent already been informed graves was beginning to sweat he resisted the impulse to wipe his forehead he sat back in his chair and tried to be calm you seem nervous wright said concerned there is no need to be nervous wright said i can assure you right now it is impossible for you to get into that room alive i dont advise you to try you seem quite nonchalant oh i am he turned the cigar in his mouth removed it stared at the burning tip we can hold you of course you mean prevent me from leaving san diego yes id expect that you dont care not particularly but youll die graves said a great many people will die in fact wright said and his eyes glowed with a sudden mad intensity you may have noticed that weather conditions are perfect there is an inversion layer over the city any released gases will be blown west across the city and will be trapped there do you know much about meteorology a little you know wright said its a funny thing about chemical agents the military makes them but they dont have much military use by their very nature they work best in high population density situations and that means civilian populations thats where you get the most bangs for your buck so to speak his eyes literally sparkled as he talked but the irony goes even farther he said modern city life improves the effectiveness of these weapons you can imagine a city like san diego as existing with a giant plastic dome over it thats the inversion layer it blankets the area holds in all the automobile fumes and exhaust gases that make city air so obnoxious that inversion layer will hold any released gas or in the case of zv oil droplet suspension graves snapped his fingers the detergent yes wright said good for you the detergent was ordered in case i had an accident in the hangar have to cut that oil somehow detergent was the best way but he said i didnt have an accident nothing went wrong at that moment phelps stuck his head in the door nordmanns here all right graves said wright looked appreciative good move he said nordmanns an excellent man in fact it was one of his articles detailed scholarly and complete that suggested to me the possibility of stealing some gas in the first place again there was that glow in wrights eyes graves found himself getting angry he stood up abruptly dont let him go anywhere he said o the marshal i wouldnt think of it until ive finished my cigar wright said graves left the lobby nordmann was outside standing on the sidewalk with phelps they were both looking up talking graves said the gas is up there is there any antidote to zv nothing very good but there is an antidote theres a sort of theoretical antidote if a person has a mild exposure it may be possible to inject chemicals to block the effects of the gas can you get those chemicals yes but not in sufficient quantities to protect very many get as much as you can graves said do it immediately he turned to phelps notify the san diego police evacuate this block and cordon it off cordon off the blocks on both sides as well and i mean a cordon nobody in and nobody out he paused what happened with the president hes leaving within the hour for sure i assume so better check again phelps nodded towards the lobby is he talking hes saying what he wants to say graves said my god hes a cool customer what did you expect graves said and went back inside when he returned he found the marshal smoking one of wrights slim cigars graves shot him a look the marshal quickly stubbed it out waste of a good cigar wright said why cant we all be friends graves sat down what did you paint in the hangar paint amp yes we found a spray gun and several cans of paint oh that what did you paint i dont believe ill answer that what did you paint you show a certain redundancy of mind wright said its tiresome and disappointing i expected you to be more clever he was silent a moment i will tell you one thing he said whats that graves resented the eagerness that he heard in his own voice i have devised a multiple staging system actually several interlocking systems if one fails or is thwarted another takes over its quite beyond you i can assure you of that however i will tell you i am dependent on one external system which is fortunately quite reliable whats that you wright said everything has been designed especially for you so to speak wrights calmness was infuriating graves bit his lip trying to control his anger what time is it wright asked three forty the marshal said thank you do you have any other questions john one or two graves said his anger was so intense that it clouded his judgement he fought the feeling i can see youre upset wright said and you havent asked me some rather obvious questions one is when will the gas go off graves stared at him almost shaking with fury the answer wright said is five pm exactly the gas will go off then it will begin to drift in a predictable way and will have blanketed the city with good saturation by about five thirty the peak of the rush hour maximum number of people on the streets and so on now it seems to me there was something else i wanted to tell you graves wanted to beat the man to a pulp he wanted to smash his face to shatter his nose his teeth he had a brief image of himself standing over wright pounding him damn wright said it was just on the tip of my tongue well no matter it couldnt have been that important he sighed i think he said this concludes the questions for today i have nothing else to say graves stared at him for a moment you dont leave us much choice wright smiled i believe you call it softening up is that right more or less an interesting notion wright said but now i must leave and with astonishing speed he jumped from his chair and raced for the door the marshal crouched down and held his gun stiffly dont graves shouted and knocked the pistol away the marshal looked stunnl d dont shoot him wright was out the door a second marshal stood outside he wore a look of surprise as wright slammed him in the groin with one knee he doubled over wright sprinted for the stairs to the basement hes going for the garage graves said he pushed the other marshal towards the door to the basement and then ran outside phelps was directing a halfdozen marshals and policemen to cordon off the area wrights escaped graves shouted he ran down the street looking for the underground garage exit where the garage can he get out the marshals and police all drew their guns a single shot echoed inside the garage how did this happen phelps demanded graves looked at the marshals and the cops standing by the ramp from the garage dont shoot him he said whatever happens dont shoot him there was a long silence nothing further was heard from inside the garage i demand to know what happened phelps said graves listened nothing the cops looked at each other hey a cop shouted from the garage he went out the other exit graves instantly realized that he had made a mistake wright was too smart to think he could escape from the garage of this building he would have another plan graves started to run so did the police whered he go next building other block graves sprinted down the ramp into the garage and towards the other garage exit he ran up a short flight of stairs through an open door and came out into an alley the alley connected with the opposite block he ran down it the cops following their footsteps echoing they saw no one whered he go graves held up his hand everyone paused they heard the sound of an engine it was coming from the garage of a building on the adjacent block wheres the exit from that garage graves ran forward the exit must be on the street they came out into the next street deserted heavily cordoned off at each end with a police car crosswise blocking the road cops standing around the sound of a racing engine they saw a ramp dont sh wrights alfa came up the ramp moving very fast the cops and marshals scrambled out of the way they fired as they ran graves felt sick but the alfa was still going it made a twisting righthand turn slamming into a parked car there were more gunshots the side windows shattered into great spiderwebs but somehow the car continued gears grinding as it raced down the street wright had planned it well graves thought he would have made his escape by sneaking through the buildings if it hadnt been for the roadblock he didnt expect that graves himself had ordered it on the spur of the moment the alfa roared down the street he wasnt expecting the roadblock graves said he didnt count on that whose side are you on phelps demanded at the end of the street four policemen waited by the parked patrol car as the alfa bore down on themthey dropped to their knees holding their guns stiffarmed before them dont shoot graves screamed the cops began to fire the tyres on the alfa exploded the front windshield shattered the car wobbled flipped on its side and slammed into a parked car the horn began to blare graves ran over to the alfa and tried to open the door it was jammed shut he looked in through the shattered windscreen and saw wrights face a bloody pulp the features indistinguishable as he watched a tiny stream of blood spurted rhythmically from wrights neck then it became a seeping red stain across his collar he turned away from the car is he dead phelps said running up yes graves said hes dead how can we turn off that fucking horn phelps said graves stared at him and walked away hour san diego pm pdt his sense of shock was profound of all the alternatives of all the possibilities and options he had never expected this he had never expected wright to die graves walked back up the street slowly trying to gather his thoughts what did he do next nordmann came up to him thats a damned shame he said you bet it is graves said nordmann looked at the crowd clustered around the wrecked car one thing though he said whats that it proves he could make a mistake it was a big one graves said yes nordmann said in a calm logical voice but it was a mistake graves nodded and walked back towards the surveillance building he thought about what nordmann had said the more he thought about it the more encouraged he was because nordmann was right wright had erred and that was encouraging one of the aides came running out of the building waving wrights ticket mr graves he said theres something very strange going on we just checked this ticket he cancelled that reservation yesterday protect me from fools graves thought of course he did of course look graves said he planned to let us catch him and he planned his escape but he couldnt get far if we knew his real aeroplane reservation could he well i guess not keep checking the airlines check los angeles too youll find he had a reservation somewhere phelps came over the sniffers arrived has it good graves walked across the street to wrights apartment building phelps trailed behind him in silence finally phelps said i hope you know what youre doing graves didnt answer because the fact was that he didnt know what he was doing he knew only in a general way what wright intended wright had made graves a part of the total mechanism and therefore graves would have to cancel himself out inactivate himself by not doing what was expected of him in order to do that he had to decipher as many elements of the total staging mechanism as possible only then could he determine how he was intended to participate in the staging sequence that controlled the final release of the gas the sniffer was the first step in deciphering the sequence graves stood outside the door to wrights apartment next to him lewis held a gunlike instrument in his hand the gun was attached to a shoulder pack with a dial lewis pointed the instrument at the door and ran it along the cracks and seams behind them at the far end of the hallway six people including phelps stood and watched graves wanted everyone away from the door so that they wouldnt accidentally trip the vibration sensors he didnt know how sensitively they were tuned but he wasnt taking any chances after a moment lewis turned away with the instrument wow he said you get a reading yeah he said high nitrogen and oxygen content trace phosphorus meaning plastic explosive very near near the door probably just on the other side he said graves said is there any chance youre wrong the sniffer is never wrong he said youve got oxide of nitrogen fumes and thats explosives you can count on it all right graves said he walked away from the door he had to trust the sniffer it had been developed for use in vietnam and had been adapted for customs operations smuggling and so on it was incredibly sensitive and incredibly accurate if the sniffer said plastic explosive was behind the door he had to believe it he walked back to phelps at the end of the hallway well theres explosive on the other side of the door nice phelps said what do we do now try to get a better look inside the apartment graves said he glanced at his watch its four ten phelps said when did your friend say it would go off five graves said i hope you know what youre doing phelps said again graves sighed he wondered if he could ever explain to phelps that that wasnt the problem the problem was figuring out what wright expected him to do and then not doing it across the street in the surveillance room looking down on wrights apartment he talked to nordmann nordmann had brought a cardboard box full of medical supplies syringes needles bottles of liquid he was frowning down at it this is the best i could manage on short notice he said will it work graves said its the standard therapy nordmann said but we havent got much this quantity will treat two or three people for exposure thats all then lets make sure it doesnt come to that nordmann smiled slightly it better not he said because you need somebody alive and well to administer it is it hard to administer tricky nordmann said there are two different chemicals atropine and parladoxime they have to be balanced graves sighed so the antidote is a binary too in a sense the two chemicals treat different effects of the gas one treats the peripheral nervous system the other the central the chemicals are dangerous in themselves which makes it all much harder fighting fire with fire in a sense nordmann said the two men stood staring out the window at the apartment opposite phelps was in a corner using a walkietalkie you in position a response crackled back in position sir very good phelps clicked off the walkietalkie weve got two cops stationed outside the door to that apartment he said fine graves said just so they dont get too close to the door i have them ten feet away that should be fine in the hallway outside wrights apartment officers martin and jencks of the san diego police department stared at the closed door and leaned against the wall you understand any of this jencks said nope martin said but they said not to get too close to the door thats right you know why i dont know nothing martin said he took out a cigarette you got a match maybe we shouldnt smoke whos going to know martin said jencks gave him a match graves stood with nordmann in the surveillance room across the street wright boobytrapped the apartment elaborately graves said he told me some of it im sure he didnt tell me everything and it goes off at five yes fortyfive minutes from now nordmann said is the navy sending people with protective suits because protected people could just walk right in nobody can walk right in graves said hes wired the room with explosive thats why weve got the guards over there nordmann grimaced explosive twenty pounds of it the tv in the corner of the room showed the convention a monotonous voice was saying mr chairman mr chairman we request the floor mr chairman there was the loud banging of a gavel turn that damned thing off graves said someone turned it off at the window two men grunted as they lifted a huge lens onto a heavyduty tripod it was screwed into place and adjusted ready mr graves thank you graves went to the window whats that nordmann said a fifteenhundredmillimeter telephoto graves said its the best look we can get he peered through the giant lens the view was so enormously magnified that at first he didnt know what he was looking at using a fineknurled knob he moved the lens and saw he was focused on a crack in the floor he moved across the floor to the boxes he shifted the lens upward examining each box in detail take a look at this he said stepping away nordmann squinted through the lens three stacked boxes he said i cant make out much neither can l graves folded his arms across his chest and stared out the window he tried to think logically but he was having trouble wrights death had unnerved him whether he wanted to admit it or not and the system seemed so complicated staging sequences timers vibration sensors explosives his head ached how the hell would he unravel it lets work it backward nordmann said whats the most important element in the system the gas how is it controlled there are springloaded valve mechanisms they can be tripped by a solenoid and they presumably have a timer of some kind presumably batterypowered or linepowered well hes plugged one of the boxes into the wall but the valve mechanisms are probably batterypowered nordmann nodded that makes sense he said he wouldnt have the most important elements dependent on an external system so what did he plug into the wall i dont know vibration sensors maybe graves said he looked at his watch it was he would have to move soon what had wright expected him to do the psychological report was folded up in his pocket he took it out and looked at the last few lines if there are any defects or hidden flaws in his behaviour they are his impulsiveness and his desire to finish a test situation rapidly well he didnt have much choice now he was going to have to make a move and soon you know nordmann said thoughtfully most of the equipment in that room is defensive its designed to keep people out of there until the gas is ready to be released but i suspect some of those defences are meant to be penetrated i agree graves said and in any case we have to start penetrating wall current first nordmann asked graves nodded he glanced at phelps who was sitting in a corner of the room literally chewing his nails graves sent lewis across the street to disconnect power to the apartment four minutes later the power was off graves watched through the big telephoto lens he saw a single yellow pilot light in the vibration sensor box go out well nordmann said thats a start weve killed part of the system have we graves said he watched through the telephoto as the solenoid mechanism tripped open the tank valves then a moment later tripped them shut the apartment became filled with whitish gas whats happening phelps said very agitated quick graves said those cops tell the cops what cops phelps said officer martin finished his cigarette and ground it out on the floor his heel squeaked sssh jencks said suddenly tense what is it sssssh listen the two men listened in silence there was a hissing you hear that jencks said yeah its coming from the room are you sure martin moved closer to the door i think so maybe you shouldnt martin began to cough his nose ran shit he said what is this he coughed again jencks went forward to help him then jencks felt the stinging in his nostrils and the liquid began to pour over his shirt he didnt know a nose could run that way his eyes ached and stung he felt dizzy what the hell he had a coughing fit the walkietalkie crackled this is phelps a voice said over martin took a step towards the walkietalkie and fell to the floor now he could see the faint wispy whiteness seeping through the door this is phelps over jencks was coughing loudly and groaning martin stretched out his hand towards the walkietalkie he was weak his arm trembled then without warning he vomited and lost consciousness im not getting an answer phelps said graves and nordmann exchanged glances then looked back out the window at the opposite apartment the room now had a faint milky haze are they dead phelps said probably how can you just stand theref because graves said it was just a short burst the valves are turned off again phelps looked puzzled it wasnt a full release graves said its just a partial release to fill the room with gas thats why wright carefully closed the windows now we really cant get in there you sound so appreciative phelps said im not but we understand now what wright meant by a complex staging sequence god damn it this is not a jigsaw puzzle two cops have died and were all right nordmann said quietly until five pm and what do you intend to do between now and then phelps demanded angrily im going to call the navy he said their men were supposed to be here an hour ago its four thirty now graves stared at the gasfilled apartment he had a brief mental image of the two cops staggering drunkenly in the hallway he pushed it away he could consider it later beside him nordmann said its really quite clever graves said how thick is the gas in that room hard to say nordmann said the normal colour of the gas is white i dont think the density is very great why if you shot me full of those antidotes could i survive the atmosphere in that room i dont know would i have a chance a chance of course but even if you could survive how would you get in you said yourself its wired with explosives you cant go in the front door i wasnt thinking of the door graves said i was thinking of the window the window nordmann frowned i dont know graves looked down at the street below where an ambulance had pulled alongside the wrecked alfa a halfdozen cops and orderlies were trying to open the door but it was still jammed shut damn he said i wish he were still alive it probably wouldnt matter nordmann said absently he was staring across at the other building graves said how good are my chances with the antidote four thirtyfive somebody said maybe one in two nordmann said at best all right lets do it are you sure what choice do i have nordmann considered this then nodded sit down he said ill fix a syringe he quickly filled a syringe with two solutions one pale yellow the other clear graves sat and watched him how do i take it intravenously you mean in the vein yes i cant possibly shoot into my veins you can nordmann said if i tape on an iv line roll up your sleeve graves rolled up his sleeve and nordmann tied a rubber tourniquet around his arm he slapped the veins to make them stand out then he turned back to the syringe i hope ive got this mixture right he said he tapped the bubbles of air out of the syringe so do i graves said nordmann attached the syringe to a piece of flexible plastic tubing at the end of the tubing was a needle ill put the needle into your vein he said and tape the syringe to your arm just before you enter the room you can inject the contents graves felt the coldness of alcohol on his forearm and then the prick of the needle dont move nordmann said let me tape it down he removed the tourniquet applied the tape and stepped back done graves looked at the equipment taped to his arm you sure this will work i told you the odds nordmann said graves stood up okay he said time four thirtynine lets go he said and ran for the elevator they came to the street and ran outside by his side nordmann was puffing red in the face graves felt no strain at all he was tense and full of energy rope he shouted to a cop we need rope the cop went off to get some hurry the cop hurried graves looked at nordmann listen he said i just had a thought the gas leaked out of the nineteenth floor and killed those two cops right right whats to prevent us from getting knocked off in the elevator as we go up to the twentieth floor nothing nordmann said its a risk we have to take if enough gas has leaked back into the building we may die on our way up is that all you have to say nordmann shrugged thats the situation two burly cops came over one had a coil of white nylon rope over his shoulder come with us graves said and he ran with nordmann into the apartment building the elevator creaked up slowly graves fidgeted nordmann seemed very calm the two cops looked at each other obviously not understanding what was going on they stared suspiciously at the syringe taped to graves arm they passed the tenth floor listen graves said i had another thought zv is an oil right yes well when i get into that room all the surfaces will be coated with oil and deadly right probably not nordmann said it takes time for the droplets to settle if the room is cleared of gas fast enough the surfaces should be safe you sure im not sure about anything they passed the fifteenth floor graves resisted the impulse to hold his breath he looked at nordmann nordmann crossed his fingers seventeenth floor eighteenth floor nineteenth floor graves waited for the gas to hit him but nothing happened they came to the twentieth and the doors opened we made it he said so far nordmann said they hurried down the corridor time four fortytwo one of the cops said they came to apartment the one directly above wrights the building had been evacuated and the door was locked the two policemen threw themselves at the door it didnt move they tried again without success nordmann went hurrying down the hallway and returned with a fire axe he swung once at the door the axe barely bit into the wood let me do that one of the cops said and swung hard near the lock knock it down knock it down graves said it took time there was no easy crash and splintering the wood was new and strong and thick finally the cop managed to bash a hole large enough to admit his hand he reached in and turned the lock the door swung open and they came into an apartment that was all chintz and doilies and heavy furniture graves went directly to the window and flung it open he looked out and down feeling the hot gusty august wind he was sweating hard one of the cops tied the nylon rope around his waist tell me what i do graves said to nordmann and pointed to the syringe okay nordmann said you press that syringe to give yourself an injection of the antidote you can push the plunger this far he touched the side of the syringe and be safe more than that and you will suffer effects similar to the gas itself clear christ graves said the cop cinched the rope tight around his waist remember nordmann said that youre counteracting the effects of the gas and you must pay out antidote in relation to your exposure to the toxin clear what happens if i undershoot thats worse than overshooting its better to give yourself too much than too little but not too much too much when do i begin to inject just before your exposure to the gas if youre exposed before injecting youll have only five or ten seconds of clear consciousness so do it before four fortyfive one of the cops said graves swung one leg over the window ledge you afraid of heights nordmann asked terrified graves said good luck nordmann said as graves crawled completely over the sill and hung there for a moment with his hands weve got you one of the cops said graves let go and began his descent down the face of the building he tried to balance himself against the stone wall it was remarkable how dirty the outside of an apartment building could be his fingers scraped over a crust of dirt and grime and pigeon droppings he tried not to look down but once he lost his balance and twisted upsidedown so that he was descending head first he stared straight at the ground the people were minute below him he was vaguely aware of the hot wind whistling in his ears it was the only sound he heard he seemed completely isolated completely alone he reached for the stones of the apartment wall with tense fingers he slowly pulled himself around until he was upright again his descent continued more slowly he checked his watch it was plenty of time plenty of time he was now just above wrights window he could see the interior of the apartment clearly the two tanks yellow and black the connecting hoses the equipment the snaking cables and electrical lines okay nordmann shouted inject yourselfl graves hung dangling and twisting on the rope nineteen floors above the street and tried to grab his own forearm he was clumsy his breath came in hissing gasps the rope was tight around his ribs finally he got the syringe and pushed the plunger partway down go nordmann shouted graves kicked away from the wall swinging out into space and came back with his legs stiffly extended the glass smashed under his feet and he was swung smoothly almost easily into the apartment he dropped to the floor coughed and got to his feet immediately the acrid piercing sting of the gas invaded his nostrils and brought tears to his eyes he felt lightheaded the antidote isnt working he thought and fell to his knees he was gasping for breath he looked up at the equipment the tanks above him he was very dizzy he injected more antidote and then suddenly he was all right his mouth was dry and he was still lightheaded but he was all right he got to his feet and moved towards the tanks at every moment he expected to hear the ominous hiss and sizzle of the releasing gas but it never came he stood in the centre of the room with the wires and cords all across the floor at his feet and the white gas drifting gently out the broken window he disengaged the first valve mechanism unhooking the solenoid trip wire then the other mechanism and then he sighed it was done the mechanism could not release the gas the tanks were isolated he relaxed blinked his aching eyes swallowed dryly and checked his watch it hadnt even been close graves that was nordmann shouting to him from the floor above graves went to the window and looked up you all right graves tried to talk but a hoarse dry croak came out he nodded and waved instead cant talk graves shook his head thats the effect of the antidote nordmann said youll be okay we want to come down can you open that door for us graves nodded okay well come down graves opened all the other windows in the apartment then went back to the centre of the room and crouched over the three metal boxes one was a timer one was a battery the third when he turned it over was a hollow shell empty inside he stared at it and shook his head another diversion but it didnt matter now he went to the door and looked closely at the vibration sensors they were just rubber suction cups from a toy bowandarrow set with some wires attached totally phoney he sighed nordmann called from the other side of the door graves you there graves let him in he had a glimpse of two san diego cops sprawled on the floor in the hallway as nordmann came into the room gas is dissipated now but those poor bastards got it full how do you feel graves nodded smiled dry mouth graves nodded youll be all right just dont inject any more of that stuff you uncouple the tanks graves pointed well nordmann said thats it then he looked around the room quite an elaborate setup with a pluck graves pulled one of the rubber suction vibration sensors off the wall and showed it to nordmann ill be damned nordmann said phoney as a fourdollar bill but he really kept us guessing phelps came into the room whats going on here the tanks have been uncoupled nordmann said theres no danger any more good work phelps said he said it to nordmann graves was angry about that but he made no gesture there was no sense in giving phelps the satisfaction phelps left somebody brought graves a glass of water graves sipped it and wandered around the room looking at the equipment touching it idly well anyway nordmann said congratulations graves shrugged youre not accepting congratulations graves finished the water tried his voice im not sure theyre in order yet why surely its clear the double whammy graves said wright is a master of it that may be nordmann said but then wheres the second punch graves said he continued to wander around the room when he came to the scintillation counter he clicked it on the machine chattered loudly like an angry insect damn nordmann said everybody out graves laughed and shook his head everybody left the room quickly phelps was outside in the corridor talking with policemen who were removing the two dead bodies what is it now phelps asked a second punch nordmann said radiation in that room phelps smiled in total triumph were prepared for that he said he picked up a walkietalkie we have a radiation hazard on the nineteenth floor he said get the shielding up here graves and nordmann exchanged glances oh phelps said im not a complete fool nobody ever suggested you were a complete fool nordmann said it took two minutes for the policeman to arrive he entered the room with the lead cases which were carried on small rolling dollies he also had a pair of long tongs he emerged a moment later all clear he said two bars of some isotope shielded now phelps smiled as soon as we heard about the explosive he said i checked truck hijackings there were two today one for the explosive and another for the isotope good work graves said he said it to nordmann phelps looked pained graves and nordmann went back into the room nordmann said satisfied now almost nordmann laughed youre a hard man to satisfy its not me graves said its him nordmann looked around the room well he said i dont know what you expect to find here neither do l you seem so certain im not certain im just worried nordmann raised an eyebrow a triple whammy maybe i think youre giving him too much credit maybe graves continued to prowl around the room well nordmann said in the meantime i think wed better move these tanks apart just in case ill be happier when theyre separated by a distance of several miles okay graves said he was hardly paying attention looking at the equipment in the room you know he said i cant get over the feeling that its been too simple too simple its been complicated as hell nordmann put his arm over graves shoulder i think youre tired he said gently across the room lewis said its five oclock gentlemen everyone including the cops laughed one or two of the men in the room clapped on the floor the timer wheel clicked once there was a loud metallic snap the battery light blinked on the twin solenoids clicked to the open position and nothing happened because the solenoids had been disengaged from the tanks well nordmann said i cant imagine that theres anything else i guess not graves said he and nordmann left the apartment and walked down the corridor towards the elevators hour san diego pm pdt at graves pressed the button for the elevator the light didnt go on he looked up at the floor numbers one of which should have been lighted they were all dark thats funny he said nordmann frowned maybe they went on the blink why graves asked maybe when we cut the power to the apartment but they worked before yes thats true they did why should they break down now at that moment a cop came up the stairs panting heavily damned elevators are broken down he said we checked the circuit breakers in the basement there was a timer wired in to knock out the elevators exactly at five at five graves asked he looked at nordmann nordmann shrugged probably just a little irritant he threw in an irritant but that doesnt make sense its plenty irritating to me nordmann said i dont want to walk down nineteen flights of stairs of course graves said but why do it now i dont get you well if wright wanted to make things difficult he would have knocked out the elevators at four pm and that would have made things very difficult for us it might even have delayed us until the gas went off true but why wait until five by then weve either beaten his system or we havent listen nordmann said i think youre tired youve been worrying about wright for so long i am not tired graves said shaking off nordmanns arm wright was a logical man and there is logic in this move there are no more moves nordmann said weve won yes graves said thats exactly what were supposed to think and he turned and walked back to the apartment john nordmann said running to catch up with him john listen you listen graves said whats the point of knocking out the elevators after five it has no point its a foolish irritation wrong graves said it has one important point it traps everybody on the nineteenth floor and it traps the tanks as well thats true nordmann said but it hardly matters weve disarmed the mechanism have we oh for christs sake of course we have you did it yourself you know its disarmed but what if its not how can it not be at that graves sighed i dont know he admitted he reentered the apartment he often feels that a problem is solved when it is only half finished or twothirds finished graves remembered the psychological report as he paced the apartment talking out loud nordmann watched him and listened in the background cops were disassembling the tank mechanisms all right graves said lets think it through wright designed a mechanism yes and the mechanism had a purpose yes to dump nerve gas over the city at five rht graves nodded and we have thwarted that yes nordmann said did he have any other purpose well i dont know you could answer that better than anyone somebody mentioned something about disagreeing with the president over china no no graves said lets forget about motivation lets consider only the intent of his system did he intend to do anything besides dump the nerve gas raise hell create panic nordmann shrugged graves was silent frowning at the room i mean he said did wright intend his elaborate mechanism to do anything besides dump the gas no nordmann said i agree graves said there was a long pause graves considered everything he knew from every angle he could make no sense of it but he somehow felt certain that pieces were missing vital pieces he knew about you graves said suddenly what he knew about you he knew that i had called you in so what why should he care he didnt care graves began to see it was coming into focus because he said wright knew about you he knew your position and he knew your expertise he must have known that you could provide an antidote to the binary gas if he knew you could provide an antidote then he also knew his protection filling this room with gas would not work wed break in he knew that are you sure yes im sure and he didnt care perhaps he was bluffing nordmann said its too important for a blur he must have had another part of his system to cover that eventuality he must have planned it so that if we did break in hed still manage to win nordmann considered it all very carefully at length he sighed and shook his head im sorry john he said i think youre entirely wrong about this youre making hypothetical sand castles in the air no graves snapped his fingers no im not because there was a second purpose to his system what second purpose wright was going to jamaica or somewhere correct correct and he was not suicidal correct correct he expected to get there all right then that establishes the need for a second purpose his mechanism had to do two things what two things look graves said he spoke as rapidly as he could but he was hardly able to keep pace with his racing mind wright planned all this and planned it carefully if he succeeded a million people would die including the president a major political party would be wiped out there would be national panic of incredible proportions and for some reason he wanted that he was insane yes but not suicidal he planned an escape and the question is what about afterwards afterwards sure wright is on some beach sunning himself and gloating as he reads the headlines but for how long damn nordmann said nodding phelps was also listening i dont follow you he said you never do graves snapped but the point is this sooner or later navy men in protective suits would enter san diego they would determine that people died of nerve gas they would search for the source they would find this apartment they would enter it they would find the tanks they would put the pieces together and they would come after wright nordmann said exactly graves said wherever he went he wouldnt be safe he would be a mass murderer and he would have left a very clear trail behind him he gestured at all the equipment would he really leave such a clear trail for others to follow it must be true nordmann said getting excited he had to have two purposes first to discharge the gas and second to obliterate the evidence obliterate the evidence how phelps asked graves leaned on a tank he turned to nordmann how long would it take this cylinder of gas to discharge nordmann shrugged ten or fifteen minutes then he said i see you want to know exactly yes graves said why exactly phelps asked graves ignored him nordmann said normal army pressure tanks are usually stabilized at five hundred pounds per square inch so these tanks anybody got a tape measure he looked around the room one of the cops had a tape nordmann measured the tank thirtyseven inches in circumference he said eight feet long thats ninetysix inches with a radius of he wrote on a small pad doing rapid calculations phelps said to graves why do you need it exactly because graves said wright didnt care if we broke into this room he had another contingency plan to cover that and we need to know when it will take effect phelps looked totally confused a radius of six inches nordmann was saying and a length of ninetysix inches gives a volume well figure for a cylinder at five hundred psi let me check the nozzles he wandered off graves said to a cop what time is it five oh seven mr graves nordmann finished his calculations and turned to graves at normal discharge rates it would take these tanks sixteen minutes to empty thats it then graves said at five sixteen a bomb will go off in this room destroying everything weve got to find it everyone paused they stared at him phelps said a bomb of course thats why he knocked out the elevators to trap us here in case we managed to disengage the mechanism he wanted us here when the bomb went off releasing the gas and eliminating the evidence phelps said but theres no evidence of a bomb remember the sniffer nordmann asked phelps frowned the sniffer graves said picked up oxides of nitrogen plastic explosive yes okay graves said where is that explosive now phelps looked around the room i dont see it anywhere he said but the sniffer detected it yes there must be a bomb graves said and it must be in plain sight five oh eight a cop said we better get these tanks out nordmann said we dont want them damaged by the bomb right graves said and lets get the sniffer in here itll help us find it the sniffer had been taken to the other building phelps turned on the walkietalkie and talked to lewis lewis said he would bring it as soon as he could but it would take time to climb nineteen flights phelps told him to hurry and added a string of expletives meanwhile nordmann supervised the removal of the tanks to the hallway the cops carried them four men to a cylinder grunting under the weight graves searched the room scanning the wall surfaces the door the window ledges for any irregularity any discontinuity that would suggest the location of explosive plastic explosive compound c could be shaped and moulded into a variety of forms that was its advantage it could be anywhere nordmann stuck his head into the room maybe you should get out of here he said we can let the room blow if the tanks are far enough away no sense in risking anything ill stay until we find it graves said he walked to the window and looked out he saw lewis running across the street with the sniffer on his shoulder five ten phelps said it would take lewis at least two minutes to scramble up all those stairs graves stared out the window wondering what was happening to wright had they managed to cut his body out of the wrecked car yet odd he thought how the game continues lewis is coming phelps said i saw how much explosive is supposed to be in this room twenty pounds christ graves continued to stare out the window where would wright hide twenty pounds of explosive what would be the supremely logical hiding place nothing less would satisfy wright he was sure of that he shifted his position at the window careful to avoid the jagged splinters of glass around the sill as he did so he looked down at his shirt there was printing on the shirt some of the lettering from the tanks had come off on his arms and chest when he had leaned on them chemi it said and then faintly do not he looked at his watch where the hell is lewis lewis appeared running down the corridor redfaced and out of breath sorry he said came as fast as i could he turned on his sniffer and walked around the room pointing the gunlike wand staring at the dial on the shoulder unit graves and nordmann watched him lewis began with the door then turned to the walls he checked carefully from baseboard to ceiling in a slow methodical way he went entirely around the room finally he stopped you get a reading no lewis said checking the machine nothing maybe its in another room nordmann said i doubt it graves said lets check it lewis said he disappeared into the bathroom worked through it and through the adjoining bedroom of the apartment he came back a moment later maybe the machines broken how can we test it give it a smell of some kind like what anything strong cologne perfume food graves went to the refrigerator but it was empty when he came back he saw nordmann strike a match graves bent over the tank and rubbed the lettering it streaked on his finger go to the window graves said to a cop use the bullhorn and clear the street below do you understand get everybody the hell away from the street the cop looked confused go the cop ran graves pushed at the surface of the tank in front of him his finger left a minute indentation thats where your plastic explosive is he said its wrapped around the tanks in thin strips strips pressed through the rollers of an old washing machine there must be a timer he ran his fingers quickly along the surface feeling for lumps and irregularities he couldnt find it but he was in a hurry christ lewis said pointing his sniffer this is it plastic explosive the timer the timer its after five fifteen nordmann said get those cops in the stairway away from that tank graves said tell them to drop it and run his fingers raced along the surface back and forth but it was eight feet of tank too much surface to cover easily it was probably a small timer too perhaps miniaturized perhaps the size of a thumbnail damn i get it lewis said that was why he wanted inflammable plastic for the tanks itll explode and burn without leaving a coming up on five sixteen nordmann said looking at his watch where was the timer i cant find it graves said come on he picked up the tank by the nozzle and began dragging it back into the apartment help me he said there were

efforts in this matter three weeks later the secretary of defence ordered a contingency study based upon reevaluation of band scenario beta theft of cbw or nuclear components the contingency study advised the following destruction of all unnecessary chemical stockpiles this includes all chemical agents stored aboveground as in rocky mountain arsenal etc this includes all chemical agents combined with outmoded delivery systems as in bolt rockets evacuated to ocean in this includes all redundant chemical agents as in all gas gb stockpiles now outmoded by vx zv severe limitation of transport of chemical agents this includes all chemical agents in whatever quantities the necessity for any transportation must be verified by direct order from the secretary of defence himself severe restriction of total stockpiling locations chemical agents are now stored in twentytwo loca lions in the continental united states the contingency study concluded that there was no rationale for maintaining more than four t one stockpile locations severe regulations governing transport of chemicals no quantity of chemical agent however small should travel with less than two platoons eighty
