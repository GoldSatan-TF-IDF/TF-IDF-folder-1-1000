destinations in the world just ask met my husband my children and i love it after every visit i return to my desk sandy sunburned and gloriously happy im ready to write more romances but theres always a trace of i wish i could have stayed longer this year as we were waiting in cairns airport for our flight south and back to work a honeymoon couple arrived on the inward flight they were obviously very much in love they were weighed down with beach gearand he was just gorgeous so all the way south i sat and scowled what if i hijacked her honeymoon and the lovely thing about being a romance author isthat i just did and i hope you enjoy it chapter one sapphire cove australia was definitely the loveliest place in the world for a honeymoon pity about the bride dr ryan henry eased his foot from the accelerator and gazed across the headland what he saw was magic the sea below was the sapphire blue that gave the town its name a yacht with white sail and crimson spinnaker stood out against the distant islands the wind was warm and laced with salt and sunshine and tropical growth surged between coconut palms all along the roadside magic indeed his mother hadnt thought so sapphire cove is the end of the earth ryans mother had told him when shed taken him to the states seventeen years ago ryan had been fifteen years old and his parents marriage had collapsed dont ever let your father talk you into coming back his father had never tried and australia was no longer part of ryans life but the idea of far north queensland for a honeymoon appealed to felicity and the fact that ryan hadnt seen his father for seventeen years intrigued his intended bride ryan i didnt know you still had australian citizenship hey i have a conference in hawaii in november what if we meet in australia straight afterwards we can marry and honeymoon there and maybe you can visit your father before i arrive we should arrive there together ryan insisted if i make my flight the day after your conference ends felicity arched her beautifully pencilled eyebrows and decided to humour him well why not ryan henry was certainly worth humouring tall dark and dropdead handsome as well as being one of the countrys most promising young surgeons ryan was a hunk in any womans eyes scared of meeting your father on your own then she teased ok ryan ill come with you but she hadnt ryan might have known she wouldnt emotional family reunions werent felicitys scene ryan had landed in cairns this morning to be met by a message from felicity she was still in hawaii theres a postconference meeting its imperative i attend ryan these people are so important careetwise ill join you when i can go on to sapphire cove and ill meet you there yeah great damn you felicity ryan said savagely the beauty of his home town faded in the face of his anger and he shoved his foot on the pedal with more force than it deserved mistake a bicycle flew out from a gravel side road straight across his path ryan hit the brakes hard but he couldnt stop in time the bicycle ended up right beneath his car the world stopped there are some moments so awful that to replay them in memory or to try and describe them is unbearable this was one of those moments for two seconds ryan sat stunned and frozen while the sound of metal against metal faded to nothing it seemed a lifetime that he sat there in fact it was two whole seconds then he was out of the car and launching himself around the front of the bonnet to find the unimaginable horror that lay beneath there was a bikeor what had been a bike a tangled heap of metal was buckled right under his car for one awful moment ryan thought the rider must be there toobeneath the twisted bike he wasnt no she wasnt dear god the ridera girlwas crumpled and motionless on the verge of the road shed been thrown clear she was dead as white as a ghost himself somehow ryan moved to see and as he did the girl stirred and moaned the moan was a tiny sound her stirring was a tiny movement but it was enough to shove ryan back into medical modeto lift him out of the nightmare a little back to a mental framework where hed been trained to cope a medical emergency dont move he snapped urgently and knelt down beside her on the gravel his strong hands moved swiftly to press the girl back on the verge to stop her from rising if her spine was fractured or if she had head injuries he removed her bike helmet gently halfafraid of what he might find to his relief the short dark curls were unbloodied then he put all the authority he could muster into his voice in a vain attempt to override his shock dont try to move silence the girl did as he ordered and lay absolutely still or maybe that initial movement had been his imagination at least she was breathing ryan ran his hands over her body to check her his eyes taking her in the girls eyes were closed she was young but not a childmaybe twenty or so slight five feet four or five black curly hair closecropped and shining finely boned with a wide generous mouth and a neat little nose in other circumstances she might be described as lovely very lovely wearing shorts and a tshirt that said no fear the slogan wasnt appropriate ryan was so fearful he could hardly breathe himself there wasnt a vestige of colour on the girls face she had a faint smattering of freckles across her nose and they only made her lack of colour look worse he had to see what damage there was but to turn her do you think i might move just a bit a voice said cautiously theres gravel sticking into my cheek ryan practically yelped then he grinned relief washing over him like a tidal wave no brain damage here then there were other sorts of damage wait a bit i think my spines intact if thats what youre worried about still with her eyes closed and still motionless the girls voice seemed somehow disembodied i can feel everything the girls voice wasnt as sure now as it had first sounded it held a distinct tremble and ryan found himself putting medical imperatives aside and moving to touch her face to comfort her hey its ok he stroked the soft black curls as one might have reassured a frightened child youre ok im a doctor youll be fine she opened her eyes at that and stared straight up at him and he knew her ryan henry would have known those eyes anywhere theyd taunted him as a child haunted him for years abbey rhodes had been eleven years old when hed left sapphire cove she was four years younger than he and his mother had hated her white trash his mother had termed abbey and when shed seen abbey trailing home alongside ryan shed let loose with both barrels ryan that childs mothers not married worse she never has been married shes poor as a church mouse and scrubs floors for a living if that woman thinks youre going to waste time talking to her child well thats why were leaving ryan this whole place has no class at all sapphire cove didnt have class ryan acknowledged and it was one of the things he remembered about australia with affection the abbeys of the town the poor the immigrants the local koori kids whose parents thought houses were a waste of timeand celia henrys sonwere all treated exactly the same by the locals and despite what celia thought abbey had definitely regarded herself as the equal of ryan or better if youre going to be a worldfamous doctor then so am i shed declared puffing out her elevenyearold chest and snapping imaginary braces im just as good as you ryan henry even if my mum does think your mums snooty abbeys mother had housecleaned for celia henry and for a while abbey had followed ryan around like a devoted little shadow that was until celia had put an end to it for ever by moving ryan away and all ryan remembered of abbey were her eyes her fabulous eyes vivid blue direct honest and clear as two big pools of water from the sapphire ocean gorgeous theyd changed though ryan had assessed the slim girl lying on the road as being twenty or so well if his figuring was right abbey had to be more like twentyseven or eight now and her eyes told him he was right even if his arithmetic couldnt abbeys eyes were linedcreased from accustomed laughter and from something else suffering well i never abbey managed staring up at the man kneeling over her its ryan henry it was a painfilled whisper and it brought ryan up with a jolt shed recognised him toobut damn he was a doctor and she was injured hey abbey he touched her curls again and they were warm and soft to touch yeah its ryan but lets see what the damage is you were driving too fast it was the same voice he remembered from years ago you are walking too fast ryan henry wait for me and he always had you want to have me arrested ryans stern face quirked into a smile hey abbey im a doctor and i might just be useful here let me examine you before you have me hauled away in handcuffs i think abbey cautiously raised her head a little and winced in distress as ryan helped her into a sitting position there was still pain in her voice i think theres gravel stuck in my cheek there is ryan looked at her face and he hardly saw the gravel rash abbey had had the promise of beauty when she was eleven the promise had been fulfilled and more its not too bad though itll scrub out and shouldnt scar what else hurts abbey my leg yikes my leg abbey grimaced ryans arm was around her shoulders now and she found herself putting her face against the soft linen of his shirt finding comfort in the solidness of him as shed found comfort in his company all those years ago she peered out from the folds of his shirt along the line of her leg ryan its dislocated she whispered just look the patellas way out of line the patellas way out of line that wasnt what a nonmedical person would say theyd have said the leg was broken or that it looked funny with the kneecap sitting out of line with the rest of the leg had abbey done nursing then ryan wondered briefly the abbey he remembered would have made a good nurse cheerful and bouncy and never one to let lifes knocks get her down let me see making sure she was able to sit unaided ryan shifted so he could examine her leg one look told him it was out of position ryans hands moved gently down over the injured limb and he knew she was right it was at least dislocated shed be lucky if there wasnt a break as well he looked up at her face again and swore as he saw the deep pain in her eyes you need morphine he said im sorry abbey but i dont have anything with me were just going to have to get you to the hospital as fast as we can let me be she said weakly and tried to bend over to put her hands on her leg ill try and get it back in you ryan caught her hands and held them abbey you cant abbey bit her lip closed her eyes and curled her fingers into fists within ryans hold for all her strength the pain in her leg was building to the stage where she couldnt bear it ryan let me try i must but i dont understand ryans grip on her hands tightened are you the district nurse doing house calls on your bicycle close enough abbey opened her eyes again then and met his look with a touch of defiance i knew you didnt believe me all those years ago ryan henry i told you what i was going to be im the local doctor youre the look i hate to be rude abbey said wearily but lets get my leg back to a straight line and catch up on career paths later shall we abbey couldnt ryan didnt let her make the attempt but a comprehensive examination of abbeys leg told him he couldnt do it either not without a really hefty dose of morphine and sedative to relax her the patella had twisted way out of position shed been incredibly lucky that the leg hadnt snapped theres morphine in my bag abbey told him abbeys bag by some miracle was hardly damaged ryan retrieved it by simply reversing the car off the bicycle at least there was something he could do then ryan injected subcutaneous morphine into abbeys thigh considered trying to manipulate the leg then and there and decided against it he wanted an xray first to try and manipulate it and then discover that there was a break he splinted the leg as best he could with crepe bandages and newspapers he had in the car and then gathered her carefully into his arms abbey hardly spoke as he worked all the energy seemed to have gone out of her and ryan found himself growing increasingly worried about just how hard shed hit her head thank you ryan she whispered she put her arms unselfconsciously around his neck to help him lift her and the feel of her made ryan feel distinctly strange my pleasure ryan winced as he heard himself say it lnane that was how he felt young and gauche looking down at this slip of a girl was like looking at his childhood all over again it made him remember with a vengeance the things he had once loved memories came flooding back the things and the people his mother had torn him front abbey come on he said in a voice rougher than hed intended lets get you to the hospital i assume theres a hospital in this place now do you have another doctor who can patch you up we do have a hospital but im afraid its a case of physician heal thyself she quoted wryly ryan didnt respond he steadied himself made sure his grip was sure and the splint was supported by his arm and then lifted her into his arms and across to the car she was a featherweight she put her arms around his neck in a subconscious gesture of trust that made him feel even more odd its me me or me abbey added shakily as he set her down oralternativelyme ryan gave himself a mental shake what was it about this girl that was making emotions and memories hed forgotten flood right back well you cant put your own leg back into place he said brusquely i probably can abbey said thoughtfully i dont think anythings broken lets get me xrayed and then well see you have to be joking no abbey perched on the cars back seat as ryan lowered her then as ryan held her leg steady she hauled herself backwards so that her leg was stretched out straight on the seat her voice still wobbled but there was a trace of defiance in the tone likedont mess with me i can handle myself i stitched up my gashed arm last year she told him ten stitches all by myself i dont see that this is any worse look would you mind if we made a house call on the way to the hospital she took a deep breath the morphine was beginning to cut in and the agony was receding a house call i was on my way to see a patient abbey told him her voice was growing stronger by the minute and ryan frowned in disbelief this was one tough lady and she was recovering fast from the shock you were going on a house call on a bicycle well why not abbey settled against the squabs of ryans luxury car and gave a sigh of relief once again there was defiance in her voice its a gorgeous sunday afternoon i dont have anyone really sick in hospital mrs millers a nonurgent case and using my bicycle saves petrol abbey this was getting crazier by the minute ryan climbed behind the wheel and looked over his shoulder at the girl on the back seat there was blood on her face and her colour was still sickly the no fear on her tshirt looked crazy defiant like she was apart from the life creases around her eyes she looked about ten youre not really suggesting we do a house call before we take you to hospital id like to do it while the morphines still working abbey said seriously ive been thinking at a guess im going to find it hard to get around for a day or two now and marg miller wants to see me what about ryan shook his head in bewilderment you said it wasnt urgent she has an ulcer on her leg that needs dressing surely you have a district nurse who can do that or are you the sole medical provider for the whole district we have district nurses abbey said defensively three of them but marg wants to see me but not urgently no abbey said thoughtfully but theres something wrong not just the ulcer she wouldnt have asked me to come unless she was worried theres something troubling her ryan sighed his hands gripped the wheel tightly good grief it had been a long flight from new york and hed worked at full pace right up to the minute hed left hed just had the fright of his lifehed thought hed killed herand now abbey was suggesting that they go and dress an ulcer that could probably be dressed by the nurse at any time over the next couple of days no he said in a voice that was implacable headofsurgicalteam implacable if you really are a doctor then you know basic triage abbey i have two patients one has a dislocated knee which may have a fracture running through it a grazed face possible injuries i dont know about yet and possible delayed shock the other has an ulcer that needs dressing im sorry abbey you win or you lose im not sure which it is but either way youre going to hospital they didnt make it abbey submitted to ryans plansafter all she had no choice as she was hardly in a position to hike off to marg millers under her own steambut halfway down the hill to the hospital a phone rang a mobile phone ryan started at the sound and looked at where his phone lay on the seat beside him it wasnt his then he looked in the rearvision mirror and found abbey removing her phone from her belt dr wittner her voice sounded professional and sure she really was a doctor then but had she said dr wittner ryan frowned as he listened to her speak his memory hadnt got her name wrong surely she was abbey rhodes now wasnt the time for questions abbey was snapping out her own questions how bad still on the beach ok send the ambulance and tell them to pull out all stops no they dont have to collect me on the way im in a car now and were closer than the ambulance ill tell you why later but the driverll take me straight there ring the surf club back and tell them to keep pouring vinegaras much as they can and just keep it coming prepare icu and make sure the ambulance has antivenim and oxygen and adrenalin on board abbey leaned forward to touch ryan on the shoulder ryan turn around now ryan slowed and stared why theres a child been stung by a box jellyfish down on the south beach he sounds bad abbey ryan was rendered almost speechless abbey youve just been hit by a car its you whos the patientremember no abbeys voice was hard and firm same rules of triage ryan this is urgent i dont have time to be a patient im the only doctor in this place and unless we get there fast this child could die now turn around or let me out and ill tell the ambulance to pick me up on the way abbey ryan surely you remember box jellyfish stings well be lucky if he makes it argue later but just go the child was on the beach a little way south of the surf lifesaving club ryan had spent the three minutes it took to reach there working out just how abbey would cope he finally figured she couldnt and he couldnt either box jellyfish stings were right outside his realm box jellyfishchironex fleckeriwere lethal almost invisible in the water their tentacles stretched up to five metres in length and clung with sticky tenacity to everything they touched their venom was lethal what had ryan read you either got enough venom to kill you or you didnt there was no in between fortunately the jellyfish were only around in the hottest of the summer months ryan remembered and the popular beaches had stinger nets to keep them at bay but there were always tourists who preferred to risk swimming outside the nets thats what must have happened here ryan thought the beach south of the lifesaving club was just as beautiful as the netted area and when it was deserted it looked much more enticing and the current treatment of jellyfish stings ryan couldnt think there wasnt a lot of call for current treatments where he now worked ryan glanced back at abbey he was driving fast and the roads were bumpy the morphine was working but only just shed started to regain her colour but was now losing it again ryans hands whitened on the steeringwheel saying a silent prayer that her condition wouldnt deteriorate what if she did have a head injury triage the box jellyfish victim over the next hill the surf beach lay before them as a wide ribbon of sand bordered with coconut palms ryan saw the group of people clustered on the shore decided that the worst thing that could happen was that he could bog the car in the sandand gunned the car right down to where the child lay the hirecar people would have a fit if they knew but ryan didnt stop until the tyres started spinning in soft sand about three yards from the child theyd beaten the ambulance ryans guess had been right the child had been swimming in unprotected water the main beach was two hundred yards further north this section of beach was deserted apart from a family group in various stages of hysteria and two lifesavers who must have run from the patrolled beach they were bent over the child working hard the lifesavers looked up as the car approached and there was real relief in their eyes dr wittner one of them breathed abbeys name as he saw her and then paused as he registered that abbey wasnt driving ryan was out of the car almost before the car stopped hauling the back door open so that abbey could see and then stooping quickly over the child abbey dont try to get out he snapped you cant just tell me what to do he ordered brusquely moving as he spoke to check the childs airway and vital signs the childa boy of about thirteenwas unconscious and limp hed been wearing a brief costume that only covered his hips his chest and arms and legs were a mass of angry red weals and there were traces of tentacle still clinging to his skin vinegar abbey hauled herself upright on her seat so she could see despite ryans orders shed be out of the car if she could make her damned leg work she couldnt how much have you used she asked the onlookers then as no one answered she looked down on the sand to where there were two empty flasks and two full ones she took a deep breath pushed her faintness aside and raised her voice to command get all that vinegar on she ordered and get the remaining tentacle off she was speaking to everyone within hearing distance all of you get down on your hands and knees and rub every trace of tentacle off his body therell be more venom going in while we watch you she pointed to a gangly boy of about sixteen pour vinegar over everyones fingers while they work or youll be stung yourselves you she pointed to the youngest childa girl of about twelve run to the lifesaving club and say you need more vinegar scream it tell them dr wittner says she needs it and she needs it now theres a shop behind the club go up there and yell it too tell them to bring all theyve got ryan his breathing yeah ryan already knew the child was halfdead from shock and likely to stop breathing at any minute is there antivenom he was trying to remember had there been antivenom available when hed lived here as a boy he didnt think so yes abbey snapped and if her painful leg was causing her any problem ryan couldnt hear a trace of it in her voice its coming in the ambulance just keep him alive until then rod abbey looked across at the senior lifesaver and then winced as a shaft of pain fiercer than the rest shot up her leg she shoved away her faintness as irrelevant stand by to do mouthtomouth if she didnt have time to say more the boy stopped breathing at that moment ryan swore shot an urgent look up at rod and moved to the cardiopulmonary massage position his hands linked on the boys chest and he started thumping down breathe for him rod he ordered harshly hoping australian lifesavers still had the training he remembered undergoing himself as a teenager here they did rod had a mask at the ready standard equipment for a lifesaver at the beach now rod started breathingtwo breaths for every fifteen of ryans heart compresses ignoring everything else move all of you abbey yelled in a voice that would have woken the dead it was a voice designed to do just that ryans eyes widened as he worked this was an abbey ryan had never met beforeaccustomed to emergencies and accustomed to authority any doubts as to her medical training disappeared right then and there the family and onlookers were frozen to immobility in their horror do what i said abbey ordered harshly now they moved that is everyone moved except abbey she had to stay on the back seat of the car watching as everyone else did her work it was driving her crazy she thought desperately shed never felt so helpless in her life ryan was good though thank god for ryan but then if he hadnt been here her leg wouldnt have been damaged in the first place at least he was good there was no way she could fault what he was doing now four minutes five ryan worked on hardly pausing for breath pumping the rhythm on the young boys heart while rod breathed steadily through the mask into the boys mouth there was dead silence on the beach the childs parents and the other lifesaver were working frantically rubbing off tiny parts of tentacle from legs and arms and around ryans pounding hands while the older boy kept the affected area awash with vinegar a small crowd had gathered around but no one spoke the parents faces were streaked with tears but no one made a sound they just worked and then there was the sound of the siren moments later the ambulance appeared across the headland and lurched across the beach it stopped before it reached ryans car the driver clearly worrying more about being bogged down than ryan had and in seconds two ambulance officers were running across the sand toward them they had what ryan most needed oxygen adrenalin and antivenom give it to ryan abbey ordered pointing at ryan as the ambulancemen stopped astounded at the sight of her dr henry hes in charge now and two minutes later the boy started breathing again despite their success they still couldnt relax the fact that they had the child breathing again meant little yet in terms of whether he lived or died the boy was still deeply unconscious but breathing he had a chance that was all they knew keeping him breathing gave the antivenim time to work it meant there was time for a miracle he was loaded speedily into the ambulance and ryan took charge ill go with the ambulance he said crisply with only a fleeting thought as to what he should be doing right now damn this was his holidayhis honeymoon for heavens sakebut there wasnt a lot of choice here he looked across at the lifesavers can one of you bring dr rhodes in to the hospital she has a dislocated knee possible fracture and possible concussion hed like to take her in the ambulance but if the child stopped breathing again theyd need all the space they had and more dr rhodes the ambulance officers looked blank he means me abbey said wearily hes about twenty years out of date go on ryan she motioned to her mobile phone ill ring the hospital and tell them to expect you give you authority to act gee thanks it was as wry as he was going to get ryan didnt feel wry he felt railroaded still this was no time for hesitation with a last long look at abbey ryan followed the boys mother into the ambulance and he gave his last order concerning abbey whoever she is he growled at the lifesavers take good care of her and bring her in fast chapter two it took an hour and a half for abbey to reach the hospital and by the time she did ryan was practically going round the twist not medically sapphire cove had a beautiful little hospital with every piece of modern equipment he could hope for the nursing staff forewarned by abbey via mobile phone greeted him with efficient courtesy and there was little more ryan could have done for his jellyfish victim if hed been back in new york less he thought grimly there wasnt a lot of call for jellyfish antivenom on long island for the first halfhour after he arrived at the hospital his hands were full the boy took all of his attention he stopped breathing twice more finally though the antivenom took effect his breathing stabilised and a few moments later his eyes flickered open his mum burst into tears and as the boy showed signs of recognising everyone and didnt appear as if he would suffer longterm effects ryan felt like doing the same himself it had been some afternoon so where the hell was abbey she rang in five minutes ago to check everything was ok the hospital matron volunteered a slim competent woman in her early thirties ryan could vaguely remember eileen mcleod as being a bright spark in his class at school only now she was eileen roderick like abbey rhodes was now abbey wittner you told her everything here was ok yes and shes been delayed apparently they had to dig your car out of the sand eileen grinned the tide was coming in and they only just got it free in time the lifesavers wanted to carry abbey across to another car but abbey wouldnt hear of it and supervised operations from the back seat she grinned again thats our dr wittner bossy to the core so where is she now ryan asked in a voice of foreboding he put his hand up to run long surgeons fingers through his thick brown hair he was tired to the point of exhaustion he had to fix abbeys leg and he still had to face his father rodthe head of the lifesaversis driving her in but she wanted to make a house call first to mrs miller ill bet ryan exploded he crashed one hand against the door of the nurses station making eileen jump for petes sakethe womans got a dislocated knee if not a broken leg shes had a thump on the head thatll give her a headache for a week if not longer and shes haring round the country like theres nothing wrong shes tough our abbey eileen said quietly and then cast ryan a doubtful glance shes had to be ryan didnt take it up he didnt care how tough abbey was twentysix hours in the aira car accidenta neardeathand now she realises im waiting to set her leg ryan said darkly i dont think she realises anything of the kind eileen looked at him doubtfully eileen was the same age as ryan and she remembered him from childhood but shed always been a bit in awe of ryan henry even when hed been fifteen tall and dark clever and aloofthat was how eileen remembered him his strong bone structure dark skin and good looks combined with the almost astounding intelligence and sportsmanship hed displayed at school had made him stand apart it had only been abbey whod refused to be intimidated by his solitary air ryan henry fancy him coming back eileen chewed her bottom lip trying to think how ryans presence could help abbey eileen and abbey ran this hospital as a tightknit team and maybe only eileen knew just how hardpressed abbey really was but local gossip had it that ryan was here on his honeymoon that figured the wonder of it was that ryan hadnt married years ago ryan henry was tall dark and rangy despite his lean frame he was strongly muscled and obviously used to the outdoors his brown eyes crinkled in warm understanding his twinkling eyes had even made the boys unfortunate parents smile a while back and eileen had been astounded ryans deep brown hair ran backwards in waves that almost made you want to put your hand up to touch it good grief eileen pulled herself up with a start she was a married lady what on earth was she thinking of who does abbey expect will set her leg then ryan was saying savagely and eileen hauled her thoughts back to abbey with a visible effort oh eileen sighed i expect well do it together we she and me or is thati and her eileen frowned you tell me ryan henry you were always better at english than me than i eileen tossed him her cheeky grin again and ryan stared a nurse who threw back schoolday memories wasnt something he was used to he expected deference in the hospital where he workedand he got it but eileen was smiling and he couldnt take offence anyway he had to concentrate what eileen was saying didnt make sense abbey said she stitched her arm herself he said blankly thinking it through she did eileen said even i was a bit shocked at that one there was a car smash abbey went with the ambulance to the scene and helped get them out she cut herself badly but didnt let on there was so much blood no one noticed some of it was hers she just wrapped it up didnt say a word and kept on working afterwards when we were all exhaustedthere were two deaths you know and they were localsabbey just quietly went away and stitched herself up it was her right arm too and shes righthanded she didnt do too bad a job either though it has scarred eileen sister roderick eileen eileen smiled heck ryan we go back too far to be formal yeah eileen what was it about calling a nurse by her first name that made him so uncomfortable eileen are you saying you approve of abbey setting her own leg well no but theres no alternative she could go to cairns an hour and a halfs drive eileen shook her head no way its crazy if as you say the knee is just dislocated between us well get it back in what happens here if theres an emergency while shes away abbey will refuse point blank to go bluntly ryan abbey hasnt time to waste on herself she has a baby theres cows to milk her motherinlaw needs her stop ryan put up a hand as though fending off something he couldnt cope with youre saying abbeys responsible for all those things thats right eileen paused and the hospital matron let her smile slip as a thought struck home abbey shrugged her responsibilities off lightly but there was no reason eileen should do the same for her its not easy for abbey though she admitted looking hopefully up at ryan hey ryan was a doctor after all and he was planning on being in town for a while eileen thought some more came to sudden urgent conclusions and then she made her voice deliberately doleful and if her legs as bad as you say it is i have a feeling itll be impossible so what will you do while shes laid up find her a darned good set of crutches i guess eileen put her hands on her hips and fixed ryan henry with a look ryan this place runs because of abbey wittner i dont know if you remember the medical facilities here when you were a kid i dont remember there being anything here at all ryan confessed remembering a dreadful car ride to cairns late at night when his appendix had burst there wasnt anything eileen said bluntly since abbey got her medical degree shes organised everything galvanised the locals into building this hospital restructured the homenursing service the medical services in this town are wonderful nowbut without abbey theyll fall apart but whether you need her or not shes just dislocated her knee ryan said faintly even when we get it back in place shell have to spend the next week with it up itll be so bruised and swollen she wont be able to use it shell have to take some time off she never has before eileen said darkly not when she had her baby not when well not ever i dont see why she should now as long as the legs not broken then ill help her get it back into place well shove on a robert jones bandage to protect it and well go on from there well i knocked her off her damned bicycle ryan growled ill at least have to fix the leg then he met eileens suddenly hopeful look and he could read her thoughts as clear as day i am an orthopaedic surgeon after all he said bluntly but thats all im doing yes sir eileen said meekly but she gave him a very long look before she headed back to her work an orthopaedic surgeon well well abbey arrived at the hospital half an hour later to find ryan pacing when rod finally drove ryans hire car into the casualty entrance ryan grabbed a trolley and almost flung it at the back seat where the hell have you been there was a note of raw anxiety in his voice but abbey didnt hear it all she heard was anger busy she said crisply hiding the pain in her own voice she wasnt letting this man know shed been silly shed thought she could do the house call but the morphine had worn off and in the end it had been all she could do not to pass out from the pain hows the boy eileen says you have him stabilised and the antivenoms working yes abbey did you do that damned house call are you crazy rod the head of the lifesavers had climbed out of the drivers seat and was watching ryan and abbey with interest but ryan only had eyes for abbey mrs miller wanted to see me abbey said defensively abbey she wanted you to dress her ulcer for heavens sake no she didnt abbey said flatly at least that wasnt the main reason she wanted to see me she wanted to tell me something what i still dont know abbey confessed rod was therewell he had to beand she clammed up so youve been wandering round the countryabbey you were knocked cold when you came off that bikeand youve been sitting drinking tea how did you know ive been drinking tea havent you well yes but i guessed ryan said goaded beyond belief i remember margaret miller abbey you are ill and marg miller isnt no but theres something wrong but you dont know what no but ill find out she made me carry her into the kitchen so she could have a cup of tea with the old lady rod said blankly helping ryan lift abbey onto the trolley doc wittner propped her leg up on a kitchen chair and went at it like there was nothing wrong the old lady had the whole thing set upbest china scones and jam and cream and i suppose you ate them ryan barked of course i did abbey glared marg would have been hurt if i hadnt and what if i have to give you a general anaesthetic no ones giving me a general anaesthetic says who says me abbey glared again ryan henry are you going to take me into the hospital or do i sit here looking stupid on this trolley for the rest of the afternoon i have things to do even if you dont ryan ran his hand through his hair lets push her inside rod said helpfully otherwise shes just as likely to hop off and push the trolley herself she knows what she wants our doc wittner he gave ryan a sympathetic manbossedbywomen grin and helped the nearspeechless ryan take abbey into xray the bones were intact thanks be ryan thought and abbey echoed his thought aloud as she stared at the xray thats great ill have eileen dose me up with morphine and well get it back into position itll hardly slow me down at all it was hurting like crazy now but she wasnt admitting to that no way ryan shook his head im putting it back into position abbey im an orthopaedic surgeon so lie back shut up and let me get on with it an orthopaedic surgeon abbeys face cleared despite her bravado the thought of trying to tell eileen how to manipulate her leg back into place had had her feeling faint and she just had to look at ryan to see he was competent she closed her eyes thank you ryan thatd be great if you could patch me up before milking ryan stared milking abbey ill patch you up before bed thats where youre going and nowhere else im not going to bed yes you are for a week thats ridiculous whats the alternative here abbey ryan demanded you produce another bicycle and pedal off into the sunset you wont even be able to drive i will not while the robert jones dressing is on for a start the bulk of the thing will hinder you and bluntly abbey the leg will just be too painful when we get it back into position youll be left with residual swelling thatll take a week to go down i guess for a moment abbey looked worried and then her face cleared well ill just have to cut down on house calls the ambulance boys can take me out if they need me abbey ill be fine ryan she said firmly i have to be now that ryan said in a voice that was just as firm is something i dont understand he turned to the matron whod just entered the room behind them eileen can you prepare me a robert jones dressing the robert jones dressing was a bulky padded dressing used to protect the knee and hold it firmly in position yes doctor eileen said primly casting abbey a sideways glance and left abbey still arguing ryan i am perfectly capable youre not ryan sat on the edge of the examination couch and caught abbeys hands they felt rough he looked down at her fingers and frowned abbeys hands were workworn hands farmers hands felicitys hands were silksmooth made even more so by expensive moisturisers abbeys hands felt like theyd never seen moisturiser in their lives odd how good abbeys hands felt how right hed always looked after abbey im fixing this damned leg and cleaning up your face ryan told her gently and then im driving you home and home is where youll stay twentyfour hours absolute bedrest abbey followed by a week off work with your leg up doctors orders abbey stared she looked down at her hands resting in ryans and something suspiciously like a lump rose in her throat which was stupid she didnt cry not for something as trivial as this it must just be the shock of the accident followed by the drama of the afternoon she told herself it certainly wasnt weakness it certainly wasnt the fact that ryan might be right she closed her eyes and hauled her hands away when she opened her eyes again she had her facts right i cant she said flatly im not ill and i dont have a choice here ryan i work get a locum he said brutally and dont tell me you cant abbey sighed and shook her head thats just iti cant its november therell be no graduating medical students wanting fillin jobs yetnot until next month when they finish their finals there are only the professional locum services and they cost an arm and a leg she managed a rueful smile and i dont have a leg ryan well maybe you can find one who just charges an arm ryan smiled back but shook his head abbey thats silly with this hospital well you must be making enough to pay a locum no abbeys smile faded and her face set and its none of your business how much i earn i cant pay a locum and thats that eileen entered the theatrette again with her hands full of bandages and her eyes full of mischief what we need is a doctor wholl work for nothing she said cheerfullyinnocently maybe someone with local background someone with a spot of time on his hands and someone whose fault it was that our own doctor is out of service ryan stared hey just a minute it didnt take einstein to see what eileen was on about im here on my honeymoon so we heard but wheres your bride eileen arched her eyebrows did you leave her sitting by the side of the road when you knocked abbey off her bike no shes still in hawaii and shes arriving here later today no but then whats the problem eileen smiled at abbey and then smiled at ryan abbey staredand eileen stared right back dont you dare say we dont need him abbey wittner eileen said firmly because we do if i can persuade him she turned again to ryan well dr henry eileen you cant do this abbey said weakly watch me dr henry will do the right thing wont you dr henry both women looked at ryan like they expected a rabbit to appear from his hat and ryan was left with nowhere to go hey if you think youre hijacking my honeymoon ryan expostulated i havent had a holiday in a year dr wittner hasnt had a holiday for as long as i can remember eileen said solidly and you knocked her off her bike eileen leave him alone abbey said wearily we dont need him oh yes we do eileen fixed ryan with her very hardest glare you damaged our doctor dr ryan provide us with a replacement model eileen abbey was half laughing half horrified but ryan looked down at abbey and his protests died he didnt see her laughter he saw weariness and pain and need in fact he saw absolute exhaustion until now hed thought of himself as tired this girl was boneweary and she was way too thin abbeys eyes were ringed with shadow her hands were aged beyond their years with hard physical work he saw what eileens defiant glare was telling him and there was no way he could get out of this one what on earth would he tell felicity well felicity had already sabotaged the first part of their honeymoon and now circumstances and these two women were hijacking the rest a man knew when he was beaten very well he said wearily i know when im licked lie back then and let me put this damned leg into position dr wittner from now on it seems youre on my honeymoon abbey stared up at him what on earth do you mean i mean i damaged your leg and im on holiday ryan said bluntly or i was on holiday it seems that now we just swap roles if ryan had thought abbey would accept his offer with open arms he was very soon put right abbey protested the whole time he and eileen carefully cleaned positioned and dressed her leg in the end ryan took drastic measures one more word out of you and we administer a general anaesthetic he told her shut up and keep still abbey gasped you cant administer a general anaesthetic against my will ryan sighed and looked across at eileen sister roderick would you say this patient is behaving unreasonably i surely would her problems solved eileen was now enjoying herself immensely maybe caused by the bump on her head eileen nodded could be so weas caring professional providers of emergency treatmentwould be justified in doing whatever we need to administer appropriate treatment eileens grin widened sounds good to me short of a sledgehammer dr henry im with you all the way so shut up abbey ryan said kindly youre beaten he took the leg carefully between his hands and checked abbeys face abbey had been given a sedative and as much morphine as ryan thought she could tolerate he watched her face carefully for signs of pain none with one fast decisive click he rotated the lower leg to the right abbey gasped her eyes widened in shockand then she stared down and her pale face creased into a smile underneath the swelling the patella looked normal again one kneecap back in position well done she whisperedand then she went right back to arguing now lets think this through if you think im lying back and doing nothing sister how far up do you think we should wind this bandage ryan asked how about somewhere near her armpits mouth sounds better eileen chuckled know when youre beaten abbey ryan told her and kept right on winding and there was absolutely nothing abbey could do so abbey wittner finally shut up she hardly said a word until ryan had her in his car driving northwards towards her home the jellyfish victim was recovering nicely eileen had ryans mobile phone number to contact him in an emergency and the transfer of authority was complete but abbey didnt like it one bit you dont need to do this abbey told him in a voice that was subdued in fact she was tired almost beyond belief the pain and the shock of the accident was taking its toll and ryans offer to take her home to bed was sounding so good that she wanted to give in to it only she couldnt i do ryan told her abbey was stretched out on the back seat of his car again and he was talking to her over his shoulder as he drove believe me abbey ive looked at it from every angle and i dont see that i can get out of it you said yourself that the accident was my fault i was driving too fast yeah but i didnt look and you now have a massively bruised leg and i have a guilty conscience so lets fix both shall we by letting you be a martyr abbeys voice was sharper than shed intended and ryan winced that was just how he was feelinga martyr another twinge of guilt hit home should he call what he was doing here martyrdom this was his home town after all and he had just squashed the local doctor well sapphire cove had been good to him as a child he owed it something so maybe he could give it without calling himself a martyr its not martyrdom abbey ryan said in a voice that was gentler than any hed used before let me do it please be doctor here for a week or longer if you need me but you are here on your honeymoon abbey said cautiously everyone knows that thats why your dad said you were coming you still know my father of course i still know your father abbey cast him a strange look hes a good friend of my motherinlaw he spends a lot of time with us and as far as knowing how he iswell id imagine i know him better than you do ryans face set meaning meaning hes my friend and hes also my patient ryan frowned thinking this through and accepting reluctantly that she was right shed have to know his father better than he did but abbey as his fathers doctor that took some getting used to is there anything wrong with him he asked dont you know how his health is abbey demanded he tells me you write to each other of course we write hmm abbey compressed her lips and ryan could see judgement standing out a mile and condemnation so she asked changing the subject wheres your bride then dr henry in hawaii oh abbey thought this through and then nodded wisely a doctoroftheworld nod i see separate honeymoons thats very very modern abbey abbey hadnt changed one bit ryan thought bitterly abbey had always said exactly what shed thought shed always told him and hed loved her for it did you get together for the wedding abbey continued in a voice that was dispassionately interested nothing more or can you do a wedding via teleconferencing these days or maybe via the internet despite his darkening humour ryan couldnt suppress a smile a teleconferenced wedding that would be just felicitys style now why hadnt she thought of that abbeys bright eyes were watching him gently mocking his smile faded he went into defence mode with abbey defence had always been a good idea we havent married yet weve organised to be married in sapphire cove when felicity gets here oh to ryans surprise abbeys face softened oh ryan your father will like that i wouldnt imagine hed care very much oh hell care abbey said grimly almost to herself you cant imagine how much then she leaned forward and pointed to a turnoff here ryan turn here this is where i live ryan stared where abbey was pointing was to a farmhouse but it wasnt what youd call the home of the landed gentry the farmhouse was a simple cottage set back among encroaching tropical wilderness it looked as if it had been built a hundred years ago and nothing much had been done to it since thered been a sugar plantation here once but not now straggling lantana grew wild almost right to the door there were a few cows in the paddocks around the house as ryan turned up the drive poultry scattered in all directions and a redheaded toddler was pedalling a tricycle along the verandah scattering hens and feathers in the process as the car drew to a halt the toddler stared openmouthed bolted inside and reappeared clutching the hand of someone who had to be his grandma the lady hed produced was in her seventies still with traces of the childs red hair but bent and weathered with age and queenslands fierce sun the woman came down the verandah steps slowly hobbling with the aid of a walking stick and clutching the small boy to her side in the manner of someone expecting disaster this woman had seen disaster ryan thought fleetingly as he watched her face the suffering he saw there was a deeper version of what he saw behind abbeys eyes who was she he couldnt remember he couldnt remember anyone living on this place when he was young the expression on the womans face had given way now to open fear ryan turned off the engine but abbey had the door of the car open before ryan could move its ok janet she called urgently im ok i dislocated my knee but its fine now ryan was right the woman had been expecting trouble the elderly womans face cleared as though shed just won a reprieve and she limped the last few steps to the car with a tread that was as close to a bounce as someone who obviously had a damaged hip could manage youve what i dislocated my knee abbey grinned up at both the woman and the little boy at her side and only ryanwho knew how much pain abbey must still be incould know what that grin was costing her hi jack look what mummys done abbey pointed to the bulky bandage which made her leg look three times its size and then she turned back to the woman janet you must remember ryan henry he just knocked me off my bicycle ryan henry janet stared and then her elderly face creased into a smile of course sams son ryan i remember you as a youngster you were a bit older than my john welcome home though she looked doubtfully down at abbeys leg did you say ryan knocked you off your bicycle abbey i did janet frowned then im not sure whether we should welcome you or tar and feather you and drive you back out of town therell be no driving him anywhere abbey said firmly hauling herself backwards to the edge of the seat ryans offered us his honeymoon can you give me a hand inside hes what janet wittner took a step back ryan promptly moved forward and lifted abbey effortlessly out of the car she really was ridiculously slight he straightened holding abbey in his arms the hot sun blazing down on them at their feet the chooks cautiously returned squawking and fussing in the dust i cant work until this blasted swellings gone down abbey told janet from the safety of ryans arms ryans offered to work for me instead of taking a honeymoon she grinned up into ryans face and then her smile slipped a little it felt very strange to be carried against this mans chest this man whom shed once known so well this man whom shed wept over for months when hed left her well thats very kind of you ryan janet told him but wont your wife have something to say about that he hasnt got a wife yet abbey told her hes left his bride in hawaii ryan put me down i can hop you cant hop anywhere except over very flat ground when you can use your crutches youre to be carried everywhere you need to go for the next few days wheres your husband silence and ryan knew that abbeys husband wasnt in hawaii or anywhere else for that matter abbeys next words confirmed hed just put his foot right in it johns dead abbey said wearily her brave front suddenly disappearing entirely thank you ryan if you could just carry me inside then well be right now thank you for your help chapter three john wittner ryan carried abbey into a house which was as shabby inside as it was out and as he did he forced his mind through lists of kids he remembered from his school days thered been a few wittners in the end it was the toddlers red hair that helped ryan remembered a boy two years his juniora big goodnatured youth whod been great at football and cricket hed had brilliant red hair that was all he remembered of abbeys husband but it was enough john wittner he said slowly as he laid abbey on her bed the old lady had stopped out in the living room her face had shown her distress as abbey had said the word dead and she was clearly working at getting her composure back the toddler shy of ryan had stayed with her big guy six feet three or so great at sport you remember him abbeys eyes showed pleasure as she settled down on the bedcovers bed felt just wonderful and with luck she could stay here for half an hour before she needed to start milking only a little ryan confessed he sat down on the bed beside her and looked down at his friend she was so thin her short dark curls were matted with dust and her finely boned face was stretched thin with exhaustion but her clear blue eyes looked up at him and she was still the same abbey abbey seventeen years of absence and she was still his friend it distressed him unutterably to know shed been in trouble and he hadnt known abbey lay there dirty bruised and way too thin and he remembered just how hed felt about her all those years ago hed loved her tell me about john he said quietly when were you married after i graduated abbey shrugged john well john had the biggest heart after you left she caught herself remembering how shed felt when ryan had left and she couldnt stop the pain washing over her face let ryan think it was just her leg well i needed a friend she managed and john well he sort of became it then my mum died your mother died she died of cancer when i was twelve and the wittners took me in janet treated me like her own and john and i well we just drifted from friendship into marriage it was like it was meant only only abbey took a deep breath and closed her eyes while i was away at medical school johns dad died janet didnt cope very well shed depended heavily on johns dad and she lost interest in everything john kept on farming but suddenly every decision was his the transition was too sudden he got into financial trouble ryans voice was intent he was watching the pain wash over abbeys face and part of him didnt want to hear the end of the story the wittners had a lovely farm they grew sugar cane and ran cattle abbey said bleakly as if telling a story that still had the power to hurt the farm was prosperous but john didnt have much of a head for figures he made a few investments that werent very wise and he gave loans to people he shouldnt have trusted by the time i finished medical school and came back here to marry him he was in real trouble so you sold up and moved here it wasnt quite as simple as that abbey confessed john well he was proud and he wouldnt let on to either janet or me just how much trouble he was in i galvanised the community into building the hospital my medical practice started paying and then i found myself pregnant i was delighted and i thought john was too with the farm and my medicine there seemed to be heaps of money but her voice faltered and ryan found himself covering her hand on the bedclothes tell me abbey when john ran into trouble he started gambling abbey said painfully no one knew he just i was busy and hed go awayto farming conferences he said and we believed him and then he ran so deeply into debt it was a nightmare and he still couldnt tell us her voice faltered and then he shot himself oh abbey he didnt even make a good job of that abbey said wearily he was in a coma for months before he died the place was a financial disaster there wasnt any insurance and i was pregnant jack was born two months after john died she shrugged putting aside a nightmare so the bank foreclosed and janet and i sold up janet couldnt bear to live in town she thinks everyone is still talking about her and she cant bear to face people or talk about john the only person shell still see is your father so we bought this place which was all we could affordand here we are apart from a pile of debts which im slowly paying off then were fine were doing fine she spread her hands im sorry its the end of a rotten story only it wasnt ryan looked down at those workweary hands and knew that it wasnt are you making ends meet now he asked gently and abbey grimaced we will apart from my medical income were supplying a local cheesemaker with unpasteurised milk and how many cows are you milking fifteen thats all the milk he wants and its not enough for one of the bigger dairies to adjust their collection procedures fifteen cows ryan frowned thinking this through but thats hardly enough to justify milking machines well isnt that lucky abbey managed a smile we milk by hand you have to be kidding no abbey sighed again look if we get rid of the farm entirely i think janet will just curl up and die she loves jack and she loves the farm abbey janets hands her hip yes abbeys voice was disinterested and weary twenty more minutes until she had to face the cows abbey janets hands are crippled with arthritis her hip seems even worse than her hands so she cant possibly milk no i do that thats ridiculous ryan exploded you cant milk twice a day and run a medical practice and care for a whats the choice here ryan silence there has to be a choice ryan said at last he thought of felicityof what shed say presented with this nightmare it didnt bear thinking of youll have to buy a small house in town i told youwe cant live in town janet cant bear it and this place was cheaper than anything within the town boundaries abbey cast a rueful glance around at the rising damp on the walls and the cracks in the plaster much cheaper this waywell the cows bring in an income janet thinks shes making a contributionas indeed she is she cares for the poultry and sells the eggs and she cares for jack when im away and you do all your house calls by bicycle i have a car abbey said defensively i just dont use it when i can use the bike you cant tell me you wouldnt make more and have an easier life living in an apartment in town i might abbey said evenly jack and i could live in a flat at the back of the hospital but where would that leave janet shes old enough for a nursing home thats what felicity would do ryan knew get the hell out of the mess abandon the old lady and leave the whole catastrophe behind her so fast you wouldnt see her for dust silence again then abbey shook her head nestled her head back down on the pillows and closed her eyes go away ryan henry she said wearily id appreciate it if you would care for the medical needs of the town for the next week id appreciate it very much but that doesnt mean i have to spend any time with you why the hell ryan for a minute there then you sounded just like your mother abbey told him flatly and if theres one person in this world i could never stand its your mother ryan rose anger flooding into his face if it comes to that yeah my mother was a slut abbey said in the same disinterested tone your mother told me she was so you dont need to repeat it go away ryan abbey oh leave it abbey was bonetired and she wanted done with it the sight of this man beside her bed was doing strange things to her insides she wanted to weep her leg throbbed and the world just seemed too darned hard whos milking tonight ryans face had closed and his tone was clipped there was anger in his voice but also resignation he wasnt enjoying this one bitbut damn hed do the right thing by this girl and then hed leave who do you think abbey demanded dully me me or maybe you think its me now go away so i can have fifteen minutes to pull myself together before i have to start you cant milk tonight well that leaves janet and jack to do it for me you choose there must be someone else there isnt go away and abbey humped herself over and faced the wall good grief she thought bleakly she was behaving like a petulant childbut that was how ryan made her feel like her life was way out of control and her problems were exposed for all the world to see for ryan to see she didnt like this abbey blinked back a stupid tear and then another can janet show me what to do ryan asked and his voice sounded like it came from a long way off abbey sniffed and tried to focus on what hed said what do you mean i assume janet can give me directions on how to get your cows in and i vaguely remember milking the house cow as a boy its like riding a bicycle isnt it once learned never forgotten ryan wasnt a long way away at all his hand came down and touched abbeys cheek wiping tears from her long lashes there was resignation in his voice but also tenderness abbey go to sleep ill go and milk your damned cows for you and then after that well sit down and try to make some sense out of this mess you dont you cant abbey twisted around on the bed but ryans hands held her firm abbey shut up and go to sleep he said kindly im the senior doctor hereremember what i say goes now just cut out the protests and go to sleep it was all abbey wanted to do it was all her body was screaming at her to do she looked up into ryans concerned face and for the life of her she couldnt think of a thing to say or do the morphine was blurring her edges muting her protests she blinked and tried but all that would come out was what she most wanted to say yes sir she said thank you and the morphine took its toll she slept abbey woke to laughter she stirred and winced and checked herself out from the toes up her leg was hurting so was her face nothing too drastic though the dressing ryan had put on her face was stretchedthe swelling must have pulled the cover tight she winced and adjusted it loosening it and reapplying the sticky edges then she tried moving her leg it didnt hurt as much as shed expected the huge dressing was holding everything firm she was covered by a thick quilt it hadnt been there when shed gone to sleep janet must have come in or ryan had put it over her abbey found herself flushing at the thought of ryan being beside her when she was asleep no it had to be janet ryan henry hed slammed back into her life with the force of a bulldozer and it wasnt the knock on her head this afternoon that was making her dizzy ryan dont be stupid abbey wittner she told herself harshly just because the mans goodlooking and smiles just the way he used to it doesnt mean hes the same it doesnt mean you still have to be in love with him there were giggles coming from the kitchen abbey listened for a whole two minutes and then could bear it no longer she grabbed the hospital crutches from the bedside and staggered forth her first venture on four legs ryan henry was seated at abbeys kitchen table and he was feeding her son abbey stopped at the kitchen door and blinked and blinked again janet was smiling with pleasure while ryan aeroplaned jacks egg into his mouth it was hard to know who was having the most funjack jacks grandma janet or the man with the egg aeroplanes jack doesnt like egg abbey said slowly and ryan and janet turned towards her not jack her little son didnt look up the toddler was concentrating fiercely on catching and eating the next aeroplane jack doesnt like egg more said jack says who ryan asked politely he gave abbey a mocking smile and went back to his aeronautics jack demolished the last mouthful of egg and crowed with delight ryan does a finer aeroplane than you or i ever did janets smile deepened as she stood and shifted awkwardly to the stove sit down child and ill give you your dinner i kept it hot abbey frowned and looked at the clock above the big old fire stove and winced seven oclock we let you sleep janet explained we thought it was best i see abbey didnt see at all she looked at ryan with suspicion did janet feed you then theres no need to say it like its taking food from your mouths ryan complained janet said there was heaps and so there is janet said warmly ryans milked all the cows and its only taken him two and a half hours to do it two and a half abbeys eyes widened and twinkled did the girls give you a hard time ryan they learned who was boss ryan said evenly eventually he might need a loan of your crutches or my walking stick janet interjected he got himself kicked abbey lifted her brows in sympathetic enquiry really badly ryan let me see no way ryan said darkly and dont ask where enough to say its a place where the sun rarely shines its not crutches i need but a gynaecological pillow a gynaecological pillow was a pillow shaped like an inner tyre to take the pressure from sore bottoms after childbirth abbey grinned in swift sympathy oh dear he was bending over to tie one girls legs and he forgot the girl in the next bail wasnt tied janet explained she looked over at abbey and her eyes twinkled she chuckled out loud and abbeys eyes widened even further it had been a long time since shed heard janet chuckle janet placed a plate of casserole on the table abbey lowered herself thoughtfully into the chair and surveyed her family it all seemed so so domestic to have ryan sitting in the chair at the other end of the table calmly wiping superfluous egg from her sons little face the kitchen had been empty well it had seemed empty since theyd moved here ryan filled johns place and more his charismatic presence holding janet and the baby spellbound and what about abbey herself she had loved this man once she conceded or maybe that was wrong shed loved this boy before hed become a man this boy was now a surgeona careeroriented doctor engaged to be married to a woman in hawaii and home for only two weeks home no this wasnt ryans home this was his honeymoon destination abbey gave herself a fast mental shake it was no use growing accustomed to ryan being at her kitchen table in two weeks hed be gone once many years ago shed broken her heart over his leaving not any more now she didnt even know him your legs hurting ryan said softly and abbey flushed as she realised hed been watching her nno she lied well maybe just a bit do you want more morphine no she shook her head ill take aspirin if i need to aspirins not strong enough abbey once again that cool voice which held a hint of concerna voice that was close to abbeys undoing the same voice she remembered from all those years ago its no weakness to admit youre in pain and therell be scratches and bruises under that filthy tshirt would you like me to help you bath no way she blinked determined and ill stick to aspirin thanks very much morphine will just make me go to sleep thats just what you need to do girl janet said strongly and abbey shook her head no i have to bath jack and put him in case you havent noticed jacks in his pyjamas janet told her ryan and i have already bathed jack abbey blinked you her eyes swivelled to ryan theres no need to sound as if you think im completely useless ryan complained i can cope with the odd baby bath yeah abbey gave him a sideways look how many babies have you bathed in your time ryan henry one he said promptly but it was a brilliant one wasnt it jack he grinned down at abbeys little son and jack grinned a toothy toddler smile right back at him i i see abbey couldnt help staring this man was making himself right at home jack was normally shy it wasnt all that brilliant janet conceded i told him what to do not necessary it was necessary young ryan janet told him and ryan smiled and sat back in his chair like a rebuked schoolboy i just wish i could do it myself janets smile faded if i could lift him hes too heavy for you to lift from the bath abbey said as if repeating a conversation that had been played out a hundred times but janet if youd get your hip fixed your hip ryan turned to look consideringly at janet now thats what i dont understand tell me why youre dependent on sticks arthritis janet said shortly it doesnt matter it does abbey leaned forward and spoke urgently to ryan janets in urgent need of a hip replacement if she had that well shed be like a girl again but i cant persuade her to get it done id have to go to cairns janet said harshly and i wont leave you girl you need me i can get a babysitter for a month or more and whod feed the poultry and look after jack and wholl push your wheelchair when your leg gives completely abbey retorted ryan held up a hand whoa is there something im missing here yes abbey said shortly or ratherno there are no complications she should get it done and she wont i wont go to cairns janet muttered id hate it id come and visit you abbey told her oh yes janet jeered in your spare time why not do it here ryan asked and both women turned to stare at him silence it was abbey who spoke first well thats a crazy suggestion she said simply firstly im the only doctor here and i cant operate and give anaesthetic at the same time secondly and more importantly im not a surgeon much less an orthopaedic surgeon with the skills to do hip replacements i can do an appendicectomy in an absolute emergency with my charge sister giving anaesthetic but thats an end to it with my knowledge of orthopaedics id end up having janet walking backwards ryan smiled but his smile was perfunctory i could though he said i told you when i put your knee back abbey my specialtys orthopaedics more silence oh yes abbey said finally and her voice was faintly mocking this was cruel maybe you could if we had the equipment if we had an anaesthetist and backup staff if you were registered to work here if pigs flew registered ryan centred on only one objection if i can organise everything else is registration likely to be a problem well maybe not abbey admitted youre not australian trained but with your australian citizenship your training and the fact that were a remote hospital remote its why i accepted your offer of help this week abbey explained because sapphire coves categorised as remote if any doctor is stupid eni mean willing enough to work here and their basic overseas training is acceptable we can get their registration through in a flash i see ryans magnetic grin flashed out soive just offered to be stupid im not having any hip operated on janet broke in harshly shed been staring from abbey to ryan in confusion abbey this is crazy whod look after jack if i was in hospital if ryan can organise a few pigs to fly i dont see why you should object abbey said promptly if but ryans doing my work for me didnt you hear him offer and marcia over the road was put off work last week the resorts always lay off staff during stinger season janet lets not throw any more obstacles in his way than ryan already has hes offered me his honeymoon and you a new hip what next what next indeed ryan sat at the table as janet and abbey talked across him and he felt as if hed been knocked sideways why on earth had he made that offer to do a hip replacement here in such a place it wasnt that he doubted his ability to organise it routine procedures such as hip replacements were now left to those working under him and there were favours he could call in to get equipment and staff it was just well this was his honeymoon after all hed have to beg borrow or steal equipment from a bigger hospital pull in favours from all over the place itd take a couple of days to get everything he needed at a guess felicity would arrive just as hed lined up theatre felicity would not be happy but abbey was ryan looked over the table and abbeys eyes were misting as she looked at her motherinlaw and then abbey turned to look at him if you could organise it itd be the best thing she said and her voice shook ryans astonishment at what hed just offered lifted a little hed eased just a fraction of the load on abbeys slight shoulders and for some reasonwell for some reason he suddenly didnt give a toss what felicity would say he had to do it he felt lighter himself and then the phone rang one thing ryan had learned early in medical school was that the most emotional moments of his lifeor the most embarrassingwere always punctuated with the phone the mobile phone shrilled and both abbey and ryan looked down at their waists abbey grinned and held up her hands you win she said as ryan flipped his phone open then her smile faded as she watched ryans face ryan what is it ryan was talking harshly into the phone theyre already bringing him in ok ill be there as fast as i can and ryan was on his feet his chair clattering to the floor behind him he didnt even notice that hed knocked it over what is it it had to be something awful abbey knew all the colour had drained out of ryans face its my father he said shortly it sounds like hes had a heart attack oh no janet went white and automatically clutched jack as if clutching the baby could ward off catastrophe not another one abbey rose too grabbing her crutches and shoving them under her arms ryan give me a hand out to the car ryan stopped dead and stared back at abbey his face had grown suddenly haggard what do you meananother hes had three this year abbey told him bluntly hes running on borrowed time but ryan shut up and move abbey ordered she gave jack a fast pat goodbye see you later sweetheart mummy has to go back to the hospital be good for gran janet ill look after sam for you i swear dont worry and abbey grabbed her crutches and headed for the door youre not coming ryan said automatically but abbey was already on her way just help me into the damned car she said harshly im not leaving you to look after your own father and besides janet and i love sam henry and what abbey didnt sayand both of them knewwas that if sam was in real trouble then ryan could become next to useless to be an efficient doctor was an impossibility when the patient was so close and if hard decisions had to be made if life support systems had to be shut down well abbey was coming ryan was so shocked he didnt speak again until they were halfway to the hospital when he did he sounded sick tell me dads medical history abbey with ryans help abbey had hauled herself into the back seat again her leg stretched out before her her position hadnt been achieved without cost from the hip down her leg was starting to ache as it had before the morphine a dull rhythmic throb dont you know she shifted and winced i didnt even know he had a heart problem ryan swore savagely so tell me ryan didnt know abbey shook her head in concern how much didnt he know well sams like janet abbey said slowly only its more drastic he desperately needs bypass surgery but he wont have it why not abbey shrugged he says its because he doesnt want to leave the farm myself i think its more than that what do you mean i mean hes a lonely old man with no family abbey said gently hes fond of janet and jack and me but were all he has and were not enough i dont think he wants to live to a ripe old age but thats ryan shook his head thats nonsense abbey shrugged well i guess youd know better than i do youre his son after all but then youre his son and you didnt even know he had a heart condition i write ryan said explosively i write every week abbey screwed up her nose she knew about those letters yes you do she said gently im sure your concern does you credit abbey why has he had a heart attack now abbey asked staring into the middle distance over ryans shoulder has he been stressed how the hell should i know there you are then damn it abbey abbey ignored his mounting anger someone had to lay the truth before ryan henry a letter once a week sam had shown her a few proudly and abbey had felt sick inside when shed seen them they were formal punctilious letters describing ryans career the weather the news wherever ryan happened to be in the world always a polite enquiry after his fathers health at the end they were duty letters the fact that sam had been proud of them had made abbey cringe inside how was he today though abbey probed was he happy to see you relaxed i havent seen him yet ryan said explosively i hit a bicyclist on the way into townremember oh yes but abbey didnt sound apologetic in the least she kept right on probing sodid he mind when you let him know youd be late i didnt let him know silence you mean abbeys voice grew softer ryan sam told me he was expecting you about midday hes been talking of nothing else for weeks hes been talking of his son coming home waiting and what time is it now eight hell have been pacing the floor i was milking your cows dammit abbey bit back her anger with real difficulty i know and im grateful but ryan how long would it have taken you to phone himto tell him youd be eight hours late how long ryan henry you didnt even think i had to milk your cows and you didnt tell me i didnt tell you that your father has a bad heart and you should ring and reassure him abbey took a deep breath her leg was on fire and her anger was building to boiling point shed watched sam henry pine for his family for almost twenty years and she hadnt been able to do a damned thing about it and now ryan was sitting in the driving seat practically saying it was her fault sam had this attack she wasnt going to yell she wouldnt how could i have said that to you without sounding like a patronising adult talking to an uncaring unthinking child she asked finally and her voice was deathly quiet i wish id known thats exactly what you are and after that there was nothingabsolutely nothingleft to say chapter four sam henry was in intensive care when they arrived his worry and anger building to a crescendo ryan abandoned abbey in the car and strode down the hospital corridor fast the night charge sister by his side ryan looked every inch a doctor abbey thought as she watched him go walking as all hospital staff were taught to move in an emergency walk fastnever run never risk barrelling into patients and making things worse there was more than the way he moved that showed the world ryan was a doctor though ryan henry exuded authority and competence the night sister automatically deferred to him when they arrived without once looking at abbey for confirmation of his authority all ryan needed was a white coat and stethoscope hanging around his neck and he might have been the doctor in charge here for years he was all doctor and abbey hardly knew him this man she had once known almost as well as shed known herself once long ago abbey had loved ryan henry she thought sadly as she watched him disappear around a turn in the corridor the boy abbey knew had loved his father absolutely and would never hurt him where was the boy abbey had loved now had he disappeared for ever it didnt matter it couldnt matter the old ryan was part of her childhood nothing more abbey had been abandoned in the car in the casualty entrance and now there was nothing to do but wait her leg hurt too much to move unless she had to she knew if ryan needed her hed remember her presence and send someone out to fetch her in the end he didnt need to the ward attendant came out to move ryans carand stopped in astonishment when he saw her doc wittner yeah abbey gave him a reluctant grin hi ted do you think you could help me inside sure ted stared down at her his face creasing in concern but i didnt think you were supposed to be here arent you supposed to be home in bed eileen said youd been injured just a bruised knee and i want to know whats going on inside doc henrys looking after his father sams ok i dunno ted admitted all i know is they havent called me to shift him to a slab yet so thats gotta be a good sign abbey grinned ted was a wizened korean war veteran whod been a semiinvalid ever since lonely and miserable all his life when abbey had offered him the job as ward attendant hed been astounded who me i couldnt do anything like that in a pink fit it had taken all abbeys skills at persuasion to have him give the job a go since then ted had been abbeys most loyal employee he lived in a tiny apartment at the back of the hospital and the hospital was now his world but there were no greys in teds world there was black and white dead or alive sam was alive you want a trolley ted asked her dubiously eyeing her huge white leg and abbey shook her head no but a wheelchair would be good and a hand backwards out of this car no sooner said than done a minute later abbeys wheelchair was spinning down the corridor to intensive care sam was definitely still alive ted pushed the ward door open and abbey looked in with some trepidation to find sam henry looking to see whod just entered when sam saw abbey his face puckered into a whitefaced smile hey abbey sam abbey shoved the wheels of her chair down to push herself over to the bed she took sams hand in hers it was clammy and cold but he was alive and for the moment that was all that mattered in the last few years abbey had leaned heavily on sam henry for advice and friendship in fact sam had become almost as important to abbey as his son had once been what on earth are you doing to us now she asked gently damned heart sam whispered but ryans here the old man looked up at ryan standing beside his bed and there was no mistaking the pride and love in his voice abbey looked up too and saw ryans face set ryan had heard it then the love and the pride the ties that went far beyond duty letters and abbey saw in his face that ryan was feeling just dreadful the old ryan wasnt completely gone ok shed let ryan off the hook take the blame herself let sam keep on thinking that his son was wonderful im so sorry abbey squeezed sams hand did ryan tell you it was all my fault he was late first i smashed my bike into him then i demanded he put my dislocated knee back into place and finally he had to milk my cows and all the time you were waiting and not knowing he was even in the district im so sorry theres no damage there was damage abbey knew sams voice was a weak whisper but there was no way hed conceded anything to his dicky heart in the past he wasnt about to start now i might have known ryan was needed he wouldnt have been late otherwise my ryans a great boy he is too abbey ventured a smile up at ryan and found his face still looked as if it were carved in stone pain was washing over her in waves soundlessly ryan held out the ecg reading abbey checked it carefully and nodded its ok ryan she told him not much different to last time a little worse not much what the hell ryans voice was full of pentup emotion dad youve got a heart thats as dicky as this and you havent even told me now hardly seems the time to yell at him for being a bad letterwriter abbey said mildly she smiled affectionately at sam ill yell at you in the morning if you like for now ill ring janet and let her know youre ok shell be worried so ill thank you kindly to stop scaring her if ryans done all he needs maybe you should get some sleep i dont need all these wires sam said fretfully and abbey fixed him with a look yes you do why because they keep your son happy abbey told him also they tell us that your hearts still beating and if ted out there doesnt have positive proof of a beating heart every few minutes or so he has a nice little slab down in the mortuary thats just your size silence ryans eyebrows hit his hairline but to her satisfaction sam gave a weak chuckle you always did have such a persuasive way with you young abbey he whispered ok then ill wear your dratted wires now get off with you and let a man get to sleep do you always gain patient compliance by threatening them with the mortuary ryan asked as he wheeled abbey back into the corridor his voice sounded drained and weary but also calmer the electrodes attached to sams chest were giving a cautiously optimistic message a nurse was sitting beside sams bed and there was every reason to hope hed live a bit longer live to be persuaded to have his bypass i use it all the time abbey chuckled works a treat especially since ted started taking guided tours of his underground room ted ryan frowned is that the ghoul i saw stalking the hospital corridors as i came in if he looked like a ghoul it was definitely ted ryan frowned he looks familiar do i did i know him probably abbey told him but i wouldnt imagine you were on close terms hes ted hammond the wheelchair came to an abrupt halt ryan stared down in incredulity abbey ted hammond was a derelict when i was a kid how he wasnt a derelict abbey said he was just bored and lonely he was out of work and didnt know how to fill in his time ted came back from the war to find his wife and kids had left him he had one leg shorter than the other and he had nerve damage so he drifted on the streets and he stayed there then yeah tell me what happened then ryan straightened and started walking againand abbey frowned it was a strange sensation being wheeled by ryan henry concentrate on ted well a couple of months after the hospital opened we had an awful car crash down near the beach abbey told him ted was first on the scene when i got there with the ambulance ted had hauled a couple of kids clear before the car burst into flames there were a couple of others dead inside ted copedin fact he coped a lot better than i or the ambulance officers did and i saw a side that hed kept hidden for years behind a wall of misery so i offered him a job abbey he was a street bum no he was a lonely old man without friends and family and without an aim abbey said roundly people like your mother classified him as a bum while he was ill and desperate and the label just stuck ted didnt drink he just didnt know what else to do with himself but sit on park benches and look desolate and if he looked unkempt it was because he couldnt see the point of being anything else hes not unkempt now silence oh dear abbey bit her lip shed just criticised ryans motheragain she and ryan were doomed not to be friends any more abbey thought miserably then she looked up as the night sister approached sister i was just wondering the nurse said and smiled shyly up at ryan dr henry are you going home i thought id check our jellyfish victim once more then take dr wittner home and go on to sleep at my fathers ryan said brusquely still mulling over abbeys words he motioned to the phone on his belt call me if you need me the nurse hesitated but ryan when i have someone in hospital with heart problems i dont go home abbey interjected and the jellyfish toxin is still a risk despite the antivenom so as youre now doctor in lieu of me abbey ryan i dont know whether you realise what youve let yourself in for here abbey told him youre it theres no resident or intern backing you up if your father goes into cardiac arrest then theres only you ryan frowned sleep at the hospital hed never thought of doing that but if he didnt if his father went into cardiac arrest trained nurses could start emergency procedures but abbey was right to drive the five minutes to take abbey home was one thing to be fifteen minutes out of range at his fathers house he hardly had a choice here but if he had to stay at the hospital for the entire week well felicity would not be pleased what do you do with your little boy when you need to stay here he asked and abbey shrugged if i can i bring jack with me and settle him into the childrens ward thats possible if i have warning but janet copes if theres not time to bring him she cant bath him but she can do most other things he helps her by climbing in and out of his own cot now but you milk abbey smiled yeah i dash home and milk with the mobile phone beside me and i dash back if needed the locals are accustomed to the smell of cow dung mixed with antibiotic and the cows have learned to be a bit negotiable in their milking times youre kidding ryan said faintly abbey what sort of life is that for a he had been going to say a girl and then ryan looked down at abbeys workworn hands and corrected himself for a woman its my life abbey sighed and smiled again well maybe its not for a while its now your life for a weekor at least the medical part is after that though then itll be my life ever after i dont ask for anything more now if you would i would like you to take me home abbey ryan looked down at the whitefaced girl in the wheelchair she was still dressed in the stained shorts and tshirt shed worn all day she looked weary beyond belief in pain and looking to a future that held nothing but hard work and something twisted inside ryan that hadnt been twisted in a long time something deep and strong and urgent it was only that he felt sorry for her he told himself harshly but he found his hand wandering to touch abbeys dusky curls youre hurting just take me home ryan abbey said ted cant drive or id ask him to take me stay here he said i cant you should be in hospital yourself ryan let his fingers drift though her curls absently almost as if he wasnt noticing what he was doing but he was noticing he was very definitely noticing the touch was doing strange things to his insides and where would that leave jack and janet abbey demanded ignoring the feel of ryans fingers or trying to ignore them i have to milk in the morning ill do that you cant if you can do it ryan said gently so can i you just said that your life is mine for a week that includes your cows its not necessary it is ryan look im a country boy from way back ryan told her exasperated i can milk a cow and i have your medical training this is my honeymoon youre supposed to be on dr wittner i dont offer every girl a honeymoon so i suggest you just take yourself to bed and get on with it if only she could abbey looked up into ryans face and thought of the impossibility of doing what hed suggested taking a honeymoon taking a holiday work never stops she said wearily never dont you know that ryan henry it does abbey he said gently it must only it didnt it hadnt even now before ryan finished speaking there was an urgent screech of brakes outside the casualty entrance three seconds later the glass doors opened and a young man burst in he looked wildly around dishevelled and frantic and his eyes focussed on ryan quick oh please come quick tessas having a baby shell have to go to cairns nonsense outside the labour ward ryan and abbey were neck deep in argument inside tessa ludlow was neck deep in labour hell abbey i cant deliver her here shell deliver herself then for heavens sake ryan all you have to do is go in there check dilatation check the foetal heart and stand around to catch in fact sisters probably done all the busy work for you while youre hanging around here procrastinating ryan raked his fingers through his hair it was true he was procrastinating with good reason abbey im a surgeon an orthopaedic surgeon how many babies do you think ive delivered they dont let you through medical school unless youve delivered a few abbey said firmly unless us training is very different to what it is here but that was years ago i havent delivered a baby since its what you said about milkingits like riding a bicycle abbey said promptly once learned never forgotten nothings changed unless im very much mistaken babies still come out just the same way they did a hundred years ago ryan get in there and deliver that baby but im not even registered here ryan gave a sound that was practically a moan abbey if something goes wrong i can get sued for millions you know if something does go wrong and youre standing out here in the corridor arguing about money then you could be sued for even more abbey abbey sighed and took a deep breath what is it you want me to deliver the baby ryan is that what youre saying your offer was for the easy stuff only well i guess i can reach the bed from the wheelchair if i really try maybe if you hold me up under my arms ryan glared go on ryan abbey managed a smile you remember that day you wanted your tooth to come out so you could spend your toothfairy money at the fête the next day it was wobblybut only just what on earth you showed determination then abbey i must have been all of ten years old no difference abbey said blithely you tied yourself up with string and then made me slam the door and you didnt even yell come on ryan thats the stuff youre made of wheres your determination now the labour ward door opened the night sister stood gazing from one doctor to the other in exasperation have you two sorted out whos delivering this baby yet she asked sternly because if you dont figure it out soon im going to get all the credit and thatd never do now would it doctors she winked at abbey ryan gave another groan rolled up his sleevesboth metaphorically and physicallyand went to deliver a baby in fact it wasnt as easy as abbey had foreseen second stage took far too long it was a firsttime birth the young mother was exhausted and frightened and it took all ryans bedside skills to calm her ryan finally effected a safe delivery but only after applying forceps funny that he remembered how abbey was right it was like riding a bicycle or like loving abbey the thought flashed into ryans mind as he stared down at the red and yowling infant in his hands and he found himself smiling at the thought abbey had bullied him into delivering this baby and to his astonishment hed found the experience deeply satisfying tessa and her husband were gazing at him as if hed just personally produced their miracle and the baby was warm and healthy and full of new life in his hands how many times in the past had abbey bullied him into doing something hed loved once hed tried come on ryan take your shoes off you cant catch crabs properly unless your toes ooze mud ryan inserted a few neat stitches in tessas perineum checked his baby over thoroughlyodd how it felt like hisand with a chest expanded a few inches from an hour ago went to find abbey she was curled up on a couch in the waiting room in casualty and she was fast asleep ryan stared down at abbey for a long long moment the same abbey she looked a real waif here dirty bedraggled and her leg in the huge white dressing his mother had called her trash abbey was no such thing abbey was some lady ryan conceded staring down at her in wonder she was a lady with iron determination and courage to match her heart a friend to be proud of what would his life have been if hed stayed at sapphire cove ryan found himself wondering in the background he heard his newly delivered baby start to cry a nurse moved swiftly down the corridor there were coos and chuckles and a low conversation between die young father and the nurse they all knew each other here this hospital was about as different from the hospital where ryan worked as he could possibly get hed go crazy working for a week here he told himself no research no colleagues bouncing ideas off each other no social life outside the hospital no concerts art galleries or restaurants how could abbey stand it he looked down at the sleeping girl on the couch and a shaft of pain shot through hima pain so fierce he almost staggered a pain of sheer absolute want he wanted to gather her to him protect her from the pain he saw on her face take a load off her shoulders that seemed too heavy for any woman to bear it wasnt on this was crazy thinking ryan wasnt about to walk away from a fantastic career and lifestyle just because he was being sentimental about an old friend there was a soft step behind him ryan turned to see ted lurking in the doorway ghoullike she looks at deaths door ted said with a certain amount of relish youre not going to take her home now are you doc shell fight me if i dont seems to me theres not a lot of fight left in her ted said morosely now if i was a young fella id just gather her up and take her to bed then he coloured i mean put her to bed like ryan smiled he turned to look down at abbey and his smile faded a sudden image of what that might be like pierced his senses to take abbey to bed no way that was the last thing he needed the last thing abbey needed he was an engaged man abbey had responsibilities bed pure and simplebed in the oldfashioned sensewas what this lady needed with a wrench ryan forced his mind to practicalities will janet cope if abbey doesnt come home he asked dubiously ive already rung janet ted told him when i found our doc wittner asleep like she wont worry janets a good un but the baby and ive told her ill do the milking but shell panic janet says young jacks asleep janet can cope with the little uns breakfast and the milking dont need to get done again till morning ted told him and ive got ideas about that so lets worry about the morning in the morning sisters got a bed made up in room four for doc wittner and one in room seven for you so go tuck her in and then hit the sack yourself he eyed ryan shrewdly looks to me you need a bit of shuteye almost as much as doc wittner he did ryan acknowledged the pressures of the day were crowding in threatening to overwhelm him with the time change in international travel hed missed two nights sleep hed hit abbeys bicycle and hurt abbey hed coped with his fathers heart attack hed delivered a baby it was time to call it quits and do as he was told but first he nodded acknowledgement to ted and stooped to lift abbey into his arms she was featherlightfar too slim for a woman of her age he half expected her to wake when he lifted her but the aftereffects of the morphine and shock from the accident were taking their toll there was no argument from abbey she sighed in her sleep and nestled easily into his arms her breasts moulding themselves against his chest as if she were meant to lie there as if she were part of him ryan strode down the corridor with his sleeping burden knowing that things were changing inside him that he had no idea how to set right again worry about it in the morning he told himself firmly these feelings the feel of abbey against him the trace of perfume in her hair the way her breasts curved in against him as she lay in his arms in total trust what he was feeling was just a result of a crazy two days he had to sleep in the morning he could go back to being ryan henry hugely successful orthopaedic surgeon and future husband to felicity all over again in the morning chapter five abbey woke to breakfast there was a smell of bacon wafting around her and her nose twitched in appreciation before she opened her eyes when she did lift a cautious eyelid the first thing she saw was a breakfast tray the second was ryan henry well well ryan was lifting the lid from her eggs and bacon and nodding his approval of what lay underneath youve decided to join the land of the living excellent id have let you sleep longer but i wanted to bully you into breakfast before clinic ive heard you should always eat a big breakfast on the first day of your honeymoon its medically recommended i you abbey winced and stirredand then stared this was crazy last night shed settled down on a couch in the waiting room now she cast a wary glance at ryan and then cautiously lifted her bedclothes and yelped is something wrong ryan enquired blandly my clothes abbey hauled her bedcovers up to her nose and glared what happened to my clothes you sound as if youre naked ryan complained which considering the amount of trouble sister and i had getting you into a hospital gown is a tad unappreciative i know for a honeymoon you really should have something sheer and sexypreferably blackbut im afraid hospital green was all we could come up with abbey was no longer listening she couldnt care less what she was wearing it was the identity of the person whod dressed heror rather whod undressed herthat was important here sister dressed me she asked cautiously sitting up with her bedclothes still up to her neck i helped but only as far as was decent ryan smiled you dont remember your clothes were disgusting i was afraid theyd infect your scratches if we left you in them any longer my tshirt i didnt like it ryan said as if that clinched the matter and your shorts were torn already what have you done with my tshirt and shorts abbey demanded in a voice that was loaded with portent for answer ryan pointed to a pair of scissors on the bedside table all gone it was an imitation of teds voice that he used when discussing a death pull of ghoullike relish we disturbed you less by cutting them off ted took em away to use as dusters down in the morgue we figured thats the best place for them now if i were you id eat some breakfast before it gets cold considering the amount of trouble cooks gone to on your behalf letting this lot get cold would be a real shame ryan i want my clothes theyre in a million pieces ryan handed her a slice of toast bite abbey bit and glared problem ryan enquired politely he stood back with his arms folded and watched herdoctor watching interesting specimen ryan was dressed in fresh trousers and an opennecked shortsleeved shirt his wavy brown hair was neatly brushed he looked like hed had about twelve hours sleep instead of a scant six and he was showered and freshly shaved ryan henry was a doctor in charge of his world again which abbey definitely wasnt however she was hungry she bit into her toast once more trying to get her thoughts in order thered been janets casserole last night but shed eaten hardly any before theyd been called to help sam and the smell was fabulous what are you going to do about my clothes it was tricky to talk with a mouthful of toast when one was concentrating on glaring at the same time but abbey managed it no sweat nothing ryan told her they were appalling they certainly dont deserve burial honours if thats what youre suggesting abbey didnt smile she concentrated fiercely on her breakfast not looking at ryan for some reason the sight of ryan henry standing beside her bed surveying her with an air of proprietary interest unnerved her completely abbey lifted a piece of bacon and inspected it from all angles and decided not to take offence at the bacon in it went they were the only clothes i have she said between mouthfuls surely not ryans eyebrows rose in polite disbelief abbey i know youre poor but i find it hard to believe you spend your entire life as a doctor a farmer and a mother dressed in the one tshirt ok smartyboots abbey glowered i meant they were the only clothes i have here ryan you were supposed to take me home you passed out before i could i never send unconscious patients home its against medical ethics and youve been unconscious for over twelve hours i was asleep you knew very well i was just asleep abbey lifted a fork and attacked her eggand then paused with her fork halfway to her mouth did you say twelve hours she swivelled to look at the bedside clock and gasped nine oh glory its nine oclock ryan how could you her fork clattered onto her plate forgotten and her legs swung sideways to be blocked by ryan so where do you think youre going home abbey said in a distressed voice ryan its nine oclock the cows will be frantic and janet will try to milk them herself and theres no one to look after jack while she does even if she could manage the milking and teds organised your cows ted i intended to milk them but ted tells me theres any number of local farmers willing to roster themselves to milk your herd ryan said his hands moved to her shoulders and he held her still brooking no argument ted says the locals think the world of you if you need help all you have to do is ask this morning ted asked on your behalf he was inundated with offers no abbeys face creased in distress i wont ask for help everyone did so much when john died when he was in the coma i was pregnant and they helped so much everyone helped i dont need help any more we can stand on our own feet you mean you dont need their help ever again ryan asked no i dont i wont yet ted tells me theres not a person living within a thirtymile radius of sapphire cove who doesnt use your help ryan said thoughtfully you do house calls at all hours youve bullied the government into subsidies so this hospital could be built youve given the community medical treatment thats never been available before ted says you give and give and giveand everyone wants desperately to give something back whats the old adage here abbey its better to give than receive well sometimes its only fair to let the giving be both ways you dont understand abbey shook her head and pushed her tousled curls back from her face janet will ive talked to janet ryan told her i was out there an hour ago checking everything was going ok ive told her im keeping you in hospital today to give that leg a chance to settle if youre good then you can go home tomorrow ive organised marcia over the road to come and give janet a hand with jackif necessary shell do that for the next week so you can restand the local farmers are arranging a roster system with the milking until your legs ok until i say your legs ok and janet janet will hate it she was upset ryan admitted but i told her your health was at stake i gave her the same lecture about giving and receiving as i gave you and shes content shed never agree she has i dont believe you but ryan wasnt listening hed picked up the bedside phone and was dialling let her tell you herself dont believe me oh ye of little faith talk to janet and thirty seconds later abbey replaced the receiver and stared up at ryan totally bewildered i dont know how you did that pure charm ryan smiled his most enigmatic smile and pointed to abbeys breakfast now eat he hauled a chair up and sat himself downa man at ease with his world there are things i need help with now abbey just keep eating while i fire questions like im not asking anything while youre not eating ok ok im eating abbey shoved a mouthful of egg home and frowned i dont understand any of this you cant just organise my life its not your life now ryan pointed out we made a bargain i drove too fast i hurt your leg and im paying youre on my honeymoon im on your duties you but abbey was no longer listening another anxiety had just crowded in ryan hows sam hows your father it was a fast change of tack but it was the way abbeys mind was working leapfrogging from one worry to another dads ok ryans air of a man in charge slipped a little i have the feeling what happened last night was crescendo angina rather than a fullblown heart attack as hes settled fast but the damage thats already been done well i wish i could say hes fine but hes holding his own he needs bypass surgery and he needs it now he wont go i pushed it this morning how long have you been up abbey demanded off on another track and ryan shrugged since five i gave our jellyfish victim more morphine at five the pain takes a long time to wear off from those damned things after that it was hardly worth going back to bed my father was awake so we talked about bypasses that and other things he wont do it abbey nodded i told you ryan he wants to die thats crazy its not crazy think about it all he has is a son who hasnt been near him for seventeen years oh for heavens sake abbey shook her head as she saw the rigid look on ryans face ok i know this is none of my business apart from your father tell me what else you need help with ryans set look eased a little did i say needed help yes you did and it floored me abbey said bluntly the great ryan henry needing help ryans anger gave way to bewilderment at the sudden laughter in abbeys eyes if there was one thing he was unaccustomed to it was being teased he shook his head abbey for some reason am i wrong or am i getting the impression that you think im an autocratic selfopinionated yep all of the above im not no i suppose youre a really thoughtful considerate human being i might be well if youre so thoughtful you didnt by any chance abbey cast him a hopeful look bring me some clothes when you went out to see janet nope there you are then autocratic unfeeling inconsiderate ryan sighed he and abbey seemed destined to spend the morning sparring ok abbey enough just fill me in on a few histories here i need a verbal changeover your patient notes are nigh on unintelligible i guess thats because im the only one who ever reads them abbey admitted contritely im not used to handing over tell you what find me some clothes and ill do a ward round with you and hand over personally youre not getting dressed and youre not going anywhere ryan no what if i stay in a wheelchair abbey said meekly and promise to act subservient all the time abbey please she smiled and her smile lit up her eyes it really was the loveliest smile ryan caved in he always had he stared down at her baulked and baffled and then he sighed ok abbey ten minutes ill bring a wheelchair and a dressinggown back here in ten minutes but if you havent eaten every scrap of your breakfast youre not going anywhere yes sir sapphire cove bush nursing hospital boasted fifteen beds twelve of which were full four of those were nursing home patients which left eight acute cases to discuss all eight patients were agog to see their accustomed doctor being pushed around in a wheelchair her bandaged leg stuck straight out before her on a support boardand being propelled by a man many of them vaguely recognised from almost twenty years ago ryan henry old mr thomlinson gave a wheezy chuckle and held out his hand in greeting well well back in your old partnership i see partnership you and abbey bert thomlinson looked from ryan down to abbey and grinned at the memory caught the pair of you swimming out to the reef and pinching crayfish from my traps when you were about twelve and eight years old apiece like two little fish you were diving down and hauling crays out of the trap you were letting the little ones go you told me and gave me a lecture on catching babies he chortled at the time i felt like tanning the hides of the pair of you but you know what ive never kept an undersized lobster since he broke into a fit of coughing and abbey clucked reproof thats what you get for telling tales out of school bert thomlinson she looked up at ryan berts recovering from two nasty patches of pneumonia affecting both lungs caught no doubt from going fishing late at night and not getting out of wet clothes and i dont believe youve reformed bert ill bet you were still catching undersized crays i never would bert said wounded the look of you back then abbey no higher than my waist standing there with your fingers all bloody from getting nipped and making me sound like a child murderer for catching baby crays and young ryan standing in front of you ready to defend you to the death he fell back on his pillows and smiled well it does me good to see the pair of you back together again even if it took a busted leg to do it that was pretty much the opinion of the entire older population of the hospital ryan found he was recognised with real pleasure and he also discovered that he liked the sensation very much the best greeting though was from his father ryan only had to walk into his fathers room for the old mans eyes to light up with delight double delight when he saw abbey hows the leg sam demanded reaching out and gripping ryans hand between his attached tubes abbey saw the gesture with resignation did ryan really not realise how much his father loved him did he really not realise that sam needed a lot more than duty letters from his beloved son better than your heart sam you have to get this bypass abbey said bluntly so ryan says but theres no have to about it its my heart i can do what i like with it like let it stop abbey abbey took a deep breath she glanced uncertainly up at ryan and then turned her attention solely to ryans father and took a chance sam would it help if ryan told you hell look after your farm while you have the operation and that hell stay until youre on the mend again silence ryan said nothing that didnt mean ryans mind wasnt working though good grief what was abbey saying abbey was just committing him here committing him to stay here for a month or more but abbey i cant he said blankly of course you cant sams voice was tired and bleak and absolutely final thats stupid abbey ryan has his career back in the usa he just cant dump it to look after me and he has this ladyfelicity isnt it son felicity wont want to stick around here with a sick old man felicity wouldnt of course she wouldnt felicity was an oncologista cancer specialistas expert in her field as ryan was in his shed had trouble slotting a honeymoon into her busy schedule anyway to extend the honeymoon for a few weeks impossible impossible for both of them felicity was needed back at work as much as ryan but sam was fading back into the pillows and his grip on ryans hand had eased it was as if for a brief moment sam had allowed himself to show his need for his son and now he was schooling himself to let go and abbeys face was absolutely expressionless ryans gut tightened hell there was only so much of this a man could take it was an impossible thing to ask it was impossible to stay but with sams hand in his and abbey looking at him like that it was impossible for him to go i meant i cant see why not ryan said stronglyroughlyand his hand tightened on his fathers reestablishing the link reestablishing the need i can keep up with my research work over here theres articles i need to write up and i have my laptop computer with me i have everything i need of course he had his laptop with him to go on a honeymoon without work was unthinkable to stay away from work for more than two weeks was unthinkable the reorganisation that would have to be done was unbelievable and there was richard crogin to worry about richard was after ryans job and if ryan was away but suddenly all that mattered was the link between his fathers hand and hisand the luminous glow that was beaming straight up at him from abbey you mean it abbey asked breathlessly oh ryan ryans resolution firmed of course i mean it he looked down at his father if you agree to the surgery then ill stay for at least a month sam blinked he looked up at his son in bewilderment and abbey felt her delight fade maybe it wasnt enough abbeys own heart sank for ryan to promise a month there was nothing promised for the end of that month there was no commitment to a future for the old man in that one month a couple of weeks of which sam would spend in hospital in cairns maybe sam still wouldnt agree but sam was looking from ryan to abbey with eyes that were lightening by the minute there was a spark of interest glowing in their depths that abbey hadnt seen for years what about your felicity sam asked his son ill talk to felicity ryan said heavily we might have to reorganise things put the wedding off i dont know was ryan imagining it or was there a tiny hopeful note behind sams words ill have to talk to her maybe shell come out well get married and shell go back before me that might be the best plan then again felicity might decide she wanted a real honeymoon and put everything off until they could take more time away together which would be a year or more from now it didnt matter the thought of a delay to their weddingand its seeming irrelevancemade ryan frown it didnt matter if their wedding was put off why never mind he could think of felicity later for now there was his fathers agreement to gain his fathers health that was the important thing that was why he didnt have room to worry about felicity there couldnt be any other reason you need to agree dad he said and met his fathers eyes directly i want you to have this surgery the way your heart is nowwell you could have a fullblown heart attack at any minute and you could die and i badly dont want that to happen you meant that of course i mean it and he did for twenty years ryan had been carrying the look of his father as he and his mother had boarded the plane away from here his fathers look had been blank expressionless andryan had thoughtuncaring abbey had told him that he was wrong to believe his father uncaring and suddenly he believed abbey his father loved him and it was a damned good feeling he didnt want to lose that he didnt want to lose sam now when he had just discovered that he had a father after all a real father not a pen at the end of a series of duty letters and sam was looking from abbey to ryan and back again and smiling well i guess id better have that surgery after all he whispered you say youll stay a month a month well anything can happen in a month sam said ambiguously its worth taking a risk on abbey didnt see ryan again for another few hours he settled her back into bedonce more refusing her request for clothesand gave instructions for the nursing staff not to let her out of bed then he took himself off to do her clinic ryan came back into the hospital at eleven when the ambulance arrived to transport his father to cairns but by then abbey was dead to the world it was as if abbeys exhaustion of the last few monthsor maybe the last few yearshad finally caught up with her that and the shock of the accident the day before let her sleep the sleep of the dead janet and jack and her cows and farm were in safe hands her clinic was in ryans hands sam was having his bypass for once all was right with her world she slept she woke briefly at lunch to find eileen hovering over her with orders to see she ate every mouthful and then she slept again when she woke once more ryan was standing over her bed smiling down at her with satisfaction if you dont wake up soon youll miss bedtime he warned and abbey managed a sleepy smile it cant be bedtime no ones bullied me into dinner yet ryan looked at his watch youre right its fivethirty dinner at six and bedtime at seven abbey nodded the idea had immediate appeal i dont know why im doing this she murmured its not like i was really hurt yesterday no youre telling me youre not aching in every bone in your body truly abbey abbey stirred and checked herself out every bone well maybe every bone certainly complained yeah well its only bruising i know ryan touched her lightly on the cheeka touch that sent abbeys senses screaming plus the fact that youre exhausted he hauled a chair over and sat down abbey you cant keep going like this he said gently ive seen your medical workload now this community needs two doctorsor at least one and a half and with jack to care for and the farm to run you should be the half no abbey shook her head with decision no way because someone else would take over some of the limelight because you like being the towns only doctor thats unfair abbey said firmly ryan id let go if i could but finding another doctor to move to a rural area even an area as beautiful as sapphire cove doctors want big hospitals and specialists on call and private schools and universities on tap for their children abbey told him i thought your mother would have drilled into you what an unsuitable place sapphire cove is to live i shouldnt have to she had ryan flinched but even so abbey even so i cant afford to work less i have debts johns debts thats none of your business maybe but i had a talk to one of your patients this afternoon ryan told her mr ellis the local bank manager he came in with shingles shingles abbey screwed up her nose her attention diverted oh no the poor man shingles is so painful did you start him on acyclovir she pushed herself up on her pillows ryan itll be a new treatment since you trained you must start him on that in the first twentyfour hours it really does stop shingles in its tracksquarters the time of discomfort if you havent been around as a general practitioner for i know all about acyclovir ryan told her and then smiled at her look of disbelief dont worry i know im out of touch with general practice but ive figured a really efficient way of sounding as if i know what im talking about while im seeing your patients ive hooked up to the internet on the internet i can play doctorpatient in a virtual hospital all i have to do is type shingles and out comes all the latest treatments and references to all the current literature excerpts and précis included you mean you leave the patient i have my laptop computer on my desk he told her smugly i tell the patient im recording details of their case as i go and all the time im asking what the heck the latest treatment for shingles is then i do a fast search of mimson compact discand i find the drug dosages and brand names and everything i need to make myself sound intelligent oh and by the way he smiled in case you were worrying i rang the medical board and theyve given me emergency registration as an interim measure oh ryan abbeys hand flew up to her mouth i forgot understandable he smiled again his lazy caring smile that ran right through her youre not well abbey and not just because of the accident youve run yourself into the ground and mr ellis says you shouldnt have been discussing me with my bank manager abbey said fretfully and ryan shook his head i havent been discussing you with anyone ive simply been listening while one patient after another has come in berated me for knocking you off your bicycle and then told me how worried they are about you and mr ellis has done more than that he tells me the debts youre paying off are gambling debts incurred when john was under such pressure he didnt know what he was doing he says hes advised you strongly to declare yourself bankrupt wipe the slate clean and start again how can i do that simple find yourself a lawyer and do it he also said you cant lose the farm your homes exempt and with janet and jack living there too its doubly insured he said you could have stayed living where you were and have jack growing up with people knowing his father owed them money he never repaid abbey said simply no thank you this is my problem ryan and ill thank you to butt out of it she swallowed but the expression on her face of grim determination didnt waver who who else did you see in clinic and ryan stared down baffled it had seemed so simple when brian ellis had explained it to him abbey should declare herself bankrupt get rid of her debts and then find another doctor to take over at least half her workload and ryan could walk away with a clear conscience not yet he couldnt not for a month but at the end of the month when his father was recovered from his surgery ryan wanted to be able to walk away from here knowing that his friends security was assured and how could he do that if she was going to be obstinate and proud and stubborn as a mule but he didnt want her any other way tell me who else you saw in clinic abbey insisted and ryan blinked he wasnt used to this he was accustomed to being in charge to people coming to him when they were in trouble and demanding his help well abbey had accepted his helpalbeit grudginglyfor a week but not after that and he found himself thinking how impossible it would be to live with himself knowing hed left her like this burdened with work burdened with debt and responsibility as i said most cases i found i could handle he told her forcing his mind back to the patients hed seen i had old angus harvey with an infection on his penis walked in and saidstraightfaced doc theres a ring round me old bloke and it aint lipstick that was the hardest part of my day trying to keep a straight face and treat his infection at the same time you sound like you enjoyed it abbey said wonderingly and ryan grinned to tell you the truth i did oh and i saw mrs miller she came in to get her ulcer dressed again he shook his head she must just like doctors abbey the ulcer didnt need dressing did you ask her what was worrying her abbey asked anxiously and ryan frowned i told you she wanted her ulcer dressed and i told you theres something else troubling marg miller abbey shook her head men you have no intuition at all its not her ulcer shes worried about its her son theres something wrong with ian im sure of it mrs miller wouldnt worry like this for herself he must be in some sort of trouble her son ryan frowned ian miller i think i remember him hes my agea bit older thats right hes living in sydney and you think he might be ill i have no idea abbey said with asperity if youd asked you might have found out ians not my patient hes not mine either i havent seen him for years but his wellbeing is affecting my patient and therefore i worry thats what a good general practitioner does i wouldnt know ryan said dryly im an orthopaedic surgeon remember he paused waiting for comment waiting for abbey to apologise no apology was forthcoming the silence stretched out to an embarrassing length clearly abbeys opinion of orthopaedic surgeonsor one orthopedic surgeon in particularwas less than flattering ill telephone her abbey said at last no ryan shook his head if you really think theres something happening thats serious then ill telephone and talk to her again you wouldnt consider going out there and talking to her face to face abbey ryan said explosively dont push me i can only try she ventured a teasing grin and you can only say no ill go if i have time but i will telephone ryan promised a man driven against the ropes he sighed and you might like to know janets agreed for me to replace her hip next monday i can organise it by then next abbey stared you mean you will do it i said id do it why should you doubt me but next monday abbey frowned ryan its only monday now thats a whole week away ill be back working by then no you wont ryan said roughly theres been a change in plan janet will need at least three weeks before she can think of looking after jack again so you stay home full time and look after jack for two weeks and i organise help we need help for me for the next two weeks and then for you when sam comes home from hospital help abbey shook her head dazed theres a locum arriving tomorrow steve pryor ive rung a few contacts in brisbane and they tell me hes good were lucky hes free at short notice disregarding her aching bones abbey sat up in bed with a jolt ryan henry you cant do this i cant afford no but i can but i cant abbey its my job im sharing for a bit here ryan reminded her not yours you agreed to work the week yes ryan agreed his voice gentling and im not going back on that promise i promised to look after your practice for a week but dads surgery is scheduled for the day after tomorrow and i want to be in cairns during his operation and maybe for twentyfour hours afterwards oh ryan abbeys face creased in distress of course i didnt think of that but i can look after things by the day after tomorrow ive organised tomorrow too ryan said blandly about my honeymoon ryan just shut up and listen he told her in a voice that brooked no argument abbey there is no need for you to get your knickers in a knot about my arrangements tomorrow im taking you out of here and driving you to your honeymoon destination honeymoon abbey stared she was starting to feel as if her world was tilting sideways on its axis and any minute now shed fall right off well felicity and i werent intending to stay with dad for our honeymoon ryan told her felicity organised us a place on the beach ten minutes drive from here thats where youre going tomorrow but ryan even if i could i dont want to abbey wailed i want my little jack i want janet now how did i know youd say that ryan grinned thats all organised i agree with you that janet could use a rest as well as you and id like her fit to face surgery so i rang the owners of the place we booked and theyve swapped the booking from a onebedroom to a twobedroom unit so ive given the same ultimatum to janet as i give to you pack and be ready for your honeymoon by tomorrow morning or ill pick you up and take you in what youre wearing at the time his grin deepened and i mean that abbey wittner then his grin faded at the look of dazed incredulity on abbeys face whats wrong to ryans astonishment abbeys eyes were filling with tears abbey for heavens sake a holiday you really mean a holiday abbey choked ryan i havent had a holiday for years you cant really mean i dont deserve this i think you do abbey ryan said quietly he stooped and kissed her on the cheek his hand came down and cupped the curve of her grazed and bandaged cheek wiping away an errant tear if anyone deserves a honeymoon you doand its all my pleasure to be able to give you one and what felicity would say when she realised hed given away the magic honeymoon destination shed spent days researching he hated to think felicity however seemed a very long way away felicity was for tomorrow chapter six ryan appeared at about nine the next morning with a youngish scholarly man in tow it didnt take a genius to work out this was ryans new locum there was a stethoscope around the young mans neck and an owlish look of anxiety on his face abbey wasnt in her ward ryan tracked her down in the childrens ward why arent you in bed ryan glowered from the doorway and then relented enough to smile at the little girl in the bed hi leith still feeling better leith kinley managed a wan smile she was a regular here a chronic asthmatic shed been admitted into hospital more times than abbey could remember and each time her attacks seemed to worsen at the other end of the hospital abbey had slept though leiths admission last night but the nurses had told her this morning that ryan had had a hard time getting her stabilised ryan had been up all night abbey wouldnt have thought it to look at him now he seemed bright and alert and raring to go hey leith ive brought another doctor for you to meet ryan gave abbey a smile but he spoke directly to the little girl in the bed leith kinley was terrified of her asthma attacks and as abbey watched the way ryan treated her she knew ryan was aware of the childs terror leith this is dr steve pryor dr pryor this is miss leith kinley and the lady beside her is an escapee from another ward dr abbey wittner to abbeys astonishment and pleasure steve pryor leaned over and solemnly shook leiths hand first amazing a locum who treated patientseven child patientsas humans and greeted them on a needs basis where on earth had ryan found someone like steve are you ready to go abbey ryans dangerous smile twinkled out or do i have to carry out my threat despite your threats im going nowhere in a hospital gown abbey said with dignity and ryan nodded of course not theres a dress on your bed i chose it myself you chose a dress i mean from your wardrobe he said sanguinely janet was busy supervising milking when i dropped in you could go and put it on he added politely then ryan turned back to leith ignoring everyone else he stooped and took leiths two little hands between his bigger ones while abbey watched still hornswoggled leith i know last nights asthma attack scared you it scared all of us this morning ive been doing some hard thinking about how we can improve matters and ive been talking to your mum and dad this morning abbey glanced disbelievingly at her watch ryan had been up all night with an asthmatic child hed been out to the farm to find her a dress then hed talked to an ill childs parents and finally found time to meet a new doctor all this by nine oclock also shed heard ryan doing a ward round at about seven your mum and dad agree that we need to do something more than just give you medicine ryan was saying leith we need to improve your lung capacity make your lungs bigger if you like so you can get more air leith frowned how do i do that she whispered swimming ryan said promptly and if you agree your first swimming lesson is this morning im taking dr wittner to the beach and if you like you can come too you can have a gentle swim with me showing you what to do to build your lungs and then ill bring you back here i cant go home ill bring you back to the hospital for lunch and a really good sleep then if your breathing is ok your mum and dad will take you home tonight and weve agreed that your mum and dad will take you swimming every day for a month after a month well think about whether its doing you good or not abbey stared shed suggested this first rule for asthmatics was to attempt to increase lung capacity but leith had been reluctant to try swimming lessons and leiths parents had always been adamant that they hadnt time something had changed ryan had said leiths parents had agreed hed bulldozed them abbey decided hed bulldozed them in the same way he bulldozed everyone else he got his own way just by going in with force well it had worked and something else had changed leiths reluctance leith was looking up at ryan with a tremulous smile i can go swimming with you now with me and with dr wittner and maybe with dr winners baby jack and jacks grandma is that ok ryan turned to abbey and pointed to his watch what are you hanging around here for dr wittner be ready in five minutes or face the consequences ryans honeymoon retreat was the kind of paradise abbey had never dreamed of the sign at the end of the beach road simply said bliss the word painted with small black lettering on a cream sign and discreetly tucked in between the coconut palms abbey had heard of this place but had never been here few locals had and for one good reason they couldnt afford it from the time ryan nosed his car into the wide white sweep of the entrance the place screamed money at its most tasteful reception was vasta cavern of pale grey marble with great wooden ceiling fans stirring the warm air straight from the sea and huge cane chairs and settees with cushions that just begged to be sat on the whole of reception was open to the sea breeze like a vast canopy on one side was the white sandy road leading into the place once up the gracious curving stepsassisted by doormen who knew just the right welcoming touchall you could see was the sea sapphire cove was lovely and bliss showed it off at its loveliest abbey refused point blank to use the wheelchair ryan produced she hopped up the steps on crutches and gazed in awe out to sea as ryan booked in even reception wasnt your standard hotel counter a sleek and beaming lady immaculately groomed and wonderfully welcoming tactfully led ryan to a small cane desk while abbey and leith gazed around in awe you wait until i tell my sister ive been here leith breathed one of the kids at school said his brother tried to come here and got kicked out oh doc wittner do you think dr henry can afford it he must be able to abbey said doubtfully i wonder where janet theyre waiting for us in our villa ryan said appearing at their elbow like a benevolent genie he looked down at abbeys tight face in concern are you tired would you like me to carry you no ryan we cant i cant abbey gazed around in consternation ryan this place will cost you a mint i cant possibly pay you back for this maybe you already have ryan said gently and he cupped her chin in his hand and tilted her face forcing her eyes up to meet his abbey we both practise medicine you choose to practise here for peanuts and because of you people like me are free to practise elsewhere for sums of money that would probably seem to you to be obscene quite simply thats what i earn abbey it isnt fair but thats the way it is as a doctor youve cared for my father for the past four years and im grateful you work a damned sight harder than i do for a lot less so shut up now and let me balance the books a little and without waiting for another protest he simply swung her up in his arms and headed down the path towards the sea come on then young leith lets see if we can hang ten before lunch they didnt hang ten hanging toes over the end of a surfboard here would have meant an immediate bellyflop into the water sheltered from open ocean by the great barrier reef the surf at sapphire cove was nonexistent the water was as calm as a mill pond but it was far more lovely than any mill pond could ever be sparkling blue and stretching on for ever the farmer whod done the milking for janet had at ryans request brought janet and jack here straight afterwards janet met abbey with a look of wonder abbeys motherinlaw was so stunned that she was almost ready to enjoy herself to abbeys astonishment she donned a pair of faded black bathers and was the first to hit the water whooping with a delight abbey had never heard from her ryan says im to enjoy myself or hell take you home she told abbey she grinned and he says if you go home youre headed for a breakdown so with a threat like that hanging over my head whats a woman to do she abandoned her walking stick at the waters edge forgot her arthritic hip and prepared to follow orders to the letter she and jack whooped and splashed in the shallows like two children instead of one staid grandma with grandchild and abbey ryan showed her to their unit which was right on the waters edge and unbelievably luxurious allowed her two minutes to change into her bathing costume and then carried her to the shoreline here he set her down in the shallows on a cutaway seata seat with no legsand organised another seat for her foot to rest on his coup de grâce was a large green garbage bag which he taped over her massive bandage there you cant get your bandage wet if you try and then he was off scooping up the wondering leith and carrying the little girl out on her first ever serious swimming lesson abbey was left with her mouth open stunned as a beached whale for a transformation a genie in a bottle could hardly have done better she gazed about her in awe the beach resort was unobtrusively netted way out there was no threat of marine stingers here janet was lying full length in the shallows her grandson crowing in delight as he crawled all around her it was impossible to tell who had the biggest smile janet or jack and leith the wan little girl was listening seriously to what ryan was telling her and then putting her face in the water and blowing bubbles not such a big deal maybebut abbey knew how frightened the little girl was of new experiences and she also knew leith wasnt accustomed to water all of themjanet jack and leithwere putting their trust absolutely in ryan henry ryan had told janet she must drop her isolated grieving and here she was doing just that hed told leith to leave her terror behind and the child had obeyed and what of abbey it was tuesday morning for heavens sake if anyone had told abbey the week before that this tuesday shed be lying on the beach with her feet up she would have laughed in disbelief yet here she was she lay back and watched them her jack her beloved janet her ryan the thought brought her up with a jolt what had her heart meant by that it had been an involuntary thought but it stayed insidious in its appeal her ryan he was no such thing once upon a time shed been proprietorial about ryan henry hes my friend shed told her mother and when ryan had gone off with the big boys to play cricket or football or other boy stuff it had been all abbey could do not to appear jealous well he wasnt her ryan now he was engaged to be married to a lady called felicity who abbey gathered could appear at any minute to claim her own and abbey certainly couldnt let her jealousy show then jealousy abbey examined the word from all angles how could she possibly be jealous of felicity after all she hardly knew ryan any more he had left here almost twenty years ago he was rich and successful and and practically american but she looked out to where ryans tanned muscled body was glistening in the morning sun the water running in rivulets down his broad back and catching the rays of the sun across the sea he looked across and laughed at her his eyes crinkling in just the same way they had when hed first met her a long time ago some older girls had been teasing the tiny abbey on her way to school and one of them had tipped her lunch out into the dirt abbey had sat down tearstained and angry trying to separate the dirt from her sandwiches then all of a sudden ryan had been there kid i have six whole sandwiches two chocolate bars and a game of football at lunchtime hed told her i cant possibly manage to eat everything in the time available and if i did id get fat lets feed your sandwiches to the seagulls and divvy up my lunch between us abbey had looked up through tears at this big kindly boy with the twinkle and laughter behind his eyes and her heart had been his ever since and damn the man just had to look at her now penny for them abbeys head jerked up shed been playing with a trickle of wet sand as shed been thinking and hadnt seen ryan splashing up through the shallows lesson over leith had gone to join the fun grandma grandson and now leith all pretending to be whales penny what are you thinking abbey ryan sat himself beside her and his broad wet shoulder touched hers skin against skin a shudder of sensation ran though her and ryan saw it youre cold no no im not how how did the lesson go brilliantly he smiled and put his arm around her a gesture of affection nothing more you saw i have her doing dead mans float already i had to take things easy because shes exhausted from last night and i dont want a recurrence but shell be swimming like a dolphin in no time or a whale abbey smiled over to the silly game being played out nearby and tried hard to ignore the sensation of ryans arm around her waist ryan grinned as you say ryan abbeys voice sounded stiff i want to thank you theres no need ryan said roughly and the arm around her waist tightened possessively no need at all but he put his hand up and pressed a finger against her lips abbey i said no then he paused it was as if hed suddenly realised how close they were and how much was between them the glimmers of light that had been dancing all around them suddenly seemed to intensify ryans finger stayed where it was there was an electric current running between themrunning through ryans finger on her lipsfrom ryans hand on her waistfrom his body straight to hers and both of them could feel it abbeys eyes flew up to ryans and her heart gave a jolt stronger than any gained from a defibrillator ryan there was suddenly only ryan out in the shallows janet and the two children were wholly engrossed in their game their laughter rang across the water heightening the sense of delight heightening the joy and abbey felt the joy flood through her through and through ryan holding her ryan touching her it felt so right abbeys face tilted upward to the sun lifted compulsivelyso her lips were just where ryans lips could meet them if he would only bend his head a little and he did ryan stared down at abbey for a long long moment but he could no more resist the force pulling them together than she could he couldnt even try ryans lips met hers as if the two of them were pieces of a puzzle now joined his chest touched her breast and her scant bikini bra was no shield at all skin against skin mouth against mouth body against body heart against heart that was how it felt abbey thought in wonder as if by that single touch abbeys heart had found a channel to escapefrom her body to his her lips touched and felt and explored and her whole body yearned to be closer closer to this man who made her feel as no man on earth had ever made her feel as if she were part of a whole and the other part of her was the man whose lips were claiming hers and if she drew away shed be tearing herself in two this was crazy somewhere in the back of abbeys head her common sense was screaming at her mistake huge earthshattering mistake on a scale of one to ten this ranked about a hundred and forty because the kiss changed everything or rather it made everything the same again it reminded abbey of what shed known for most of her life that she loved ryan henry absolutely totally without question at eight years old shed handed her heart over to ryan and shed never taken it back again sure shed loved john but her love for john had been different john had been her beloved friend and he and his mother had been abbeys family john and abbey had built something that was totally satisfying but there had never been this instant linking of heart to heart this knowledge that this was where she belonged that she was part of this man only she didnt belong she was no part of ryan henry the kiss was deep and wonderful and lasting but it couldnt last for ever a tiny wave splashed up further than the rest breaking over ryans legs and he drew away as if a bucket of ice water had been thrown at him rather than the tropical warmth of the sea as if he was shocked to the core abbey it was a hoarse whisper full of total bewilderment and all abbey wanted to do was reach out and put her arms around ryans broad wet shoulders and draw him to her again to claim him as her man but she didnt she couldnt this man wasnt hers ryans life was half a world away and the woman he was about to marry was probably on a plane heading here right now so abbey gave a choking little laugh and managed to smile thats thats enough of that ryan henry she faltered i know i know it was only a kiss of friendship but even though this is a honeymoon resort your felicity would never approve your felicity the confusion in ryans eyes faded felicity his future felicity was his life his future had nothing to do with this waif of a doctor sitting here in her cute little bikini with her elfinlike cuds and toobig eyes and her leg stuck out before her covered with white bandages and a green garbage bag felicity was his love not abbey felicity was his future ryan closed his eyes for a long long moment and when he opened them his face was resolute youre right felicity would have pink kittens shed never understand that were just friends just friends how hollow did that sound ryan flicked abbeys white face with a long finger and rose to stand looking down at her his eyes were blank and uncomprehending id best take leith back to the hospital he told her in a voice that was none too steady i need to check there are no problems with steve and then get down to see dad in the hospital in cairns tonight ryan bit his lip and stared out to sea as if reluctant to leave as he was who would want to leave this magic place who would want to leave abbey ill be back thursday if i can he told her if steves managing ill come and see you then look after yourself and then without so much as glancing at abbey again he walked over collected the reluctant leith and strode away up the beach end of one crazy interlude before ryan left for cairns he managed to contact felicity she was just leaving one meeting and about to enter another i can ring back later ryan told her its ok ryan theres never going to be a good time here im so busy you wouldnt believe it what is it ryan briefly outlined what was happening and heard felicity frown down the phone line i guess the best course might be for us to just make our own way back to the states ryan suggested i dont want to tie you here we can do the marriage bit next vacation more frowns and then a decision no ill come anyway felicity said decisively lets just get this marriage bit over fast ryan its been hanging over us long enough ill be there on thursday if youre in cairns with your father we can meet there and take it as it comes she rang off and headed for her meeting leaving ryan staring down at his mobile phone this was what he wanted wasnt it that felicity still came that the wedding went ahead it had to be it was his future all mapped out the future as he and his mother had planned it since he was fifteen years old then why the hell did he feel so damned bleak chapter seven abbeys honeymoon lasted a week and by the following monday she was aching for it to be over not that it hadnt been wonderful abbey and janet and jack had had the time of their lives ensconced in absolute luxury with nothing to do but enjoy themselves it would have been churlish of them to have done anything else jack had revelled in having his mother and his grandma all to himself the child had blossomed steadied on his plump little legs attacked the water as if hed been born to it and had chortled and grinned the entire time and janet the creases on janets forehead had faded and even the look of perpetual pain from her arthritis had eased she was far fitter now for surgery than she had been a week ago abbey thought thankfully and abbey abbey was restedsort of it was difficult to sleep though lying alone in a kingsized bed with the thought of ryan henrys mocking smile staying with her after the first night abbey hauled jack into bed with her hoping the toddlers faint snoring would ease her sense of loneliness it didnt her sense of isolation stayed she should be used to being a widow by now she told herself fiercely over and over again there wasnt room in her life for a man there was if that man was ryan henry but ryan didnt return there were a couple of curt phone calls enquiring as to their welfare but that had been all when abbey had rung cairns hospital shed been told that sam was recovering nicely from his bypass thank you for your enquiry when shed rung sapphire cove hospital eileen had told her ryan and steve were coping brilliantly between them and had added get back to your honeymoon abbey winner only it was hard to do that when her heart wasnt really here it was hard to block out the thought of someone else doing her job especially when that someone was ryan and janet watched her daughterinlaw with troubled eyes and knew why the circles under abbeys eyes hadnt faded shed seen that kiss youve got everything you need abbey asked as she stowed janets hospital bag in the luggage compartment of the car though i guess i can always bring in things afterwards ill be in and out so often youll be sick of the sight of me ive got everything i need except news that the hospitals burned down janet said grimly why i ever let you and ryan talk me into this darned fool procedure janet youll be able to walk again painfree i promise yeah and next year youll be at me to have the other hip done thats right abbey agreed serenely she and janet had come back to the farm to pack now abbey handed jack over to marcia and pointed to the passenger seat of the car janet get in one of the worlds leading orthopaedic surgeons is waiting to perform his artistry on your leg lets not keep him waiting that sounds indecent janet muttered now if it were you id say ryan henry could go ahead no sweat what on earth abbey took a deep breath and fixed her motherinlaw with a defiant look janet what do you mean by that ive got eyes in my head janet said sagely so dont think you can pull the wool over em abbey wittner she gave abbey a sideways smile and youve been a widow for close on two years now dont you even think about letting the memory of my son get in the way of whats happening between you and that nice young man abbey licked suddenly dry lips janet janet arched her eyebrows yes janet ryan henry is engaged to be married we havent heard from him for nearly a week he might even be married by now so you can stop thinking indecent thoughts about the pair of us well if hes married then ill stop thinking thoughts janet agreed but youre barking up the wrong tree if you think my thoughts are indecent i happen to be thinking thoughts that are very decent indeed after that it was hard to get any sort of thought process operating for a while abbey eventually pulled up in front of the hospital and there was only one thing in her mind shed see ryan again and he might be married ryan was waiting for them the car pulled up outside casualty and ryan strolled across the car park to greet them the same ryan the same smile the same twinkle in his eyes the same impossible charm janet he greeted abbeys motherinlaw first and gave her a swift hug making himself right at home abbey thought bitterly making my motherinlaw putty in his hands glad you decided to trust us then he turned to abbey you shouldnt be driving i have full mobility of my foot and its my left one anyway my right ones for the brake and thats all that matters she said it promptlyso promptly that ryan laughed youve been rehearsing that line i knew youd give me a hard time she did too abbey looked up at ryan and felt her heart twist she knew him so well it was as if the years had peeled away and there was still the same ryan wealthy and respected worldwide she could still see inside his heart hows sam she said faintly and blushed ryan was looking at her and if he could read her like she could read him then she was in big trouble hows your father hes great ryan lifted janets bags from the car and took the old ladys arm he said to thank you for the flowers and the chocolates he looked at janet a faint smile playing at the corner of his mouth oh and he said to give you a message janet he says hes had a change of heart so now its about time you did do you think he was talking about your operationor something else and to abbeys astonishment janet blushed bright crimson get away with you janet said fiercely but she smiled silly old fool he is whens he due home with luck ill have him back at the farm by next week well abbey stared at her motherinlaw but janet wasnt meeting her eyes no questions her body language said and abbey could only acquiesce abbey picked up her crutches and the three of them made their way across to the hospital entrance and felicity she asked still eyeing her motherinlaw shes great too ryan said curtly are you married yet janet demanded and ryan shook his head nope dont worry youll get an invitation now janet have you been nil by mouth since midnight if you mean has abbey let me eat anything then the answer is not a drop janet said bitterly not even my breakfast cup of tea well what have you done with this felicity if you havent married her ryan grinned you make it sound like ive stuffed her in a cupboard youll meet her soon enough ryan promised but meanwhile you and i have a date with a new hip he smiled across at abbey abbey steves giving the anaesthetic hes done his first part anaesthetics and is goodbut i wondered if youd like to scrub and assist can you manage it do you think there was nothing abbey would like better to sit out in the waiting roomto play the anxious relative instead of doctorwould just about kill her she gave ryan her very best smile and nodded watch you work id love to just count the swabs abbey girl janet growled ive heard all about surgeons who leave things behind what goes in has to come out and im depending on you to see to it yes maam ryans preparations left abbey stunned for a start ryan had the theatre as abbey had never seen it designed to cope only with emergency surgery there was equipment here now that abbey had had no idea could be begged borrowed or bought on sapphire coves limited budget its borrowed ryan said briefly when abbey queried it some from cairns and some from brisbane hes pulling in favours all over the place steve told abbey as they left ryan sorting equipment and went together to don theatre gowns ryan henrys one slick operator now this i dont understand abbey complained how come ryan can ask favours in a country he has no contacts in if you think he has no contacts how do you think he got me steve demanded he shoved a theatre cap over his receding hairline and gave her a sheepish smile favours owed then at abbeys look of surprise he explained ryans a world expert in the orthopaedic management of brittle bone disease hes the best bar none and hes generous unlike most researchers he shares his knowledge all over the world ive been using him as a source for my doctorate in medicine youre doing a doctorate well at the moment i spent a bit of time trying to figure out what i wanted to do careerwise i tried general practice then anaesthetics and then orthopaedic surgery but im heading more and more for a researchbased career my home base is cairns but i spent last year in new york working with ryan and ryan well hes been so darned good to me that i cant refuse thats why im here and there are plenty more like me he only has to ask he only has to ask abbey tied her gown and scrubbed while she thought this through it was true enough more than true ryan only had to smile and then he hardly had to ask at all what followed was the slickest piece of surgery that abbey had ever had the privilege to witness abbey abandoned her crutchesher leg was weightbearing again anywayrefused ryans offer of a stool and stood by to assist in any way she could ryan hardly needed her help he hardly needed anyone this surgery normally took a theatre full of staff here there was eileen ryan steve and herself and no one could doubt that janet was in the best of hands from the moment janet was wheeled into theatre ryan concentrated totally on the job in hand to the exclusion of everything else and abbey could only marvel at the speed at which he worked he made a swift incisiontiny compared to the incisions abbey had seen for this procedure before he dislocated the joint with an ease that left steve and abbey exchanging wondering glances just as easily the acetabulumthe cup of the pelviswas cut away and the prosthetic cup inserted in its place then the femur was sliced neatly and the damaged sphere of bone removed the stern of the prosthesis was wedged skilfully into the shaft of the femur and the new joint enlocated easy fast and simple it was just that ryan made it seem so it looked easy enough that anyone could do it only steve and abbey watching in wonder knew that the ease ryan was showing was a skill they could never match with a lifetime of practice the last time abbey had seen this piece of surgery performed it had taken close on three hours steve would be able to reverse the anaesthetic in less than one finally abbey watched as ryan inserted layers of neat stitching all abbey had had to do had been to watch that the tools ryan needed had been on hand hold the flaps apart so ryan could work and supervise as eileen kept the site free of blood now janet had a new hip and by the look of steves monitors shed come through the operation with flying colours a new hip for janet that meant almost a new life shed been in constant pain for years she never would have done it if ryan hadnt come abbey send a thousand tiny prayers of gratitude upward for this small miracle she glanced down at her still swollen knee the bulky dressing barely discernible under her surgical trousers if it only cost one bruised knee to have ryan here well the bruising was worth it how much more would she pay to have him stay she couldnt begin to consider the procedure over steve followed his patient out to recovery eileen gathered the stained linen and took herself off to the sluice room and abbey was left alone with ryan tired ryan asked sympathetically and immediately abbey decided she wasnt no liar well i shouldnt be tired she said less than an hour for a procedure such as this i dont know how you did it besides im rested and raring to go theres no excuse for me not to be ive just pinched your holiday you needed it i shouldnt have asked you to assist today i wanted to abbey said warmly ryan she looked up and met his dark concerned eyes i just want to thank you she said simply if you knew how much i wanted janet to have this done the other hips not nearly as bad but now even when it finally gives well so far shes come through this brilliantly as long as her rehabilitation goes well i shouldnt have any trouble convincing her to do the other hip ill fly back and do it for you ryan offered lightly and abbey found herself feeling suddenly less bleak maybe when ryan left here he wouldnt be gone for good maybe he would come back in a year or so yeah in your dreams abbey wittner or if he came back hed come back with a wife wheres felicity she said with difficulty and watched ryans face close shes out at my fathers farm working i asked her to come in for lunch but she hasnt time i see but abbey didnt if this was supposed to be a honeymoon felicity was surely a trifle offhand about her husband youve not organised the wedding yet she asked and for the life of her she couldnt keep her voice steady no well do that as soon as dad gets back from cairns it sounded like changing a pair of socks well do that just as unimportant oh this was inane abbey crossed to the sink and peeled off her gloves then ryan was behind her untying the tapes of her theatre garb and abbey started feeling really strange really strange you you can let steve go back to his research now she managed and it was a real effort to keep her voice light i you can see my legs almost back to normal the lass whos helping to babysit can keep caring for jack and i can take over work again not yet you cant ryan i must monday he said you can start again next monday but youll take the rest of the week off abbey and thats an order no yes ryan dont baulk me here abbey ryan said heavily and his hands suddenly fell to her waist and gripped hard i want to do this in three weeks im having to walk away from here and i want to do it with a clear conscience allow me to give you a decent break then maybe he broke off his hands fell away and he stepped back as eileen reentered the room eileen looked curiously from ryan to abbey and she smiled am i interrupting something she said brightly would you like me to leave clearing this mess until later and pull the curtains closed abbey gasped and moved away from ryan she hauled her theatre gear from her shoulders and shoved it in the laundry basket with unnecessary force no no the feel of ryans hands on her waist was still with her we were just discussing dr henrys wedding she managed she took a deep breath if youll excuse me rdr henry ill go out to janet i want to be with her when she wakes she took another deep breath and i accept your offer to work until next monday though if you change your mind she faltered knowing that eileens interest was growing by the minute probably because of the mounting colour of abbeys cheeks she made a swift desperate decision if youre free maybe before sam comes back how about on thursday maybe you and felicity could come to dinner out at the farm jack and i would enjoy having you there shed got it out she had to start treating this man as part of a couple she thought bleakly and the best way to do it was to put a face to this mysterious felicity the sooner the better you mean it ryan asked and abbey nodded thursday seven oclock she cast a rather frantic look at eileen can you come too im on duty eileen said sadly but there was a hint of a twinkle behind her eyes otherwise i wouldnt miss it for quids im just not sure where felicity stands in all this im just not sure where anyone does but id really like to know why am i doing this abbey stared down at her tousleheaded toddler and demanded an answer jack why am i going to all this trouble its like those people who go swimming in the antarctic in midwinter id have to be a little bit crazy jack was armed with a spoon and was in the process of cleaning the chocolate mousse bowl there was chocolate mousse from one end of his small person to the other and he had far more important matters weighing on his mind than his mothers social life like how he could get the last scraps of chocolate right at the bottom of the bowl he gave up and did it the easy way abandoning the spoon he stuck his head right down the bottom of the bowl and licked and abbey chuckled yeah well the ostrich approach may have its advantages but theyre coming even if i stick my head in a mixing bowl too she sighed and looked around her at least the food would be great if there was one thing abbey could do well it was cook if only the house didnt look so so well so darned poor it normally didnt matter it was just that tonight tonight what she really didnt want to happen was for felicity and ryan to feel sorry for her which they shouldnt she said she picked up jack bowl and all and gave his chocolateclad person a fierce hug it was a bit tricky as he still had the bowl over his head but jack enjoyed the sensation and gave a chuckle from the bottom of the bowl i have you jack wittner and i have janet your grandma is improving every day little jack and well have her playing hopscotch in no time felicity and ryan arrived right on seven and by the time they arrived abbey had the place looking as good as it ever could shed placed a white cloth not too worn over the scrubbed kitchen table and a bunch of crimson bougainvillea sprayed from a glass jar in the centre with luck the flowers were so lovely that her visitors would miss the absence of a cut crystal vase the meal was all ready the smell from the chicken concasse was wonderful and abbey was almost satisfied she gave herself one last critical look in the mirror before she went to answer the door maybe her soft white frock was a little worn but it was still pretty with a low scooped neckline no sleeves and a skirt that flared out into soft folds almost to her ankles abbeys closecropped curls were brushed until they shone and shed even scrounged a little makeup from a store she hadnt used since john died your mummy looks pretty she told jack in a voice that sounded defiant jack was dressed in his newest pyjamas and was clearly not impressed he had a new game the chocolate bowl was now clean but jack had it permanently over his head he staggered about like a flannelette and plastic robot bumping into everything in sight and chuckling with glee now he hauled his bowl off his head checked out the new version of his motherand stuck his bowl back abbey stuck her tongue out at her now blind son as a first comment id have to say your appraisal stinks she told her son but she smiled and went to answer the door feeling good that lasted a whole ten seconds abbey swung open the door and her feeling of satisfaction in her person her little house and the evening in general faded to nothing felicity was just gorgeous of course she was she was ryans intended wife after all and abbey might have known ryan could never marry anyone second rate felicity was tallalmost as tall as ryanand willowslim with legs that seemed to go on for ever her dress must have cost a bomb and it was straight out of the new york collections elegant and understated it was high at the neck and minimal everywhere else sleekly black and hugging felicitys body as if it had been sewn on her felicitys long blonde hair hung down freely beautifully cut and silken smooth luminous blue eyes gazed at abbey with lazy interest and her perfectly painted mouth curved into a smile of greeting it was all abbey could do not to slam the door shut again but ryan was beside felicity looking so handsome he almost took abbeys breath away his dark suit looked as expensive as felicitys gown but the smile behind his eyes was infinitely warmer than felicitys he smiled straight down at her and abbey felt her heart turn to butter boo said jack he appeared from behind his mothers skirts lifted his bowland then saw the newcomers stunned by the power of his boo he scuttled off toward the kitchen his bowl back in place he made it as far as the first wall thumped against it hard toppled over and started to wail after that the evening went straight downhill the meal itself was fine abbeys cooking couldnt be faulted with jack tucked safely in bedstill clutching his bowl ready for robotics in the morningabbey served and tried to take part in a conversation in which she felt increasingly uneasy felicity ate as if she hardly noticed what she was eating making no comment on the trouble abbey had gone to she chatted brightly with an air abbey knew from long ago ryans mother had it down to an art form it was the air of a social superior putting the lower orders at their ease this house is charming abbey felicity said pleasantly its just so quaint almost an artwork in itself if i could lift it up and take it back to new york itd sell for a fortune with or without the rising damp abbey managed a smile and then tried to at least make the conversation medical when in doubt work ryan tells me youre an oncologist while youre here i wonder if i could have a talk to you about one or two cancer patients and their treatment id very much appreciate it she would too it was hard sometimes to be an isolated family doctor suspecting that the treatment she was giving was less than optimal but not sure with simply no time to attend conferences and keep up to date abbey called for specialist advice often but sometimes her patients refused to go to cairns to see someone better qualified if she had someone on the spot a welltrained oncologist shed love to know what the latest treatments were but felicity was holding her hands up in horror im in research she said firmly i dont see actual patients any more ryan and i are heading for what we think of as ideal medical practices ones where we dont handle grubby patients at all oh of course abbey cleared the dinner plates and counted to ten then she tried again actually id only like to talk to you about treatments i am a bit out of touch here and itd be lovely if you could give me an hour or so of your timejust to answer a few questions that have been troubling me thats what journals are for felicity said lightly i think youve taken up enough of my honeymoon dont you dear it was the dear that got her abbey turned to find ryan glowering and she couldnt figure out whether he was glowering at her for asking the question or glowering at felicity for rebuffing her so well it didnt matter ryan henry was engaged to the cow and he was responsible abbey glowered right back at him she glowered at the pair of them she glowered at the kitchen in general theres chocolate mousse she said tightly and dumped it on the table with a slap that would if shed been waitressing at the ritz have got her the sack before she could have blinked which was just what she wanted she wanted to be dismissed she felt young and countrybumpkin frumpish and she even wanted ryan to go home just get them both out of here she ate one spoonful of chocolate moussefunny that jack liked it because as far as abbey could tell it tasted like mudand then the phone rang thank heaven for phones only this time the thought was inappropriate abbey lifted the receiver and it was marg miller abbey abbey chocolate mousse felicityeven ryanforgotten marg miller suddenly had abbeys full attention there was no mistaking the terror flooding down the line marg what is it no marg you need to stop crying take your time three deep breaths and then say whats wrong abbey waited while the ragged breathing steadied when marg spoke again at least abbey could understand her abbey its ian he came home last night from sydney abbey he looks just awful hes ill yes but not ill i mean abbey hes gone is he dead the shock tactic worked marg gave a terrified gasp and then steadied when she spoke again her voice was almost calm abbey i just dont know is he there with you abbey had visions of a heart attack now ian dead on margs kitchen floor she cast an urgent glance at ryan who was rising to his feet she had ryans total attention as marg miller had hers no hes not abbey thats just it i dont know marg what is it that youre afraid of abbey demanded harshly making her voice as authoritative as she could quickly just say i cant help unless you do silence and then margs voice breaking with sobs again abbey he came home just miserable hed hardly speak to me just went to bed and stayed there today he went out for a walk he walked for ages and when he came home he seemed well odd but he wouldnt say what was wrong then tonight i had to go out to a cwa dinner and ian said just go he said i mustnt stay home because of him so i went but when i got there i started thinkingyou know when you think theres something really awfully wrong but you dont know what and i came home but hes not here abbey theres a note on my bed saying goodbye and hes sorry and and his cars gone and abbey i know this is stupid but so is the hose i keep by the kitchen door abbey he wouldnt you dont think he wouldnt whats he driving abbey snapped a red corolla licence number abbey i dont know margs voice broke into a wail and abbey clipped it off fast ok marg ring your sister tell her to come over and be with you margs sister lived on the adjoining property abbey thought thankfully and annette was a sensible woman who could be relied on in an emergency ill contact the police to get things mobilised and ill be right there you dont think abbey if im being stupid marg do you believe ian intends suicide there was a sharp horrible pause yes i do marg said bleakly i dont know why but god help us abbey yes i do please abbey hurry im coming chapter eight ryan came with her it took three minutes before they were in abbeys car heading for the miller property and by then abbey felt like all the wind had been pushed right out of her if there was one thing ryan henry could do it was mobilise help in an emergency he organised jack while abbey contacted the police by the time abbey was off the phone she knew there was no way felicity would look after jack abbey would never have thought of asking it of her but ryan knew no qualms he asked but he got nowhere felicity took herself off in ryans car clearly appalled that ryan felt the need to get involved abbey heard her talking angrily while she was waiting for the police sergeant to answer his mobile phone for heavens sake ryan this is none of your business these people have nothing to do with you ryan didnt respond to felicitys anger at all ill see you later felicity ryan said flatly ill go over the road and find the girl who looks after jack their voices faded out of range and abbey blocked felicitys anger out of her mind she simply didnt have time to think about it she rang the ambulance as well as the police asking the officers to take the vehicle out to the millers i hope im overreacting here she said to herself i hope margs overreacting but marg miller was a sensible unemotional woman whod buried a husband and raised a family of six on her own and abbey had never known her to panic before with a sinking heart abbey slipped off her dress hauled on jeans and a sweatshirt and emerged to find marcia had already arrived from over the road ryan was a mover and shaker if anyone was the next thing abbey knew they were turning out of the driveway with ryan at the wheel of her car tell me where to go abbey ryan said curtly just straight north she paused you know the miller farm i think so off palm road thats the one abbey frowned its not much use us going there though ryan where would you go if you took off in your car from the millers with a piece of rubber hose and suicide in mind youd need a spot where no one would find you until morning mmm there was silence while the little car cut through the night outside was still and warm and starlit it was a lovely night hardly a night for ending your life ryan when i asked for your help with mrs miller and told you i thought there was something wrong with ian did you contact him abbey said diffidently into the darkness she tried as hard as she could to make her voice nonjudgemental but it still came out badly and ryan heard it no oh silence hell ryan said at last i didnt see the need it was none of my business i rang his mother like you asked and and she said she was worried about ians health so i told her to have him make an appointment with you or steve or me next time he was home or see his own doctor in sydney just like he would if he had a sore throat abbey said softly how the hell was i to know he was suicidal you werent to know that abbey agreed i should have rung myself abbey ians health is none of our business no like felicity said abbey just shut up ryan abbey said in a voice that dragged youve changed from the ryan i knew and loved i dont think i know you any more but i guess it doesnt matter its not us thats important here just just think about where ian would go thomlinsons ryans voice three minutes later cutting across the silence made abbey jump her mind had been racing in a million directions and she didnt like where she ended up each time how long had ian been away marg hadnt known how long had he had to carry out what he intended pardon thomlinsons ryan said heavily you must know the place abbey the cove where we swam out to rescue old man thomlimsons crayfish abbey frowned and considered the thomlinsons ran a derelict property just north of the millers the ground on the thomlinsons place was rough and hilly giving way to mountains behind from the foot of the mountains the land turned into uncultivated wilderness going north from the millers the road turned to gravel just before the thomlinsons farmhouse there was a track leading off to a tiny cove nestled deep in the hills very few people knew about it ryan and abbey had found it on their bikes as kids and then theyd seen old man thomlinson collecting his crays so theyd gone back time and time again to rescue his catch ian would know about it abbey said slowly he was brought up on the miller place and all the miller kids knew every inch of the coastline around here almost as well as we did ian would know the cove is deserted theres room down there to turn a car but thats all and he could sit and look out to sea until he didnt go on lets try there abbey said decisively she motioned to the mobile phone on her belt were not too far away that we cant get back in a hurry if hes found elsewhere but oh ryan may you please be right he was two minutes later ryan nosed the little car gently off the road and onto the track leading down to the beach they bumped over three or four sandhills and came to a halt there was a car in front of them facing out towards the sea and in the moonlight they could see the car had a hosepipe leading from the exhaust up to the drivers window dear heaven ryan was out of the car almost before it stopped even hindered by her weak knee abbey wasnt far behind but by the time she reached him ryan had the drivers door open and was dragging the unconscious ian out of the car the stench of exhaust fumes was almost overwhelming abbey shoved her hand up to her mouth coughed and gagged but kept on coming no ryans voice was clipped and curt stopping her in her tracks he kept moving dragging ians body clear of the car and onto the green verge of seagrass away from the fumes get your bag abbey he ordered swiftly fast move i think hes still alive what followed were several frantic minutes by the time abbey reached him with her bag ryan had already cleared the airway abbey found the mask positioned the oral airway into ians mouth and started breathing for him ryan started cardiopulmonary resuscitation they worked together as a team each concentrating fiercely on what they had to do and three minutes later they had their reward ians body heaved he retched into the mask and then as abbey moved to clear his airway he retched again and his lungs heaved for air had they been in time no longer needed for breathing abbey helped ryan swing ian onto his side to prevent him choking it was only three or four minutes since theyd arrived not very long but how long hadnt ian been breathing before theyd got to him it couldnt have been that long if cpr worked so quickly abbey told herself but maybe that was wishful thinking ians eyelids flickered open his eyes moved uncertainly from abbey to ryan in the soft moonlight and he groaned no ian damn you no put me back put me back well that was a start ryan gave abbey a halfhearted grin felt for ians pulse and his grin broadened ian was definitely going to live one problem was over but this was only the first step abbey knew how many wouldbe suicides had been rescued or revived only to suicide successfully later heaven knew but the list must be legion at least ian had a chance now abbey could try to communicate even if ryan hadnt even if ryan thought it was none of her business its ok ian abbeys arm went around ians shoulder and she hugged him in a gesture that had nothing to do with being a doctor but everything to do with the fact that shed known ian since childhood and his mum was her friend were here for you i dont know what the problem is thats so awful you had to take this step but whatever it is were with you and well be here tomorrow for you just relax now concentrate on getting your strength back well take you to hospital and talk through your hassles in the morning no it was a fierce fretful whisper dont touch me dont leave me alone you can catch but ryan was bending over and he suddenly took ians hand and gripped hard ian have you got aids he demanded flatly ians eyes widened he stared from ryan to abbey and then back to ryan and his face closed in misery oh god is that why you did this what do you think ian whispered hiv positive oh god hey ian aids isnt the end of the world ryan said strongly its not even a death sentence ive just come from new york and the latest breakthroughs are amazing his grip tightened ian was firmly held by the pair of them this was no clinical approach this was two humans comforting another in any way they could and abbey could only wonder at the concern in ryans voice she hadnt thought him capable of such concern for someone he hardly knew this was the old ryan then not felicitys ryan ian let me talk to you about this in the morning ryan said but for now rest and know that when you wake up you wont be by yourself abbey and i are here to help your mums worried sick and the old prejudices about your illness are disappearing fast i promise you whats in front of you isnt worm dying over now i promise you mate and he stayed with his hand gripping ians until the ambulance arrived then ian closed his eyes with exhaustion and let the medical world do its will with him how did you guess he has aids intelligence ryan said promptlyso promptly that abbey burst out laughing they were back in the car again travelling south steve had been telephoned and was waiting for ian at the hospital mrs miller would be there too there was no urgency for their return and the night seemed suddenly light and free and lovely tragedy averted so tell me how your mighty intelligence worked it out abbey demanded and ryan grinned how about intuition thats worse its partly what it was though ryan told her i knew ian at schoolremember i remember him being a loner and thinking maybe he was gay thats not enough on its own and he was still a teenager but the look of him the fear the worry that you might be infected if you touched him at a guess hes hiv positive hes working on outofdate information and hes terrified i see abbey nodded thinking it through it made sense ian had done law at sydney university and very rarely came home all the other miller kids were married and settled by now but abbey had never heard any hint of a romantic attachment for ian oh dear this was some end to her dinner party at least though theyd been in time i think you mean trouble ryan henry abbey said as they turned out of the cove things have gone haywire since you arrived to use cpr twice in ten days believe it or not its been six months since ive tried to resuscitate anyone and then i failed it hardly seems fair that youve done it twice successfully in this short a time youll be thinking i go from one drama to another dont you ryan demanded wryly and abbey shook her head nope but as you can see when im needed im really needed she added thoughtfully thats why ill never leave here if i left well if sapphire cove had doctors at all itd be overseas doctors who think a tropical resort sounds wonderful ive seen them come and go from other places around here they stay through our winter and think its magic and then comes summer and they cant wait to leave february here tries anyones temper i remember summer in sapphire cove ryan said thinking back to a time it had been so hot even shorts and thongs had seemed too much trouble to wear though i have to say i kind of like summer here all the rain and frogs and insectsand the odd cyclone thrown in for good measure he hesitated at least it must get quieter for you when the wet hits your population must fall mmm but the ones that stay get sicker abbey told him i get so many tropical infections the water gets warmer with particles of coral floating everywhere people go swimming with a tiny scratch and it turns into a major infected wound she sighed well thats my business youll be long gone by february then she hesitated she needed ryans help before he left you will have a really long talk to ian tomorrow though wont you ryan i dont know the uptodate treatments for aids in fact ive never treated an aids patient i cant reassure him as he needs to be reassured ill phone a friend in new york tonight for information ryan agreed hes working in the field and he has the disease himself if anyone can give me the latest marcus can and then ill talk to ian in the morning abbey bit her lip you you promise silence you really do think ive changed dont you abbey ryan said softly but his knuckles on the steeringwheel were white hell abbey i said i would im sorry its just well its ians life and and im already blaming myself for tonight if i hadnt depended on you yeah ryans voice was curt and angry lets all blame ryan he cast a swift glance at her why not i do myself he shrugged and im sorry believe me abbey you cant blame me any more than i do myself i guessdoing what i dowell my jobs mostly research and teaching and when i am called in for handson work the patients been counselled and assessed already often theyre already unconscious on the operating table you get used to thinking of problems as a pelvis or a femur or a combination of problemsnot as mr jones whose life depends on what youre doing he sighed i guess i hadnt realised until tonightor maybe i once knew but had forgottenthat what i do has a wider impact it certainly did tonightor rather what i didnt do it damn near caused a tragedy he stared straight ahead again and kept on driving and abbey bit her lip as she watched his drawn face she should have shut up ryan hadnt changed so much that she had to kick him when he was already feeling so guilty she turned away and glanced out of the car they were travelling along the beach road towards the town and the moon was glimmering over the sea in a brilliant band of gold the beach stretched away on either sidea broad ribbon of sand smooth and washed clean in the moonlight it was low tide and sapphire cove was at its most beautiful not a tourist in sight nothing except ryan stop abbeys voice was urgent and ryan acted instinctively he shoved his foot on the brake so hard that if they hadnt been wearing seat belts both would have been catapulted through the windscreen what on earth pull over ryan abbeys voice was excited rather than fearful she was staring down at the beach in wonder oh ryan and ryan looked and saw a vast turtle was lumbering up the beach causing a swathe in the wet sand like a bulldozer ploughing a channel the turtle was heading in a straight line up the beach and that could only mean one thing as far as ryan knew turtles came out of the sea for one purpose to lay eggs oh ryan abbey was scarcely breathing after all this time she hauled open the car door and was out heading across the sandy verge to the beach beyond like it or not ryan was left to follow abbey and ryan watched the turtle for almost two hours and they hardly spoke for the entire time what they were seeing was a miracle the huge green turtles were increasingly rare in these waters they came up onto the beach to lay their eggs but there were thousands of miles of coastline for them to choose and for one to choose this place and this time all abbeys life she had wanted to see one lay her eggs and back in the time when hed been her friend so had ryan so abbey assumed he was as spellbound as she as eager to see and miraculously for once in her busy life abbey could take the time to watch abbey had a babysitter who wasnt expecting them home soon steve was in charge at the hospital for once in her life abbey was free she crouched low in the seagrass and was silent as the big turtle lumbered up almost within touching distance and started to dig the turtle was almost two feet wide and three feet longmassiveand nothing was getting in her way whether or not she was aware of ryan and abbeys presence she kept on digging but abbey wouldnt have distracted her for the world she didnt have to warn ryan to stay still or be silent ryan sank on the sand beside her and watched by her side and watched and watched and in a way this time was a healing for them both for abbey the last years had moved like a fastpaced nightmare johns death the birth of jack financial disaster and the constant pressures of far too much work and ryan ryan watched the turtle preparing a safe place for her brood and he felt his foundations shift or what hed thought of as his foundations he hadnt known until this moment that hed left a part of him here when hed left this place at fifteen his mother had dragged him half a world away and had set about systematically destroying every memory hed had of his childhood his father hadnt really cared shed said why else hadnt he fought her for custody sapphire cove had nothing except a bunch of country hicks and no culture at all close on twenty years of her poisoned tongue had had their effect hed almost started believing her but now in this time of absolute stillness and wondercrouching side by side with abbey in the sandtheir bodies touching and yet not speaking at allletting the moonlight play on their faces as it lit up the wonder of new life before themryan knew that his mother was wrong sure in new york he had a life that his mother was proud of but was it his life he sat and he watched and he thought two hours was nothingand yet two hours had the power to change peoples lives they stayed where they were as a miracle happened before their eyes the moonlight cast a soft glow over the whole beach lighting the scene almost like day the turtle knew exactly what she was doing she scraped a vast hole behind her using her paddles to shove the sand aside occasionally a spray of fine sand flew up over abbey and ryan and it was as much as abbey could do not to laugh in delight and then came the eggs slowly they came one after another eggs eggs and more eggs soft white balls plopping moistly into their bed of sand a huge mound of new life just waiting to happen and finally the last egg was laid and the turtles job was almost complete once more those massive paddles shifted the sand but this time they calmly coated her eggsslowly carefullyleaving no egg uncovered and then magically as though receiving final acclaim for a job well done the great turtle turned and looked straight at ryan and abbey straight in the eye eyeball to eyeball as if challenging them to keep her eggs safe and then she calmly turned towards the ocean and made her way majestically back to sea the waves washed over her as she reached the shallows the sea took her back into its warmth and all there was left to tell them shed really been here was a tract of furrowed sand leading down to the sea and abbey and ryan were left staring after her in wonder she knew abbey breathed did you see she knew we were here all the time she let us watch yeah well she must have known we were doctors ryan smiled but he felt a bit emotional all the same in truth he felt very emotional it was all too much this place this woman his friend it was bringing his childhood back again fast how many october and november nights had he and abbey hunted along this beach searching for just what they had seen tonight theyd never found a breeding turtle but theyd always been sure they would just one more night abbey had pleaded over and over again when ryan had tried palming her off with homework commitments or somesuch but the breeding season was short and ryan had never tried hard to think of reasons he shouldnt come hed longed to find one as much as abbey had theyd crept out when their respective mothers had thought theyd been long in bed and if abbeys mother had suspected the reason her daughter wore dark shadows under her eyes for most of the turtlebreeding months shed never let on she knew and then ryan had gone but weve never even found a turtle yet abbey had wailed when ryan had told her he was going shed put the pain aside with her heartache for ryan and shed stopped searching somehow it hadnt seemed important to find a turtle when ryan hadnt been here to share it with her but now ryan was backand theyd found their turtle abbey turned to face him and found him watching her and the wonder in her heart was reflected in his eyes abbey did you ever see anything so beautiful she breathed and ryans hands came out to take hers no abbey i never have and suddenly he wasnt talking about the turtle and abbey wasnt thinking about the turtle there was only the linking of their hands there was only what was between them ryan her friend her love and then there was nothing between them any more nothing not even distance somehow the length of their arms which had been there was gone somehow ryans head was bending and abbeys was tilting upwards to meet him to welcome him to taste him and to know this man who was a part of her already whom she already knew in every way but this and then his lips were claiming hers and abbeys mouth was opening beneath his to acknowledge his claim this was so right so so meant like the turtle theyd been looking for since childhood and had finally found theyd known they would find her and maybe maybe abbey had always known this was her place here was her home ryans arms were where she was meant to be like the turtle this was a miracle searched for and found ryan ryans hands were falling to her waist somehow they were no longer sitting but settling deeper into their sandy hollow so their bodies were cocooned against each other the sand warm from the heat of a day of tropical sun welcomed and embraced them above them were the moon and the stars and the night sky and holding them all together was her ryan ryan abbey returned his kiss gently at first but then with increasing fiercenesspossessiveness ryan was hers hers what right had he had to go away and leave her all those years ago what right had he to marry felicity the thought of felicity flashed into abbeys mind but she shoved it away as her hands wound themselves around ryans broad shoulders and her breasts pushed against his chest dear god she wanted him ryan felicity the thought flashed back again abbey shoved it away with everything she possessedbut the thought wouldnt go it wouldnt felicity and ryan felt it wondering ryan drew back a little in the moonlight abbey he said and his voice was a husky murmur laced with desire love felicity she said flatly silence abbey pushed ryan back and rolled sideways in the sand she stood uncertain refusing to look at ryan refusing to look at her love ttake me home ryan she said softly i think we must both have been mad youre engaged to felicity remember deny it her heart was screaming but ryan didnt instead he stood and looked gravely down at her when he spoke again his voice was harsh and bleak as you say weve both run mad gone troppo has meaning after all and that was that end of evening help me hide the turtle tracks before we go abbey managed staring out to sea concentrating on anything but the pain in her heart there was something else to concentrate on the eggs must be protected there were all sorts of predators whod see the turtles furrow before the tide came back in the best disguise was simply to make more furrowsso it looked like the sand had been disturbed by a party of revellers rather than one solitary turtle and put plenty of human scents around to deflect interest ryan nodded like abbey he was searching for something to say something to do that didnt touch the jumble of his emotions he left abbey and retrieved a huge piece of dried seaweed silently he started raking it back and forth across the sand for a long moment abbey watched him and then silently started to do the same there were shadows haunting ryan she thought bleakly and one of those shadows was her she could feel ryans desire but she knew well abbey knew his mother and she knew felicity she knew what she was up against finally they finished and made their way back to the car there are a group of turtlewatchers in town abbey managed as they settled back in the car for the drive home her voice was flat and desolate she was no longer excited about the turtle she just wanted to get home get to the sanctuary of her pillows so she could hide her head and have a good howl ill let them know where the eggs are theyll work out the gestation period and set up a watch when theyre due if they could the turtlewatchers would try to be here when the eggs hatched the journey from the nest to the sea was the most hazardous the turtles would face often almost all the tiny hatchlings were eaten by gulls and other predators before they reached the water id love to be here when they hatch abbey added silence if i can ill send you a photograph abbey offered and ryans gut clenched into an almost unbearable ache shed send him a photograph to put on the wall in his office so he could remember this night always he couldnt bear it felicity was on the telephone when ryan arrived back at his fathers farm she greeted him with a cool smile a lift of her eyebrows and a wave to the coffeepot ryan obliged he made her coffee and then sat and waited for his love to finish speaking to new york his love his future he should be working too he told himself he was running so far behind and tonight tonight hed spent the whole night watching a turtle what a waste yeah if he told her felicity would agree it was a waste his colleagues back in new york would think it was a waste or maybe they wouldnt maybe theyd be as jealous as hell whats the time in new york he asked when felicity finally finished her phone call she was typing furiously into her laptop computer and clearly had no time for small talk about eleven midmorning what kept you did you find your suicide then it was only half a question when felicity worked she committed herself absolutely it was one of the things ryan admired about her she had a brilliant mind a brilliant body and and he gave himself a mental shake what the hell was he thinking of there was no and felicity was everything he needed in a woman everything he wanted we found him he said grimly he has aids felicity frowned was the suicide successful no close but we found him in time we resuscitated him ryan suddenly he had all felicitys attention she stared up at him appalled ryan i hope you took precautions we used a mask and gloves ryan for heavens sake resuscitating aids patients is not your job if thats what abbey wants to do fine but to haul you in she has no right no she didnt abbey had no right to ask anything of him at all and the thought of her not having that right made ryan sick at heart abbey was his friend with a huge mental shake ryan managed to shove the thought of abbey asidethe thought of abbey in his armsyielding her slim body to his clinging to him welcoming his kiss as if it was right she was lovely but abbey wasnt his future she couldnt be abbey was a widow and a mother and she had obligations up to her neck someone like abbey would fit into his new york life like a fish out of water he shruggedand turned to phone new york turned to get on with his life chapter nine at eight the next morning there were three doctors in sapphire cove hospital and sister eileen roderick was enjoying herself im sorry doctors but i dont have enough nursing staff to accompany each of you on ward rounds she said primly i can offer one of you ted but otherwise youll have to share how about if dr wittner goes back on honeymoon where shes supposed to be ryan said darkly glowering at abbey abbey was dressed in a soft blue dress that exactly matched her eyes her curls were bouncing and shining and she looked altogether too pretty for words how about if dr henry goes back to new york abbey retorted flushing ryan henry looked too darned handsome for his own good or for her peace of mind and how on earth could she concentrate on anything other than the memory of that kiss well im not going back to cairns steve interjected this place is too much fun both abbey and ryan turned to stare at steve excuse me ryan said i practically had to blackmail you to get you here then it was steves turn to flush yeah well im enjoying myself he admitted sheepishly medicines a bit dry when its only books i think i might be about to make another career change well how about a spot of nursing eileen suggested were short a few and doctors seem to be thick on the ground around here lets divvy up our patients shall we how will we work it draw straws in the end they didnt need to abbey agreed she really only needed to visit ian miller and janet to keep herself happythen shed go back to jack and her cows ryans father was due to be ambulanced back to sapphire cove within the next hour and ryan wanted to be at the hospital when his father arrived he volunteered for morning ward round that left steve free to read the morning newspapers and then take morning surgery abbey went to see janet shaking her head in bewilderment to have too many doctors steve pryor was thinking the same thing you dont want to pay me off and have me leave do you steve asked ryan as abbey disappeared down the corridor steves voice was a trifle anxious i mean you wanted me here for four weeks right yeah well ryan was watching abbey walk away and he hardly heard ryan abbeys coming back to work on monday steve went on slowly following ryans gaze i thought wasnt the idea that id help her out for a couple more weeks but we wouldnt see you here after monday youll be off getting married and looking after your dad thats right ryan was still gazing at the now empty corridor steve wasnt stupid he was putting one and two together or one and one and one and one makes two there was only one thing to do here if you want to know something badly enough then ask steve squared his shoulders and asked ryan am i imagining things here or do you fancy working with abbey yourself what ryan turned reluctantly to stare at steve no so steve put his head on one side considering you just like the workis that it the corners of his mouth twitched into a smile well if thats the case you wont mind if i ask abbey out to dinner over the weekend ryan stared you and abbey me and abbey hell and then silence the corners of steves mouth curved all the way into laughter he now knew all he needed to know gotcha he said lightly and grinned dont worry ryan in fact theres a rather special nurse who works nights whos agreed to go out with me already the date with abbey line was a ruse i just was getting vibes about you and abbey and thought i might put my vibes to the test his grin deepened to unholy enjoyment and i was right steve theres nothing ryan was fighting to gain control again steve pryor was too intelligent for his own good he saw too darned much theres nothing between me and abbey hell steve i cant object to whoever you want to date im engaged to felicity remember yeah i remember steve said dryly if i were you id do something about that its likely to cause all manner of complications ian miller looked grey tucked into a side ward by himself ian had spent the night recovering from the effects of the gas ryan paused at the door and checked him over it was no wonder hed taken a chance and guessed aids ian might still be simply hiv positive and not have fullblown aids but the man looked haggard maybe he wasnt really ill though ryan thought as he did a fast visual examination ian was thin but not to the point of emaciation underneath his fear there could well be a reasonably healthy male ryan knocked lightly on the door and ian hardly stirred hi ian finished breakfast ryan checked ians barely touched tray and frowned you want to talk ian looked up wearily from his pillows and shrugged im here on ward round ryan told him hauling up a chair and lowering his long frame as a good doctor i should examine youbut i wont if you dont want any aftereffects of the gas no then just tell me where youre up to with your aids i assume you have a definite diagnosis were not dealing with guesswork here fullblown aids or just hiv positive no guesswork drearily ian outlined his history hed heard a friend had died of aids so hed had himself tested the hiv positive diagnosis had been confirmed a month ago just hiv not fullblown aids no well thats a bonus have you had any counselling ian shook his head hell ryan im a lawyer he said bleakly i dont need counselling ive watched friends die in the past hmm ryan nodded so you tried suicide because you think youre going to die horribly and die soon yeah well i would have died last night if we hadnt messed you around ryan smiled as abbey appeared at the door hey abbey were just being accused of interfering with this mans life or death and hes a lawyer for heavens sake do you think hell sue youd better not abbey said warmly she crossed to ians bed stooped and hugged ian hard if you do ill tell your mother on you ian miller and shes a force to be reckoned with your mums been worried sick ian she guessed something was wrong way before this i think you should have told her i cant why not silence does your mother know youre gay ryan asked and ian shook his head no thats why well i live in sydney you dont think it might be kinder to tell her i dont want people here to know ian said explosively theyre so damned judgemental theyre not you know abbey said softly i think youve forgotten all the good things about small towns ian miller you and ryan both you left here when you were fifteen and seventeen respectively and youve hardly been back since but sapphire cove well one of the things its really good at is protecting its own you belong here ian you wont be tarred or feathered by your family when they know how do you know abbey tilted her head well for a start id imagine many of them have guessed youre gay already ryan had and hes working on old memories maybe youre underestimating them tell them and see if im not wrong but aids hell abbey im not just confessing im gay i have aids at the risk of repeating something thats been said time and time again aids is a word not a sentence abbey told him you tell him about the current treatments ryan ian for a start you dont have aids ryan said steadily youre hiv positive so just stop being so damned dramatic and negative and listen then ryan outlined the treatments now favoured in the usaand abbey was stunned ryan had certainly done his homework this wasnt a brief description of aids treatments at the superficial level most doctors could give some time between the time abbey had left ryan last night and now ryan had read every piece of pertinent modern literature on the current treatments and prognoses for aids ian had a sharp lawyers mind and he threw questions at ryan almost faster than abbey could think them upand ryan calmly answered every one look mate the information youre working on is years out of date he said firmly the breakthrough in aids research has been monumental youll no longer be treated with just the one drug theres a real mix the sideeffects of the combined therapies are minimal and life expectancy is increasing dramaticallyto a stage now where the medical profession is refusing to make predictions on life expectancy at all theyre cautiously optimistic that in cases like yours where you havent converted to fullblown aids then that conversion may never happen a couple of years ago we were saying life expectancy was up to five years he continued now now we dont endline it at all every case is different the life expectancy is stretching out and out and were hopeful that many cases like yours will never develop at all into fullblown aids theres millions being poured into aids funding and new breakthroughs are happening all the time maybe well just maybe given the present rate of learning youre more likely to get run over by a bus than to die in the next ten years from the disease you have ryan smiled and that would have been a waste of a funeral if youd happened to bump yourself off last nightnow wouldnt it ian stared at ryan his face was intent and fearful as though he was afraid to let himself hope youre kidding its all here mate ryan produced page after page of copious notes i thought you wouldnt believe me so i had a colleague fax through the literature ian stared up unbelieving he lifted the first sheet and read then the second and then he lifted the whole pile some of the greyness eased from his face and all of a sudden he looked lighter and younger a life sentence had just been liftedand he might just choose to live his face clouded again my job though he said fretfully im a corporate lawyer for an international company were required to have a full medical every year as part of our superannuation scheme when they know theres no way theyll keep me on then quit ryan said promptlyso promptly that abbey blinked yeah and do what do an abbey ryan looked across to abbey and his smile gentled hell ian while you and i have been out in the big wide world making our millions abbeys been here holding sapphire cove together with a piece of string and the locals love her for it ive been asking around this morning about lawyers in sapphire cove theres one hes about eighty and is capable of signing affidavits if someone holds his wrist and the magnifying glassand thats the extent of it if you were to come back well like abbey the locals would fall on your neck and ask questions later maybe itd work long term and maybe it wouldnt but in the short term i think sapphire cove might be just what you need come back i dont see why you shouldntat least for a while ryan said youre emotionally and physically exhausted it doesnt take abbeys or my medical qualifications to tell us that youve been living a nightmare and a stressful corporate job with an axe hanging over your head isnt what you need so why not come home for a while and see if sapphire cove cant work its magic on you he smiled ian abbey and i saw a turtle laying her eggs last night why dont you stick around and see those eggs hatch a turtle ian pushed himself up on his pillows like ryan and abbey and most kids around sapphire cove ian had done his own turtlehunting his eyes lit up like magic where a mile south of where we found you filling yourself with exhaust fumes if you like ill run you out later and show you ian stared and then let the doubt creep back you dont have to do that hell ryan i dont need patronising and i dont need humouring ryan said mildly if you dont want to come then say so im going out to check anyway ill stick my head in here when i leave and see if youre up to a drive his smile faded and he fixed ian with a challenging look now abbey and i have work to do and you need to think any questions maybe in a while ian told him slowly he stared down at the sheaf of papers on his bed when ive read this well leave you to it then ryan told him take it that well discharge you when youve summarised the lot for heavens sake ryan you sounded almost homesick abbey told him as they left the room together talking ian into coming back here to work if he agrees itd be the best thing for him but hes a corporate lawyer his mum says he spends half his life overseas on one international deal after another how could someone like that be happy in sapphire cove abbey glanced uncertainly at ryan shed once known this man so well and now she knew him hardly at all hed sounded convincing in there talking ian into a life in sapphire cove yet yet ryan had left it without a backward glance ians like you she said softly hes left here ryan and i dont think you can come back again to be content with sapphire cove after youve seen the big wide wodd she shrugged well youd know how hard that could be silence ryan didnt answer for the life of him he couldnt think of a single thing to say abbey looked at him for a long momentand then turned away from his side to go and visit janet sam henry arrived back at sapphire cove an hour later and within two minutes of arriving he demanded to see janet you dont think we should get you settled into a ward and give you a rest first ryan asked doubtfully sam had come though the operation with flying colours now ten days postop he was looking good but it was a long ambulance drive from cairns nope sam reached out and gripped ryans arm the ambulance officers were standing at each end of his trolley waiting for directions and sam knew exactly where he wanted to go but its good to see you still here ryan youre not married yet i hope i told you wed wait for you to get back before we tied the knot good the weddings not this afternoon no ill bring felicity in to see you this afternoon and well talk about setting a time good sam smiled in satisfaction its not organised yet then im not up to a wedding for a few days at least but janet the hand gripping ryans tightened in anxiety i need to see her you said she was fine shes fine shes only three days postop though dad and shes pretty sore not up to receiving visitors there was apprehension in sams voice and ryan frowned down at him she can have visitors i guess if its important well take you there now thats what i want sam fell back on his pillows folded his arms across his chest and prepared to be wheeled on take me away boys ive got a mended heart here and im raring to go why do you suppose my father wants to see your motherinlaw so badly ryan demanded hed tracked abbey down in sisters station and found her writing medicolegal letters and just what do you think youre doing catching up on some paperwork abbey said mildly marcia told me shed look after jack until lunchtime and it seemed too good an opportunity to miss she hesitated i guess as soon as you and steve leave ill go back to chasing my tail again i dont want to start from behind no there was silence while ryan thought about abbey chasing her tail with overwork again and thought about leaving her for good sams back then abbey asked lightly searching ryans face it seemed set and forbidding he arrived ten minutes ago and the first thing he demanded was to see janet ryans frown deepened abbey am i imagining things here do you think theres anything between the pair of them theyve always been good friends abbey told him she hesitated like you and me she added her voice slightly hesitant they were kids together that sort of thing so there couldnt be any sort of romantic attachment i told you abbey said heavily its like you and me friends thats all she searched for some way to change the subject and her eyes rested on her pile of patient notes leith kinley as good a topic as any i saw leiths dad this morning she told ryan her words sounding stiff and forced he stopped me outside the hospital as i arrived he just wanted to tell me how well leith was going with her swimming i didnt know youd been taking her for more swimming lessons yeah well ryan shrugged shes a good kid im enjoying teaching her i would have thought abbey bit her lip but the words came out anyway ryan are you spending any time at all with felicity she must be bored stupidwith all the help youve been giving me the time you spend with your dad and now leith felicitys not bored ryan said coldly well if it was my honeymoon youd hijacked id be really cross abbey said frankly and if she knew youd been kissing me last night she swallowed and stopped in midsentence the thought of kissing ryan last night flooding back with dizzying intensity but what she had to say must be said ryan had been so generous to her hed given her his honeymoon but that honeymoon also belonged to felicity ryan if youre not careful youll mess up your marriage because of me she said softly and i dont think you want to do that abbey i need to work now ryan abbey said dully please leave me alone to do that i think you should go back to felicity after that ryan finished doing his ward round which had been interrupted by sams arrival and tried to get his thoughts in order abbey was right he wasnt being fair to felicity hell hed thought felicity would have been bored stupid by now hed thought felicity wouldnt have stayed but felicity seemed to have an endless supply of work at the end of her modern and was perfectly happy to base herself at sams house while he helped abbey while he helped abbey there was no longer any need for him to help abbey he conceded as he changed the dressing on little peter harknets burned foot the local farmers were still milking abbeys cows despite her protestations and they would until janet was up and around again abbey had herself a decent babysitter her knee was almost back to normal and for the next two weeks steve was here to make her workload reasonable so so ryan should just slope on back to felicity he was like steve he didnt want to how come youre not talking pete demanded as ryan cleaned down the burned area of his foot and applied cream fiveyearold pete had burned himself by sticking his toes into a box of dry ice which had been keeping his birthday icecream cake cold hed been in childrens ward for three days normally he chattered like a butchers magpie and ryans silence wasnt to his taste cat got your tongue he demanded no ryan managed a smile sorry mate im just thinking im just thinking what a really dumb thing it is to stick your toes in places to see what it feels like i was going to taste some pete informed him just lucky i didnt do that eh mum says i would have burned the tongue right out of my head very lucky ryan agreed pete if you live till youre ten itll be a miracle my mum says youre getting married real soon pete went on unperturbed then he winced yike that hurt ryan winced too the dead skin was coming away as he gently cleaned it the procedure was impossible to do without hurting at all pete was a really brave little patient he deserved to have all his attention thats right youre marrying a lady from america yep pete screwed up his nose you sound a bit american but youre really from sapphire coveright well yes but that was a long time ago then why dont you marry someone from here and live here again like we do pete announced why dya want to go away for why indeed silence cat got your tongue pet demanded and ryan could only nod agreement ian miller didnt have time to go with him to see where the turtle had laid her eggs ryan went back to ians ward when hed finished his rounds and found him surrounded by family masses of family mother brothers sisters nieces nephews brothersinlaw the whole box and dice and somewhere in the midst of them was ian being absorbed again into the clan ian looked through the crowd and met ryans eyesand grinned the greyness in his face was receding by the minute out you lot he ordered his family heres my doctor and i want to ask him if you guys can take me home when the family had receded just outside the door ian hopped out of bed and closed it firmly against them and grinned again youd think they owned me ryan smiled back youve told them yep and you havent been cast out of the family no ians smile faded he sank onto the bed again the toll of the last few weeks emotional turmoil and his brush with death the night before had left him weak but there was a determination in his eyes which was growing by the minute abbey dr wittner was right he said the family already knew i was gay they hadnt talked about it because theyd decided it was my business and id talk about it if i wanted it talked about typical really my family they want to help they sure do ian shook his head his voice laced with wonder i told them i was hiv positive and my sisters started berating me for not laying it on them and for not trusting them my mother burst into tears and fell on my neck and my brothersinlaw told me i was a clothhead and that your idea of me practising law here was the best one theyd heard for a long time the general consensus was that id be a darn sight more use practising law in sapphire cove than pushing up daisies which im starting to think might be true ryan finished for him hell mate you can only give it a go get yourself on a firm footing again get your medical regime established and then see if you want to face the world outside sapphire cove again ryan looked out the window across the headland the sea was a wide band of sparkling sapphire against the horizon sapphire cove really is the loveliest place in the world to live he said and his voice was tinged with regret how come you dont live here any more then ian asked and ryan shrugged im still on a career path he said with some reluctance i have commitments in the states that itd take more than aids to shift and i have a fiancée who couldnt live here in a fit no i wish you all the best here mate but im afraid i have to go the turtle eggs were safe ryan should have been back at home with felicity instead he spent the next two hours sitting on the beach watching the barren sweep of sand where last night the turtle had laid her eggs the tide had done its job well there was now almost no sign that underneath the sand there were scores of tiny turtles growing towards life how long did they take to hatch heaven knew ryan didnt and he didnt want to know he didnt want to be back in the states look down at his calendar and say todays the day half sapphire cove will be out escorting baby turtles to the water he had to go back there was nothing for him here he told himself nothing sure sapphire cove was a beautiful place but he hadnt fought his way up the career ladder to abandon it nowabandon it on a whim abandon it because he wanted to please abbey the thought of abbey was overpowering he couldnt get her out of his thoughts the feel of her last night her soft curves yielding to his touch the scent of her her lovely dusky curls against his face abbey dear god he wanted her ryan shifted uneasily on the sand and finally rose he walked down to the waters edge and stood looking out to sea as if the answers could somehow be found out there they couldnt of course they couldnt he had to go home to the states he had to marry felicity no he couldnt marry felicity he couldnt last night felicity had kissed him goodnight deeplypassionately if the phone hadnt demanded her attention she would have wanted to make love and ryan hadnt wanted to make love one bit not with felicity back in the states he had thought of felicity as one of the most beautiful women be knew powerful ambitious wonderful all the adjectives hed used were still true except the wonderful he no longer wanted to many someone who spent her life attached to a mobile phone and a computer he wanted to marry abbey the thought settled into his mind like a flaming arrow and it buried itself into his heart and burned marry abbey if he married abbey then hed already have a son he and felicity had talked of children and had decided against them it wasnt that either of them disliked them it was just that they hardly felt they had time for them but jack ryan thought back to the flaminghaired toddler demanding more egg to be aeroplaned into his mouth wobbling on his sturdy little legs his head upended in a pudding bowl and ryans mouth curved into a smile itd be no problem at all to have jack maybe adopt him if abbey didnt object and abbey well she could be a fulltime mum shed like that give her a chance to be looked after for a change how would she like new york a flash of doubt swept through his mind at the thought of abbey in new york but he suppressed it fast the thought of abbey as his wife was so well so tantalising it had to be possible convincing abbey would be the easy part what came before was the hard part telling felicity hed made an awful mistake chapter ten you have to be kidding as a reaction to a marriage proposal abbeys first words left a bit to be desired ryan thought still maybe it was no more than he deserved hed asked abbey to marry him in her dairy ryan had come to abbeys that evening expecting to find her resting and with jack in bed instead hed discovered shed told the local farmers whod been milking her cows that she was fine by herself jack had been given his dinner and his mother had discussed bedtime with him but jack had had a long afternoon nap and had been in no mood for sleep hed been making mud pies in a playpen in a corner of the dairy and abbey had been milking her thirteenth cow what do you want shed demanded when ryan had come through the dairy gate and had startled abbeys cows in the process the herd had then twitched and become nervous and had made abbeys job hard ryan had been thrown so far off balance that hed told abbey what hed wanted straight out im not marrying felicity any more hed said flatly i want you as a proposal it had lacked a little finesse he told himself later abbeys reaction had confirmed it you have to be kidding she reached up and patted her cows rump settled herself again and kept right on milking no ryan stay over there she ordered as he took a couple of steps nearer my girls dont like strangers i know you milked them once but they dont remember you or maybe they do and its that thats making them nervous she frowned and he couldnt see by her face what she was thinking so tell me what have you done with your felicity i havent done anything with felicity ryan said exasperated but shes no longer my felicity shes gone home abbey can you leave your damned cows for a minute not while jacks being so good abbey smiled sweetly and only she knew the effort her nonchalance cost her im on my thirteenth cow why dont you go in and make us a cup of tea while you wait for me ryan almost ground his teeth abbey i want to speak to you damn it abbey i want to marry you abbey looked over to ryan for a long long moment then she sighed her nonchalance slipping you know ryan im almost sure you dont she rose tipped her bucket of milk into the waiting vat and went to bring in another cow ryan waited silence abbey roped her next cow into the bail and sighed ryan this is crazy she told him go inside and put the kettle on and ill be with you in fifteen minutes and she turned her back on him and started milking her fourteenth cow abbey had full need of those fifteen minutes her head was spinning shed managed to keep her voice calm she told herself proudly but it had taken a herculean effort to keep calm when ryan had asked a question like that i want you hed said well that much shed known already last night ryan had wanted abbey and abbey had wanted him their reaction to each other on the beach had been pure animal longing thats what it was lust nothing more she told herself flatly nothing but ryan must have thought it more than that today hed sent felicity away poor felicity abbey looked over to where jack was squeezing mud through his fingers he was totally engrossed in the rich black mire sliming through onto his bare knees abbey had provided him with a whole bucket of mud and it promised to keep him good for another hour or more he was dressed only in a nappy and he was filthy one of the cows whod already been milked had doubled back to watch the little boy the cow hung over jacks playpen her kindly bovine face watching jack with interest jack reached up and put one grimy finger on her noseand shouted with laughter at the black splodge on her brown velvety face this placethis lifestylewas about as far from new york as life could possibly get but ryan had just asked her to marry him good grief abbeys overwhelming sensation was shock sure ryan had kissed her last night sure she was head over heels in love with the man but marriage marriage to ryan was so far out of the realm of possibility that abbey had never dreamed of it or maybe she had dreamed but in the way someone in new york would fantasise about life in a tropical paradise a dream nothing more marriage to ryan meant life as a new york consultants wife life away from here no and no and no but marriage to ryan to be with ryan was all she wanted abbey told herself bleakly marriage to ryan was the fitting together of two halves of a whole but no way there was no way in the wide world she could marry ryan she wasnt just abbey wittner any longer she was janets daughterinlaw and jacks mother and also sapphire coves doctor a lone and independent abbey might marry ryan and adjust to life at his side on the other side of the world but jacks mum couldnt janets daughterinlaw couldnt johns widow who still had debts to pay couldnt sapphire coves only doctor couldnt so abbey blinked back tears of depressionand kept right on milking damn ryan henry why did he have to come back here in the first place abbey you must marry me abbey was hardly through the kitchen door before ryan threw his line at her abbey blanched damn ryan bit his tongue in disgust as he saw her recoil this wasnt ryan at his persuasive best he was way out of line herethrown right off balance it seemed there was only one thought in his head marriage to abbey after his visit to the turtle eggs hed gone back to felicity to find her pacing his fathers farmhouse where the hell have you been when he hadnt answered shed supplied the answer for him youve been with that girl havent you no i hed got no further felicity had picked up his laptop computerhis mind not her precious machineand had hurled it straight at him it had missed and slammed into the wall and had smashed youve wasted my time ryan henry she snarled i ought to sue you two damned weeks ive spent kicking my heels hey half that time was spent in hawaii i could have stayed in hawaii do you know how many meetings ive missed all because of you felicity even if you werent with that girl im still sick of it she snapped ive been so patient i cant believe it ive sat here and waited while you ran round after your goddammed father and i havent said a word while you operated in this godforsaken hospital and worried about that girls damned cows and then i rang the hospital looking for you and got someone called ted who sounds like a morgue attendant and he said maybe youd gone out and killed yourself on the road because it seemed to be in fashion to knock yourself off and then he changed his mind and said it was more likely you were out making love to abbey wittner and he even said that it was a shame if you werent feeling suicidal because he needs a good death to keep up the occupancy rate of his damned morgue she stopped exasperated as ryans mouth twitched into a smile no dont you dare laugh ryan ive had enough whether you were with her or not i dont care im not staying this whole place is crazy and if i stay one minute longer itll infect me she paused for breath ryan theres an urgent meeting tomorrow afternoon in new york theyve just emailed me and i must be there she hesitated for a whole ten secondsand then hauled the diamond from her left hand im going but i dont think you want me to take this with medo you ryan felicity i dont want to take it she confided softening a little and pressing it into his hand ryan i decided to marry you because you knew where you were going in life now well youre vacillating and i cant stand it she reached out and kissed his forehead goodbye ryan then she stared down at his smashed computer and it was her turn to smile and i hope i crashed your hard disk that was the end of felicity and all ryan could think of as he watched her pack and leave was that now he was free to talk to abbey and now here was abbey standing at the kitchen door in filthy overalls and gum boots and her toddler in her arms dripping mud his one thought kept echoing abbey you must marry me abbey didnt answer she simply held jack out to him and before he knew it ryan had a splodge of muddy baby in his arms you bath him while i take a shower and then ill make us both an omelette she said abbey i refuse to cope with perfectly ridiculous requests on an empty stomach was not a perfectly ridiculous request wash my son and then well talk about it washing jack was not as easy as it looked in fact it took three rinses before the water ran clean jack thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience the only part he didnt enjoy was getting dressed again ryan finally gave up and came out into the kitchen carrying a naked toddler in one arm and a nappy in the other ok you win i need a mother here abbey was clean herself there was a cold shower on the back verandah shed thrown herself under it in the hope it might shake some sense into her head and then hauled on jeans and a tshirt she should be cool instead she was as hot and flustered as shed ever been in her life keep it light abbey told herself keep it keep it away from heartbreak you mean you can cope with the intricacies of microsurgery but not a piece of flannel thats right wuss it was so hard to keep her voice light she had the makings of omelette on the table now she took her naked son from ryan and pointed to the eggs ok if you cant do nappies youre on omelette duty ryan blinked hell abbey i cant cook why not ive never learned i have a housekeeper a housekeeper back in new york well yes and if i married you would i have a housekeeper abbey asked carefully i guess yeah of course you would mrs ohara could look after jack while i went out to work abbey i dont know about registration in the states ryan admitted its been easier for me here because i have australian citizenship ill have to look into whether you need to retrain or not registration could take some time he spread his hands but hell abbey youve worked so hard all your life why dont you marry me and let me take care of you for a while i wouldnt know how to abbey confessed ryan just hold on here she hugged her small naked son against her as if he gave her strength this morning you were engaged to felicity right right but but youre not engaged to her now no why not because we dont love one another ryan wanted to lunge over and take abbey in his arms make her feel like he was feeling desperate to have her close but it was a bit hard to lunge at a woman with a naked baby hugged to her breast abbey closed her eyes you decided that today then that you dont love felicity just like that abbey felicity and i have never loved each other ryan said slowly pushing back the urge to lunge admired and respected each otheryes thought we were compatibleyes i thought id be proud to call felicity my wife and she felt the same about me but marriage to each other was something that suited us it would have made no demands on our lifestyles it would have fitted in and now ive discovered that its not enough ryan said simply i want you i see silence abbey turned away to a couch by the stove bent over and started putting a nappy on her son ryan watched in silence as jack submitted to his nappy with no trouble at all finally respectable jack was set on his feet to toddle out to the verandah the sun was setting in the west over the mountains the hens were starting to roost and jack headed off toward the henhouses to watch his friends put themselves to bed as if ryan wasnt there abbey wandered out to watch her idea of cooking omelettes forgotten ryan followed marriage abbey whispered she put her hands on the weathered verandah rail and looked out over her rundown farm you really want to marry me i do ryan came up behind her and put his hands on her shoulders touching her felt so good so right he wanted to swing her around and pull her into his arms but he knew instinctively that she would resist she wasnt ready her body was tense beneath his hands ryan you dont want to stay here she whispered no of course not ryans grip tightened my works important hell abbey i make more in a week in new york than i think you make in a year we can both be comfortable on my income jack can go to any school he wants he can have everything we can have more children he did turn her then so she was facing him against the setting sun abbey i love you he said softly and he tilted her chin so she was forced to look up at him i think i always have i didnt want to leave when i was fifteen and i should have come back before this i never realised id left something so precious behind and now youve realised youll pick it up and take it away take me back to new york if youll come he stooped to kiss her but abbey pulled back her eyes searching his in the soft twilight ryan no she fended him off pushing him away with her hands and the feel of his heartbeat under her palms made her want to cry what she had to say was so hard that she wasnt just abbey she was jacks mum janets daughterinlaw sapphire coves doctor ryan what you said about you and felicity fitting into each others lifestylesit may not be the most important thing about a marriage but its important all the same youd fit he took her waist and pulled her into his arms but she still resisted believe me abbey youd fit maybe she whispered maybe id fit into your lifestyle but maybe i wouldnt be happy fitting into your lifestyle and i cant see you fitting into mine abbey ryan looked down into her troubled eyes hell sweetheart he lifted a hand from her waist and gestured around him you cant live like this for the rest of your life in debt and up to your ears in work no but i cant live like you want me to either she said sadly in wealth and up to my ears in idleness abbey i want to look after you yeah well im not ten years old now ryan henry she snapped and suddenly hauled herself back from him he was being obtuse here thick im twentyeight years old and im a doctor and i know it sounds pious ryan but here people need me jack needs me janet and sam need me sapphire cove needs me im not going to walk away and i think she took a deep breath and desolation welled up all around her i think jack needs to grow up here his grandmas here there are people here who loved his daddy if i took him away itd be like cutting him off from his fathers memory for ever and i cant do that abbey please ryan her voice was desolate dont all i want to do is come with you she looked up at him her eyes bright with tears i love you ryan henry she admitted i want you more than anything in the world but but ryan ive only just found my turtle i have to stay he did lunge then the sight of her small and defenceless and desolate standing there in her bare feet on floorboards that threatened to rot away underneath her to leave her before she could protest he gathered her into his arms and he held her close moulding her body to his he kissed the top of her head and she buried her face in his chest to stop him kissing her anywhere else ryan dont please abbey i must this is nonsense we can take janet with us youll have janet and jack and well come back i promise well return for a month every year so jack can learn to love this place and i can spend time with my father ryans hands caressed the small of her back and he pressed her to him with such tenderness that abbey almost said yes it would be so easy all her problems solved by uttering one word she couldnt say it she stood with her face pressed against the soft fabric of ryans shirt and she felt his heart beating against hers this was her home this was right but nothing else was new york housekeepers luxury the little hospital here would close without a permanent doctor sam would break his heart janet would refuse to come and would be alone and jack would have to wear shoes and not play in mud and when he grew up a little he wouldnt be able to search for turtles turtles in a little while the turtles buried safe under the sand would hatch and make their way down to the sea abbey knew that the whole town would turn out to watch shed take jack to see and then maybe then the hard work and the poverty would be paid for ryan said he earned more in a week than she did in a year maybe but her payment was something you couldnt measure in dollars living in sapphire cove was a heritage for her son living here was companionship for sams and janets old age and it was turtles i cant marry you ryan henry abbey said sadly and her voice was so muffled against his chest that he had to bend his head to hear i cant marry you because you dont have turtles in new york and it was a measure of ryans love for her that he knew exactly what she meant and he knew he couldnt make her change her mind chapter eleven you love him janet was standing beside her bed leaning heavily on her walkingframe a week postop she was recovering brilliantly janet thought rehabilitation hospitals were for wimpsdefinitely not for the likes of janet wittnerso rehabilitation had to come to her ryan had organised a walking racetwo waisthigh bars about five yards long and a couple of feet apartto be installed in the hospital corridor for her to practise her walking abbey intended to supervise her practice now janet took three halting steps towards her race supported with her walking frame and then she paused and turned back to where abbey was standing by her bed janets eyes were troubled dont think i cant see whats eating you girl she said gently every day youve been coming here the shadows under your eyes have been growing with that nice dr pryor helping out at the hospital and ryan henry putting his oar in as well youre more rested than youve been for years but still the shadows ive been worried about you abbey told her a touch of defiance in her voice and janet snorted pull the other leg abbey the new hip your ryans given me is working almost as well as the old one already in a couple of weeks ill be as good as new better and then janet frowned youre not worried about me in other ways i hope youre not worried about me being on my own if you marry your ryan abbey winced janet thats crazy hes not hes not my ryan no that fiancée of his has left him to go back to america he doesnt seem to be pining one bit and the way he looks at you abbey has he asked you to marry him and at the look on abbeys face janets frown deepened he has she announced softly in a voice of discovery and youve told him no i can see it in your face abbey for heavens sake why did you say no its almost two years since john died if i as johns mother think its time you got a new life for yourself then surely you should too her eyes perused abbeys face with care abbey you love ryan henry she said slowly you love him so why refuse to marry him abbey shook her head but janets eyes didnt leave her face she stood waiting for an answer and abbey had to find one janet i must refuse him abbey said at last what choice do i have she dug her hands deep into the pockets of her white coat as though her doctors uniform were some sort of security janet ryan wants me to be a new york consultants wife how on earth can i be that she bit her lip im a doctor in my own right i fought hard to be what i am youll be what you are if youre here or if youre on the other side of the world janet said brusquely youll be just the same abbey only youll be with ryan no abbey shook her head i wont be janet ryan doesnt even know whether i can get registration he doesnt know if i can work and he doesnt see he doesnt see that its important is it important you know it is abbey crossed to the window and stared out over the headland to the sea beyond janet this hospital i fought so hard for it we need it sapphire cove needs it i cant just walk away not even with ryan abbey shook her head i love ryan but thats not all there is in the world she said just like my medicines important but its not everything jack my little jack would have to wear shoes hed lose his people she flung herself around so she was facing janet again ryan says you could come with us would you want to come whatme in new york janets face sagged in astonishment you have to be joking i was born in sapphire cove and ill die in sapphire cove thank you very much the thought of big cities fills me with the heebiejeebies same here abbey told her and tried to smile so you see its impossible crazy and yet youre breaking your heart to go with him it broke my heart when john died abbey said bleakly and yet here i am two years later discussing marrying someone else life goes on ill live she stirred herself and crossed to hold the door open for janet enough talk lets get you out to the race and get you walking when all else fails janet wittner theres always work there was more than that abbey thought as she and eileen took janet carefully through her exercises more than just work in her life there was this place a wonderful nursing staff her little son janet so why did life still seem so bleak youre in love with abbey wittner sam henry had one sock on and one sock off now he paused in his attempts to dress himself and fixed his son with a glare im right arent i boy youre in love with our abbey dad if you want me to take you out to see where these turtle eggs are incubating then lets keep the talk impersonal otherwise i might cut and run like you and your mother did twenty years ago dad your mother didnt like getting involved sam said darkly thats why she hated it here hated sapphire cove she should never have agreed to marry me in the first place sam hauled his shoes on and gave his hand to his son to help him up although sam was recovering well he was still weak at the knees and breathless in a few days hed go home but this was a first an outing with ryan and then back to hospital at the end of it you thinking of marrying her he demanded bluntly dad theres no use telling me to mind my own business sam told him youre my sonremember so tell me your fiancées sloped off back to new york and youre carrying a ring around with no one to give it toright so youre thinking of marrying our abbey he steadied on his feet but he didnt relinquish his grip on his son you could do worse ryan abbeys a damned fine girl i know she is ryan said heavily and then he shrugged talking to his father about his personal life was new to him but he liked the sensation it was just well hard to get used to and it was uncomfortable talking about abbey dad i have asked her to marry me he confessed sam stared yeah his whole face lightened you and abbey well well shes refused sam frowned why on earth ryan janet tells me shes nuts about you janet says dad have you and janet been talking about us you have to do something in this dratted hospital if youre not to go stircrazy sam retorted between bedpans and library trolleys and people making you do a damned stupid set of exercises talking to janets been a lifeline and shes worried about that girl of hers says shes breaking her heart over you not so youd notice ryan said morosely she wont marry me hell why not sams face was still eager maybe its just she needs time to get used to the idea ryan itd be great he took a deep breath tell you what if itll help ill buy a little place down closer to the beach and let you kids have the homestead its too big for me and itd be a great place to bring up kids that is he was watching ryans bleak face if you want more kids but ryan shook his head dad thats more than generous but you must see even if abbey marries me we couldnt live here silence why not sam asked at last but the light had faded from his face as if it had never been because my life is in new york ryan said explosively hell dad i have a career and abbey doesnt well yes but what sort of career it pays peanuts and you know it maybe abbeys content with peanuts sam said sadly how can she be ryan demanded and it was as if he was talking to himself she works herself into the ground for nothing but the lifestyle im offering her i could look after her take her away from all this but abbey loves all this sams face softened and ryan so should you you were born here this is your heritage too ryan stared at him in astonishment dad are you seriously suggesting that i should stay here if you want abbey if abbey loves me then shell come with me no sam shook his head abbeys not that selfish selfish abbey could go with you tomorrowjanet tells me thatand be content heck ryan abbeys been your other half since she was kneehigh to a grasshopper the two of you are meant for each other but she wont abandon her responsibilities and you cant ask her to its not like sapphire cove owns her no sam said sadly its not but you dont either and you never will i dont want to own her dont you sam shook his head by taking abbey away from sapphire cove what would she have but you shed be totally dependent on you for her happiness and you would it be the same for you will you be dependent on her i dont think so ill just bet you dont intend to drop your work commitments by one bit i cant dad so you wont change your lifestyle and youll expect abbey to fit in around the edges of your existing life sam demanded harshly other women marry men like me other women arent abbey sam said roughly and he sat heavily on the bed if you want other women go marry other women if you want abbey i suggest you marry her for what she is a woman with a heart too big to ever think of leaving us he looked up at his son and his eyes were full of pain im feeling too tired to go look for turtle eggs he said sadly you go by yourself stare out to sea and think about whether poverty really means peanuts or whether you really know what love means at all chapter twelve the following few days were some of the bleakest of abbeys life she should have been cheerful so many of her problems were solved janets walking went from strength to strength at the end of the following week janet could walk unaided from one end of the corridor to the other and was agitating to go home only the knowledge that shed refuse to take things easy when she did go home made abbey keep her in hospital for a few days longer sam was home already ryan had taken him out to the farm and abbey hardly saw either of them if there were problems wed have heard steve pryor told her at the end of the following friday but if youre worried why dont you take off early and drop in and see him no abbey and steve had been sharing the workload for the previous week and had found they worked well together with two doctors working together everything was well under control the hospital was quiet and there was no reason abbey shouldnt leave early but to drop in on sam meant dropping in on ryan no and no and no are you busy tomorrow steve asked and abbey hauled her thoughts back to work no im not busy and my babysitters available if you want me to work could you run the morning clinic steve asked then he turned pink i caroline and i caroline the pretty young night sister abbey smiled youd like to do something together just spend the day at the beach steve confessed his blush deepened i dont usually swim but caroline caroline was hauling this young man from his academic pursuits with the strength of a bulldozer abbey thought steve only had a week more to work in sapphire cove but if caroline had her way her thoughts flew off at a tangent maybe steve could be persuaded to work here then she could leave no she couldnt there was still janet there were still her debts there was still her little son who should be brought up in the place his father loved whats wrong abbey steve asked gently you look sad do i abbey managed a smile nope i was just reminiscing about young love far be it from me to put my oar between the pair of you certainly have the day off with caroline you can work sunday i hoped youd say that steve leaned over and kissed her on the nose as working companions theyd achieved almost instant rapport and abbey was growing fonder of this owlish young man by the minute and i wouldnt get too nostalgic about young love just yet dr wittner youre not exactly greyhaired and matronly im a widow steve and ryan henrys just lost a fiancée steve i know steve held up his hands in mock surrender youre just good friends and im the monkeys uncle he laughed and left her walking down the hospital corridor with his stethoscope swinging jauntily and a bounce in his step steve was in love and he wanted the world to be in love with him well abbey was in love but but there was no happy ending for her love it didnt put a bounce in her step a week from today ryan was due to go back to new york and life was due to go right back to where shed left off three weeks ago there was no real need for her to even say goodbye she thought bleakly ryan could leave next week without her seeing him again it didnt happen of course later that night ryan telephoned her and asked if he could see her abbey closed her eyes in pain told him she was busy and put the phone down on its cradle before she broke down and wept she stayed awake all night and stared into the darkness thought about the impossibility of what ryan was asking her to do thought about the impossibility of not doing what he wanted thought about life without ryan impossible on saturday morning she rose and dressed and the shadows on her face were darker than ever she performed morning surgery like an automaton and by the end of the morning there wasnt a patient shed seen who didnt know there was something seriously amiss with sapphire coves dr wittner and most of them figured what it was there were telephone calls going from one end of the community to the other but the last telephone call of the morning was the worst abbey was in sisters station when it came though it was rod at the surf club and his voice was shaking as he tried to speak dr wittner youd better get over here fast some idiots driven a jet ski straight through the stinger net and into the swimmers weve got two children and dr pryor injured hereand theyre all in a bad way a jet ski abbey stood motionless for two seconds while she took this on board and there was no comfort in her thoughts jet skis were like powerful motorbikes on water they were totally banned from the swimming beach dear heaven the injuries could be horrific im on my way she snapped pressure on bleeding wounds rod you know you can cope until i get there she slammed down the phone and turned to eileen eileen had been pushing a medication trolley down the corridor but had stopped dead shed seen abbeys face eileen take over the phone abbey told her her mind racing tell the ambulance to get to the surf club fast a jet skis hit swimmers and there are three casualties rod sounds horrified and he doesnt scare easily im going ahead now tell the boys to bring as much plasma as they can find if you can find someone to cover for you here then you come too ring the air ambulance from cairns and get a helicopter here fast and eileen yes abbey took a deep breath ring dr henry if hes still in sapphire cove we need him i have a feeling we need everyone we can get for the five minutes it took abbey to reach the beach she prayed she was overreacting surely calling the air ambulance was unnecessary surely notifying ryan was stupid she wasnt overreacting at all abbeys car flew over the last hill and one look at the beach told her she was in dire trouble no one was in the water and for a hot saturday that was almost unheardof instead there were scores of people milling around the beach in horrified clusters there were three main groups two children had been injured rob had said and dr pryor steve dear heaven abbey pushed her little car as far over the beach as she dared then grabbed her bag and ran the rest of the way her bruised knee was forgotten there were people everywhere abbey it was rod seeing her and calling through the crowd and his voice was urgent abbey i need you here now not yet first she should check all casualties and sort out priorities triage abbey gave a helpless look around there seemed to be blood and people everywhere many of the swimmers were bloodstained at a guess many had carried the injured from the water there was mass shock mass distress and tears and the sobbing of frightened children caroline the nurse whod come to the beach with steve was bending over a child and she seemed to be working frantically but rods voice was just as frantic and abbey finally abandoned triage as an impossibility she trusted rod enough to be led two seconds later she was at rods side and she knew there could be no higher priority than the one facing her steve steve pryors leg was slashed to the bone and bright red arterial blood was spurting upwards i cant stop it rod gasped abbey help he was searching desperately for a pressure point and getting nowhere the wound was massive get me towels abbey snatched the first towel she could see from one of the limp and appalled bystanders she shoved it into a pad over steves leg and pressed as hard as she could she used every muscle she had and a few she didnt know she possessed as she pressed downward ok rod wind another towel around the top of his leg fast youll have to burrow under the leg as i cant take the pressure off here and don she looked up and directed her gaze at a middleaged man with a beer gut the local publican don i need your help get everyones towels beachbagsanything you can lay your hands onand shove them under steve from his waist to his feet work under me put them under his hips use them to shore up sand and build a pile i want steves legs to be above his heart from waist to ankles the publican looked a sickly shade of green abbey i cant dont give me cant abbey snapped stevell die if you cant just do it as the publican moved to do her bidding abbey glanced up as another car roared across the beach and stopped in a shower of sand its tyres spinning ryan too had beaten the ambulance ryan she wasnt alone there was no time for abbey to do more than glance upwards and say a tiny thankful prayer that eileen had been able to locate him all her concentration was on getting enough pressure on the pad to stop steve bleeding where on earth was the ambulance she had to have plasma now and what about the injured children ryan i havent done triage she gasped as ryan reached her side she was pushing down as hard as she could on steves leg and she couldnt move there are two others hurt but i cant leave this theres a girl with a gashed arm my boys are dealing with her rod told her briefly he was hauling another towel tight around steves upper leg he glanced up at ryan but leith kinleys just over there doc and shes hurt bad we carried her out of the water on a surfboard because she wasnt feeling her legs carolinethe nurse who was with doc pryoris with her but she looks i dunno leith kinley their little asthmatic ryans swimming pupil ryan took one long hard look down at the nearunconscious steve and turned to where leith was lying ten yards away abbey felt her heart give a sickening lurch leith but she had to leave leith to ryan if she didnt concentrate on what she was doing steve would bleed to death under her hands where on earth was the ambulance and what had happened it seemed inconceivable that someone just ride a jet ski into the swimming beach and then the ambulance screamed across the sand followed by the local police car the fire truck and the state emergency services van for good measure eileen had clearly decided that the more people helping the better and eileen herself arrived in the hospital car with plasma eileen had plasma for steve plasma meant the difference between life and death and hed lost so much blood now that the line between the two was growing very close indeed for the next few minutes abbey couldnt think past getting the plasma running into steves body and the flood of blood from his leg completely stopped finally with the combined effort of abbey rod don and eileen they achieved success abbey sat back in the sand and looked down she took three deep breaths as if she hadnt had time to breathe until now steves leg was no longer bleeding the tourniquet would have to be loosened every few minutes to let the blood flow through but shed tied towelling pads across the wound so tightly that it shouldnt be a problem plasma and intravenous fluids were flowing into steves veins and adrenalin to counter shock his pulse was thready but still there he was young and strong hed need a decent surgeon to repair the damage to his thigh but barring complications steve should live youll make it steve abbey whispered as she saw his eyelids flutter open she gripped his hand and held tight shed only known this young doctor for three weeks but he was already a friend hes a bloody hero don said faintly despite his initial protest don had worked like a trojan building steve up with towels and sand so his thighs were at a thirty degree angle to his torso it had made abbeys job of stemming the blood loss much easier and don hadnt fainted once now though with urgent needs over don shoved his head between his knees and took a few deep breaths himself when he finally raised his head he looked better you know he saved the kids don said how abbey was looping a vast strip of elastoplast around the pad of towels pressing down on steves leg she didnt want the pad coming loose before he reached cairns steve would have to go to cairns she knew and probably on to brisbane he needed plastic surgeons skilled in reconstruction for this leg there was a bloody kid on a jet ski don told her roughly glaring around the beach as if trying to locate him showing off outside the nets in bathers and no other protection mind then the obvious happens he gets stung by a stinger of some sort and assumes its a box jellyfish panics and starts screaming and then comes haring through the nets to the beach forgot the nets would foul him got all tangled up and wrenched out of itstraight into a group of kids steve here saw him coming don added staring down at the injured doctor in awe faster than the rest of us put together i reckon he lunged across and shoved the kids out of the way if it wasnt for steve its my guess wed have half a dozen dead kids oh steve and then carolinethe only qualified nurse on the beachtried to stop his leg bleeding and steve made her go to leith rod added the lifesaver had fixed the tourniquet to his satisfaction and now was wiping some of the blood from his hands with an already bloodied towel towel sales in sapphire cove were due to go through the roof in the next few days abbey thought grimly caroline showed us how to get leith out of the water without moving her back but meanwhile steve here was bleeding like a stuck pig the lifesaver shoved his hand on steves shoulder and gripped hard youre all right mate a bloody hero bloody was right no one smiled leith steve said faintly abbey leith ryans with leith abbey told him you go too ill be right you go abbey stooped and gave him a quick hug sent a silent message to eileen with her eyes to look after himand then went once steves bleeding had stopped leith was in more trouble than steve she was conscious and there seemed little blood but as abbey approached she could tell things were serious by the look of grimness around ryans mouth ryan ryan looked up and saw her and then looked down again he was injecting morphine into leiths lateral thigh and it took his entire attention he signalled to caroline to keep holding the little girls hands thatll stop the pain leith ryan said gently just dont move one inch you hear i want the painkillers to work and they cant work if you move he rose to greet abbey steve there was no disguising the anxiety in ryans voice ive stopped the bleeding and ive set up a line for plasma he should be ok the leg retrievable not by me though id imagine hell have to go to brisbane the air ambulance service is sending a helicopter it should be here any minute theyll take him to cairns stabilise him and send him on leith id guess fractured spine oh ryan im not sure of the damage ryan said grimly but shes not feeling her legs what else is there ill find out abbey said grimly oh god the other two casualties were a child with a gashed armitd need stitching but abbey could do that at sapphire coveand a boy with a bluebottle sting the rider of the jet ski i thought i must have been stung by a box jellyfish like that boy was a couple of weeks back paul muttered over and over again bluebottles were tiny airfilled saclike jellyfish that trailed along the waters surface they stung but the pain eased after thirty minutes or so with no lasting damage paul was all of twelve years old and what had happened had him appalled i never meant i never its not your fault paul abbey said wearily and she gave him a hug as she washed down his leg with fresh water she was right it was his stupid parents for letting him have such a powerful machine in the first place abbey badly wanted to kick someoneand she couldnt kick a twelveyearold his parents were just as appalled as paul they were being punished enough without abbey kicking which didnt ease abbeys desire to kick one bit she went back to check steve and found him drifting in and out of consciousness shed given him as much morphine as she dared and then the helicopter roared in overhead and came in to land on the firm damp sand at the waters edge you go with them abbey yelled at ryan over the noise of the chopper as steve and leith were skilfully loaded onto stretchers she glanced down at leith and her mouth tightened in fear a broken back was leith facing paraplegiaor worse maybe maybe with ryan the child had a chance spinal injuries were so unpredictable but if ryan was there please ryan i want you to go ryan looked down at abbey with an unreadable expression on his face and he went chapter thirteen ryan was away for five days for those five days abbey hardly had time to blink she was thrust back into her old workload with a vengeance steve pryor was undergoing massive reconstruction of his thigh he wouldnt lose his leg but it would take months before he was able to use it in anywhere near a normal fashion caroline the night sister whod spent the day at the beach with him travelled to brisbane so thered be someone with him during major surgery it turned out steve had no family caroline was it and by the look of her haggard face as she arrived back in sapphire cove abbey knew caroline wouldnt have it any other way hes such an owl caroline sniffed into abbeys arms such a gentle loving person and he saved those kids i dont think i can bear it youre in love with him abbey said on a note of discovery and that produced more sniffs and a fast retreat into a handkerchief yes but now i mean it all happened so fast i only went out with him the once and hows he supposed to believe i love him already and now hes in brisbane and im here and he was only here on a locum anyway and im never going to see him again lets see what steve has to say about that when hes feeling a bit better abbey smiled and then asked what she most wanted to know now tell me hows leith is ryan still with her caroline hauled herself together and blew her nose and managed a watery smile dr henry assisted at the operation the surgeons down there asked him to oh dr wittner they think hes wonderful no one thought shed walk again but theres some new technique dr henry knew was being trialled the surgeons here did a video conferencing session with some of dr henrys colleagues in the statespaediatric orthopaedic surgeons the best in the world dr henry organised it so it seemed like they were actually in the theatre while they were operating on abbey and now they say theres a really good chance she will walk well well abbey took it all in and hugged it against her heart it helped it helped that even if she couldnt marry ryan the ryan she knew and loved was still going strong she was proud of him she ached for him she loved him it had to be shoved aside for the moment thered be time to be really miserable later there were all sorts of aftereffects from the accident on the beach paul the child whod been riding the jet ski had been admitted to hospital suffering from shock and it would take all her skills to pull him out of it without serious emotional scars his parents were almost as bad basically goodhearted people they were deeply distressed at what had happened the police sergeant wasnt helping he wanted blood and when abbey counselled him strongly about taking it further he broke down and wept and needed help himself the small child with the gashed arm was the least of her worries wendy was proud of her stitches but her parents were upset then the local school teacher wanted abbey to come and speak to the children at assembly as the children were desperate to know what was going on and there was her ordinary hospital work abbey asked the farmers to take over her cows again and marcia kept on helping with jack but still she finished each day exhausted and missing ryan janet was still recovering following her exercise regime with stoic determination with reason on the fifth day after the accident abbey walked into janets ward to find her sitting up in bed with sam at her side that didnt surprise her sam had been a constant visitor what did surprise her were the silly grins on both of their faces they sat hand in hand on the bed and they looked for all the world like two teenagers caught having an illicit cuddle abbey lifted her eyebrows and smiled a query sorry guys you want me to come back later no janet blushed and looked at sam and blushed again we have something to say to you sam said seriously and it was his turn to turn pink and abbey knew you want to ask for janets hand in marriage she said in delight dont you well sams smile deepened in quiet satisfaction i should ask someone have you asked janet yes and she said yes sam said bluntly she said shell marry me if youll marry ryan abbey frowned i like the marriage idea she said slowly i dont agree with the if part of the deal it doesnt make sense thats what i told her sam said but she wont leave you by yourself im not by myself abbey took a deep breath so you two love each other yes sam said firmly and put his arm around janets waist we do then im walking out of here right now and announcing it to the world abbey told them sam and janet are getting married and theres no conditions applying not one she hugged them both and dont you dare stuff this up by stupid quibbles janet wittner she ordered youve got your sam and i have my little jack i wont be lonely only it wasnt quite true jack was here but anywhere without ryan was lonely where was he hed been away for five days why didnt he return half of her was starting to think that the next thing theyd hear from ryan would be a phone call from new york to say that his career had reclaimed him and it was time to get on with his life at two the next morning someone knocked hard on abbeys door abbey flicked on her bedside light and looked blearily at the clock two people telephoned in an emergency they didnt come here for a moment she felt a pang of alarm this little cottage was set back far from the road and apart from jack she was alone still if it was an emergency she hauled a wrap around her flimsy nightgown went to the door and opened it a crack ryan she shut it again for the life of her she couldnt think of anything else to do abbey go away ryan henry she said breathlessly its two in the morning im not im not dressed to receive visitors im not a visitor im me ryan twenty years ago when i came at midnight to take you turtlehunting you never had maidenly quibbles you want to go turtlehunting she demanded with her back to the door and ryan laughed no abbey i dont im looking for something much more precious let me in why should i because i love you silence the words echoed round and round abbeys little living room this was dangerous ryan abbey im not here to demand you leave everything you love ryan pleaded i promise let me in abbey took a deep breath this was mad crazy but there was nothing else to do but let him in shed expected to open the door and have him sedately step inside no such thing she opened the door an inch it was shoved wide with ruthless force and she was swept right up into ryans arms and kissed so thoroughly that there was no possible way she could protest and after the first millisecond she didnt try abbey wound her arms around his neck and kissed him right back crazy crazy crazy but sense was for tomorrow crazy was for now ryan was for now he swung her round and round the room his kiss intensifying as he whirled abbey was laughing and dizzy and so madly in love her feet wouldnt have touched the ground even if shed been standing there was only ryan there was only this love and finallysomehowthey were in her bedroom falling onto the soft covers and ryans mouth left off claiming hers he lay with abbey in his arms and he pulled away so he could see her his hand reached up and switched off the bedlight and there was only the light from the full moon glimmering onto the land and through the open window from the sea woman you are driving me crazy ryan groaned you know that five days five days since ive seen you and i havent had you out of my head for one minute abbey you must marry me to save my sanity you must and he hauled her tighter to him tighteruntil his need was her need and the world was fusing in a mist of love and desire and the coming together of two people who were right for each other but they werent they couldnt be somehow abbey made herself push away she held ryan at arms length and she looked into his eyes in the dim light and what she saw there told her that she was truly loved but it wasnt enough in the next bedroom lay her little boy and there was a hospital five minutes down the road that depended on her and janet no janet had sorted out her own loneliness but there was no way abbey could find the same happiness ryan this is crazy we cant her breath broke on a sob i cant you can ryans hand held her and he smileda smile that made her heart do crazy things inside her breast abbey for the past five days ive been thinking really thinking leiths injury leith its touch and go whether shell walk again ryan told her she needs expert rehabilitation more than just swimming lessons now and i thought if i went back to the states id never know that it was done properly id walk away and it would be up to others to see that she had the right treatment but hush he told her listen over the past five days ive been seeing sapphire cove at its best ive watched how surrounded leiths parents have been and steve hes down there in brisbane and he has no family at all but i dont think theres a family in sapphire cove who havent sent him flowers or chocolates or fruit or something the local primaryschool children have sent him pictures to decorate his walls his bedrooms packed hes touched to the core and he wants to come back steves been a loner all his life trying to find roots and hes found them here he wants to work here whatpermanently yes he wants to marry caroline and stay here are you saying i could go because of that abbey asked slowly go with you to the states no he kissed her then lightly on the nose im not at first thats what i thought but then the more i thought about it the more jealous i grew jealous of steve his decision seemed so right to stay here with the woman he loved to live long term in a community like this to bring his kids up where they could hunt for turtles sso so if its ok with you ill rearrange my life ryan said seriously steve and i have it figured steve and you steve and i and my coresearchers in the states the reason ive come here so late is that this is the only reasonable time i can talk to new york and ive been trying to organise everything so i can hand you a deal on a platter he hauled her close again and kissed her a deal abbey rhodes abbey wittner abbey soontobehenry you want to hear my deal its taken me days and days to organise it so its worth a listen and he kissed her again so deeply that there was no way in the wide world that she could hear anything at all then he managed to pull away ryan was laughing down at her in the moonlight triumphant and loving and abbeys heart was turning somersault after somersault so fast she could hardly breathe want to hear he demanded again and abbey managed a shaken laugh oh ryan of course i want to hear of course my plan is this he held her at arms length and groaned hell abbey stop looking so damned beautiful i cant make myself think here think she told him severely you need a bucket of cold water ryan henry then she reached out and touched him on the lips with her finger and laughed with joy i need a bucket of cold water myself tell me fast ryan she begged fast im moving here to live permanently that stopped her the laughter died ryan you cant she said uncertainly your career she shook her head ryan youd be like me in the states a fish out of water nope he pulled her to him again and kissed her hair not a fish out of water he held her close and spoke thickly into her curls its all organised steves interested in my research areas hes bright and young and keen as mustard cairns is only an hour and a half away and it has an international airport were going to keep on with our research im going to keep on with my teaching commitments in the statesvia video conferencing ill be working here with steve intermittently in cairns and brisbane and twice a year ill have to fly back to the states for twoweek stints at the hospital where im based now but ninety per cent of the time ill be based here abbey wittner here but but how the world is getting smaller ryan told her holding her close with video conferencing the internet emailhell abbey i spend my life in the states on the end of a modern talking to doctors two rooms away now ill be doing the same thing but ill be half a world away and ill keep my feet on the ground by indulging in a little general practice as will steve so between us well give sapphire cove three parttime doctors you and me and steve and well all five happily ever after then the laughter in his voice died and his eyes became a trace uncertain anxious how does that sound my lovely abbey will it work will you mind me going back to the statesleaving you for two weeks twice a year ill give up my research if i mustto win you if its not enough oh ryan tell me abbey no abbey said breathlessly and her eyes were bright with unshed tears its not enough ryan henry eleven months of a year are not enough as a basis for a marriage abbey ill only marry you on one condition ryan henry abbey murmured joyfully and she put her arms around him and held him close so close she thought shed never let him go again not ever condition ryans voice was slurred by love and desire abbeys body was curled into his and his hands were sliding under her wrap feeling the delicious contours of her body pulling her against him a man and a woman becoming one on condition that when you go back to the states for your month every year im going too abbey told him me and jack your family whither thou goest i go my love my home is your home ryan henry my heart is your heart ryan closed his eyes in any mans life there should be this pinnacle of joy he told himself this was it this was the moment hed been waiting for all his life and now he was here he couldnt believe hed reached it you want to wake jack he asked and his voice was as unsteady as hed ever heard it as unsure tell him hes got a new daddy but abbey was shaking her head and her hands were moving down down in a gesture of pure wifely possession lets not she whispered as her fingers found what they were looking for lets do something else chapter fourteen ryan and abbey henrys honeymoon lasted one whole night before it was interrupted janet and sam married two weeks earlierwere in our seventies we dont have as much time as you young things for wasting time unmarriedwere caring for jack steve walking with a limp but well on the way to recovery was caring for the hospital two weeks of bliss the discussion on where to go had been short you hijacked one honeymoon of mine at bliss ryan told abbey severely its your duty to give me another and abbey couldnt think of a single reason to disagree on the first morning of her honeymoon abbey woke late stirred and found she was going nowhere she was being held fast in ryans arms ryan felt her wake he shifted slightly so he could look down at her his wife his lovely lovely abbey the wedding had been perfect the tiny church high on the headland overlooking sapphire cove everyone there last night had been perfect the merging of two bodies into one abbey his wife ryans arms pulled her closer as the knowledge of abbey as his bridehis woman for alwayssurged though him and then the phone rang of course the phone rang the medical imperative if thats an earthquake i dont want to know about it abbey murmured sleepily snuggling in closer against her love but there was a sinking sensation in the pit of her stomach all the same no one would disturb them unless it was an emergency and one thing abbey didnt want for the rest of her life was emergencies it was a pity then that she was a doctor ryan sighed and lifted the receiver ryan henry abbey could tell by the sound of his voice that he was as tense as she was but then ryan smiled as he listened to the disembodied voice on the end of the line when the voice had finished speaking he put the phone down come on my love ryan said and he lifted abbey into his arms and kissed her soundly time to get ourselves decent the honeymoons on hold for an hour or two oh ryan it was a wail of dismay medical imperatives be damned abbey thought bitterly she wanted this time alone with her love and then she looked more closely at ryans face his smile was growing what is it she asked im not missing this even for a honeymoon ryan told her swinging his legs over the edge of the bed and reaching for his pants come on abbey lets go our turtles are hatching the entire population of sapphire cove was on the beach there was no way anyone could have predicted exactly when the turtles would hatch the experts said between fiftyfour and seventy days depending on the depth they were buried and the strength of the sun so apart from setting up a duty roster of guards no one had planned for this but everyone was here abbey looked around in amazement as she and ryan pulled to a halt everyone school had been let out grandmas and grandpas were arriving in convoys the local shopkeepers and bankers and publicans had closed shop and headed for the beach steve and caroline stood hand in hand by the waters edge steve leaning lightly on carolines arm to support his weak leg there were men and women in wheelchairs and with walking sticks and even a couple of stretcher cases being carried by volunteers the hospital inmates had come en masse here were patients who were too sick to walk but who wouldnt miss this for the world ted was here holding a small child from childrens ward and trying hard to keep his expression ghoulish when really he was as filled with wonder as everyone else who else ian miller was here dressed in the neat trousers and tie that denoted the professional sapphire coves newest solicitor was taking his first holiday ians grin was as broad as his face and his mother beside him had a matching smile a mile wide leith kinley was here confined to a wheelchair but only just four days ago shed stood for the first time shed be going back to brisbane soon for more intensive rehabilitation but shed been allowed home for abbeys and ryans wedding and now she was here for this sapphire coves event of the decade there were two long lines of people forming an avenue of honour from the freshly scattered mound where the turtle had laid her eggs down to the sea an avenue of honour for the hatchlings one by one they came tiny tiny turtles wideeyed and terrified scrambling through the sand burrowing their way out into the open blinking in the sunlightand then heading for the sea up above were their enemies gulls and terns and all sorts of seabirds wheeling and squawking and demanding in no uncertain terms that these people depart and let them at their prey no way the school children were taking turns to toss bread further down the beach filling the birds stomachs and distracting them from tastier prey all along the line of honour umbrellas were being shaken upwards umbrellas scores and scores of them in every colour of the rainbow covering the tiny turtles flight and preventing any daring gull from getting near and one by one the turtles were reaching the waves stopping momentarily in shock at the first touch of foamand then charging gamely on each one was two tiny inches of turtle heading for the horizon sapphire cove couldnt protect these little ones once they reached the sea but once there they had a chance a chance of one day being as huge as their mother and returning here years hence to breed themselves abbey and ryan climbed from the car and stood on the grass verge looking down at the spectacle before them jack safely held between janet and sam saw his mother and crowed with delightand then went right back to crowing with delight at the turtles abbeys eyes filled with tears did you ever see such a sight she whispered to ryan our turtles oh ryan its a miracle it is indeed a miracle ryan agreed softly his arm firmly around abbeys waist and his eyes moving from the turtles to his brand new sonand then back to his wife and he held her close and kissed her and kissed her again life
