harry turtledove days of infamy days of infamy this is a work of fiction names characters places and incidents are either the product of the authors imagination or are used fictitiously and any resemblance to actual persons living or dead business establishments events or locales is entirely coincidental i on a gray drizzly morning in the first week of march an automobile pulled up in front of the great iron gates of the imperial naval staff college in tokyo the young commander who got out was short even by japanese standardshe couldnt have been more than five feet threeand so slim he barely topped the hundredpound mark all the same the two leading seamen on sentry duty at the gates both of whom overtopped him by half a head stiffened to attention at his approach your papers sir if you please the senior sentry slung his rifle so he could take them in his right hand the sentry studied them nodded and handed them back thank you sir all in order he turned to his comrade open the gates for commander genda hai the second seaman said and did genda hurried to the eastern wing of the staff college he hurried everywhere he went he fairly burned with energy he nearly slipped once on the wet pavement but caught himself the drizzle was not enough to wash the city soot from the red bricks of the building nothing short of sandblasting would have been just inside the door to the east wing sat a petty officer with a logbook genda presented his papers again the petty officer scanned them commander genda to see admiral yamamoto he wrote in the log and after a glance at the clock on the wall opposite him the time please sign in commander he said offering genda the pen yes yes genda was always impatient with formality and paperwork he scrawled his name then almost trotted down the hall till he came to the stairway despite his small size he took the stairs to the third floor two at a time he wasnt breathing hard when he came out he might be little but he was fit a captain on the telephone looked at him curiously as he went past the officers open door genda didnt meet the other mans eyes or even notice his gaze all the commanders energy focused on the meeting that lay ahead he knocked on the door come in admiral yamamotos voice was deep and gruff heart pounding genda did he saluted the commanderinchief of japans combined fleet isoroku yamamoto returned the courtesy he was no taller than genda but there the physical resemblance between the two men ended yamamoto was broadshouldered and barrelchested a wrestlers body made for grappling with the foe his gray hair was closely cropped above his broad hard face he had lost the first two fingers of his left hand in battle against the russians at tsushima in the year after genda was born after waving genda to a chair he asked well commander whats on your mind he was no more a timewaster than genda himself genda licked his lips yamamoto could beoften strove to beintimidating but the younger man asked the question he had come to ask sir if war against the united states comes what do you think of our chances yamamoto did not hesitate i hope this war does not come if i am told to fight regardless of the consequences i shall run wild for the first six months or a year but i have utterly no confidence for the second or third year i hope we can endeavor to avoid a japaneseamerican war you say this in spite of the blow we have planned against pearl harbor genda asked he had been involved in preparing that blow from the beginning admiral yamamoto nodded heavily i do if we succeed there the attack buys us time maybe it will buy us enough to take the philippines and the dutch east indies and malaya and form a defensive perimeter so we can hold what we have conquered maybe i do not believe it myself but maybe if the united states can still use the forward base in hawaii matters become more difficult for us genda observed his thick expressive eyebrows quirked upward as he spoke much more difficult yamamoto agreed well then genda said why do we limit ourselves to an air strike on pearl harbor the americans will rebuild and then they will strike back at us yamamoto nodded again every word of this is true it is one of the arguments i used against the operation should hostilities break out between japan and the united states it would not be enough that we take guam and the philippines nor even hawaii and san francisco i wonder if our politicians have confidence as to the final outcome and are prepared to make the necessary sacrifices that went further than commander genda wanted he said may we return to discussing the hawaii problem yamamotos smile was almost indulgent he waved for genda to go on the younger man did we should follow up on our strike at pearl harbor with a landing if hawaii is occupied america will lose her best base if we make this attack at all we had better make it decisive yamamoto sat and considered his face showed nothing he was an outstanding bridge and poker player genda could see why well commander no one will ever accuse you of thinking small yamamoto said at last tell mehave you discussed this proposal with rear admiral onishi that was exactly the question genda wished he would not have asked yes sir i have he answered unhappily and his view is his view is that with our present strength we cannot take the offensive in both the eastern and southern areas genda said more unhappily still rear admiral onishi is an airmans officer yamamoto said he is also a very harddriving determined man if he does not believe this can be done his opinion carries considerable weight how do you respond to his objections by saying that half measures will not do against the united states sir genda replied if we strike a blow that merely infuriates the enemy what good is it less than none in my opinion if we strike we must drive the sword home all the way to the hilt let the americans worry about defending their west coast if they lose hawaii they cannot possibly think about striking us again admiral yamamoto showed nothing of what he was thinking he asked how many men do you suppose we would need to subdue hawaii after the air strike if all goes well they should be flat on their backs by then genda said one division should be plentyten or fifteen thousand men no now yamamoto shook his head his eyes flashed angrily genda realized hed overlooked something yamamoto spelled it out for him the americans keep two divisions of infantry on oahu even with air superiority one of ours would not be enough to root them out if this enterprise is to be attempted it must not fail you are absolutely right about that genda didnt know whether to be ecstatic or apprehensive the navy could have pulled together a divisions worth of men from its own resources for a force the size yamamoto was talking about will the army cooperate with us sir their eyes are on china and on the souththe philippines and the dutch east indies and they never like to think of anything new he spoke with a lifelong navy mans scorn for the groundpounders they might like to think about not having to fight the usa so soon yamamoto said they might and they might like to think of fighting the americans from a position of much greater advantage the advance in the south may be slower if we take this course but i do believe you are right commander when we hit the americans we can hold nothing back nothing the reward for victory in the east could be victory everywhere and where else have we any hope of finding that genda could hardly hide his jubilation hed been far from sure he could persuade the older man that this was a needful course rear admiral onishi hadnt been able to see it but yamamoto as his mutilated hand showed was of the generation that had fought the russojapanese war the war that had begun with a surprise japanese attack on the russian far eastern fleet at port arthur he was alive to the advantages of getting in the first punch and making it count yamamoto was were others anxiously commander genda asked are you sure you can persuade the army to play its part in this plan without army cooperation it wouldnt work yamamoto had rubbed gendas nose in that he hated the knowledge that those army blockheads might hold japan back from its bestits only he was convincedchance to fight the usa and have some hope of winning was intolerable admiral isoroku yamamoto leaned forward a few inches he was not a big man and it was not a large motion nevertheless it made him seem to take up the entire room and to look down on genda from a considerable height when in fact their eyes were level you may leave that to me commander yamamoto said in a voice that might have come from a kami s throat rather than a mans genda hastened to salute when yamamoto spoke like that who could doubt him no one no one at all coal smoke belching from its stack the locomotive pulled into the railroad yard at esashi in northernmost hokkaido behind it the troop train rattled and clattered to a halt corporal takeo shimizu looked out the window and shook his head its not much like home is it all the privates in his squad hastened to shake their heads oh no they chorused shimizu had every right to thump them if they gave him any trouble he took less advantage of the privilege than some underofficers did a roundfaced farmers son he hadnt been promoted to corporal as soon as he might have because his superiors wondered if he was too easygoing for his own good one of the soldiers a skinny little fellow named shiro wakuzawa said id sure rather be back in hiroshima right now its hundreds of kilometers south of here and we wouldnt be shivering in our seats the rest of the squad nodded again a coalfired stove at the front of the passenger car did next to nothing to hold the chill outside at bay no grumbling shimizu said we will uphold the honor of the fifth division his squad was only a tiny part of the division but he did not want to let the larger unit down in any way that was especially true because he didnt want to lose face before friends neighbors and relatives the whole division came from the hiroshima region wakuzawa who had an aisle seat leaned forward so he could look out the window too he stared this way and that then shook his head in obvious disappointment what were you looking for shimizu asked curious in spite of himself hairy ainu wakuzawa answered theyre supposed to live on hokkaido arent they they have beards up to herehe touched his face just below his eyesand down to here he tapped himself in the middle of the chest corporal shimizu rolled his eyes and you expect to find them in the middle of a railroad yard what do you use for brains if they work here theyve got to shave so they look like everybody else im hairy toohe was proud of his thick beardbut i shave the other soldiers jeered at wakuzawa the corporal had so they joined in he looked properly abashed that was smart of him he was just a firstyear conscript with no rights and no privileges if he got out of line theyd give him lumps they might give him lumps anyhow on general principles lieutenant osami yonehara who commanded the platoon of which corporal shimizus squad was a part got up and called everybody out get your gear form column of fours by the car move move move he was shouting by the time he was done his officers sword banged against his hip he was an educated man as well as an officer which made the gulf between him and the men he led twice as wide shimizu didnt worry about it officers gave orders and men obeyed that was how things worked a nasty cold breeze blew down from the north it felt as if it hadnt touched a thing since it started up in siberia corporal shimizus teeth started to chatter somebody behind him said why didnt they give us winter uniforms my balls are crawling up into my belly silence in the ranks shimizu shouted to show he was on the job in case one of his superiors heard the grumbler forwardmarch the command came from lieutenant colonel mitsuo fujikawa the regimental commander march the soldiers did shimizu hadnt the faintest idea where he was going he didnt worry about it somebody set above him would know all he had to do was follow the man in front of him through the streets of esashi they tramped women on their way to shops and workmen gaped at them as they strode past some of the workmen had on westernstyle overalls and cloth caps most of the women wore kimonos not dresses shimizu thought more people back home used western clothes than was true up here his slung rifle thumped his shoulderblade at every step that always annoyed him and he couldnt do a thing about it around the railroad yard the buildings were western style square boring structures of brick and concrete then the eleventh regiment went through an older part of town roofs curved and arched wood and paper replaced brick to shimizu that made pretty good sense in an earthquake brickwork came down on your head and the purely japanese buildings looked a lot more interesting than the ones built on western lines when they got to the harbor western buildings predominated again they went with machinery as they did in the railroad yards they seemed more solid and sturdy than their japanese equivalents and the machinery or the ideas behind the machinery came from the west too perhaps it was more at home in familiar structures gulls wheeled and mewed overhead they descended on fishing boats in vast skrawking clouds hoping for a handout or a theft the salt tang of the seaslightly sullied by sewagefilled shimizus nostrils he trudged up a pier toward a big merchant ship her namenagata maru was painted in hiragana and in roman letters on her stern up the gangplank he went his boots clanged on the iron plates of the deck sailors stared at him as if he were nothing but a monkey he glared back but only to show he wasnt intimidated on land he knew what he was doing but this was the sailors world maybe he wasnt a monkey to them maybe he was just cargo this way lieutenant yonehara called and led them down a hatch into the hold the nagata maru had been a freight hauler now the freight she would haul was men double racks of rough unsanded wood had been run up in the hold each one held a straw mat they had numbers painted on them yonehara checked them my platoon goes here he raised his voice to make himself heard over the clatter of more soldiers marching with their hobnailed boots on the steel deck not far enough overhead two of his squads got upper racks two lowers corporal shimizu and his men were assigned to uppers he wasnt sure if that was better or worse they were right under the deck and could bang their heads if they sat up carelessly but nobody was spilling anything on them from above the hold filled and filled and filled the mats on the racks were very close together if a man rolled over he was liable to bump into the fellow next to him packing us in like sardines corporal shimizu said most of his men just nodded they sprawled on the mats three or four of them had started a card game but a young soldier named hideo furuta said it could be worse corporal how shimizu demandedhe thought it was already pretty bad furuta realized hed blundered anger at his own stupidity filled his broad acnescarred face but he had to answer if it were hot the deck right above us would be like an oven he was right that would have been worse being right did you little good though when you were only a firstyear conscript shimizu said why dont you bring us a pot of tea hed seen a big kettle in the improvised kitchen up on deck yes corporal thankful shimizu hadnt hit him furuta got down from his mat and hurried up the narrow aisle toward the ladder that led to the deck he had to go bellytobelly with newly arriving soldiers coming the other way hard work somebody called after him that could mean several things that the work really was hard or that the man calling sympathized with the one stuck with the job or simply that the luckless one was stuck with it tone of voice and context counted for more than the words themselves after what seemed a very long time furuta came back with a pot of tea shimizu thought about bawling him out for dawdling but decided not to bother given the crowd the kid had done the best he could by the way the men in the squad praised the tea they thought the same thing before long all the soldiers packed into the hold made it hot and stuffy in there even without the summer sun beating down on the metal deck above there were no portholeswho would have bothered adding them on a freighter the only fresh air came down the hatch by which the men had entered lieutenant yonehara didnt stay with the platoon officers had cabins of their own things were crowded even for them junior officers like the platoon commander had to double up corporal shimizu didnt particularly resent their better fortune shigata ga nai he thoughtit cant be helped at last soldiers stopped coming had they crammed the whole regiment into the nagata maru shimizu wouldnt have been surprised the engine began to thump the ship began to throb the deck above shimizus head thrummed army dentists had given him several fillings they seemed to vibrate in sympathy with the freighter as soon as the nagata maru pulled away from the pier the rolling and pitching started so did the cries for buckets the sharp stink of vomit filled the hold along with the other odors of too many men packed too close together greenfaced soldiers raced up the ladder so they could spew over the rail rather to his surprise corporal shimizus stomach didnt trouble him hed never been in seas this rough before he didnt enjoy the journey but it wasnt a misery for him either no one had told him where the ship was going when the authorities wanted him to know something they would take care of it till then he worried about keeping his squad in good order the men who could eat went through the rations theyd carried aboard the nagata maru rice and canned seaweed and beans along with pickled plums and radishes and whatever else the soldiers happened to have on them every morning lieutenant yonehara led the men topside for physical training it wasnt easy on the pitching deck but orders were orders the gray heaving waters of the sea of okhotsk and the even grayer skies spoke of how far from home shimizu was when not exercising the soldiers mostly stayed on their mats they had no room to move around some were too sick to do anything but lie there and moan others gambled or sang songs or simply slept like hibernating animals all in the effort to make time go faster the kuril islands seemed like an afterthought to japan rocky lumps spattered across the pacific heading up toward kamchatka etorofu was as windswept and foggy and desolate as any of the others when the nagata maru anchored in hitokappu bay shimizu was unimpressed he just hoped to get away as fast as he could he wouldnt even have known where he was if the platoon commander hadnt told him he had hoped to be able to get off the freighter and stretch his legs but no one was allowed off the ship for any reason no one was allowed to send mail no one in fact was allowed to do much of anything except go up on deck and exercise every time corporal shimizu did more ships crowded the bay they werent just transports either ships bristling with big guns joined the fleet so did flattopped aircraft carriers one after another something big was building when the men went back down into the hold they tried to guess what it would be not a one of them turned out to be right you can be unhappy in hawaii as easily as anywhere else people who cruise over from the mainland often have a hard time believing this but its true the sea voyage from san francisco or los angeles takes five days they set the clocks back half an hour a day aboard ship so that each outbound day lasts twentyfour hours and thirty minutes by the time you get there youre two and a half hours behind the west coast five and a half behind the east and then after diamond head and the aloha tower come up over the horizon you commonly stay in a fine hotel you eat splendid food you drink oh a little too much you dont get drunk mind you get happy you admire the turquoise sky and the sapphire sea and the emerald land strange tropical birds call in the trees you savor the perfect weather never too hot never too cold if it rains so what the sun will come out again in a little while you want to be a beachcomber and spend the rest of your days there if you find a slightly brownskinned but beautiful and willing wahine to spend them there with you so much the better hawaii is what god made after hed done paradise for practice how could anyone be unhappy in a place like that first lieutenant fletcher armitage had no trouble at all for one thing armitagecalled fletch by his friendswas a greeneyed redhead with a face full of freckles in between the freckles his skin was white as milk he hated the tropical sun he didnt tan he burned for another his wife had left him three weeks before he didnt understand why he wasnt sure jane understood why he didnt think there was somebody else jane hadnt said anything about anybody else shed said she felt stifled in their little wahiawa apartment shed said he didnt give her enough of his time that had frosted his pumpkinnot that frost had anything to do with anything on oahu for christs sake i give you every minute ive got when im not with my guns hed howled he served with the thirteenth field artillery battalionthe lucky thirteenth they called themselvesin the twentyfourth division you knew you were marrying an officer when you said i do shed only shrugged she was small and blond and stubborn its not enough shed said now she had the apartment and presumably felt much less stifled without him in it she was talking with a lawyer how shed pay him on a schoolteachers salary was beyond fletch but odds were shed figure out a way she usually did what armitage had on the other hand was a hard cot at schofield barracks boq and a bar tab that was liable to outdo janes legal fees he had the sympathy of some of the officers and men who knew what had happened to him others suddenly didnt seem to want anything to do with him almost all of those were married men themselves they might have feared he had something catching and so he did life in the military if anything could grind a marriage to powder thatd do it he sat on a bar stool soaking up whiskey sours with gordon douglas another lieutenant in the battalion she knew i was an officer goddammit he saidslurred rather since hed already soaked up quite a few she knew all right knew i had to take care of this stuff he gestured vaguely just what he had to do wasnt the clearest thing in his mind right then douglas gave back a solemn nod he looked like the highschool fullback hed been ten years earlier he was from nebraska cornfed and husky you know it could be worse he said slowlyhed matched armitage drink for drink how fletch demanded with alcoholfueled indignation how the hell could it be worse well the other man looked sorry hed spoken but hed drunk enough to have a hard time keeping his mouth shut and so he went on it could be worse if we spent more time in the field then she wouldve seen even less of you and all this wouldve come on sooner oh yeah if but that only flicked fletch on another gripe of his one older than his trouble with his wife or older than his knowledge of his trouble with his wife which was not the same thing dont hold your breath though we do the best we can gordon douglas sounded uncomfortable partly because he knew he was liable to touch off a rant and he did fletch exploded do we do we sure doesnt look that way to me this is a hell of a paradeground army no bout adout it he paused listened to what hed just said and tried again no doubt about it there that was better he could roll on hell of a paradeground army but what if we really have to go out there and fight what will we do then when were not on parade wed do all right douglas still sounded uncomfortable but then he rallied saying besides who the hell would we fight nobody in his right mind would mess with hawaii and you know it down the hatch went armitages latest whiskey sour he gestured to the filipino bartender for another one even before it arrived he went on all this shit with the japs doesnt sound good they didnt like it for beans when we turned the oil off on em now i know youre smashed his friend said those little fuckers try anything well knock em into the middle of next week i dare you to tell me any different oh hell yes wed lick em no matter how drunk fletch was he knew how strong hawaiis defenses were two divisions based at schofield barracks the coast artillery command with its headquarters at fort derussy right next to waikiki beach the flyboys at wheeler right by the barracks complex here and just for icing on the cake the pacific fleet theyd have to be crazy to screw with us bet your ass douglas said so how come youve got ants in your pants armitage shrugged i just wish his voice trailed away he wished for a lot of things that mattered more to him right now than just how prepared the men at schofield barracks were to turn back an attack unlikely ever to come and those werent ants in his pants he and jane had been married for five years he was used to getting it regularly these past three weeks had been a hard time in more ways than one he sipped at the drink lifes a bastard sometimes you know plenty of people in it are bastards thats for goddamn sure gordon douglas agreed you keep the hell away from em if you can you salute em and go yes sir if you cant thats the way things work buddy he spoke with great earnestness yeah i guess fletchs head bobbed up and down he didnt feel like nodding he felt like crying hed done that only once the night he moved out of the apartment and into boq hed been a lot drunker then than he was now of course he could still take care of that the whiskey sour vanished he signaled for a refill youre gonna feel like hell tomorrow morning douglas said also putting his drink out of its misery if they have livefire practice youll wish your head would fall off that bit of good advice didnt keep him from reloading too armitage shrugged thats tomorrow morning this is now if im drunk i dont have to worry about anything look on the bright side his friend suggested if we were back home there might be snow on the ground already if you were back home there might be snow on the ground fletch said thats your worry im from san diego i dont know any more about it than the hawaiians do you grew up in a navy town douglas said youre here where theyve got more goddamn sailors than anywhere else in the world so what the hell are you doing in the army sometimes i wonder armitage said if he had one more whiskey sour he was going to start wondering about his own name too the only thing getting drunk didnt make him wonder about was jane she was gone and he wouldnt get her back that was why he was drinking in the first place it didnt seem fair he turned his blurry focus back to the question what the hell am i doing in the army best i can right now how about you gordon douglas didnt answer hed put his head down on the bar and started to snore fletch shook him awake which wasnt easy because he kept wanting to yawn too they lurched back to boq together patrolling sentries just kept patrolling it wasnt as if theyd never seen a drunken officer before or even two the next morning aspirins and most of a gallon of black coffee put only the faintest of dents in fletchs hangover he managed to choke down some dry toast with the coffee in his stomach it felt as if it were all corners douglas looked as decrepit as he felt a very faint consolation indeed and they did go through livefire exercises having a mm gun go off by his head did nothing to speed fletchs recovery he gulped more aspirins and wished he were dead jiro takahashi and his two sons carried tubs full of nehus onto the oshima maru as the sampan lay tied up in kewalo basin a little west of honolulu takahashi a short muscular sunbrowned man of fiftyfive had named the fishing boat for the japanese county hed left around the turn of the century he watched the minnows dash back and forth in the galvanized iron tubs they knew they werent coming along for a holiday cruise he wondered if his sons knew the same pick up your feet get moving he called to them in japanese the only language he spoke hiroshi and kenzo both smiled at him he didnt see that they moved any faster they should have they were less than half his age and both of them were three or four inches taller than he was they should have been stronger than he was too if they were he hadnt seen it they didnt have the fire in their bellies the passion for work that he did he didnt know why it wasnt as if he hadnt tried to give it to them hiroshi said something in english as he set his tub down on the deck his younger brother answered in the same language theyd both been educated in american schools on oahu they used english as readily as japanese even though jiro had sent them to japanese schools after the regular schools ended they went by hank and ken as often as by the names hed given them they both laughedloud boisterous american laughs jiro shot them a suspicious glance were they laughing at him they sometimes used english to keep him from knowing what they were saying all over kewalo basin big diesel engines were growling to life bluepainted sampans glided out of the basin and into the wide pacific the blue paint was camouflage the fishermen hoped it fooled the tuna they caught they knew good and well it fooled other fishermen who might try to poach in fine fishing spots back when jiro first came to hawaii sampans had been sailpowered diesels let them range much farther asea takahashi muttered to himself as he started the oshima maru s engine he liked to be one of the first boats out of the basin not today not when hed had to drag his boys out of bed did they think the tuna were going to sleep late too up at the bow the two of them were tossing a hollow glass globe as big as their heads back and forth the net float had drifted here all the way from japan a lot of sampans carried one or two of them sometimes more they showed up around kauai more often than anywhere else some trick of the currents no doubt jiro hauled in the mooring line and got the oshima maru going his sons went right on tossing the float back and forth he finally lost patience with them will you two knock off that foolishness he shouted sorry father hiroshi said he didnt sound sorry he didnt look sorry either he had a silly grin on his face grimly jiro steered the oshima maru south and west careful father kenzo said you dont want to end up in the defensive sea area the last three words were in english but jiro understood them kenzo meant the threemilesquare region south of the pearl harbor outlet that the navy had declared offlimits to sampans the navy patrolled aggressively to make sure the fishing boats stayed out of it too if you got caught in the defensive sea area you were sure to get a warning and an escort out youd probably also draw a fine you think im going to give the navy my money jiro asked his younger son am i that dumb no father kenzo answered but accidents can happen accidents oh yes they can happen jiro takahashi said they can but theyd better not straying into the defensive sea area wouldnt be an accident though it would be a piece of stupidity jiro had no intention of allowing his boat went where it was supposed to a seaplane buzzed by overhead a navy man with a radio was probably reporting the oshima maru s position well let him jiro thought im not in their restricted area and they cant say i am on went the fishing boat pearl harbor and honolulu sank below the horizon jiro and his sons ate rice and pork his wife reiko had packed for them they drank tea hiroshi and kenzo also drank cocacola jiro had tried the american drink but didnt think much of it too sweet too fizzy it was the middle of the afternoon before they got to a spot jiro judged likely he couldnt have said why he thought it would be good it felt right that was all some combination of wind and waves and water color told him the tuna were likely to be here when he was a boy hed gone out with his father to fish the inland sea of japan his father had seemed able to smell a good catch when jiro asked him how he did it hed just laughed if you know fish you know where they go hed said youll figure it out and jiro had he glanced over to his strapping sons would they he didnt want to bet on it too many things distracted them he could get them to fish with him and even to do a good enough job while they were here but he could have trained a couple of portuguese cowboys from a cattle ranch on the big island to do that it wouldnt have made them fishermen and it didnt make hiroshi and kenzo fishermen either to them this was only a job and not such a good one to jiro it was a way of life he cut the motor the oshima maru drifted silently on the light chop not far away a booby plunged into the sea it came out with a fish in its beak that was a good sign the booby wasnt big enough to catch a tuna of course but it caught the sort of fish on which tuna fed if they were here the tuna probably would be too nodding to his sons he said throw in the bait hiroshi tipped one of the tubs of minnows over the side the little silvery fish still very much alive made a cloud in the water hiroshi and kenzo and jiro dropped their long lines into the pacific lines full of gleaming barbless hooks that a hungry tuna might mistake for a minnow greed killed jiro understood that the tuna didnt which let him make a living he wondered if his sons did compared to him theyd had things easy how much good had that done them jiro only shrugged hiroshi and kenzo went back and forth mostly in english now and then in japanese jiro caught names roosevelt hull kurusu he hoped the japanese special envoy would find a way to persuade america to start selling oil to japan again cutting it off seemed monstrously unfair to him he didnt say that to his sons they saw everything from the us point of view arguing over politics was usually more trouble than it was worth what jiro did say was now he and his sons hauled the lines back aboard the oshima maru a lot of them had small hawaiian striped tuna locally called aku writhing on the hooks theyd been after minnows and found something harder something crueler the three men worked like machines gutting them and putting them on ice jiro grabbed an especially fine striped tuna his knife flashed what could be fresher what could be more delicious than sashimi cut from a stillwriggling fish a slow smile of pleasure spread over his face as he chewed he offered some of the delicate flesh almost as red as beef to his boys they ate with him though they didnt seem to enjoy it quite so much as he did he sighed they gobbled down hamburgers and french fries whenever they got the chance that wasnt the food hed grown up on and it tasted strange to him to them it was as normal as what they got at home once the last of the catch was on ice he said back to it he and hiroshi and kenzo dumped the guts overboard and spilled another tub of nehus into the pacific the lines with their freight of hooks followed the fishermen waited while the aku struck then they hauled in the lines and began gutting fish again a shark snapped past just as kenzo pulled the last of the tuna into the oshima maru he laughed waste time shark he said in english that was another fragment of the language jiro followed mostly because both his boys said it all the time waste time meant anything futile or useless they fished till they ran out of bait not all the sharks wasted time they brought in several tuna heads the wolves of the sea having bitten off the rest of the fish that always happened most often after theyd been working for a while the minnows drew the tuna and the tunaand the blood in the water from their gutsdrew the sharks but it was a pretty good day when hiroshi said lets go back jiro nodded theyd done everything they could do they would get a good price from the men at the aala market these tuna were too good to go to the canning plants once the dealers bought them theyd be sold one by one mostly to japanese restaurants and japanese housewives chinese and filipinos would buy some and maybe the odd haole would too though jiro grimaced when he thought about what whites did to such lovely fish hed heard of tuna salad hed never had the nerve to try it the sun had just set when the oshima maru tied up in kewalo basin once more dealerssome japanese some chinese and mixed outfits like oshiro and wocame aboard to examine the catch they said what they could to disparage it to bring down the price but the aku were too good to let them get away with much jiro went home with almost twenty dollars in his pocket he wished he could do that well every day when the uss enterprise sailed for wake island on the morning of november the carrier had done so under vice admiral william halseys battle order number one right from the start of the cruise torpedoes had had warheads mounted planes taking off from the carriers flight deck carried loaded guns they had orders to shoot down any aircraft not known to belong to the usa all of task force eight which included three heavy cruisers and nine destroyers along with the enterprise had ammunition ready at the guns planes patrolled out to two hundred miles around the task force halsey insisted the japanese were liable to attack without bothering to declare war now the task force was bound for pearl harbor again nothing untoward had happened theyd delivered marine corps fighter squadron to wake without any trouble no one had seen any airplanes that didnt look american no one had spotted any subs either and subs worried halsey even more than enemy aircraft did lieutenant james peterson thought all the extra excitement was just a bunch of hooey he wasnt shy about saying so either the fighter pilot a rangy six feet two was rarely shy about saying anything anybody who thinks the japs have the nerve to try us on for size has to be nuts he declared swigging coffee with some of the other pilots wed kick their ass from here to sunday they arent a bunch of dummies theyve got to know that as well as we do the bull thinks theyre up to something said another pilot a jg named hank drucker he wouldnt have put out that battle order if he didnt several men nodded at that if halsey thought something they were convinced it had to be true but peterson remained unquelled and unconvinced i think he put it out just to keep us on our toes he said what the hell could the japs do to us halseys worried about submarines drucker said one torpedo amidships can put a pretty fair crimp in your plans yeah but why would they do anything like that peterson demanded it makes no sense they couldnt sink enough of our ships to hurt the pacific fleet very muchand then theyd be eyeballtoeyeball with us and wed be all pissed off theyre already pissed off at us lieutenant carter higdon had a mississippi drawl thick enough to slice despite it he was the brains of the squadron when he was off duty he was working his way through a beatup copy of ulysses he went on weve cut off their oil weve cut off their scrap metal somebody tried doing that to us how would we like it id kick the son of a bitch right in the slats peterson said i think you just shot yourself down jim drucker said a split second after peterson realized the same thing he got out of it as best he could but im an american goddammit those slanteyed bastards havent got the balls for anything like that heres hopin youre right higdon said but i reckon well be steamin west for real before too long get the war going in the philippines or somewhere like that if they dont get their oil from us where will they get it only other place is the dutch east indiesand if they go there theyll go loaded for bear several pilots nodded the dutch east indies had hung like ripe fruit waiting to be picked ever since the germans overran holland the year before and vichy france also under the nazis thumbs had given japan the right to base troops in french indochina of course if vichy had said no the japs would have gone in anyhow this way france maintained a ghostly sort of sovereignty over the area peterson wondered how happy that made the froggies you think we ought to fight if the japs do go into the east indies drucker asked higdon me ill be damned if we ought to pull the dutchmens chestnuts out of the fire if they do get that oil its us next higdon said turning next into a twosyllable word were the only ones who can worry them holland and france are down for the count and englands got bigger worries closer to home if hitler takes moscow and knocks the russians out this winter hell turn on england with everything hes got next spring the argument went on and on sometimes it was arguing in the wardroom sometimes a poker game sometimes argument and poker finally peterson got tired of it and went up onto the flight deck his shoes thumped on the sixinch wooden planks when the enterprise was abuilding thered been talk about armoring the flight deck as the british were doing but it hadnt come to anything colorcoded cotton jerseys and cloth helmets told off the deck crew by function sailors in blue handled parked planes those in yellow directed them while they moved while those in red were the repair and crash crews a couple of fire watchmen in suits of fuzzy white asbestos moved among them looking like snowmen out for a stroll peterson wouldnt have wanted that job for beans especially not in warm weather of course when the fire watchmen went to work they had more heat to worry about than what they got in the tropics they watched the world through thick panes of smoked glass diving suits might have been heavier and more restrictive than what they wore peterson couldnt think of anything else that came close no he wouldnt have swapped jobs with them for anything one of them waved a gauntleted hand automatically peterson waved back the fire watchmans head was turned in his general direction so he assumed the wave was for him he might have been wrong trying to judge what a man meant when you couldnt see his face wasnt easy he laughed out loud whats funny sir asked a repaircrew man in a red jersey i was just thinking id like to wear one of those goddamn fire suits the next poker game i get into peterson answered long as i keep the faceplate closed whos gonna know im raising on a busted flush the sailor contemplated that then grinned dont tell those firewatch bastards theyd up and do it whod play with em if they did peterson asked sir we got us somewhere close to three thousand men on board the sailor replied you dont figure some of em are suckers well yeah but youre not supposed to say so out loud otherwise you will keep em out of the games peterson said they grinned at each other peterson looked out to sea a fresh breeze blew his sandy hair back from his face the air was the freshest in the world he didnt consciously notice the salt tang of the sea but it braced him even so off to port a cruiser kept station with the enterprise a couple of destroyers prowled ahead alert for periscopesand with their listening gear for subs lurking below the surface a couple of gooney birds glided by on wings that seemed almost as long as a wildcats the big birds bred on midway and some of the other islands in the northwestern part of the hawaiian chain in the air they were nonpareils on land they came in as if theyd blown both tires and had a wheel go out from under them they were almost as ungainly taking off too they needed a headwind and a long running start otherwise they couldnt get airborne at all more destroyers followed the carrier at the heart of the task force peterson turned and peered over the enterprise s stern that pointed him more or less in the direction of japan what were tojos boys up to could they really be contemplating war with the usa peterson still had trouble believing it wasnt all their tough talk just a bluff with the america firsters and the other isolationists running around loose and making a big noise in the papers and on the radio werent the japs trying to scare fdr into giving them what they wanted dammit thats still the way it looks to me peterson muttered if the president just stood firm japan would pull in its horns the japs had a million soldiers bogged down in china for christs sake why would they take on another country that was bigger than they were it made no sense prepare to land a plane blared from the loudspeakers and then landing a plane the squat ff wildcat came in from astern the landing officer stood facing it he held out the wigwag flags so they and his arms made a straight line out from his shoulders he dipped to the right the wildcat straightened up jim peterson laughed if that wasnt ike greenwald coming in hed eat his socks ike always carried one wing low the landing officer straightened and moved the flags in small circles the fighter sped up the landing officer dropped the flags to his sides the plane dove for the deck tires smoked as they struck the tailhook caught an arrester wire the pilot killed the roaring engine the stinks of sizzling rubber and exhaust ruined the clean air for a moment the man in the cockpit rolled back the canopy and climbed out sure as hell it was greenwald nobody else on the enterprise was built quite so much like a soda straw people said he could sleep in the barrel of a fiveinch gun that wasnt fair though he might have managed in an eightincher nice landing one of the sailors on the flight deck called to him he grinned sheepishly he never knew what to do with praise peterson would have milked it for all it was worth greenwald just said i didnt crash the crate and i didnt smash me ill take it another wildcat roared off to keep the combat air patrol at full strength the plane dropped toward the pacific as it sped off the flight deck then steadied and began to climb peterson watched it with affection the wildcat was a pretty good machine it measured up fine against landbased american fighters that had to mean the japs didnt have anything that even came close oscar van der kirk was a bum he knew it he was proud of it as a matter of fact he was a big blond man in his late twenties his hair bleached even paler by constant exposure to sun and sea his hide tanned almost as brown as a hawaiians he hadnt intended to turn into a bum hed graduated from stanford in an english major with a history minor his folks thought he should have studied accounting instead but he was a second son a kid brother and roger showed plenty of aptitude and eagerness for the family construction business whenifdad ever decided to retire so while disappointed oscars folks werent furious they let him do what he wanted it was hard to be furious at oscar anyhow he had not a mean bone in his body an awshucks smile made girls hearts melt hed studied coeds at least as much as chaucer and herodotus and hed got good grades in them as a graduation present his folks gave him a trip to hawaii they booked him into the royal hawaiian right on waikiki beach the grounds were splendidly landscaped with coconut palms and banyan trees insulating the great pink pile from the encroachments of the outside world the room ran twenty dollars a daythis when millions would have got down on their knees and thanked god to make twenty dollars a week oscar had never had to worry about moneyand he didnt worry about it now next door to the royal hawaiian stood the outrigger club which since had been dedicated to the art and science of surfriding the proximity of club to hotel was the reason oscar went from newminted baccalaureate to bum in the course of two short weeks he watched in openmouthed awe the first time he saw men glide the big surfboards over the waves and up onto the white sand of the beach by god im going to try that he said nobody at the royal hawaiian took any particular notice of the remark quite a few visitors said they wanted to learn to ride the surf a good many of them actually did it a handful did it enough to start to know what they were doing the next morning oscar was out in front of the outrigger club half an hour before sunup it didnt open till eight the man who let him in smiled and said hello malihini you look eager malihini meant stranger or tenderfoot without the smile it might have been an insult oscar wouldnt have cared if it were he nodded to the man who was then the same shade of brown he would later become himself teach me he said he learned to ride the surfboard on his belly and then kneeling and then at last standing skimming over the waves was like nothing hed known in all his life it was as if god had given him wings was this how angels felt he didnt know about angels he did know this was what he was meant to do he was supposed to go home in two weeks he cashed in his return ticket instead and moved to digs much less impressiveand much less expensivethan the royal hawaiian he stretched his money as far as it would go to stay in hawaii as long as he could his only luxury though to him it was a necessity was more surfriding lessons when the money he got from the ticket ran out he worked on the docks for a while and surfed almost every waking minute when he wasnt working before long he didnt need to take lessons any more before much longer he was giving them by the time winter came he was as good as men whod been riding the waves as long as hed been alive that was what he thought anyway till he followed the outrigger club members winter migration to the north shore of oahu there he found waves like none hed seen like none hed imagined near honolulu they rolled down across the north pacific all the way from alaska and when they came ashore at waimea and some of the other spots the club members knew some of them were as tall as a threestory building riding waves like that wasnt just sport if it went wrong it was like falling off a cliffexcept then the cliff fell on you more than once he came to the surface gasping and gouged and scraped from a tumble against the sand he lost two front teeth when somebody elses surfboard hit him in the face that was if anything a membership pin half the really accomplished surfers at the outrigger club sported either bridgework or a space where their incisors had been he never did go back to northern california his family wrote anguished letters for a while he assured them he was fine after a while they gave up and stopped writing he dropped them little notes every so oftenwhenever he happened to think of it he was a goodnatured fellow as time went by though he thought about anything outside of oahu less and less often he acquired a nickname smooth oscar he acquired a scar on his leg from a jagged chunk of coral he acquired a series of lady friends from among the tourists who came from seattle or st louis or savannah to learn to ride the surf the lessons were intimate enough to start with and often got more so after the sun went down the ladies almost all of them went home happy oscar smiled a lot when times were good he got enough money from the lessons to make ends meet when they werent so good he went back to the docks or washed dishes in one of honolulus nine million greasy spoons or worked in the cane and pineapple fields that filled the middle of the island when he wasnt out on the ocean he didnt much care what he did one day when he was by his standards flush he paid a hundred bucks for a chevy hardtop with no rear window what the former owner perceived as a deficiency was to oscar an asset it let him stow his surfboard much more conveniently the board of threeinchthick koa wood was eleven feet long and not the easiest object to transport after seeing how handy the missing window proved three or four of his fellow surfers knocked the back glass out of their jalopies oscar had been brought up bourgeois every so often he wondered what the hell he was doing with his life but all the doubts flew away when he rode along at the crest of a waveor when he rode one of the girls hed taught to kneel on a board in the wahine surf near the moana hotel in waikiki he was having a good time that was what he was doing who needed anything more he snagged a lot of lessons toward the end of hed been short on cash and winter brought the tourists out from the cold parts of the country but when his latest girlfriend threw a vase at his head after he didnt ask her to marry him the night before she sailed back to los angeles he decided the time had come to get away from it all for a little while he loaded his board into the chevy with him rode charlie kaapu a large smiling halfhawaiian fellow who also lived for the surf and a good time charlies surfboard was six or eight inches longer than oscars they tied a red rag to the back of it to keep cars behind them from running into them then took off for the north coast and whatever they found there peace and quiet oscar said more plaintively than usual i told that shirley it was only for fun but she didnt want to listen he took a hand off the wheel to touch his right ear the only part of his anatomy the vase had grazed four inches to the left and he would have been very unhappy as things were he wouldnt be able to go barefoot in his apartment till he swept up all the broken glass charlie kaapu laughed at him from the back seat women hear what they want to hear dont you know that by now i ought to oscar said i mean she was fine for a week or two but forever he shook his head shed drive me nuts hell id drive her nuts they put out for you they think its gotta be for life charlie said and then philosophically shes gone now you dont gotta worry about it no more yeah oscar spoke with a mixture of relief and regret he was glad shirleyd got on the liner and out of his hairno doubt of that but he still wished things had gone better he didnt like ugly scenes they werent his style a kiss on the cheek a pat on the fanny a goodbye from the pier as the ship headed back to the mainland that was how he liked things to go and how they usually went he got out of honolulu went past the back side of pearl harbor and drove up the kamehameha highway toward the north coast the drive wasnt so pleasant as he would have wanted he got stuck behind a snorting convoy of olivedrab army trucks chugging up to schofield barracks not only did they slow him down but the exhaust made his head ache he hadnt had that much to drink the night before had he pineapple fields stretched out along the right side of the road pineapple and sugarcane to the left most of the time he would have smelled the damp freshness of growing things diesel stink made an inadequate substitute they rattled past wheeler field off to the left of the highway charlie pointed to the planes drawn up in neat tight rows on the runways pretty snazzy yeah oscar said again nobodys gonna get at em or do anything to em he drove on for a little while then asked you think anythings gonna come of this war scare charlie beats me charlie kaapu answered everybodys pretty stupid if us and the japs do start fighting though oscar nodded he said yeah one more time the trucks pulled off to the left the way to schofield barracks he stepped on the gas the chevy went a little faster not a lot since the only way it could have hit fifty was to go off a cliff but he was glad not to have to breathe fumes any more smiling he lit a cigarette and passed charlie the pack the dole pineapple plantation north of wahiawa was one of the biggest in the world most of the workers in the fields were japanese and filipinos having put in some time there himself oscar had seen enough to feel sorry for them he stopped for gas in waialua just short of the ocean eighteen and a half cents a gallon at the standard oil station that made him grumblehawaii was more expensive than the mainland up at haleiwa on the pacific he had to stop his car just short of a narrow bridge buttressed by double arches of steel another convoy of trucks was heading to schofield barracks these diesel snorters loaded with men whod been enjoying leave on the north shore even before the last truck came through charlie kaapu was doing some snorting of his own he pointed north past the last of the olivedrab monsters you see that oscar you see goddammit aint got no fuckin surf could be better oscar agreed could be worse too i figurewhat fivesix feet something like that charlie said still disgusted hell i can piss highern that i wanted some big waves maybe theyll come oscar said hopefully maybe theres a storm up north blowing like hell maybe theyll be twenty or thirty feet by tomorrow and besides this still isnt too bad ha charlie kaapu said we could do this out by diamond head you gonna tell me im wrong no oscar couldnt and he knew it but were here so we might as well make the best of it hed been making the best of it ever since he got to hawaii he saw no reason to change now tell you whatill go on to waimea bay itll be better there than anywhere else along this coast okay go ahead charlie said weve come this far whats another few miles anyway looks like well just find more soldiers if we stay around here he wasnt wrong about that either the army used waialua bay as a place to give its men rest and recreation it looked to have taken most of them back to schofield barracks in the truck convoy that had blocked the bridge but not all the olivedrab tents had disappeared from the beach here the trucks would have to come back for the rest of the men when they got to waimea though the surfers had things to themselves oscar parked the chevy across the road from the beach he and charlie pulled their surfboards out of the car stuck them under their arms and carried them down toward the sea oscars toes dug into the sand it was softer than any hed known on a california beach he knew hed feel that more on the return trip when he was going uphill now now he didnt want to think about the return trip easier to get out into the ocean when the waves werent so fierce the surfboard went into the water he lay down atop it and paddled with his arms ten feet away charlie kaapu was doing the same thing after oscar had paddled out far enough he turned the board around the swells pushed him back toward the shore he scrambled upright on the bobbing tilting darting surfboard and rode the crest of a wave all the way up onto the beach he looked around for charlie there he was separated from his surfboard which washed ashore without him surfs not too easy is it oscar called his friend gave him the finger this shit can happen down by diamond head too charlie said he wasnt wrong about that either hed lost his front teeth within a couple of miles of waikiki they surfed all day oscar wiped out several times himself hed known he would and didnt worry about it when the sun sank down toward kaena point they put the boards back into the chevy and walked into waimea a chopsuey house there gave them a cheap filling supper you dont want to drive back in the dark do you charlie kaapu hinted oscar smiled no i was thinking wed sleep in the car put the boards on the roof and go at it again first thing in the morning charlies face lit up now youre talking sleeping in the chevy was a cramped business but oscar had had practice charlie hadnt or not so much but he managed his snores escaped through the glassless rear window those same snores helped wake oscar around sunup yawning he sat up in the front seat and stretched he did some more stretching after he got out of the car to work the kinks from his neck and back he walked over and pissed at the base of a coconut palm only the waning gibbous moon looked down at him from low in the west his belly growled he wished hed thought to bring along something for breakfast nothing in waimea would be open so early and this was sunday morning too so it was anybodys guess if anything would be open at all he couldnt do anything about that all he could do was put his board in the water he looked out to the pacific and muttered under his breath the waves were no better than they had been the day before if anything they were a little flatter oscar shrugged what could you do when he got his board off the roof of the chevy the noise woke charlie kaapu the big halfhawaiian extracted himself from the car as oscar had he stretched and yawned what time is it anyway he asked i dont know oscar didnt wear a watch but a glance at the sun gave him a fair idea about half past seven i guess charlie looked out to sea he made the same sort of mutters as oscar had then he went off to take a leak by the same palm tree when he came back he got down his surfboard too were here we might as well give it a go he said resignedly yeah oscar nodded i was thinking the same thing he crossed the road and headed down the beach toward the water charlie kaapu followed oscar had a couple of good rides in the second time charlie went off his board he had a scowl on his face when he recaptured it he stood there at the edge of the sea dripping and fuming then he frowned looking north whats that noise after a moment oscar heard it too a distant drone that put him in mind of mosquitoes he also looked north he pointed there they are thats a hell of a lot of airplanes the army or the navy must be up to something the airplanes flew in several groups some went south through the central valley others took a more southwesterly course they were plenty high enough to make it over the waianae range oscar briefly wondered why they were all coming off the ocean then he shrugged again what the military did wasnt his worry he and charlie went back to their surfriding lieutenant saburo shindo piloted his zero back toward the akagi exultation filled the commander of the second waves fighters the first two attacks had heavily damaged the ships at pearl harbor and punished the airfields on oahu now shindo thought now we finish the job there was the carrier with some of the fleets screen of destroyers and cruisers and battleships and there were the transports steaming south towards oahu as fast as they could go shindos lips skinned back from his teeth in a fierce grin he was usually on the phlegmatic side not today today he felt like a tiger and by tomorrow morning the japanese would be landing on the island meanwhile he had to land on the akagi another zero came in just ahead of his the deck crew manhandled the plane to one side the landing officer signaled for shindo to continue his approach he did concentrating on the mans signals to the exclusion of everything else the carriers deck was pitching and rolling in front of him the man on it could gauge his path better than he could himself learning that lesson was the hardest thing any navy flier did down went the flags shindo dove for the akagi s deck the arrester hook caught a wire his zero jerked to a stop he shoved back the canopy scrambled out of the plane and ran for the carriers small portside island admiral nagumo he called admiral nagumo admiral chuichi nagumo came out onto the deck to meet him he was a stocky man in his midfifties with a round face two deep vertical lines between his eyes and thinning hair cropped close to his skull he was a biggun admiral not a flying man which sometimes worried shindo hed got command of the pearl harbor expedition by seniority the usual japanese way so far though hed handled things as smoothly as anyone could have all is well he asked now tension stretched his voice taut all is very well shindo flashed a grin at minoru genda and mitsuo fuchida whod come out onto the flight deck behind nagumo fuchida the air commander was a couple of years older than genda taller with long horsey features shindo pulled himself back to the admirals question yes sir all is very well we need to launch the third wave right away to smash the dock facilities and the fuel tanks and to hit schofield barracks for the armys benefit where are the american carriers nagumo demanded that was the one fly in the ointment they hadnt caught any of the carriers in port shindo gave the only answer he could sir i dont know those lines between admiral nagumos eyes got deeper yet you are thinking about what happens to hawaii he said heavily i am thinking about what happens to my fleet what if the americans strike us while we linger here from behind him commander genda said sir we have six carriers at most the americans have three and they probably arent concentrated we have the best fliers in the world they have less than the best if they find us they will be the ones to regret it so you say nagumo still sounded anything but happy shindo had yet to hear him sound happy since the fleet sailed from japan even the astounding damage the first two waves of attackers had caused did nothing to cheer him he went on i tell you gentlemen if it were not for the landing forces accompanying us i would turn around and sail for the home islands now commander fuchida couldnt hide his horror sir we have a job to finish he exclaimed i know nagumo answered and i will stay and i will carry it through those are my orders and i cannot abandon the soldiers but what i told you is no less true we are in danger here so are the americans shindo said genda and fuchida both nodded at last reluctantly so did admiral nagumo ii the message came in to the enterprise from one of the scouts just after eight in the morning white pearl harbor under attack do not acknowledge aboard the carrier rage boiled those little slantyeyed cocksuckers want a war theyve got one lieutenant jim peterson shouted to whoever would listen you were the one who said they wouldnt fight three people reminded peterson of that at the same time he was too furious to get embarrassed at being wrong i dont give a shit what i said he snarled lets knock the yellow bastards into the middle of next week but that was easier said than done everyone knew the japanese were somewhere off the hawaiian islandsbut where had they come down out of the north or up from the south the enterprise couldnt even ask the harried men at pearl harbor what they knew as soon as that horrifying message came in admiral halsey slapped radio silence on the whole task force no japs were going to spot the carrier and her satellites by their signals in the wardroom the pilots drank coffee and cursed the japaneseand also cursed the pearl harbor defenders whod shot down some of the scouts trying to land in the middle of the attack the ships steamed furiously toward pearl harbor theyd been about two hundred miles northwest of oahu when they got the dreadful newsabout seven hours at top speed and they were making top speed bull halsey was not a man to hang back when he saw a fight right in front of his nosefar from it he wanted to get in there and start swinging the only trouble was he had no more idea than anybody else where to aim his punches as the minutes passed and turned into hours fury and frustration built aboard the enterprise the news in the wardroom was fragmentarypeople on oahu were clamping down on radio traffic toobut what trickled in didnt sound good jesus somebody said after the intercom piped in yet another gloomy report sounds like battleship rows taken a hell of a licking that wont end the world peterson said the navys needed to get rid of those wallowing tubs for years he spoke like what he was a carrier fighter pilot billy mitchell had proved battleships obsolete twenty years earlier nobodyd paid any attention then it sounded as if the japs were driving home the lesson would anybody pay attention now youre a coldhearted bastard peterson a lieutenant named edgar kelley said its not just ships you know its god knows how many sailors too yeah so peterson scowled at the other pilot if they didnt get it now they sure as hell would when they took their battlewagons west to fight the japs carrier air would take em out before the carriers came over the horizon he didnt think of himself as coldhearted but if you werent a realist about the way the world worked youd take endless grief in life sure as hell you would just after noon a cry not far from despair came over the intercom third wave of attackers striking pearl that was followed almost immediately by admiral halseys unmistakable rasp boys weve got to give the landbased air a hand the japs have knocked out a lot of it on the ground and ill be doubledamned and fried in the devils big iron spider before i let those monkeys have it all their own way when i can give em a lick go get em i only wish i were up there with you cheering the pilots ran for their wildcats petersons was third in line he fired up the engine even before hed closed the canopy and fastened his safety belts the fierce roar of the horsepower wright radial engine filled him his fingernails his bones his guts all shook with it it made him feel not just alive but huge and ferocioushe might have been making that great noise not his plane a red flag hung from the bridge the signal that the enterprise was about to launch her airplanes no men in blue jerseys were left on the deck but the two who stood by to remove the chocks from the squadron leaders wheels sailors in yellow smocks formed a line across the deck what might have been the voice of god thundered from the island prepare to launch planes the sailors in blue whipped away the chocks the lead wildcat rolled forward a man in yellow walking backwards just ahead of it leading it on to a point midway up the flight deck a little ahead of the island stood another man in a yellow jersey this one held a checkered flag in his right hand that biblically amplified voice roared again launch planes as the man with the flag turned his free hand in a grinding motion the squadron leader gunned his engine when the note suited the sailor in yellow he dropped the flag the plane sped down the deck and zoomed off into the air the next fighter taxied up to the takeoff line at the flagmans orders the pilot built up the boost on his engine the flag fell the wildcat roared away then it was petersons turn the sailors in blue jerseys pulled away the chocks up to the line he went following the man in yellow the flagman made his grinding motion peterson gave his engine the gun down went the flag peterson whooped with delight acceleration shoved him back in his seat as the fighter raced down the enterprise s flight deck as always when he went off the end of the deck there was that sickening lurch that moment when he wondered whether hed go into the sky or into the drink but the wildcat climbed after the two planes that had taken off ahead peterson whooped again this was where he was meant to be what he was meant to do more fighters rose from the carrier they formed in pairs leader and wingman petersons wingman was a jg named marvin morrison he had a squeaky tenor voice that broke when he got excited which happened frequently it sounded in petersons earphones now were going to clean the japs clocks for them oh hell yes peterson agreed if they want a war marv well give em all the war they wantyou bet your ass we will similar outraged chatter crackled through the squadron along with the outrage was a sense of astonishment how could the japanese with their bucktoothed bespectacled pilots and their lousy scrapmetal planes dare to take on the united states of america the fighter pilots also monitored radio traffic from pearl harbor when one frantic officer relayed rumors that the japs had german pilots doing some of their flying for them peterson nodded to himself the little yellow men couldnt have done it all on their own say what you would about the nazis but theyd shown the world they knew what the hell they were doing when it came to war he saw the thick black smoke rising into the blue tropical sky when he was still a devil of a long way out from pearl more and more of it came up every minute too jesus he said softly with or without help from hitlers aryan supermen the japs had done something really terrible here radio from pearl harbor abruptly cut off he didnt think it was silence imposed by command more likely a bomb had wrecked the transmitterthe signal went away in the middle of a word as peterson drew closer to oahu he saw more smoke rising from the marine corps airfield at ewa west of pearl harbor in fact people in honolulu used ewa as a synonym for west the same as they used waikiki for east till he got close though the small smoke from ewa was lost in the greater conflagration of pearl harbor and the closer he got the worse those fires looked the tank farms had to be burning sending untold millions of gallons of fuel oil up in smoke peterson swore softly more in awe than in anger this was a disaster nothing else but somebodyd been asleep at the switch or it never could have happened heads would roll among the big brass theyd have to but that did nobody one damn bit of good now bandits in petersons earphones that was more a cry of exultation than a mere word bandits dead ahead he peered through the bulletproof windscreen sure as hell there they were shiny silver planes with meatballs on their wings and sides they were tiny as toys now but swelled even as he watched come on marv he called to his wingman time to go hunting im right with you morrison answered peterson more than half expected the japs to run away now theyd have to fight after all not just kick somebody while he was down did they really have the balls for that but theyd seen the planes from the enterprise too and here they came his thumb tensed on the firing button on top of the stick just when he thought he had the first of the enemy fighters in his sights though the jap did a flick roll and zoomed upwards christ but hes maneuverable peterson thought and then with a twinge of alarm he climbs like a son of a bitch too he gave his wildcat full throttle if the jap wanted to dogfight hed play along marvin morrison stuck to him like a burr the way a good wingman was supposed to several of the wildcats were shooting now flames spurting from the fourcaliber machine guns each one carried a japanese fighter fell from the sky trailing smoke and flame peterson whooped but the enemy planes were firing too and the shells from their wingmounted cannon bit chunks out of the fighters from the enterprise when they hit and they seemed to be able to hit whenever they pleased peterson rapidly discovered that dogfighting the japs was a mistake it was like trying to pick up water with a fork their fighters could turn inside his and outclimb him as if the wildcat were nailed to the mat this isnt right he told himself what the hell are they doing with hotter planes than weve got im hit morrison wailed in his earphones im going down the wingmans wildcat spun toward the ground and the sea far far below flames licked back from the engine cowling toward the cockpit get out peterson screamed get out while you can but he didnt think marvin morrison could and then he had to stop worrying about marv and try to save his own skin the jap hed been hunting had been hunting him too now the bastard was on his tail peterson jinked like a maniac but he couldnt shake the enemy or turn the tables on him tracers flashed past peterson tensed not that that would do him any good if a shell slammed through his armored seat and into his back machinegun bullets stitched across his wing two cannon shells hit his engine one right after the other it quit none of his cursing and clawing brought it back to life all of a sudden he was flying the worlds most expensive glider hed told his luckless wingman to get out now he had to follow his own adviceif he could he pushed back the canopy the slipstream tore at him as he unfastened his harness then he was out and past the tail that could have cut him in half and falling free right through the middle of this mad aerial combat a couple of tracers seemed close enough to touch as he plunged earthward he probably pulled the ripcord sooner than he should have the jolt of the parachute opening made the world go red for a moment he tried to steer himself toward land and away from the pacific he had a mae west but even so better the jungle than the sharks oh jesus here came a jap fighter straight for him was that the pilot whod shot him down one burst from the bastards machine guns and he was a dead man the fighter roared past the man in the cockpit waved to him as it went by peterson waved back with a onefinger salute fortunately the enemy flier either didnt see it or didnt know what it meant he flew back into the fight instead of returning to wipe out the insult in blood like badtempered dandelion fluff peterson floated down he spilled air from the chute and swung his weight this way and that fighting not to go into the drink and he didnt he came down on the fairway of a golf course about a quarter of a mile from the sea two grayhaired men advanced on him with upraised fiveirons surrender they shouted in spite of everything he almost burst out laughing here he was taller than either one of them fairer than either one of themand they thought he was a goddamn jap because he came out of the sky get me to a car and get me to an airfield he growled if they can find a plane for me ive got some more fighting to do the golfers gaped at him as if hed started spouting japanese if theyd lived here a while they might even have understood some japanese did they understand english i think hes an american sid one of them said as if announcing miracles youre right bernie the other declared after cogitations of his own peterson felt like murdering them both instead they drove him back towards ewa to the east the flames and smoke of the us navys funeral pyre climbed higher into the air every moment soot floated down like black rain in his zero lieutenant saburo shindo watched pearl harbor go up in smoke below him this was the blow commander fuchida had wanted to strike the blow against the harbors great tank farms and repair facilities even if the invasion of oahu failed by some accident the americans would have a devil of a time getting much use out of their forward base in the pacific the channel was plugged too with ships sunk trying to steam out and fight the japanese task force wouldnt have to worry about sorties not for a while shindo flew at four thousand meters the thick black greasy smoke had already climbed past him how high would it go how far would the pall spread he couldnt begin to guess he also couldnt see the ground as well as he would have liked for the smoke obscured it the very success of the attack was ruining reconnaissance we were attacked by carrierbased aircraft flying in from the west shindo said into the radio he knew the carriers wouldnt answer but admiral nagumo commander genda and commander fuchida urgently needed to hear repeat attacked by carrierbased aircraft from the west approximate bearing degrees from pearl harbor range unknown but not likely to be far out his lips curled up at the corners in the disciplined beginnings of a smile hed knocked down two wildcats himself the pilot of one had managed to get out and get his chute open he thought hed killed the other american flier in the cockpit the enemy was braveno doubt about that but shindo had quickly seen he and his men were better trained and the zero could fly rings around the slow stubby wildcat shindo laughed softly he knew how the americans looked down their noses at japan and what she made well the arrogant white men had got themselves a little surprise today back aboard the task force theyd be launching a flight of nakajima bns theyd held the torpedo bombers out of the third wave just in case american carriers showed up now at least one was on the board shindo would have bet there was only one or the enemy would have thrown more fighters at his force the plan called for his planes to plaster schofield barracks after theyd finished with pearl harbor but he knew he could fly along the bearing from which the wildcats had come and have a good chance of finding the carrier that had launched them the bns would be coming from much farther away they wouldnt know where along that bearing the carrier might lie so theyd have to waste time searching shindo made up his mind he pulled half a dozen zeros and ten aichi da dive bombers out of the schofield barracks attack and ordered them off to the west with him if that carrier was there he wanted to be in at the kill taking it out might be the most important thing the japanese navy did there was ewa down below planes still burned on the runways where theyd been lined up almost wingtiptowingtip a perfect target the americans had a couple of antiaircraft guns up and working they fired at shindos detachment but the shell bursts didnt come close on he flew out over the pacific it was so much bluer and more beautiful than it had been around japan the air above oahu had smelled sweet and spicy before battle began this was a wonderful place it would make a fine addition to the japanese empire but to make sure it did where was that carrier if im on a wildgoose chase alone in the cockpit shindo shrugged if he was he was he had to take the chance there was kauai off to the northwest of oahu the garden island its nickname was hed run into that in an intelligence briefing it was supposed to be even lovelier than oahu shindo wondered if that were possible then all thoughts of kauai all thoughts of beauty vanished from his head there south of the island were ships their white wakes very visible as they steamed towards oahu at full speed shindos heart thuttered with excitement nowwas the us carrier with them yes that had to be it there at the heart of the flotilla the escorting shipswere those battleships or only cruisers he couldnt tell he didnt care or not much the carrier counted for more than all the others put together he radioed its position to his own fleet and to the torpedo bombers that already had to be on the way then he spoke to the pilots he led the carrier is your first priority attack it at all costs only after it is destroyed will you worry about any other ships banzai for the emperor answering banzai s dinned in his earphones the american ships swelled as he drew closer to them flame and smoke burst from the guns of the forward vessels theyd spotted him then black puffs of smoke dotted the sky ahead they hadnt quite found the range but they would they would enemy fighters ahead a zero pilot yelled shindo swore but only mildly of course the american carrier would have a combat air patrol overhead zeros orbited the japanese task force toojust in case our job is to keep those fighters off our dive bombers he radioed to his comrades we are expendable they are not lets go he didnt shout banzai again he was not a showy man the zeros engine roared as he brought it up to full combat power he and his fellow fighter pilots left the dns behind as if they were nailed to the sky there were the wildcats boring in on them hed already seen the american navy fliers had courage and to spare what they didnt have was enough in the way of airplanes under them the zeros slashed into the enemy planes one wildcat after another tumbled toward the pacific a zero fell too and then another the japanese fighters were lighter and faster and more maneuverable than the americans but the wildcats could take more punishment and keep flying thereshindo turned quicker and harder than any wildcat could hope to do his thumb came down on the firing button the twin mm cannon in his wings roared a tracer round scored a line of what japanese pilots called ice candy across the sky shells blew holes in the wildcat just behind the cockpit no plane could survive punishment like that spinning wildly flames pouring from it the american fighter went down where were the dive bombers in the fight to keep the wildcats off them shindo had lost track then the glint of sun off a cockpit let him spy them theyd gone into their attack run stooping on the frantically zigzagging carrier like so many falcons in these cerulean seas the american navys camouflage schemedark gray below and light gray aboveleft something to be desired it was better suited to gloomier climes farther north even from his height shindo could make out the planes on the flight deck whether the carrier was going to fly them to oahu or launch a strike against his task force he didnt know too late now either way antiaircraft fire snarled up at the diving aichis one of them was hit caught fire and spiraled into the pacific its bomb went off when it struck sending up a white geyser of water but the rest of the dive bombers pressed on fearlessly they released their bombs one after another and pulled up and away banzai shindo shouted when the first bombs exploded but they were near misses one astern the other to port the carrier kept dodging staggering across the sea like a drunk it did not save her though the next three bombs were hits one near the stern one on the island and one not far from the bow the bursts of flame and great clouds of black smoke showed him the difference between what hed thought a hit looked like and the real thing the hit near the stern among the airplanes loaded with fuel and torpedoes and bombs was the one that devastated the carrier secondary explosions followed almost at once as the munitions bathed in fire went off on their own engines damaged the stricken ship slowed to a crawl brave men crewed her though the antiaircraft guns that hadnt been knocked out kept firing at the japanese planes seeing their comrades success the last three dive bombers pulled up without dropping their bombs what are you doing shindo called to them sir the carrier is dead in the water one of those pilots replied we request permission to attack a battleship instead i think theyre cruisers shindo said but even if they are battleships the carrier is the primary target he looked down at it the aichi pilot was right it could not move at all still the americans were supposed to be very clever very skillful at damage control shindo made up his mind two of you will strike the carrier again the third may use his bomb against a cruiser do you understand me all three of youspeak up aye aye sir they chorused obey then shindo radioed the rest of the das go back to the ships if you pass the torpedo bombers coming this way give them a course the three bombladen aichis climbed back up into the sky then dove once more as shindo had commanded two of them attacked the carrier one missed even though the target lay dead in the water the other bomb though struck square amidships shindo thought afterwards that that one might have been enough to sink her all by itself she began to list to starboard the list quickly grew whatever men remained aboard her could do nothing to stop it shindo was so intent on watching her that the fire and smoke suddenly spurting from a cruisersor was it a battleships superstructure took him by surprise banzai an excited young pilot shouted in his earphones that is a very solid hit yes it is shindo agreed he ordered the remaining das back to the carriers and all the zeros except his own if he spotted the torpedo bombers he could guide them down to the american ships he throttled back his plane had more endurance than the dive bombers especially when he wasnt going all out in combat he could afford to loiter here for a while and he wanted to watch that carrier sink she went to the bottom about twenty minutes later a few boats and rafts bobbed in the water he supposed individual men were floating and swimming but he was too high to spot them destroyers and cruisers including the damaged one gathered to pick up survivors then the ships scattered they couldnt possibly have finished picking up all the men from the carrier but they abandoned them and started throwing up flak saburo shindo spotted the torpedo bombers a couple of minutes later how had the americans known about them so soon had a cruiser launched a scout if so wouldnt he have seen the slow clumsy plane catapulted off its ship and shot it down but if not how had they done it did they have detection gear the empire of japan lacked that was a question for later now shindo dove on a cruiser and strafed the deck doing everything he could to distract it from the oncoming nakajimas tracers sizzled all around him he counted himself lucky that he wasnt hit if he had been hed intended to try to fly his plane into one of the us ships lieutenant fusata iida had tried that sort of thing at kaneohe hed said before the attack began that he would do his best to strike an enemy target if he was shot down he had been hit and hed aimed his zero at a hangar housing flying boats he hadnt been able to hit it but hed made the effort his spirit deserved praise one of the nakajima bns caught fire and tumbled into the pacific the planes had to fly low and straight to launch their torpedoes it made them dreadfully vulnerable had the americans here still had any fighters flying things would only have been worse their ships maneuvered desperately two destroyers almost collided too bad shindo exclaimed seeing they would miss if the foe had hurt himself that would have been sweet another torpedo bomber exploded in midaira big shell must have hit it but torpedoes splashed into the sea one after another here the bns had open water of unlimited depth this wasnt a problem like the one pearl harbor itself had presented the narrow shallow lochs at the american base had made the japanese modify their torpedoes so they wouldnt bury themselves in the bottom after they fell from their planes no such worries here just white wakes in the water straight as arrows shindo cursed when a dodging destroyer managed to evade one of those arrows but then he shouted banzai againa torpedo hit the damaged cruiser amidships the cruiser shuddered to a stop a destroyer was hit too and her back broken she sank faster than the carrier had and there was another cruiser or battleship shindo could still hope hit her bow torn off by the force of the blow shindo wished for more bombers to finish off the whole flotilla he shrugged then let out another cheer as a second destroyer was struck despite the cheer he knew the carrierbased planes were lucky to have accomplished this much the american carrier was dead that mattered most the japanese navy also had a swarm of submarines in hawaiian waters maybe they could finish off some of the us ships that had escaped the torpedo bombers that wasnt shindos worry or not directly hed done everything he could here the surviving nakajimas were flying back toward the northeast he followed them as hed trained to do they had better navigation gear than he did he smiled as he buzzed along over the pacific it wasnt as if he had to worry about american pursuit no everything had gone just like a drill the first attacks on oahu passed schofield barracks by listening to the radio looking at the smoke rising from nearby wheeler field fletcher armitage was almost insulted whats the matter he exclaimed dont they think were worth hitting the lousy yellow bastards little by little the brass started waking up from the haymaker theyd taken orders came for units to move to their defensive positions the twentyeighth infantry regiment headed for waikiki the ninetyeighth coast artillery regiment antiaircraft rolled out for kaneohe on the windward side of oahu and along with the nineteenth infantry regiment the thirteenth field artillery battalion hurried up to the north shore to defend the beach between haleiwa and waimea they hurried that is once they got everything ready to roll that took a while along with everybody else armitage discovered war was different from drills the sense of urgency was much higher unfortunately it made a lot of people run around like chickens that had just had a meeting with the hatchet and chopping block come on goddammit fletch screamed at a sergeant fifteen years older than he was you know how to hitch the gun to the truck how many times have you done it about a million sir the sergeant answered quietly but never when it counted not till now he looked down at his trembling hands as if theyd betrayed him that wasnt the only foulup small and not so small in the battalionfar from it armitage thanked god things werent worse at last all the mm guns and their limbers were attached all the men who would fire them had piled into the trucks all the infantrymen in the accompanying regiment had their rifles and ammunition and helmets they started north from schofield barracks a little before two in the afternoon they had barely begun to move when the antiaircraft guns still at the barracks began pounding away throwing shells up into the sky through the roar and rumble of the trucks diesel engines armitage hadnt been able to hear any airplanes overhead are they shooting for the fun of it he asked whoever would listen to him he got his answer less than a minute later when bombs started bursting not far away the truck stopped so suddenly that the soldiers in back were pitched into one another holy shit somebody shouted fletch was shouting too in a fury at the driver what the hell are you doing keep going i cant sir the man answered truck two ahead of this one just got blown to hell and gone roads blocked well get off the road and go around him armitage raged ill try sir the driver said dubiously armitage wished he could see better with the olivedrab canvas cover over the back of the truck he might as well have been inside a spam can for all the visibility he had then a fragment of bomb casing ripped through the canvas about six inches above his head he decided he didnt want a view all that badly the driver let out a frightened howl fighters jap fighters they were coming in low plenty low enough for fletch to hear their motors over the noise the trucks were making he heard their machine guns and cannon going off too and half a heartbeat later he heard the driver scream he had other things to worry about though machinegun bullets finished the job of shredding the canvas they did a pretty good job of shredding men too and metal as well four or five soldiers in the rear compartment started screaming and shouting and cursing all at the same time something hot and wet splashed fletchs ear and the side of his face the iron stink of blood filled the compartment more screams followed when the truck ran into the one in front of it next to getting strafed by a zero though a collision was a small thing the diesel engine didnt go up in flames the way a gasolinepowered motor would have even so fletch said weve got to get out of here nobody argued with him in fact soldiers scrambled over him to escape some of them were wounded others just panicked by the time he got out blood splashed the front of his uniform even if he wasnt hurt himself japanese planes still buzzed overhead here came a fighter low flames winking on and off as its machine guns shot up the us column get down people were shouting hit the dirt fletch was damned if he would even after a bullet slammed into a man less than ten feet away with a noise like a baseball bat hitting a watermelon the luckless soldier clutched at himself and crumpled fletch yanked the from his belt and banged away at the jap he had about as much chance of hitting the speeding fighter as he did of taking wing himself but he gave it his best shot infantrymen started firing at the enemy too that actually gave him a little hope put enough lead in the air and it was liable to do some good meanwhile though the handful of enemy planes were cutting the column to ribbons bombers pounded it from on high while the fighters swooped low to strafe again and again at every pass men died and vehicles caught fire somebody not far away moaned where the hell are our airplanes you stupid asshole fletch pointed south toward the funeral pyre of wheeler field where the fuck do you think they are this has got to be the worst sucker punch in the history of the world a bomb screamed down louder and louder with artillery fire it meant the shells were headed right for you when the sound behaved like that armitage didnt know if bombs worked the same way but he didnt want to find out by experiment either now he did throw himself flat a split second before the bomb burst blast picked him up and slammed him down again like a professional wrestler it tried to tear his lungs out through his mouth and nose dazed he tasted blood concussion could kill without leaving visible injury as he staggered upright again he realized that had almost happened to him closer to the crater the bomb had dug men hadnt been so lucky some of what he saw might have come straight from a butchers shop butchers meat though didnt scrabble frantically trying to put itself back together butchers meat didnt scream for its mother either fletch bent over and was noisily sick then he yelled corpsmen we need some corpsmen over here that shout was rising everywhere he bent again this time by an injured man with clumsy fingers he put on a wound bandage to slow the soldiers bleeding then almost stabbing himself in the process he gave the man a morphine injection the wounded soldier sighed as the drug began to take hold next to him a sergeant was using a bayonet to cut another wounded mans throat considering what the bomb had left of the young man armitage only nodded the sergeant was doing him a favor after plunging the bayonet into the ground three or four times to clean it the sergeant looked over to him how the hell are we supposed to get to our deployment area now sir he asked the column was an abbatoir trucks burned others lay on their side or upside down guns had been flipped about like jackstraws sergeant ill be damned if i can tell you fletch answered truth is ive been too busy trying to stay alive the last few minutes to care about anything else yeah the noncom said but we better start caring pdq dont you think fletch looked around again he saw ruin and wreckage and slaughter he looked up to the sky he didnt see any more japanese planes for which he heartily thanked god but that didnt mean the bastards with the meatballs wouldnt come back again he also didnt see any american planes that didnt surprise him the japs must have swept them away like kids in second grade erasing a blackboard how the hell was his force supposed to do anything if the japs could hit it from above whenever they pleased he had no idea none in the whole wide world but he managed a nod he hoped wasnt too downhearted yeah sergeant youre right weve got to try jiro takahashi took the oshima maru out on sunday just like any other day the idea of the sabbath meant nothing to him the sabbath was for haoles whod invented the silly notion as far as he was concerned work was work and one day as good for it as another maybe hiroshi and kenzo had different ideas if his sons did theyd never had the nerve to say anything about them if hed sent them out in the sampan while he stayed home and slept they might have as things were his example pulled them along if he was willingeven eagerto get out of bed before sunrise and head for kewalo basin how could they tell him they didnt want to they couldnt they hadnt yet anyhow some sampans were coming in even as the oshima maru put to sea a few men went fishing by night trailing lights in the water to lure nehus and the tuna that fed on them they were first to market with their catch and so got good prices but their expenses were higher toojiro didnt have to worry about a generator or the fuel to run it or light bulbs the work was harder at night too though that fazed him much less than the extra cost did he set a tub of minnows down in the bottom of the sampan a fairy tern swooped down to try to steal some of the little fish he waved his hat the white bird with the big black eyes flew off toward waikiki waste time bird hiroshi said kenzo laughed jiro only shrugged he got the oshima maru s engine going the sampan shook and thudded with the diesels vibration out to sea they went the sky had just started turning pale yellow out there beyond diamond head pink would follow and then the sun today he got out early enough to suit him hed cleared the defensive sea area well before sunrise today other oldschool fishermen would be complaining about their lazy goodfornothing sons not even jiro could find anything wrong with his boys this morning theyd done everything he wanted and done it in good time too he didnt tell them so he didnt want them getting swelled heads besides why should he praise them for merely doing what they were supposed to do if he did then theyd want praise for every little thing theyd expect it but theyd be disappointed he wasnt the sort to throw praise around he never had been and he never would be they chattered back and forth in incomprehensible english as the oshima maru skimmed over the water when they needed to talk with him they switched to japanese that was almost always pure business they didnt waste a lot of time on chitchat with him this past week with no progress in the talks in washington the impulse to talk had dried up even more than usual for all his efforts to make them into good japanese they saw things from the usas point of view jiro looked ahead trying to spot a good fishing ground hiroshi did the same even if he wasnt so good at it kenzo stared over the sampans stern back in the direction from which theyd come jiro almost told his younger son waste time but figured hed be wasting his breath then kenzo pointed north towards oahu and spoke one word look the urgency in his sons voice made jiro turn around oh jesus christ he exclaimed an oath he used even though he was a buddhist and shintoist not a christian those black clouds on the horizon couldnt be good news thats not honolulu its too far west hiroshi said thats pearl harbor i wonder if some of the ammunition there blew up or something maybe he would make a proper fisherman one of these days after all he was dead right about the direction from which the smoke was rising kenzo said i wish we had a radio on board then wed know what was going on as far as jiro was concerned a radio for the boat was more expensive than it was worth he said whatevers going on up there its got nothing to do with us we have a days work ahead of us and were going to do it neither hiroshi nor kenzo argued with that if theyd tried he would have knocked their heads together and so what if he would have had to stand on tiptoe to do it some things simply needed doing and he would have done what needed doing here without the least hesitation as things were the oshima maru s diesel kept pounding away most of the smoke to the north vanished below the horizon jiro forgot about it hed find out what it was when he got home in the meantime there were fish to catch if his sons wanted to go on about pearl harbor while they worked he didnt mindas long as they did work he steered the sampan to what he thought would be a good spot boobies plunged into the sea nearby that said there were small fish around where there were small fish there could be tuna to feed on them he killed the motor the sampan glided to a stop alone on the pacificalone but for that nasty smoke smudge in the north anyhow whatever had happened to pearl harbor it wasnt anything small again jiro made himself shove that aside he picked up a tub of bait minnows and poured them into the ocean away they streaked little silver darts racing in all directions come on he told hiroshi and kenzo lets get the lines in the water and see how we do today the fishing lines followed the bait to jiros eyes those big barbless hooks didnt look much like minnows tuna fortunately were less discriminating as soon as he and the boys started hauling in the lines he knew it would be a good day fat aku and bigger ahi hung from the hooks like ripe fruit from a branch take them off gut them store them throw more minnows in the water to lure more tuna to their doom noon came and passed and the fishermen hardly even noticed most days jiro and his sons would break for lunch no matter how things were going not today today the younger men seemed as much machines as their father jiro began to think the weight of fish they were taking might swamp the oshima maru he shrugged broad shoulders there were worse ways to go kenzo broke the spell about one oclock again by pointing north towards oahu he said not a word this time nor did he need to those great black greasy clouds spoke for themselves even from here miles away they boiled high into the sky swelling and swelling hiroshi whistled softly that is something really really big he said i wonder if one of the battleships blew up or if they have a fire in their storage tanks i wonder how many people are hurt kenzo said something that big theyre not going to get off for free jiro takahashi didnt say anything he just eyed the smoke when the oshima maru couldnt hold another aku he started the motor and steered the sampan back toward kewalo basin he was not a man to go guessing wildly when he didnt know but he wondered whether any accident no matter how spectacular could have caused that kind of conflagration he also wondered what had what could have if an accident hadnt hiroshi pointed east across the water theres another sampan coming in maybe theyll know whats going on will you steer toward them father most of the time jiro would have gruffly shaken his head and kept on toward honolulu the everswelling black clouds to the north though were too big and too threatening to ignore without a word he swung the oshima maru to starboard the other skipper steered his disreputable bluepainted fishing boat to port he waved a dirty white cap in the direction of the oshima maru and shouted something across the water jiro couldnt make out the words he cupped a hand behind his ear the other skipper shouted again jiro snorted in disgust no wonder he couldnt understandthe other man was speaking english he says whats going on at pearl harbor kenzo reported hiroshi didnt hide his disappointment i was hoping hed be able to tell us he said in japanese then switched to english to yell back at the other sampan the men on board pantomimed annoyance theyd wanted to find out what was going on from the takahashis kenzo called in english toward the other sampan too then he return to japanese well run into more boats when we get closer to the basin hai honto jiro said and it was true somehow though his younger son contrived to speak japanese with english intonations it wasnt kenzos accent the teachers at the japanese school had made sure he spoke better than jiro who was a peasant from a long line of peasants but anyone with an ear to hear had to notice the influence of the other language on he way he put his sentences together they werent exactly wrong but they were different jiro didnt know what to do about it hiroshi had the same problem but not so badly both sampans skimmed north over the waves sure enough other maru s were also making their way back to kewalo basin to the japanese anything that floated was a maruhaoles got a laugh out of their calling sampans ships rather than boats on one of them the crew were all but jumping out of their dungarees hiroshi pointed to the excited men theyll know yes jiro swung the rudder the oshima maru wasnt the only sampan making for that one either now jiro raised his voice what is it he yelled and waved northwest in the direction of pearl harbor the four fishermen on the sampan had a radio news tumbled out of them some of it in english some in japanese jiro didnt get all of it but he understood enough the empire of japan had attacked the us navy at pearl harbor and had struck a devastating blow his first reaction was pride this is how admiral togo hit the russians in manchuria when i was young he said hiroshi and kenzo didnt say anything for a little while then gently his older son answered but father you werent living in manchuria when they attacked it a surprise attack is a dirty way to start a war kenzo added not gently at all thats how hitler does things jiro blinked in the nippon jiji and jitsugyo no hawaii and other local japaneselanguage papersthe ones he paid attention tohitler got pretty good press the writers worried more about communists wasnt it the same in english he pointed out what was obvious to him this isnt hitler this is japan his sons looked at each other neither of them seemed to want to say anything at last hiroshi did father were americans kenzo nodded im not the words leaped into jiros mouth they were true both his sons had to know it even so he didnt say them if he had something would have broken forever between the two boys and him sensing that he kept quiet reiko would have understood but she was of his generation not his sons hiroshi went on speaking carefully this attack is going to be bad for all the japanese in hawaiiall the japanese on the mainland too the fat cats will think we wanted it theyll think we were all for it and theyll make us pay his brother nodded again nothing but gloom on his face when have things been good for the japanese in hawaii jiro asked when have the big shots not made us pay and things would have been even worse if the japanese government hadnt complained and made the planters live up to their contracts all that was before you were born so you dont remember but it happened dont you see father that doesnt matter now kenzo said were at war with japan were at war with japan the words stabbed jiro like a dagger they put him and his sons on opposite sides of a chasm what he hadnt said kenzo had he wasnt at war with japan japan was his country it always had been even if he hadnt lived there since he was young the haoles who ran hawaii had made it very plain that they didnt believe he was an american or that he could turn into one his sons might think themselves americans the haoles who ran the islands didnt think they were there werent enough jobs for japanese who had the education to fill them they couldnt move up in society they couldnt join the army either no japanese were allowed in the twentyfourth or twentyfifth divisions though every other group in hawaii had members there kenzo and hiroshi had to know that but they didnt want to think about it and jiro didnt want to think about what the attack on pearl harbor might mean or about what might happen in its aftermath because he didnt he steered the oshima maru back toward kewalo basin without another word the time for a real quarrel might come later he didnt want it now out on the open sea the other sampans hurried north along with his the one with the radio was a bigger boat with a bigger engine minute by minute it pulled away that proved its undoing a buzz in the sky swelled into a roar a dark green fighter with unmistakable us stars on wings and fuselage swooped down on the lead sampan machine guns roared the fighter streaked away oh jesus christ jiro exclaimed once more his sons stared in horror the other sampan lay dead in the water jiro brought the oshima maru up alongside it two of the fishermen aboard were gruesomely dead one almost cut in half by bullets the other with his head blown open one of the others was clutching a wounded leg they thought we were invading he moaned the fourth fisherman by some miracle hadnt been hit but stood there in shock a dreadful amazement frozen on his face come on jiro told his boys trying to ignore the stink of the blood that was everywhere on the shattered sampan weve got to do what we can for them what if that plane comes back kenzo quavered jiro shrugged fatalistically what if it does it shows you what the haoles think of how american you are neh neither kenzo nor hiroshi had anything to say to that gulping they scrambled onto the other sampan come on come on lieutenant yonehara shouted move move move you cant waste a minute you cant even waste a second a great stream of japanese soldiers emerged from the hold of the nagata maru once upon a time during his brief schooling corporal takeo shimizu had heard something about the circulation of the blood there were little things inside the blood that swirled through the body over and over again corpuscles that was the name he wouldnt have bet he could put his finger on it not after all these years he felt like a corpuscle himself one out of so very many corpuscles though werent weighted down with helmets and bayoneted rifles and packs that would sink them like stones if they couldnt make the journey from the transport to the landing barges coming alongside it was black night too which didnt make things any easier the nagata maru had charged forward all through the day and after darkness came down the ship and the other transports unloading their cargoes of soldiers and equipment were supposed to be near the north coast of oahu shimizu hoped their captains and navigators knew what they were doing if they didnt someone stepped on his foot that gave him something more urgent than captains and navigators to worry about watch it he growled so sorry a soldier said insincerely so sorry corporal shimizu snapped the soldier whoever he was let out a startled gasp it was still too dark to recognize faces and shimizu hadnt been able to tell whose voice that was either the nagata maru rolled and pitched in the pacific swells rising and falling six or eight feet at a time behind shimizu somebody noisily lost the supper hed had the evening before the sharp stink made the corporal want to puke too again though he had other things to worry about the swells wouldnt make boarding the barges any easier his platoon commander didnt seem worried this isnt bad men lieutenant yonehara called we could board in seas twice this high oh yeah id like to see you try it said a soldier protected from insubordination by darkness another soldier stepped in the new puddle of vomit and cursed monotonously yoneharas platoon did keep advancing toward the rail so corporal shimizu supposed other men from the regiment were going down the side of the ship and onto the barges it was either that or they were all going over the side and drowning they could have done that back in japanese waters if it was what the high command had in mind they wouldnt have needed to come all this way wait a sailor called the tossing didnt seem to bother him a bit another barge is coming alongside thats the one youll go into corporal shimizu wondered how he could tell it was as dark as the inside of a pig something hard and cold caught him just above the belly buttonthe rail automatically his hands reached out to take hold of it his right hand closed on iron his left on rope part of the netting down which hed scramble when the word came he stood there hoping the pressure behind him wouldnt send him over the side before he was supposed to go without warning the sailor slapped him on the back down you go the fellow said hurry dont hold things up hai shimizu said he swung over the rail hanging on for dear life while his boot found the net if hed been a monkey able to grasp with feet as well as hands everything would have been simple as things were he clambered down slowly and carefully hard work said a soldier scrambling down beside him corporal shimizu nodded this time that was true literally as well as metaphorically the daihatsu landing craft bobbed in the pacific beside the nagata maru it was about fifty feet long with a beam of ten or twelve feet its hull was made of steel supported by heavy wooden braces it had twin keels riveted on to the hull except for the two machine guns at the bow and the steel shield protecting the wheel it could have been a fishing boat going after sardines on the inner sea getting down into the barge from the transport was tricky shimizu clung to the net he didnt want to get squashed between the two vessels if he did theyd scrape him off the steel come on a man on the barge called encouragingly lean out ill grab your boots and keep you safe leaning out taking his feet out of the net was the last thing shimizu had in mind glumly he realized he had no choice with the burden he was bearing how long could he hang on with arms and hands alone how soon would he go into the water hurry up he called to the fellow in the barge ive got you the man answered and so he did let go youll come in reluctantly shimizu obeyed he was falling into the barge he laughed in relief as he straightened up arigato he said do itashimashite the other man waved away his thanks dont pay backpay forward help your friends coming down that was good advice and corporal shimizu took it no one got crushed between the nagata maru and the landing barge there were a couple of close calls passed off with laughs and bows and exclamations of hard work the whole company squeezed onto the barge shimizu wouldnt have believed it if he hadnt seen it with his own eyes lieutenant yonehara seemed pleased all according to plan he said we should start for oahu any minute now i thought we were going to hawaii a soldier said oahu is one of the islands of hawaii the platoon leader explained its the one with the good harbor and the one where the americans have all their soldiers once we take it away from them all the hawaiian islands are ours it all sounded very easy when lieutenant yonehara put it like that shimizu let out a soft sigh of relief he wanted it to be easy people said the planes from the carriers had done a good job of hitting the harbor and the rest of the islands defenses shimizu had been in the army long enough not to trust what people said this time though he hoped rumor told the truth the diesel engine at the stern of the landing barge took on a deeper note the barge pulled away from the nagata maru another took its place the motion was fierceup hill and down dale much worse than it had been in the freighter shimizus stomach lurched i wont be sick he told himself sternly a few soldiers did puke up whatever was in their bellies twilight began turning the eastern sky pale as the bargeone of a whole flotilla of invasion craftlumbered toward the shore most of the other landing craft carried soldiers as shimizus did some had howitzers or light tanks aboard shimizu hoped they were well chained down if they shifted they could capsize their barges and take them to the bottom other men worried about other things if american planes come overhead right now were sitting ducks a sergeant said nobody could contradict him for he wasnt wrong what pilot could want a better target than wallowing invasion barges will the americans be waiting for us on the beach shiro wakuzawa asked that was another good question shimizu didnt know how to answer it it was a day now since the carrier task force had started pounding oahu would the americans think it was just a hitandrun raid or would they expect an invasion to follow the attack from the air shimizu would have but he didnt know how americans thought lieutenant yonehara found his own way to deal with the question whether they are on the beach or not doesnt matter private if they are well beat them there if they arent well move inland and beat them wherever we find them plain enough yes sir thank you sir wakuzawa would goof off whenever he got the chance but he wasnt foolhardy enough to show an officer disrespect a man who did that soon regretted the day he was born the sky grew ever lighter soldiers pointed ahead and exclaimed land well what did you expect when we got into the barges shimizu demanded that theyd dump us in the middle of the sea the men laughed some of them probably hadnt thought much about getting into the barges one way or the other a lot of soldiers were like that they took things as they happened and didnt worry about them till they happened its so warm and the air smells so good private wakuzawa said the weather sure is better than it was when we left the kurils hai several soldiers agreed with him maybe siberia had worse weather than the kurils did but maybe not too after all most of the weather those northern islands got blew straight down from siberia the machine guns at the landing barges bow began banging away shimizu followed the lines of tracers rising up into the brightening sky and saw his worst nightmareeverybodys worst nightmarerealized three american fighter planes were swooping down on the fleet of barges their guns started winking bullets kicked up spurts of water screams from other barges said not all the bullets were splashing into the pacific but then the american planes suddenly broke off the attack they darted away zeros swooped down on them like falcons after doves takeo shimizu let out a wordless cry of joy and relief an american fighter caught fire and cartwheeled into the sea another went down a moment later shimizu didnt see what happened to the third but it didnt come back nothing else really mattered if i ever meet those zero pilots ill buy them all the sake they can drink private wakuzawa exclaimed i thought we were in trouble the navy will not let us down lieutenant yonehara said he might have said much more than that wakuzawa had shown not just a lack of confidence but a lack of martial spirit but the platoon leader dropped it there maybe hed had a moment of alarm too shimizu knew he had even if hed kept quiet about it he peered south the sun came up over the horizon spilling ruddy light across the golden beaches dead ahead the palm trees just behind them and the jungleclad mountains a little farther inland the sight was one of the most beautiful shimizu had ever seen it all seemed so peaceful it wouldnt stay that way for long waves broke on the beach they looked like pretty goodsized waves to shimizu could the barge get through them without flipping over he hoped so hed find out any minute now a few machine guns on the shore started shooting at the invasion barges the barges shot back something bigger and heavier threw shells at the japanesethose were big splashes rising from the sea zeros dove at the beach dive bombers appeared overhead they swooped down too the shelling suddenly stopped some of the machine guns kept firing two bullets ricocheted off the shield that protected the sailor at the wheel a soldier howled when another one instead of ricocheting struck home shimizu had fought in china hed seen plenty of gunfire worse than this it was just something a soldier went through on the imperial way to the new men it must have seemed very heavy and frightening shiro wakuzawa said the americans wont have any ammunition left for when we come ashore if they keep shooting like this oh i think theyll save a bullet or two shimizu said maybe even three some of the firstyear soldiers taking him seriously gave back solemn nods most of them though joined the men whod been in the army longer and laughed somebody pointed to the water right where the waves began breaking are those people what are they doing they must be out of their minds two nearly naked men rode upright on long boards toward the beach bullets must have whipped past them in both directions they seemed oblivious they skimmed along on the crest of a wave side by side shimizu stared at them entranced hed never dreamt of such a skill they must be americans shall i knock them down asked a machine gunner at the bow of the barge no corporal shimizu was one of the dozen men shouting the same thing at the same time he added they might almost be kami the way they glide along christians talk about their lord jesus walking on water lieutenant yonehara said i never thought i would see it with my own eyes the two men reached the beach still upright on their boards then they did the first merely human thing shimizu had seen from them they scooped the boards up under their arms and ran that was also an eminently sensible thing to do machinegun bullets kicked up sand around their feet not all the men on the landing barges must have felt as sporting as the soldiers on this one but shimizu didnt see them fall maybe they really were spirits how could an ordinary man be sure his own barge came ashore much less gracefully than the surfriders had it didnt quite bury its bow in the sand but it came close he staggered he didnt know how he stayed on his feet somehow he managed off the sailors were screaming get off we have to go back for more men hurry he scrambled out of the barge and jumped down his boots scrunched in the sand some americans were still shooting from the plantsalmost the jungleon the far side of the road machinegun and rifle muzzles flashed malevolently a bullet cracked past shimizus head so close that he felt or thought he felt the wind of its passage he couldnt run away there was no away to run to not at the edge of a hostile beach he ran forward instead if he and his comrades didnt kill those americans the americans would kill them instead come on he shouted and the men in his squad came oscar van der kirk and charlie kaapu spent their sunday morning surfriding at waimea beach and grumbling that the waves werent bigger every so often one of them would look up at the planes flying back and forth overhead at one point charlie remarked army and navy must have a hair up their ass thats the biggest goddamn drill i ever saw has to cost a fortune yeah oscar said and thought no more about it sixfoot waves werent so much not when hed been hoping for surf three or four times that size but you could still find all sorts of unpleasant ways to hurt yourself if you didnt pay attention to what you were doing finally his stomach started growling so loud he couldnt stand it any more he and charlie went into waimea for something to eat it wasnt a big town there werent a lot of choices especially on a sunday as they usually did when they were up there oscar and charlie headed for okamotos siamin stand for a quarter you could get a bowl of noodles and broth and sliced pork and vegetables that would hold you for a hell of a long time old man okamoto looked faintly apprehensive when they walked in oscar wondered why they hadnt cadged a meal off him in a year and a half and theyd paid him back for that one the next time they were here they ordered their noodles and sat down to wait while the grayhaired little japanese man ladled them out of the big pot he kept bubbling in back of the counter he set the bowls on the table along with the shorthandled bigbowled china soup spoons every japanese and chinese place in hawaii seemed to use thanks pop oscar said and dug in he and charlie both ate like wolverines he was halfway down the bowl before he noticed old man okamoto had the radio tuned to kgmb not to the nasalsounding japanese music he usually listened to kgmb should have been playing music too if of a more normal sort it wasnt instead an announcer was gabbling into the mike he sounded as if hed have kittens right there on the air that was how oscarand charlie tooheard about pearl harbor jesus charlie said then he spooned up some more siamin oscar nodded he went on eating too after a couple of minutes he glanced over to old man okamoto no wonder the old guy was nervous if the japs had done that down there he probably counted himself lucky that his neighbors hadnt come by with pitchforks and tar and feathers oscar laughed like most oldcountry japanese okamoto had come to hawaii to work in the fields hed been running this place for as long as anybody could remember though you had to be crazy to think of him as a danger to the united states his neighbors must have felt the same wayno sign of tar and feathers your kgmb time is elevenfortyeight the man on the radio said his voice getting shriller every minute we have been ordered off the air by the united states army so that our signal does not guide japanese airplanes or parachutists we will return only to transmit official bulletins and orders please stay calm during this period of emergency this time charlie laughed first oscar followed suit the radio signal cut away to sudden dead silence how would the horrible news followed by the stations disappearance make anybody stay calm something else crossed his mind japanese parachutists what would happen if the japs invaded oahu he hoped the army would trounce them what else was it here for but suppose it didnt it sounded as if the japs had landed on things with both feet suppose oscar eyed old man okamoto again more thoughtfully this time if the japanese empires soldiers came to oahu how would the local japanese respond hed heard army and navy brass had sleepless nights about questions like that but it was their worry not his he and charlie got to the bottom of their bowls at the same time what now charlie asked i dont want to go back to honolulu right away everybodys gotta be going nuts down there oscar answered besides if the japs are shooting up wheeler and schofield and kaneohe god knows if we can even get there from here we might as well hang around and surf and hope the waves get better what do you think charlie nodded suits me i was gonna say the same thing but some haoles they figure they all the time gotta do stuff you know what i mean if i saw anything i could do id do it oscar said you want to join the army right now charlie shook his head oscar shrugged okay neither do i in that case we might as well do what were doing he left a dime on the table for old man okamoto as he and charlie headed out to his car by the time they got back to the beach oscar could see smoke rising in the south up over the mountains he whistled softly that was a hell of a lot of smoke he and charlie were both shaking their heads when they paddled out into the pacific no wonder the fellow on the radio sounded as if hed just watched his puppy run over by a cement mixer the japs must have blown up everything that would blow they rode the waves all afternoon then went back into waimea for supper okamotos seemed to be the only place open and nobody but them was in it along with siamin oscar bought a loaf of bread and a couple of cokes for breakfast the next morning getting the old man to understand a loaf of bread wasnt easy but he managed he and charlie slept in the car again that night some time after midnight truck noises and swearing men woke them up the army oscar said and went back to sleep army or no army it never occurred to him not to go into the water at dawn the next morning it didnt occur to the soldiers to try to stop them till they were already in the ocean and could pretend not to hear when fighter planes zoomed by overhead right afterwards oscar wished hed listened he didnt know whether he spotted the incoming barges before the army men on the beach did or not he did discover getting stuck in a crossfire was no fun at all by what would do for a miracle till a bigger one came along he and charlie made it back to shore alive they piled into his chevy and got the hell out of there iii jim peterson hadnt thought the japanese would hit hawaii he would have been glad to have his fellow fliers from the enterprise tell him what a damn fool hed been but he didnt think many of them were left alive nobody was saying much about what had happened to the carrier either and nobody was letting him get back into combat the only wildcats on oahu were the couple that had survived the flight in from the enterprise they already had pilots put me in anything then peterson raged after the golfers whose round hed interrupted brought him to the marine corps air station at ewa west of pearl harbor i dont care what im in as long as i get another swing at those little yellow bastards they wouldnt listen to him the first thing they did was send him to the dispensary tent where a harriedlooking medic confirmed that yes he was still breathing and no he didnt have any bullet holes in him that done they took him out to the airstrip it was nothing but wreckage some still burning you see a marine corps captain said you arent the only one who wants another shot at the japsbut youre gonna have to wait in line just like everybody else jesus peterson said and it could have been worse the enterprise had taken some of the marine pilots and plants from ewa to wake island just before the japs came in otherwise they might have got stuck on the ground too what the hell are we going to do beats me the captain answered they kicked us in the nuts and we werent even looking sure seems that way the marine seemed to take a certain morose satisfaction in agreeing with him and its not just this base mind you he waved to the east it looked like hell over thereliterally the pall of thick oily black smoke filled that half of the sky sons of bitches didnt just hit the fleet they got the tank farms too god only knows how many million gallons of fuel going up in smoke up in smoke is right peterson said little by little the sheer scale of the disaster began penetrating even his stubborn soul for gods sake if you cant do anything else give me a rifle and a helmet and let me shoot at em for the first time the marine officer looked at him with something approaching approval not barely concealed annoyance that now that may be arrangedif it turns out theres anybody to shoot at peterson stared at him if theyve done this much you think they wont follow it up with an invasion theyd have to be crazy not to he was a born zealot his views swung from one extreme to the other with the greatest of ease supper was an oddly carefree meal featuring some of the best lamb chops peterson had ever eaten supper also featured hot and cold running booze admiral halsey sometimes winked at the rules against shipboard alcohol but peterson had been mostly dry for a while now the whiskey and rum and gin and irish coffee added something to the rumors coming in from around the island some of the marines believed everything no matter how gloomy some refused to believe anything only stands to reason one of them insisted if the japs plastered us and pearl harbor they couldnt have had much left over to do anything else bullshit said the captain whod shown peterson around if they did that much down here they arent going to forget about schofield and wheeler and kaneohe theyll hit everything reports seemed to bear him out with the radio off the air though peterson found it hard to be sure of anything he supposed the big wheels here knew what was really going on he hoped they did anyhow they should havephones were still working even if the radio had been yanked but whatever they knew they werent talking that by itself seemed to say the news wasnt good peterson got a cot in a tent that night and counted himself lucky when reveille sounded he thought for a moment he was back aboard the enterprise then memory returned he was swearing as he bounced to his feet a marine climbing out of another cot a few feet away nodded sympathetically yeah navy its a bitch isnt it he said a bitch and a half peterson answered what the hell do we do now might as well have breakfast the marine said practically soon as the brass wants anything from us i figure theyll let us know breakfast was bacon and eggs and hash browns not much different from what peterson would have eaten on the enterprise she hadnt been at sea long enough to switch from fresh to powdered eggs but the walk to the mess hall reminded him where he was and what had happened the west was light but in the east the sun couldnt penetrate the smoke rising from pearl harbor they hadnt even slowed down the fires there during the night how much fuel was burning hed just got a second cup of coffee when airraid sirens began to howl he sprang up and followed the marines as they ran for shelter most of them made for a nearly finished swimming pool not far away first time i ever jumped into one of these when it was dry he said he got a laugh minutes later though bombs started whistling down being on the receiving end and unable to hit back was anything but funny a few antiaircraft guns banged away but the enemy airplanes were high in the sky peterson didnt think any of them got hit no us planes rose to challenge them no us planes at ewa could this isnt how it was yesterday morning said one of the marines in the pool then they came in with fighters right over the rooftops we shot back with springfieldss anything we could get our hands on didnt do a hell of a lot of good not as far as i could see the bombers didnt linger very long after ten or fifteen minutes they droned away the marines and peterson emerged from their makeshift shelter a bomb had knocked over the old navy airship mooring mast the marines used for a control tower another had hit the enlisted mens barracks which the zeros had shot up the day before one end had fallen down and what was still standing was on fire and that second cup of coffee never got finished because the mess hall had taken a direct hit bombs had hit the asphalt x of the runways too if ewa had had any flyable planes they wouldnt have been able to get off the ground till the craters were repaired son of a bitch peterson said looking around at the devastation son of a bitch thats about the size of it agreed the captain whod taken charge of him the day before he hadnt been in the pool and peterson hadnt seen him at breakfast either by his drawn features he hadnt had any sack time the night before he went on you were talking about drawing a helmet and a rifle and making like a soldier were you serious about that hell yes peterson answered without hesitation but then he thought to ask how come about what youd expect the marine officer answered the japs are on the island lieutenant saburo shindo didnt much care for flying combat air patrol above the japanese task force as far as he was concerned that was a job for the float planes from the battleships and cruisers that had accompanied the aircraft carriers to hawaii but admiral nagumo had ordered differently and so shindo buzzed along with his engine throttled back to be as miserly with fuel as he could he would rather have been strafing the american soldiers on oahu and finishing the job of knocking out the us aircraft on the island but he was not the sort of man to protest orders when commander genda told him to take charge of the patrol hed just nodded and saluted and said aye aye sir in a way he could see the need theyd sunk one carrier but they thought three or even four had been based at pearl harbor if planes from any of those showed up at the wrong moment well life could get more interesting than shindo really wanted he preferred things to go according to plan his eyes darted now right now left now center he kept flicking them here and there if anything was in the sky to see he wanted to make sure he didnt miss it stare straight ahead all the time and even important things wouldnt register hed been flying for a couple of hours and almost dismissed the float plane off to the west as one of his countrymen but the lines werent quite right neither was the colorjapan seldom painted her aircraft that oceanic blue thats an american plane the words crackled in his earphones one of the other pilots had spotted it too then its seen us ill shoot it down no shindo said sharply no one is to shoot at that airplane until i do the rest of you continue on your normal patrol had another man given orders like that the fliers under him would have thought him out for glory out to run up his own score with lieutenant shindo that was unimaginable he gunned his zero toward the american plane the enemy pilot took awhile to spot him no doubt the americans were paying more attention to the ships spread out ahead of them that was their duty after all not until just before shindo fired a machinegun burst at him did they realize they had company only after the burst did the pilot turn toward the west and try to escape the radioman who also had charge of the rearfacing machine gun shot back at the zero shindo pulled back out of range as if afraid then he made a couple of feckless lunges at the float plane he fired each time but his bursts went wide what are you doing lieutenant one of the other fliers demanded for heavens sake finish him do you want him to get away no shindo said and said no more for a little while then he radioed the carriers enemy aircrafts bearing is i say again along that bearing we will find american ships and we may also find planes on the way to attack us he got no acknowledgment hed expected none even if the enemy had spotted them the carriers needed to maintain radio silence especially if a us carrier had launched against them now that he had the bearing he could end the little farce hed been playing out he felt proud hed been the one to get it here as well as from the wildcats near pearl harbor the day before he climbed and then dove the enemy gunner couldnt fire at him without shooting off his own tail shindo put several cannon shells into the float planes belly this held no sport it was simply killing a part of war the american plane tilted in the air smoke poured from it the pilot fought for controlfought and lost down toward the water he fell he and his gunner had both been brave and skillful flying a scout plane against the best carrierbased fighter in the world that hadnt helped them a bit the next question was twofold what could the task force throw at the us ships off to the west and what were the americans throwing at them commander mitsuo fuchida counted himself lucky if his nakajima bn hadnt come back to the akagi to refuel at just the right time he wouldnt have been able to join in the search for the newly suspected american ships the japanese air commander shook his head somewhere off to the west there were american ships they werent just suspected that float plane hadnt come from nowhere how many ships and of what sort remained to be seen but they were there as soon as the deck officer gave him the signal he gunned the bomber toward the akagi s bow there was as usual that sickening dip when the bomber went off the flight deck that moment of wondering whether it would splash into the sea instead of rising but rise it did fuchida took it up to join the rest of the scratch attack force admiral nagumo and commander genda were throwing together bns loaded with bombs bns with torpedoes slung beneath their fuselages aichi dive bombers and zeros to shepherd them along all mustered together fuchida was glad the zeros had longer range than most fighters theyd probably be able to protect the attack aircraft all the way to the target if the american plane had found the japanese fleet surely the japanese would be able to return the favor fuchida waited impatiently for planes to fly off the six japanese carriers and join the attacking force he was never one to like loiteringhe wanted to go out there and hit the enemy and the americans would not be idle if one or more of their carriers was with that force they would have launched as soon as they got word their scout had located the fleet that was punishing oahu after half an hour he radioed i am commencing the search and flew off to the west with the planes already in the air a timely attack with fewer aircraft was better than a great swarm that came too late somewhere north and west of kauai the enemy waited fortyfive minutes went by then one of the pilots with him exclaimed airplanes airplanes almost dead ahead almost dead ahead they were a little north of the course on which the japanese were flying as they got nearer fuchida saw they were about the same sort of force as the one he led torpedo planes and dive bombers with fighters flying cover those fat stubby fighters werent wildcats they had to be brewster buffaloes the us navys other carrierbased fighter planes wildcats had proved themselves no match for zeros what about buffaloes well find out fuchida thought oddnumbered zeros attack the us planes he ordered evennumbered zeros stay with our force as nine or ten zeros peeled off the sun shone brightly on the rising suns on their wings and fuselages some of the stumpy buffaloes turned to meet them fuchida sent a message back to the task force from size of enemy force estimate it comes from one carrier repeat from one carrier american fighters began tumbling in flames the buffaloes couldnt climb and dive with the zeros they couldnt turn as tightly either fuchida smiled he knew white men thought japan built junk but whose planes survived and whose spun helplessly toward the pacific junk was it then the zeros were in among the american attack aircraft the us torpedo bombers were simply sitting ducks too slow to run away and too poorly armed to fight back his own bns far outdid them zeros hacked down several in swift succession the dive bombers were better at both evading and defending themselves fuchida couldnt fault the american pilots courage hed seen that from the beginning but courage went only so far without skill and an adequate airplane under you courage was only likely to get you killed a handful of the brewster buffaloes tried to come after the japanese bombers and torpedo planes again the covering zeros had no trouble driving them off or shooting them down though they did damage one aichi dive bomber enough to make it turn back commander fuchida swung his planes a few degrees north of their previous course he also ordered them to spread out more widely to give themselves the best chance of finding the american ships they droned on somewhere out here in this vast ocean from the akagi s bridge commander minoru genda swept the western sky with field glasses fuchidas planes had crossed paths with the american attack force about fortyfive minutes after flying west that had been about fortyfive minutes before which meant the americans should find the japanese task force now more or less beside genda admiral nagumo looked thoroughly grimbut then nagumo usually looked that way this could prove very expensive he said genda shrugged yes sir he said he couldnt openly disagree with his superior but he went on we are as ready for the attack as we can be we have fighters overhead all the antiaircraft guns are manned the ships are tightly buttoned up we can give a good account of ourselves we have been very lucky so far when we wargamed this attack we thought we might well lose a couple of carriers as long as operation hawaii succeeds it will be worth it the twin lines between nagumos eyes got deeper easy for you to speak so lightly of losses commander this is not your task force genda looked down at his shoes for a moment accepting the rebuke a yeoman rushed onto the bridge destroyer tanikaze and combat air patrol report enemy aircraft in sight he exclaimed tanikaze right now was the westernmost of the destroyers screening the task force she would have sent the signal by blinker unless her captain disobeyed orders the planes had to use radio could the americans pick them up too late to worry about it nowno sooner had the yeoman spoken than black puffs of antiaircraft fire started filling the western sky now the anglosaxons will see what we can do genda said hai chuichi nagumo nodded heavily and we will also see what they can do so far they havent done much we can stop them genda said confidently the first glimpse he got of american planes was of the smoke and fire trailing from one as it splashed into the pacific all at once the akagi started maneuvering like a destroyer to make herself as difficult a target as she could the deck beneath gendas feet thrummed as the big ships engines went up to full power akagi s antiaircraft guns started firing genda couldnt see what they were shooting at but their crews had a much broader view of the action than he did he hoped they shot well all five other carriers were dodging too as were the supporting ships in the task force as far as genda was concerned the americans were welcome to go after destroyers or cruisers or even the two battleships that had sailed from hitokappu bay in the new calculus of naval warfare carriers were all that mattered bombs splashed down around one of those carriersgenda thought it was the kaga but he wasnt sure then amidst the tall columns of white water the near misses threw up he saw a swelling cloud of black smoke the ship was hit how badly he had no way to guess a dive bomber streaked off toward the west a zero hot on its tail that was an uneven contest the dive bomber did a flat roll and splashed into the sea but its crew had hurt their foes before falling commander genda nodded a salute to brave men somebody on the bridge screamed torpedo plane and pointed to starboard automatically gendas head whipped that way the us aircraft was plainly on its attack run zooming straight toward the akagi antiaircraft fire converged on it a zero dove towards it its pilot ignored all distractions he needed to be perfectly aligned to drop his torpedo and perfectly aligned he was genda watched the fish fall from the plane watched it dive into the pacific the japanese had had to expend a lot of sweat and engineering on their torpedoes to make sure they didnt go too deep and bury themselves in the mud under the lochs of pearl harbor here on the open ocean that mattered not a bit the american torpedo could dive as it pleased it would come up soon enough to strike not fifteen seconds after the torpedo plane launched its missile the zero shot it down that was of course fifteen seconds too late the akagi turned sharply to starboard to try to present the smallest possible surface to the torpedo some men on the bridge prayed others cursed some did both at once neither would do any good now everything depended on that american pilots aim genda gritted his teeth he feared the enemy flier had known exactly what he was doing and had done it well hed thrown his life away like a tensen coin to make sure he had the proper line which meant thump the impact echoed through the carrier but it was only a thump not the boom genda had tried to brace himself against a dud half a dozen men said it at once smiles of glad relief filled the bridge minoru genda laughed at himself maybe prayer had more to do with how things went than hed thought some kami watched over us there admiral nagumo said which amounted to the same thing another yeoman rushed onto the bridge bowing to nagumo he said sir kaga signals bomb damage from two hits toward the stern it would have been much worse her captain says if the hangar deck hadnt been empty of planes nagumo and genda and everyone else who heard that nodded planes waiting to take off were fires waiting to happen and like the rest of the carriers the kaga had already used up a lot of the munitions shed brought to hawaii that helped make her less inflammable too nagumo asked does she still have power what speed can she make genda added can she land planes nagumo a biggun admiral down to his toes would not think of a question like that but nagumo was the taskforce commander and the yeoman answered him first sir the engine room has taken some damage but she can make fifteen knots the engineers are doing all they can with repairs having said that the rating turned and bowed to genda there is damage on the flight deck sir right now the ship cannot land planes again the crew does hope to make repairs and keep her battleworthy tell them to do all they can until we seize airstrips on oahu we have to have our flight decks clear genda said saluting the yeoman hurried back to the blinker the action seemed over a few escort vessels were still firing but genda couldnt see that they had any targets the american planes that had attacked the task force had either gone down or fled admiral nagumo spoke in wondering tones all this fighting and we have yet to set eyes on an enemy ship true sir genda nodded he could hardly blame nagumo for his surprise there had never been a naval battle fought beyond gunnery range before not in all the history of the world after a moment he went on the americans havent seen our ships either that doesnt mean we cant hurt them hai thats true too nagumo still sounded surprised commander mitsuo fuchida stared out across the pacific more than anything else he wanted to be the man who spotted the americans flotilla so he thought anyway till another flier shouted out that he saw ships then fuchida discovered that hed been wrong discovering the enemy was all very well destroying him was more important look for the carrieror maybe carriers he radioed to the pilots in the bombers and dive bombers and torpedo planes worry about other ships only after youve wrecked the carrier force bombers line up behind your leaders in training for the attack on pearl harbor the japanese had discovered that most of their highaltitude bombardiers were not very accurate they had not had the time to train them all up to the same standard instead theyd assigned the best crews as leaders and had the others follow them precisely and bomb just where they had that had dramatically improved their percentage of hits now they would try it again there a pilots voice cracked with excitement that ship is launching planes for a moment fuchida didnt see them then the glint of sun off metal or glass drew his eye toward the enemy planes tiny in the distance yes the ship that was launching them had a flight deck but she also had smooth almost rakish lines that showed the hull had originally been intended for a battleship or battle cruiser the akagi and the kaga were the same sort of conversion the americans if fuchida remembered rightly had started the lexington and the saratoga as battlewagons before changing their minds which one was that down below he shrugged it hardly mattered now that the japanese had spotted her they had to hit her he and his comrades had been spotted too the ships around the carrier started throwing up antiaircraft fire most of them began taking evasive action the carrier stayed headed into the wind so she could go on sending up planes that made her easier to pick out from the others each groupattack the target fuchida ordered fighters accompany the torpedo planes they were the ones that had to fly low and straight they most needed fighter protection fuchida went on lead bombersline up on the enemy carrier he was a lead bomber himself he used the voice tube to ask his bombardier how he should set the bombers course five degrees to the left sir the man said at once and then half a minute later another five degrees fuchida obeyed with machinelike precision for the time being he was not his own man only an extension of the bombardiers will tracers climbed from the ships below reaching for his plane flak burst in black clouds some of the explosions came close enough to shake the bomber making it rise and dip in the air he was flying straight and level which gave the gunners a splendid target he kept on even so the mission was all that mattered then the bn leaped again bombs gone the bombardier cried exultantly the bombardiers flying behind fuchida would do their best to launch their bomb loads from the same spot as he had now the bomber was his again he could speed up slow down jink dive or climb to evade the ferocious antiaircraft fire coming up from the pacific and he could pay attention to the rest of the attack on the carrier down tumbled the bombs till they disappeared against the background of the ocean zeros and buffaloes were dueling at lower altitude several planes aimed straight for the carriers those would be the bns with their torpedoes one of them caught fire and crashed then anothershot down no doubt by american fighters the rest bored in on the enemy ship bombs began bursting around the carrier was that a hit commander fuchida couldnt be sure the big ship dodged desperately she didnt seem to be slowing down if any of the bombs had struck home they hadnt done much damage fuchidas curses made his disappointment echo in the cockpit where were the aichi das the dive bombers shouldnt miss especially when the enemy fighters were pulled down toward the sea battling zeros and attacking torpedo planes that gave the aichis a free run at the target just about all the bombs from the highaltitude bombers had fallen now fuchida had thought some of them hit the splashes couldnt have come closer to the carrier but she emerged from those columns of water still twisting and dodging at top speed hitting a moving target from four kilometers up wasnt easy we should have done it though fuchida bit his lip in mortification without warning the carrier staggered as a man might after an unexpected blow to the face a plume of water rose from her port side hit fuchida screamed unable to hold in his delight thats a torpedo hit the american carrier slowed to a crawl the aichis chose that moment to dive on her the pilots in those planes were the best japan had theyd been training for months when they struck they didnt miss bombs burst all around the carrierand on her flight deck too banzai the fiercely joyous cry burst from mitsuo fuchida banzai banzai a moment later he remembered his duty and radioed back to the japanese task force enemy carrier heavily damaged black smoke rising i can see flame through it she is listing to port more and more as i watch she lies almost dead in the water now he switched to the frequency the fliers used anyone who still has bombs use them against the american battleships or cruisers only a few bombs fell hed expected nothing different the carrier was the main target and the japanese had devoted most of their effort to wrecking her schwerpunkt the germans called the point of concentration the fliers had done what they had to do fuchida circled over the carrier like a vulture over a dying ox the list stabilized some alert engineer must have begun counterflooding but that only meant she sank on an even keel instead of rolling over no more than half an hour went by from the first torpedo hit to the moment she slid beneath the waves one of the battleships or cruisers down there was on fire the japanese might not have had much to throw at the carriers escorts but theyd done damage fuchida radioed the news to his carriers he eyed the fuel gauge it was getting low noit had got low where his was low some of the others would be lower time to head back to the task force yes theyd done what needed doing lieutenant fletcher armitage supposed he was lucky to be alive that was about as much luck as he could find in the situation he shook his head wearily one hand scrabbled through his pockets looking for a pack of cigarettes he found it he still had his gun too compared to what a lot of his fellow artillerymen had gone through he was a lucky fellow he pulled out the chesterfields he couldnt come up with a zippo or matches but that didnt matter he sprawled in front of a little fire somewhere not far south of haleiwa he got the cigarette going from that and sucked harsh smoke into his lungs can i scrounge one of those off you lieutenant asked a sergeant who sounded every bit as exhausted as fletch felt why the hell not fletch held out the pack thanks the sergeant lit his cigarette too in the red flickering firelight he looked as if he hadnt slept for a week that was impossible as he proceeded to prove was it just yesterday morning when the japs started jumping on us yeah out of somewhere deep inside him fletch dredged up a raspy chuckle time flies when youre having fun doesnt it boy no kidding the sergeant took another drag and blew out a cloud of smoke i never figured wed get up to waimea bay and then i never figured wed get off the goddamn beach either thats about the size of it armitage agreed nobody ever said anything about what a high old time you have when the other bastards got air support and you dont the japs had strafed the detachment twice more on the way up to waimea bay by the time they were done hardly any trucks would still move that reduced the army to going on foot or commandeering cars from motorists coming up kamehameha highway motorists who had no idea there was a war on till they drove straight into it some of them hadnt been very happy about giving up their automobiles rifles and bayonets though turned out to be mighty good persuaders pack as many soldiers into a car as it would holdand then a couple of moreand tie a cannon to the rear bumper and you could go the cars motor and transmission and suspension might not be worth much afterwards but who gave a damn of course bomb craters and the wrecks of shotup cars in the road north hadnt made things any easier and they were coming up past the dole plantation where the pineapples grew right to the side of the road getting by on the shoulder wasnt easy because most places there wasnt any shoulder to speak of some of the workers in the fields were filipinos fletch hadnt worried about them they were on his side but what about the japs who stared impassively at the army men from under their broadbrimmed straw hats what were they thinking he couldnt tell all he knew was he didnt want to turn his back on them maybe that was foolishness maybe they were as american as hot dogs and apple pie and maybe he didnt feel like taking chances just in case they werent nobodyd counted on having to do part of the way from schofield barracks to waimea bay in the dark now that armitage looked back on it nobodyd counted on quite a few things almost all the drills hed been through had made the unconscious assumption that everything would go pretty much according to plan when things turned out not to go that way a lot of people had no idea what to do next fletch smoked his chesterfield down to a tiny little butt then crushed it out he laughed not that there was anything much to laugh about things were going according to plan all right the only trouble was the plan had been drawn up in tokyo not honolulu or washington somewhere up ahead a machine gun fired off a burst it wasnt an american machine gun it sounded different of its own accord fletchs hand started for the on his right hip it aint so bad sir when you hear shit going off ahead of you the sergeant said when its on your flank thats when youve got to look out for your ass armitage considered that after a moment he nodded makes sense he laughed again this time with something approaching genuine amusement remember those two goddamn beach bums stuck in the water between us and the japs im not likely to forget em the sergeant answered poor sons of bitches didnt know whether to shit or go blind caught between the devil and the deep blue sea was what fletch had been thinking but it boiled down to the same thing and the surfriders had been on the deep blue sea with the americans and the japs both shooting at them and past them at each other he didnt know how theyd missed getting chopped into hamburger but they had theyd even managed to disappear in their jalopy there were plenty of times over the past day when fletch wished he could have done the same he supposed the main reason the beach bums were still breathing was that japanese planes had come overhead just then getting bombed and strafed had distracted the americans from the surfridersand rather more to the point from the barges full of japs wallowing toward shore just then had all the americans been in position as planned and had the japs not been plastering them from the skies they would have massacred the invaders before the barges ever got to the beaches as things were as things were theyd done their best theyd hurt the japs fletch had planted a shell right on a barge carrying a field gun and watched it turn turtle but a japanese bomb had upended the gun right next to his and blown its whole crew to red rags while a strafing fighter coming in at treetop height had put more artillerymen out of action and then the japanese soldiers had got onto the beach that wasnt supposed to happen in all the drills the invaders were repelled whoeverd worked out those drills had been an optimist the japs got on the beach and then they were running up off the beach shooting rifles and light machine guns and whatever else they had with them theyd even had a tank or two clatter down off a big barge their tanks didnt look very impressivethey werent a patch on the ms the fortyfirst tank company at schofield barracks had but they were where they needed to be and the ms werent machinegun bullets bounced off them their cannons were popguns but they could take care of machinegun nests and shell unprotected field guns and fletch had discovered it was damned hard to hit a moving target with a mm gun he lit another chesterfield god only knew where hed get more after the pack was empty but hed worry about that later now he needed the smoke we did everything we could he said i really think we did he sounded dazed and disbelieving even to himself yeah the sergeant nodded i guess maybe we did it wasnt enough though those fuckers are on the island now how the hell we gonna kick em off beats me armitage yawned all i know is im falling asleep sitting up go ahead lieutenant ill shake you in a couple of hours so i can get some shuteye too the noncom said or maybe ill shake you sooner in case we gotta fall back again he didnt say anything about shaking fletch if the americans started advancing plainly he didnt think they would fletch knew he should have reproved him but he didnt think the americans would start advancing in the middle of the night either they hadnt quite come to pieces when the japs got ashore but some of them had sure retreated at a pace faster than a walk yawning again fletch finished the cigarette and stretched out by the fire back on the mainland it would be cold a lot of places it would be snowing he didnt even worry about a blanket here he closed his eyes and let sleep club him over the head he didnt know how much hed had when a hard hand on his shoulder prodded him back to consciousness he did know it wasnt nearly enough what the hell he asked muzzily he felt slow and stupid almost drunk sorry sir the sergeant didnt sound very sorry theres shit going on off to our left if the japs turn our flank and get on the road behind us were screwed fletch finished for him the sergeant nodded the fire had died down to crimson embers barely enough to let fletch make out the other mans face if the japs got on the road behind them they might escape through the fields their precious gun though would be lost right now fletch wouldnt have parted with that gun for all the gold in fort knox he didnt know how many others were left he didnt know for sure if any others around here were left okay he said well pull back what they had to pull back with was a de soto taken at gunpoint from a japanese family out for a drive compared to the snorting truck that had hauled the gun partway north it was ridiculously underpowered but compared to a horse or a dozen poor bloody infantrymen it was a miracle of rare device the miracles engine coughed into life when fletch turned the key he wondered if the noise would bring a volley of gunfire his way but it didnt shells as long as a mans arm clattered and clanked on the floorboards the car couldnt pull the gun and the limber both artillerymen put their feet on the ammo as fletch put the de soto in gear he tried not to think about what would happen if a jap fieldpiece hit the car boom right to the moon was what occurred to him he reached for the light switch then jerked his hand away as if the switch were redhot now that would have been phi beta kappa the japs are trying to kill you fletcher my boy he muttered you dont have to try and kill yourself too he couldnt go faster than about ten miles an hour not if he wanted to stay on the road of course even ten miles an hour would have taken him all the way down to the south coast in a little more than two hours he didnt get that far or anywhere close after ten minutes or so he came to a roadblock manned by some nervous infantrymen they seemed glad to see he had the gunand even gladder that he wasnt a jap fletch was pretty goddamn glad they werent japs too only he did his best not to let on he and his men piled out of the de soto and added the gun to the roadblocks strength by sunup if not sooner he figured hed be in action again martial law shouted posters all over honolulu jiro takahashi didnt read english his sons made sure he understood it means the armys in charge kenzo said at breakfast monday morning it means you have to do whatever soldiers tell you to do it means were going to land in trouble for being japanese hiroshi added when have we not been in trouble for being japanese jiro asked if his son was bitter so was he they attacked the united states they hit us when we werent even looking kenzo sounded furiously angry at japan jiro felt furiously angry at his younger son kenzo had everything backwards as far as jiro was concerned japan was we and the americans were they jiro looked to his wife for support he didnt have to look far for reiko the tiny kitchen of their cramped apartment barely held the four of them reiko just said eat your noodles all of you drink your tea whether its war or whether its peace work doesnt stop youve got to go to the sampan she was right her refusal to come right out and take jiros side left him punctured anyway shed been born in oshima county just as he had her home village was only about fifteen miles from his surely she felt as japanese as he did what difference did it make that theyd lived in hawaii for decades and probably never would go back to the old country nonenot as far as he could see but reiko didnt want to quarrel with the boys no matter how foolishly they behaved hashi flying jiro finished the soba noodles hed been surprised to discover there were americans who ate buckwheat groats but he didnt know of any who made them into noodles he drank some of the hot water in which the noodles were boiled it was supposed to be very healthy and he gulped his tea then he jumped to his feet he barked at his sons come on we havent got all day to his dismay they got done no more than a few seconds after he did when they rose they loomed over him how could he feel he was in charge when he had to look up at them to tell them anything but all hiroshi said was were ready father down to the street they went when they got there jiro coughed as if hed smoked a pack of camels all at once horrible choking black smoke swirled through the air for all he could see it might as well have been nighttime the smoke made his eyes burn and sting too it left greasy soot everywhere it touched his sons made almost identical disgusted noises they pulled bandannas out of their pocketshiroshis red kenzos blueand tied them over their mouths that struck jiro as a good idea all he had was a dirty white handkerchief he used it everything would be dirty in short order maybe the hankie kept some of the nasty smoke out of his lungs he could hope so anyhow the streets were crowded it was monday morning after all but people moved as if in slow motion in the black stinking murk you had to otherwise youd get run into on the sidewalk or run over in the street cars had their lights on but the beams didnt pierce more than a few feet of haze go to hell you goddamn japs somebody yelled in english jiro understood the sentiment well enough he squared his shoulders and kept walking above the bandannas his sons eyes blazed he wasnt even sure the curses had been aimed at them they were far from the only japanese on the streets a lot of intersections had policemen posted to keep traffic moving honolulus cops sprang from every group in the islands haoles hawaiians chinese japanese filipinos koreans which jiro found revolting but koreans werent subject to japanese authority here normally the police got obeyed because they were the police now people who werent japanese swore at the japanese copsand sometimes if they were ignorant at the chinese and koreans too when the cursers guessed wrong the policemen angrily shouted back stoic as samurai the officers who were japanese ignored whatever came their way some of the intersections that didnt have cops had soldiers they wore helmets and carried bayoneted rifles and looked nervous enough to shoot or skewer anybody who rubbed them the wrong way they were cursing japanese as loudly as any civilians jiro pretended not to hear arguing with armed men struck him as suicidal madness his sons muttered to themselves but not loud enough to draw notice the aala market was half deserted that shook jiro he hadnt thought anything could keep the dealers away only the smell of fish lingered at full strength he and hiroshi and kenzo went on to kewalo basin but more soldiers waited along with a few fishermen whod arrived ahead of the takahashis some of them the younger ones were talking with the soldiers in english jiros sons joined the discussion after a little while hiroshis voice rose in anger one of the soldiers aimed a rifle at his chest jiro sprang forward to push his son out of harms way but hiroshi took a step back on his own and the soldier lowered the springfield he and hiroshi went on speaking english not quite so furiously whats going on jiro asked the soldier scowled at him probably for speaking japanese he ignored the man it was the only language he could speak and he needed to know we cant go out hiroshis voice was hard and flat what why not jiro exclaimed how are we supposed to make a living if we cant go out are the americans crazy as he always did he used the word to label other people it didnt apply to him or as far as he was concerned to his family we cant go out because the army doesnt trust us hiroshi answered it doesnt trust any japanese didnt you see that yesterday when the airplane shot up that other sampan it could have been us just as easily the soldiers are afraid well go out and tell the japanese navy whats going on here or maybe that well go out and bring back japanese soldiers thats jiros voice trailed away he couldnt say it was mad or impossible for it was neither he hadnt thought about actually helping japan against the united states but the idea didnt disgust him maybe some other fishermen had thought about it how could he know if they had they would have kept their mouths shut that was only common sense and some sampans bigger than the oshima maru could range out five hundred miles maybe even more they could surely find the imperial navy they could bring back soldiers too if their skippers were so inclined if a boat could carry tons of fish it could also carry tons of men and each ton was ten or twelve fully equipped soldiers thats an insult thats what it is kenzo said im loyal youre loyal were all loyal he raised his voice were all loyal then he spoke in english probably repeating the same thing the fishermen nodded some of them said hai others said yes more protests in english followed for all the good those protests did the japanese men might have been talking to a bunch of stones the american soldiers glared at them and shook their heads one an older man with stripes on his sleeve made pushing noises with both hands go away he was saying even jiro had no trouble understanding that fishermen who spoke english kept arguing jiro started to turn away he saw they could argue till they turned blue in the face without persuading the men in uniform then another soldier ran up shouting something in english jiro could make out japs but nothing more all the soldiers exclaimed some of them hotly so did the fishermen what does he say jiro asked most of the time not knowing english didnt bother him every once in a while he felt the lack grimly kenzo answered he says japanese soldiers have landed on the northern beaches weve been invaded oh jiro took the news in stride its part of war neh if america could she would invade japan wouldnt she but as he knew very well america couldnt if that didnt show which country was mightier his sons didnt seem to see it like that they both turned away from him hiroshi said im not going to translate that for the soldiers father and youre lucky im not too or wed all end up in trouble kenzo added this is our country we were born here we like it here we dont want anything to do with japan now that shes at war with us another fisherman a weathered fellow of jiros generation named tetsuo yuge shouted angrily at the two younger takahashis how dare you talk to your father like that if my boys were that rude id be ashamed of myselfand of them jiro wondered what the other fishermans sons would say if they were here one of them worked at a gas station the other was a bank clerk they thought of themselves as americans too tetsuo had complained about it jiro said war makes everybody crazy for a while sooner or later things will straighten out several of the tall american soldiers put their heads together when they separated the man with stripes on his sleeves shouted in english some of the younger men the ones who understood what he was telling them started to walk off kenzo translated he says we have to leave he says this place is offlimits for civilians thats army talkit means were not allowed here can he do that jiro asked doubtfully he didnt like the idea of leaving the oshima maru tied up where soldiers who hated japanese could do whatever they wanted to her but both his sons nodded hiroshi said its martial law if the soldiers say we have to do it we have to do it the only ones who can change things now are other soldiers this would never have happened if japan hadnt jumped on us kenzo said what are we going to do without a days catch what are we going to do without a days pay jiro asked and how long will the soldiershe almost said the american soldiers but judged that would cause more trouble than it was worthkeep us from going to sea what will we do for money if its a long time those were good questions important questions jiro knew that neither of his sons had any answers he didnt see what else they could do but go back home reiko would have a lot of questions for them then jiro didnt have any answers either jane armitage was glad theyd called off school for the day in wahiawa half the kids in her thirdgrade class were japs they were bright and eager they were respectful and they mostly worked harder than haoles but she didnt think she could stand the sight of so many slantyeyed faces right now shed had a devil of a time getting used to what people in hawaii looked like when she came over with fletch columbus ohio wasnt like this at all in columbus the negroes mostly stayed in bronzeville on the east side of town elsewhere even italians were out of the ordinary her own blond blueeyed good looks were as normal as sunshine not here hawaii was different coarse black hair and swarthy skin were the expected she was the one who stood out when she caught herself wondering how fletch was doing she grimaced without the war she wouldnt have given a damn without the war she would have just waved byebye if he jumped off a cliff but she didnt want the japs blowing him up even for her that went too far she wondered if he was sober if he wasnt hed be sorry if he was hed be in the war and he might be sorry anyway shit jane said crisply inside the apartment she no longer shared with him whod hear her swear bright sunlight streamed in through the window it would be another warm daynot hot for it probably wouldnt get to eighty but warm tonight it would drop into the sixties which was as cold as it ever got columbus might have snow on the ground jane hadnt needed any time at all to get used to the weather the window was open why not when the air was the sweetest in the world but along with the smells of flowers that bloomed all year around the stink of smoke came in today the japs had jumped on wheeler field and then on schofield barracks with both feet by what the breeze said some of those fires were still burning and what the japs had done to pearl harbor the smoke in the south blotted out a big part of the sky it reached up toward the sun and looked so very thick and menacing it might bring down night at noon if it climbed high enough to blot out the source of light and warmth after lighting a cigarette jane turned on the radio a fancy set fletch had bought with money that could have been better spent elsewhere so jane had thought at the time anyhow now she did some more swearing when the ordinary bands brought in nothing but silence and static the hawaiian stations were still off the air then she switched to the shortwave tuner shed never dreamt how desperately she could crave news from the outside world as she turned the dial she got more static in snarling bursts and then a man speaking a language she didnt understanditalian she thought or possibly spanish whoever he was he sounded full of himself and also full of hot air jane spun the dial some more she got a squawky singsong oriental language next and then a program of dance music that could have come from almost anywhere on the planet music wasnt what she was after now though the next station she found featured somebodyhitler bellowing in german she understood some german shed studied it at ohio state but this fellow used a dialect she had trouble following and he was going a mile a minute all she could do was pick up a word here and there she gave the dial another twist english at last a strong new yorkaccented voice said twelvethirty this afternoon president roosevelt asked congress to declare war against the empire of japan he called december seventh the date of the japs unprovoked attack against pearl harbor in the territory of hawaii a date which will live in infamy jane looked at a clock on the mantel it was half past eight here washington was five and a half hours ahead of hawaii time so the president had spoken about an hour and a half before swift congressional approval of the request is expected the announcer went on there are rumors that the japs are trying to land soldiers in the hawaiian islands but these are so far unconfirmed if they prove correct it is expected that the soldiers of the hawaiian department will drive the invaders into the sea theyd better jane exclaimed she thought about her not former enough husband and his friends all of whom drank too much she thought about the stories they told of their ignorant inept enlisted men she thought about how they always complained the government didnt spend enough money on paper clips let alone on important things and she thought about how they were going to be the ones who threw the japs back into the sea she started worrying in earnest then outrage continues pouring in around the country at the dastardly japanese deed the newscaster said jane had never heard anyone actually use the word dastardly before it sounded like bastardly which sure as hell fit the situation the newsman went on yammering about japanese attacks in the philippines and other places she couldnt have found without a big rand mcnally to give her a hand then he talked about what the germans were doing in russia it sounded as if the russians were trying to counterattack but it had sounded like that before and hitlers troops were in the suburbs of moscow jane turned off the radio and did the breakfast dishes there werent many shed had cornflakes and a glass of apple juice even so she paused with the bon amisoaked dishrag the cereal and the juice both came from the mainland if the japs really were trying to invade oahu how would ships from the states get here how much food did hawaii have on its own how much could it grow if it had to she laughed how much pineapple and sugarcane can we eat that wasnt a joke hawaii grew more pineapple than any other place in the world and lots and lots of sugarcane but because the territory grew so much cane and pineapple it didnt grow a whole lot of anything else off to the west antiaircraft guns started booming janes mouth twisted into a sour grimace that she could tell they were antiaircraft guns proved shed spent too much time with fletch armitage field guns had a different reportdeeper and more prolongedand didnt fire so quickly what could fletch tell about anything that mattered to her not a thing not as far as she could tell all that mattered to him were guns and booze and the bedroomand he hadnt been nearly so good there as he thought he had muttering to herself she finished the dishes the thought that had come to her while she was washing the cereal bowl wouldnt go away maybe a trip to the grocery would be smart to stock up on things just in case she wished wahiawa had a piggly wiggly the way honolulu did you could do all your shopping in one trip at the supermarket with a corner grocery you were never sure ahead of time what theyd have and what they wouldnt and japs ran most of them shed learned not to give that a second thought now she was going to have to unlearn it again things had changed exactly how theyd changed well shed just have to wait and see a quarter to nine was too early to go to the store there was another reason to wish for a piggly wiggly stores like that opened earlier and stayed open later than little family businesses she spent an hour or so cleaning the apartment that was all it needed keeping it clean was a lot easier with fletch gone the army was supposed to have made him neat but it had fallen down on the job or maybe it was just that while he lived with her he expected her to do all the work and he didnt care how much it was whatever it was she was glad to be out from under it when she did come out trundling a little metal folding grocery cart behind her she found the streets of wahiawa full of soldiers since the town was right next door to two divisions of army men that wasnt the biggest surprise in the world but they usually came here to get drunk or get laid or pawn something for the cash they needed to get drunk or get laid these werent men on leave out for a good time they wore the steel derbies that made them look like british soldiers from the great war and carried rifles with fixed bayonets and they had the air of men who knew damn well they were doing something important and something that might be dangerous jane was glad shed chosen to walk the soldiers were setting up roadblocks and barricades in the streets which snarled traffic to a faretheewell horns blared what the hell are you doing a fat middleaged man shouted from behind the wheel of his ford a sergeant who usually dealt with a swarm of privates had no trouble putting one mouthy civilian in his place what are we doing he echoed were making sure you dont get your stupid ass shot off thats what and this is the thanks we get the horse you rode in on too buddy he spat in magnificent contempt the fat man deflated like a leaky balloon jane had all she could do not to giggle years as an army wife had acquainted her with the talents of sergeants this one turned back to his men they hadnt missed a beat as soon as they had their barricade finished they hauled a cannon up behind it it wasnt one of the bigger guns fletch dealt with but an antitank weapon seeing its snout pointing north gave jane pause when she got to the grocery store she discovered she wasnt the only one whod had the same idea the line stretched out the door some of the women in it were haoles others japanese or chinese or filipino though there were just a couple of the latter most of the filipinos on oahu were men brought in to work in the fields they sometimes brawled because they didnt have enough women to go aroundor got into knife fights over the ones there were or over fighting cocks or over nothing in particular jane didnt have much use for filipinos two japanese women right in front of her chattered in their own language shed heard japanese almost every day since coming to hawaii she took it as much for granted as the perfect weather or the funny birds or the palm trees she had taken it for granted anyhow now she eyed the women suspiciously what were they saying what were they thinking if the japs got this faralmost inconceivable but for the soldiers in the streetswhat would they do the white housewife who came out of the store was loaded down with so many groceries she could hardly walk she gave the japanese women a hard stare goddamn lousy japs she said and trudged on they plainly understood english they stared after her their flat narroweyed faces unreadable at least to jane for close to a minute neither of them said anything in any language then they started speaking againin japanese jane didnt know whether to want to applaud them or kick them in the teeth by the time she got into the grocery store it looked as if a swarm of locusts had been there ahead of her and so they have she thought and im another one she bought canned vegetables and spam and yams and potatoes and crackerseverything she could think of that would keep for a while well almost everything try as she would she couldnt make herself get a sack of rice other haoles werent so fussy jane shrugged she liked potatoes better anyhow she bought toilet paper and kleenex and soap too she brought her cart up to mr hasegawa he totaled everything up not on a cash register but with a pencil on the back of an old envelope twenty dallah fotytree cent he said at the end of his calculations on impulse she asked him what do you think of all this his face closed down the same way those of the japanese women outside the store had very bad he said at last we have war where get more groceries that undoubtedly wasnt a tenth of what was on his mind but it wasnt far removed from what jane and the other panic shoppers were thinking either she set a twenty and a one on the counter the storekeeper gave her a halfdollar a nickel and two pennies she bumped her little cart out of the grocery store and headed home one of the soldiers manning the antitank gun sent a wolf whistle after her she ignored him which only made him laugh getting mad at themletting them see you were mad at themjust encouraged them fletch had been right about that what else had fletch been right about jane angrily shook her head no matter how much her intheprocessofbecomingexhusband had known about soldiers and artillery pieces he hadnt known a goddamn thing about being a husband if hed been married to anything it was the army not her she looked back at the soldiers she looked south at the appalling black smoke rising from pearl harborand west at the smaller smoke clouds from wheeler field and schofield barracks all shed done to fletch was throw him out of the apartment when she couldnt stand living with him another minute being married to the army was liable to get him killed fletcher armitage stuck a fresh fiveround clip in his springfield and worked the bolt to chamber the first cartridge he wanted something that would hit from farther away than he could throw a rock he still had the officers on his hip but he hadnt used it for a day or two the soldier whod been issued the rifle wouldnt miss it a japanese shell had cut him in half the roadblock south of haleiwa to which hed added his gun hadnt held the japanese for long they hadnt come straight at it he could have slaughtered a million of them if they had instead theyd gone around through the cane and pineapple fields the bastards were like water or mercury they flowed through the tiniest gaps in the american lineand came out shooting on the other side he still had the mm gun he still had the de soto that hauled it too the windshield had been shot out of it a bullet hole went through both rear doors the round hadnt gone through any of the men in the back seat fletch didnt know why it hadnt maybe god was on his side after all but if he was why had he turned so many japs loose on oahu a bullet from off to the left cracked past his head and ricocheted off the barrel of the field gun he ducked automatically and much too late he had no idea whether the bullet was american or japanese if many more came from that direction though hed have to pull up stakes and fall back again if he could if he couldnt hed fall back without it and take along the breech block so the japs couldnt turn the piece around and start shooting it at his side more shooting did come from off to the left but most of it came from two american machine guns they fired noticeably faster than their japanese counterparts maybe the japs instead of flowing through a hole had walked into a buzz saw this time fletchs lips skinned back from his teeth in a savage grin jesus he hoped so and so it seemed for the shooting moved farther north my god one of the artillerymen said wearily i didnt think them slantyeyed fuckers knew how to back up i dont think theyre doing it on purpose i think were doing it to them theres a difference fletch said the artilleryman paused in the act of lighting up a cigarette long enough to nod a wildeyed foot soldier burst out of the cane to the left of the kamehameha highway half a dozen men around the gun swung their rifles toward him he didnt seem to notice how close a brush with death hed just had all he did seem to notice was the single silver bar on each of fletcher armitages shoulders thank god he said an officer what the hell fletch said most of the time enlisted men wanted nothing to do with officers they hoped their superiors would leave them alone when a pfc actually came looking for a first lieutenant something was rotten in the state of denmark sir come with me please the pfc sounded close to tears theres something you need to see what is it fletch asked the soldier shook his head you got to see it sir christ almighty he gulped as if fighting his stomach fletch had already seen much more than he ever wanted to war was nothing like the sanitized version the army had got ready for in the drills on the mainland and around schofield barracks people didnt just get killed they got blown to pieces they got chopped to shreds they got holes punched through themnot neat tidy holes but ones that pouredoften gushedblood fletch had smelled shit and burnt meat sometimes from the same wounded man hed heard shrieks that would haunt him as long as he livedwhich didnt look like being long by the pfcs grime and the stubble on his chin hed been fighting from the very beginning of this mess how could he not have seen and smelled and heard the same kinds of things as fletch had how could he not be getting hardened to what war did what hed seen just now though had shaken him to the core which meant that either he was shellshocked or that it was going to shake fletch to the core too for his own sake fletch rooted for shell shock but he went into the cane field with the soldier stalks rustled bugs chirped one of them lit on him he brushed it away trying to walk as softly as he could eddie the pfc called cradling his springfield you there eddie wish to hell i wasnt another soldier answered from not far ahead you find an officer bill a lieutenant the pfcbillsaid damning with faint praise bring him on eddie didnt seem inclined to be fussy im with poor goddamn wilbur aint no japs aroundnow following bill fletch pushed the last little way through the cane eddie was a stocky swarthy private who looked straight out of hells kitchen or some other equally charming slum he stood guard over a corpse the dead mans hands were tied behind his back which fletch saw first bill said jap bastards caught poor wilbur alive go on around sir take a look at what they done to him i dont want to do this i really dont want to do this went through fletchs mind eight or ten thousand times as he took the four or five steps that let him see what the japanese had done to the american soldier theyd captured and he was right he was righter even than hed imagined fuck he said softly the most reverent prayerful obscenity hed ever heard theyd bayoneted wilbur again and again in the chest and in the bellybut not in the left side of the chest because that might have pierced his heart and killed him faster than they wanted to and after he was dead fletch hoped like hell it was after he was dead theyd yanked down his trousers cut off his penis and stuffed it into his mouth and they must have been proud of their handiwork too because theyd stuck a piece of cardboard by his head on it one of them had written in english he take long time die fuck fletch said again what do you need me for what do we do with him sir eddie sounded like a lost kid not at all like a tough guy bury him fletch answered at once his mouth running ahead of his brain his wits caught up a moment later bury him and for christs sake dont tell anybody just what happened to him but spread the word you really dont want the japs to take you alive eddie and bill both nodded yes sir they said together seeming relieved somebody was telling them what to do then bill asked what about the geneva convention sir i dont know what about it fletch pointed to the mutilated degraded remnant of what had been a man how much do you think the japs care about it why dont you ask wilbur here they both flinched what do we do if we catch one of them that was eddie fletch looked down at the dead american soldier again he knew what he was supposed to say what came out of his mouth was whatever you do dont come asking an officer beforehand you hear me yes sir where nothing else had that got bill and eddies enthusiastic approval iv while at annapolis lieutenant jim peterson had taken a lot of military history back around the time of christ he remembered the roman empire had tried to conquer the germans that looked like a damn good idea nowadays too bad it hadnt worked augustus sent three legions into the middle of germany under a bungling general and they didnt come back the emperor howled quintilius varus give me back my legions peterson felt like howling general short give me back my airplanes yes the japs had sunk the enterprise and the lexington but theyd both gone down swinging theyd shot down enemy planes a couple of surviving pilots claimed the lexington s aircraft had nailed an enemy carrier maybe even two but the army before the japs struck the army had lined up its fighters and bombers wingtiptowingtip scuttlebutt said the illustrious general short had been scared of saboteurs peterson didnt give a damn about scuttlebutt what short had done was set up the bowling pins and when the japs did show up they knocked just about every one of them down not that the navy came off smelling like a rose there was plenty of blame to go around as far as peterson could tell looking back on it admiral kimmels decision to have most of the pacific fleet in port every weekend seemed something less than brilliant if hirohitos boys had somebody keeping an eye on pearl harborand anybody with two brain cells to rub together would havetheyd spot the pattern licketysplit and again the usa paid because the japanese were on the ball when its own top officers werent peterson also wondered why the hell neither the army nor the navy had spotted the enemy carriers before they launched their planes someone should have been looking off to the north that was the logical direction for the japs to pick if they were crazy enough to attack the united states at all peterson hadnt thought they would be crazy the slanteyed bastards were raking in the chips shows how goddamn smart i am he muttered inside the pearl harbor boq where hed gone from ewa it was at the moment a tent city japanese bombs had blown the original structure to hell and gone why this is hell nor am i out of it peterson had taken english lit too lines like that stuck in the mind as firmly as augustus anguished cry this one was a pretty good description of what things were like at pearl harbor right now everybody wore gauze of some sort over his nose and mouth despite the americans best efforts to douse the flames the fueltank farm still burned a week after it was bombed noxious smoke filled the air it got on everything and everybody and made men look as if they were in blackface for a minstrel show distant thunder came from off to the north the only trouble was that wasnt thunder it was an artillery duel the japs versus the us army again scuttlebutt was the only way to get a handle on what was happening if you werent at the front on the rare occasions the radio said anything it belched out optimistic twaddle that made peterson want to puke he knew bullshit when he heard it gossip and rumor said the americans were falling back the way the distant thunder didnt seem quite so distant argued that gossip and rumor knew what they were talking about they also said you didnt want to try to surrender to the japs peterson didnt know about that hed talked to people whod talked to people whod talked to people who said theyd seen this that and the other thing maybe they had maybe they hadnt there were party games where you passed a sentence around the room from mouth to mouth it always came back to the person whod started it garbled beyond recognition the rumor just didnt make any sense to peterson if the japanese abused american prisoners of war wouldnt the usa declare open season on captured japs whod want to start anything like that his doubts werent what propelled him out of boq nobody had yet figured out how to get him into action hed been patient as long as he could stand now he intended to start pounding on desks and shouting at people till he got what he wanted that was the strategy of a fouryearold throwing a tantrum but it often worked the squeaky wheel got the grease peterson wouldnt just squeak hed scream he winced when he emerged from the tent hawaii had always struck him as paradise on earth or as close as anybody was likely to come the thought was profoundly unoriginal which made it no less true here hell had visited itself on paradise the noxious smoke swirled everywhere now thicker now thinner depending on the vagaries of the breeze maybe the gauze mask peterson wore helped some but he still had a permanent nasty taste in the back of his throat while his eyes felt as if somebodyd thrown ground glass into them heavy black fuel oil fouled the turquoise waters of the harbor the floating fires were finally out that helped a little but only a little the navys proud battlewagons lay shattered and broken their terrible grace and beauty turned to trash oklahoma capsized west virginia and california sunk arizona not just sunk but with her back broken too her bridge and foremast all twisted and askew and blackened by the conflagration that had raced over her and nevada or what was left of her yet another armorpiercing bomb had struck her in the third wave of the attack after she beached herself near hospital point and started fires that still smoldered she might be salvageable but it would be a long slow job bombs had savaged the lush greenery on ford island too toppling palm trees and showing the earth all naked and torn this is what war looks like this is what war feels like this is what war smells like peterson thought it wasnt the way hed imagined it at annapolis it wasnt even the way hed imagined it when that goddamn jap shot him down that had been a duel in the air a fair fightexcept that his wildcat was a lumbering pig when measured against the machine the jap flew this nothing even remotely fair about this japan had kicked the usa right in the nuts and this was the aftermath peterson wanted with all his heart to visit the same devastation on tokyo he couldnt his country couldnt he was painfully aware of that but japanese soldiers were within reach on oahu and getting closer all the time he could pay them back for some of what theyd done to hawaii that they might do the same to him never crossed his mind hed spent his whole military career training as a pilot ground combat was a closed book to him though one he wanted to open if they tell me no goddammit i can steal a springfield and a bike and head for the fighting myself he thought hell i dont even need a bike i can hoof it this isnt what anybodyd call a big island being ready to contemplate ignoring orders spoke strongly about how frazzled he was bombs had hit the dispatching office too is there anything around here bombs havent hit but the clerksthe penpushers and rubberstamp stampers and typewriter jockeys without whom the military couldnt function but who often thought themselves the beall and endall instead of the men who did the fighting and dyingthe clerks persisted even if they had to go to tents too some of them had died here some of them might even have fought here im sorry lieutenant no chance for a plane we havent got any planes to give you right now a yeoman said through his own muffling of gauze peterson knew nobody had any planes hed heard nothing but how nobody had any planes since those grayhaired geezers from the golf course got him to ewa let me have a rifle then he said let me have a rifle and a helmet and permission to go north theres a war on up there unlike the marine captain over at ewa the yeoman shook his head we dont want to do that sir if we get planes we dont want to find out that all the people trained to fly them have turned into casualties in the meantime are you out of your goddamn mind peterson exploded where the hell are you going to get more planes from pull em out of your asshole everybody and his motherinlaw says the japs have blown all the planes in hawaii to hell and gone what did i join the navy for if you wont even let me fight the yeoman turned red sir i have my orders he said stolidly and if you dont mind my saying so sending you to the front with a rifle is about like putting a doughboy into a fighter cockpit and expecting him to shoot down japs my balls to peterson ground combat looked simple you aimed at a jap you shot the son of a bitch and then you aimed at the next one what was so complicated about that flying a plane now was a whole different business that took skill and training with a shrug the yeoman said however you want it sir if you like ill bump you on to lieutenant commander mcandrews i dont have the authority to change orders like that he does bring him on peterson said eagerly lieutenant commander mcandrews still had an office in a real building to call his own as it did everywhere rank had its privileges mcandrews a jowly man in his late forties looked at peterson as if he were a cockroach in the salad so you want to go off and be a hero do you he said in a voice like ice no sir i want to serve my country sir peterson could yell and cuss at the yeomanhe outranked him the shoe was on the other foot here he had to move carefully they wont let me get back into an airplane if they would id gladly fly but the enemy is here i want to fight him you may not be doing yourself any favors you know mcandrews said things arent going so well the army may have promised more than it can deliver he sniffed as if to say one couldnt expect anything else from the army by all the signs the rivalry between navy blue and army khaki counted for more with him than the war against japan maybe that made sense in peacetime peterson had had plenty of rude things to say about the army too what navy man didnt but you could take it too far good god sir he said in that case they need all the help they can get mcandrews eyed him curiously are you really so eager to get yourself killed lieutenant no sir peterson answered what im eager for is killing those little yellow bastards who jumped on our backs when we werent looking your spirit does you credit mcandrews said but not in a way that made it sound like a compliment it is policy not to risk those men who have skills that may be valuable in the future how where we havent got any airplanes to speak of and we have got more pilots than we know what to do with peterson said sir if i have more money than i know what to do with lieutenant i dont throw some of it in the fire mcandrews said coldly do you i dont know sir i never had more money than i knew what to do with as a matter of fact peterson had done the equivalent of throwing his money in the fire plenty of times when he was in port he spent it on booze and broads and bright lights what else was it good for i was speaking metaphorically lieutenant commander mcandrews tone declared that peterson wouldnt recognize a metaphor if it bit him in the leg he might have accused the younger man of eating with the wrong fork but if you are mad enough to want to go if somebody doesnt go stop the japs up there sir dont you think theyll come down here peterson asked what happens ifno when they do by the horrified expression that washed across mcandrews face he hadnt even imagined that a lot of possibilities about the japanese hadnt occurred to americans till too late peterson knew all about that he was one of the americans those possibilities hadnt occurred to maybe mcandrews hadnt let himself think about this one he looked as if he hated peterson for making him think about it five minutes later peterson had in his possession an order releasing him for ground combat in the best interest of the navy and the united states of america mcandrews eyes said he hoped peterson stopped a bullet with his teeth peterson didnt care regardless of what mcandrews thought he had what he wanted when the americans pulled out of haleiwa theyd done their best to wreck the airstrip near the little town on the north shore of oahu theyd dynamited the runways to try to make sure planes couldnt land or take off on them a lot of pickandshovel men would have needed a long time to get the airstrip ready for operations again and the japanese army didnt have that kind of manpower to spare as lieutenant saburo shindo took off from that airstrip a smile wreathed his usually impassive features the americans hadnt been as smart as they thought they had when they pulled out of haleiwa theyd left behind a couple of bulldozers and a steamroller with those japanese military engineers had been able to repair the airstrip in a couple of days not several weeks the smile faded a little as he gained altitude there sat one of the dozers painted a friendly civilian yellow by the side of a runway such a casual display of us wealth bothered shindo a little or more than a little that wealth of earthmoving equipment wouldnt have been casually available in a japanese small town his countrymen had been able to take advantage of it yes but they couldnt come close to producing it themselves attacking a nation that could was worrying with a shrug shindo dismissed such worries from his mind they were things to keep an admiral or a cabinet minister up in the wee small hours not a lieutenant as a matter of fact nothing much kept shindo awake at night he looked forward not back forward lay the american positions us forces were trying to form a line between oahus two mountain ranges the waianae in the west and the koolau in the east they seemed to assume the land outside the mountain ranges didnt matter much so far they hadnt managed to stop the japanese advance but they had slowed it down black puffs of antiaircraft fire appeared behind shindos zero the americans were much more alert than they had been when the fighting started they still didnt lead the japanese fighters enough they couldnt believe how fast zeros were shindo dove on a us artillery position in front of wahiawa sooner or later the yankees were bound to figure out that the japanese had a landbased airstrip and werent just flying off carriers any more when they did mm guns here had no trouble reaching haleiwa knocking them out was important he dove on the guns the americans realized they had an important position here too though they might not have realized why tracers from machinegun fire spat past the stooping zero shindo couldnt do anything about them so he ignored them if they knocked him out of the sky that was fate karma if they didnt he would carry out his mission his thumb came down on the firing button he was better at shooting up ground targets than he had been when the fighting here began he didnt overshoot any more as with everything else practice made perfect the men around the american guns scattered some of them fell one or two snatched up rifles and banged away at him that was brave it was also futile or so shindo thought till a sharp clank told him somebodys bullet had struck home he pulled up eyeing his instrument panel no fuel leak showed his eyes flicked to left and right his wing tanks werent on fire either all the controls answered the round must have hit somewhere harmless in the privacy of the cockpit he allowed himself a sigh of relief the americans wasted weight on selfsealing fuel tanks and armored pilots seats that cost them speed and maneuverability japans fliers had been inclined to laugh at them on account of it lieutenant shindo still was but less so than when the fighting started yes the extra weight hurt performance but shindo had seen us planes take hits that would have sent a zero down in flames and keep on flying as if nothing had happened there were advantages on both sides half his attention was on the ground as he looked for more strongpoints to shoot up the other half was in the air every so often the yankees sent up some of their few surviving fighters they werent much if you knew they were coming but they could give you a nasty surprise if they got on your tail before you knew it the pilot who didnt learn to check six in a hurry usually didnt last long enough to learn at his leisure shindo didnt spot any trouble this time as usual the japanese had the skies over oahu to themselves all he had to worry about was ground fire that didnt bother him much he had its measure a column of olivedrab trucks was heading north up the highway that ran through the center of the island the column wasnt moving anywhere near so fast as it might have southbound refugees some on foot others in automobiles clogged the road shindo laughed hed seen that before americans had no discipline they refused to keep refugees off the road by whatever means necessary as japanese soldiers surely would have and they paid the price for their softness too radial engine roaring the zero dove on the road shindo cut loose with the fighters machine guns and cannons it was like stamping on an anthill people down there scattered in what seemed like slow motionfar too slowly to evade bullets and shells fire and smoke erupted from truck and automobile engines the plume was tiny compared to the one rising from pearl harbor but every little bit served its purpose those soldiers wouldnt get where they were going when they wanted to get there that ought to help the japanese move forward on the way back to haleiwa shindo spotted an american machinegun nest spitting tracers at japanese foot soldiers a tank would have taken care of it but none seemed close by the pilot felt as if he were looking for a policeman when he really wanted one he had to do the job himself and he did swooping down on the gunners from behind they might have died before they even knew they were under attack behind the japanese lines commandeered cars carried soldiers here and there again shindos side took advantage of the enemys wealth he wished his own country had a larger share of wealth for itself getting that larger share of course was what this war was all about shindo was used to coming in on the rolling pitching deck of a carrier landing at a strip on dry land felt ridiculously easy as if he were back in flight school the only thing the signalman had to do was guide him into one of the earthbanked revetments engineers had made with the bulldozers they kept his plane safe from anything but a direct hit as soon as the zero was in the ushaped shelter camouflage nets covered it the yankees wouldnt spot it from the air how did it go a groundcrew man asked after shindo climbed out of the fighter routine he answered just routine machinegun bullets struck flesh with wet slaps the noise reminded fletcher armitage of the last few fights he and jane had had before she threw him out of the apartment when she slapped him though his head had only felt as if it would fly off his shoulders when a real machinegun bullet hit the zero roared away to the south bound for more mischief it was low enough to the ground to kick up dust fletch fired a last futile shot at it the fellow piloting it was an artist which didnt keep fletch from hoping hed burn in hell and soon too he had more immediate things to worry about though two of his precious irreplaceable gunners were down one clutching his leg and moaning the other ominously still a quick glance told fletch nobody could help the second man this side of judgment day hed caught a slug in the back of the head and spilled his brains out in the dirt the only good thing you could say about such an end was that it was quick hed never known what hit him the artilleryman with the leg wound by contrast screamed about god and his mother and shit all of which amounted to the same thing he was in pain and didnt like it hold still vic fletch said kneeling beside him ill get a bandage on you a week earlier he might have lost his lunch trying not any more hed had practice what was that line from hamletcustom hath made it in him a property of easiness that was it old will had known what he was talking about there sure as hell hurts hurts like shit vic said yeah i know fletch used his bayonet to cut away the khaki cloth of the other mans uniformone of the few things a bayonet was actually good for he could see the artery pulsing inside the wound it looked intact if it werent vic probably would have bled to death fletch dusted the gash with sulfa powder he couldnt sew it shut but fumbled in one of the pouches on his belt and produced three safety pins theyd help hold it closed anyhow he got a bandage over the wound then stuck vics syringe of morphine into his thigh and pressed down on the plunger a couple of minutes later vic said ahh thats better sir he sounded eerily calm the drug had interposed a barrier between his torment and him well take him now sir someone behind fletch said he looked up there were two corpsmen red crosses prominent on their helmets and on armbands i wish you guys got here sooner he said the man whod spoken gave back a shrug its not like theres nothing going on for us sir he looked weary unto death his buddy nodded adding goddamn japs shoot at us regardless of these he tapped the red cross emblems bastards dont give a shit about the geneva convention tell me about it fletch exclaimed the memory of the american soldier the japanese had captured rose in him again his stomach churned you dont want to let yourselves get caught he told the corpsmen they nodded in unison yeah we already know about that one of them said they got vic onto a stretcher and carried him away come on buddythe docsll fix you up that left fletch to figure out how to fight his gun without two more trained men he had untrained infantrymen jerking shells now his gun wouldnt shoot as fast as it had before but he could still get out two or three rounds a minute if he had to lay the gun by his lonesome then he did that was all he muttered to himself even from here the piece could reach all the way to the north shore and into the pacific and how was it being used as a directfire gun banging away at whatever targets he could see he had no idea where the rest of the s in the battery were the two guns close by belonged to another outfit theyd been shot up worse than his crew and that was par for the course if anything it was better than par for the course hed taken everything the japs could throw at him and he was still in the fight a hell of a lot of people werent in the sugar fields off to the northeast a japanese machine gun started hammering away the japs were aggressive with their automatic weapons they pushed them right up to the front and went after us infantry with them he didnt care to think what they would have done with browning automatic rifles so far they hadnt shown any signs of owning weapons like those he thanked god for small favors aiming the gun at a target by himself was only a little faster than dying of old age and he hadnt finished the job before shouts of tank tank from right in front of him made him give it up from everything hed heard the us m wasnt anything special compared to what the germans and the russians were throwing at each other these days ms could usually make the jap machines say uncle though that truth would have pleased fletch more if any of those us tanks were in the neighborhood they werent if anything was going to stop this snorting jap beast from running roughshod over the infantrymen it was his gun armorpiercing he shouted to the foot soldiers hed dragooned into his service which ones are those sir one of them asked shit fletch said but he said it under his breath it wasnt the infantrymens fault that they didnt know one kind of round from another the ones with the black tips shake a leg guys or that son of a bitch is going to that son of a bitch did start shooting first fletch and his makeshift crew threw themselves flat fragments of sharp hot steel snarled overheard standing up while you were getting shelled was asking to get torn to pieces sometimes you had to but you never wanted to an american machine gun opened up on the tank for all the good their bullets did the soldiers at the gun might as well have thrown marshmallows at the japanese machine a tank that wasnt armored against machinegun fire had no raison detre french yet fletch muttered but the machine gun did do one thing it distracted the japs in the tank from the distant artillery piece to the annoyance right at hand fletch didnt know if that was what the machine gunners had had in mind he doubted it as a matter of fact but it let him get to his feet and yell till his crew did the same come on you bastards theyve given us a chance theyre human by god they can make mistakes just like us the japs hadnt made very many damn them by sheer dumb luck the tank wasnt very far from the line on which the pointed fletch swung the barrel to bear on it range was about seven hundred yards he turned the altitude screw the muzzle lowered ever so slightly fire he shouted the gun roared flame shot from the muzzle the shell kicked up dirt in front of the tank and a little to the left short one of the infantrymen shoutedthey were starting to learn the ropes nowhad the japs seen the shot fletch didnt think so they went on banging away at the machine gun armorpiercing again he said quick goddammit as the shell went into the breech he corrected his aimor hoped he did the tank wasnt going very fast but this gun wasnt made for hitting any kind of moving target hed already seen that fire boom the went off again the foot soldiers who served it flinched they usually remembered to cover their ears but they didnt know opening their mouths helped at least as much when it came to beating an artillery pieces noise but then they started making noise of their own screaming hit hit jesus god thats a hit and you nailed that fucker lieutenant nailed his ass good fletch didnt think any tank in the world us british german or russian could stand up to a mm ap round this japanese hunk of tin didnt have a prayer he couldnt have aimed it better if hed had the most highly trained crew in the world and tried for a week it struck home right at the join between hull and turret and blew the turret clean off the tank and a good six feet in the air ammo in the turret started cooking off while the hull erupted in a fireball the crew never had a chance not that fletch wasted much grief on them you see how that jap tank tipped his hat to our gun one of the infantrymen yelled fletch laughed his head off it was a pretty good line and all the better because it came from somebody so raw but that wasnt the only reason he felt giddy almost drunk with relief the odds had favored the tank not him all he had to protect him from fragments was a flimsy shield hed had to be dead accurate to kill before he got killedand hed done it and as far as he could tell doing it did neither him nor the american position one damn bit of good a couple of hours later he got the order to fall back to the outskirts of wahiawa the army would try to make another stand there oscar van der kirks life swayed back and forth between something approaching normality and something approaching insanity some of the tourists the war had stuck on oahu still wanted surfriding lessons he gave them what they wanted why not he needed to pay his rent just like anybody else his landlord a skinflint jap named mas fukumoto would have flung his scanty belongings out in the street the day after he failed to pay hed had the crummy little apartment on lewers street for a couple of years now after getting the heaveho from another place much like it all that time of course hed known mas fukumoto was a jap hed known fukumoto was a skinflint too as a matter of fact hed never known a landlord who wasnt a skinflint the one whod tossed him out when he got behind was irish as paddys pig but to think of mas fukumoto as a skinflint jap now was to think of him as an enemyas the enemyin a way it hadnt been before december oscar didnt know fukumoto wasnt loyal to the united states he had no reason to believe his landlord wasnt in fact that didnt keep himand a lot of fukumotos other haole tenantsfrom giving the man a fishy stare whenever they saw him and even when oscar paddled out into the pacificwarm despite its being the week before christmaswith a wahine from denver or des moines he couldnt help seeing and smelling the black stinking smoke that still rose from the navys shattered fuel tanks at pearl harbor the wahines mostly didnt care theyd come to hawaii to forget whatever ailed them on the mainland they intended to go right on forgetting too and when they couldnt forget they said things like well but thats all going on way up there everythings pretty much okay down here in waikiki and honolulu right that was a strawberry blonde named susie shed come to hawaii from reno to forget about a recently exhusband and she was doing quite a job of it too she was ready for any kind of lessons oscar wanted to give her he had a sure instinct about such things he wondered if saying something would mess up his chances lying there on the surfboard with her he shrugged a tiny shrug she wasnt the only fish in the sea he said wahiawas only half an hour away the north coast is only an hour awaya buddy of mine and i were surfriding up there when the japs landed they were shooting at us susie looked back over her slightly sunburned shoulder at him her eyes were blue as a siamese cats what was that like she asked when the bullets started flying back and forth i pissed myself nobody but mell ever know because i was dripping wet anyway but i damn well did not a whole lot of fun he answered out loud which was not only true but sounded tough and not the least bit undignified he wondered if the same thing had happened to charlie kaapu no way to ask not ever what he said seemed to satisfy susie she made a little noise almost a purr down deep in her throat im glad they missed she told him me too oscar said and she laughed if he lowered his chin a couple of inches it would come down on her cottoncovered backside he decided not to unlike some of the women to whom he gave lessons susie didnt need much in the way of signals he paddled out a little while longer so did she not very helpfully then swung the surfboard back toward the beach this time were going to get you up on your knees on the board okay what happens if i fall off she asked you swim he answered and she laughed he started paddling shoreward come on you can do it ill steady you and he did kneeling behind her with his hands on her slim waist that was a signal of sorts but it was also line of duty and she could ignore it if she wanted to she laughed again she wasnt ignoring anythingexcept the japs oscar wished he could do the same actually her sense of balance was pretty goodplenty good enough to keep her kneeling on the board with only a little support the surf wasnt very bigoscar had chosen this place with care but she got enough of the rollercoaster thrill to let out a whoop as they neared the beach wow she said when the surfboard scraped to a stop on the soft sand there were stars in her eyes she turned back and gave him a quick kiss thank you thank you he said keeping any hint that hed expected it out of his voice if they knew you knew they got coy want to try it again sure she said unless youd rather just go on back to my room instead even oscar hadnt thought shed be that brazen sometimes the ride lit a fire though hed seen that before he said well youve paid for two hours of lessons afterwards i dont have anything else going on so i like the way you thinkamong other things she said okay well do that and they did by the end of the lesson she was kneeling unsupported she did fall off on one run but struck out strongly for the shore when the lessons were done she gave oscar her room number he took the board back to the outrigger club then went over to the hotel if hed gone in with her the house detective would have had to notice this way the fellow just tipped him a wink and looked in the other direction all along waikiki beach the house dicks and the surfriding instructors had their informal understandings a few dollars every now and then a few drinks every now and then and nobody got excited about anything no huhu charlie kaapu would have said oscar knocked on the door its open susie called he turned the knob she lay on the bed naked and waiting jesus he said what if id been the plumber or something those blue eyes went wide in some of the phoniest innocence hed ever seen that depends she said throatily is the plumber here goodlooking oscars jaw dropped susies laugh was pure mischief since its you hows your plunger lets see he managed and slipped off his trunks by the way she eyed him he passed muster he got down on the bed beside her she slid toward him he rapidly discovered she had no inhibitions hidden anywhere about her person once she got back to the mainland shed probably rediscover them hed known more than a few other women who left them behind in san pedro or san francisco or seattle this one seemed an extreme casenot that extremes couldnt be extremely enjoyable he was poised to find out just how enjoyable she could be when sirens started wailing and bells started clanging what the hell is that susie exclaimed and then whatever it is for gods sake dont stop now but oscar said thats the airraid siren wed better get in the trenches having been under fire once he didnt care to repeat the experience hed helped dig some of the trenches that marred the greenery around the hotel buildings susie stared at him dont be silly they wouldnt bomb waikiki were civilians she spoke the last word as if it were a magic talisman maybe they wouldnt not on purpose oscar said though he wasnt convinced but fort derussys just ewa from the waikiki hotels she sent him a blank look just west he explained impatiently adding if they bomb that and they miss susie reached out and gave him a regretful squeeze okay im sold she said all the kitten gone from her voice the trenches she ran for the bathroom and emerged in her bathing suit by the time oscar had his on again they werent the only scantily dressed people hurrying down the hallways the sharp flat boom of a bomb bursting not far away made several peoplenot all of them womenscream and made everybody hurry faster more bombs went off as oscar and susie raced across the lawn and scrambled down into a trench antiaircraft guns at the fort added to the din sure enough derussy was what the japs were after most of their bombs fell on itmost but not all when a bomb burst on the hotel it made a noise like the end of the world sharp fragments of hot metal hissed and screamed by overhead the ground shook as if at an earthquake blast stunned oscars ears as if from very far away he heard susie say well you were right she kissed himmore he judged from gratitude than passion and then an armorpiercing bomb or maybe more than one penetrated the reinforced concrete protecting the coastdefense guns in the fortress and their magazines the explosions that followed made the ones from the bombs themselves seem like love pats chunks of cement and steel rained down out of the sky shrieks said some of them came down in trenches oscar wondered how many men fort derussy heldhad held for they were surely dead now the raid lasted about half an hour the antiaircraft guns kept firing for five or ten minutes after bombs stopped falling shrapnel pattered down out of the air along with debris from the fort oscar wished for a helmet that stuff could smash your skull like a melon despite the secondary explosions people started climbing out of the trenches christ but i want a drink somebody said which summed things up as well as edward r murrow or william l shirer could have done susie let out a wordless squawk of dismay she pointed at what had been her room and was now nothing but smoking rubble oscar gulped if theyd ignored the sirens and gone on with what they were doing they might have died happy but they sure would have died then susie found words what am i going to do all my stuff was in there god damn the dirty japs oscar heard himself say you can move in with me for a while if you want to he blinked hed taken in stray kittens before and once a puppy but never a girl it wasnt even that he was all that crazy about susie if it hadnt been for the war theyd have screwed each other silly for a few days and then gone their separate ways but he didnt see how he could leave her stranded here with nothing but the bathing suit on her back by the way she eyed him she was making some calculations of her own okay she said after a few seconds but its not like you own me or anything whenever i want to walk out im gone sure oscar said at once i dont have any trouble with that if you start driving me nuts ill hold the door open for you in the meantime though he stuck out his hand uh whats your last name higgins she said as she shook it her hand almost got lost in his but she had a pretty good grip whats yours he told her van der kirk she echoed and started to laugh youre so brown i wouldve figured you for a dago he shrugged im out in the sun all the time thats one of the reasons i like hawaii you want to see the place its only a few blocks mauka from here susie higgins looked blank again north toward the mountains oscar told her hawaiian notions of directions had baffled him too when he first got to oahu now he took them for granted but he was on his way to becoming a kamaaina an oldtimerhere he wasnt a justarrived malihini any more the way susie was come on he said and she went with him the apartment building plainly didnt impress her well it didnt much impress oscar either she did seem surprised when he opened his door without a key once she walked in she said oh i get it you dont bother to lock it because you dont have anything worth stealing only things i own that are worth anything are my car and my surfboard and my car isnt worth much oscar answered with another shrug you dont need much to live here susie didnt say anything about that even so he got the idea she wasnt going to stay there forever or even very longshe was a girl who liked things he could tell what she did say was you want to lock the door now how come he said and then oh she laughed at him he deserved it he laughed too she said we were doing something or other when that air raid started as if to remind him what she peeled off her bathing suit the bed was narrow for two but not too narrow things were going along very nicely when a great roar made the walls shake and the window rattleit was a miracle the window didnt break susie squealed oscar needed a bit to recover john henry the steeldriving man would have needed a moment to recover after that hed just started again when another identical roar made susie squeal again this time though it didnt unman him for hed realized what it was more things blowing up at fort derussy thats all thats all susie exclaimed jesus oscar didnt answer not with words after a while he managed to distract her which he took as a compliment to himselfdistracting somebody from the thunder of those explosions was no mean feat susies gasp said he hadnt just distracted herhed got her hot a moment later oscar exploded too he stroked his cheek not so bad he said and tried to believe it what the hell had he got into getting into susie well hed find out an american soldier showed himself corporal takeo shimizus rifle jumped to his shoulder he steadied on the target took a deep breath and pulled the trigger just like a drill he thought as the arisaka rifle kicked the american crumpled shimizu ducked down deep into his foxhole in the pineapple field outside of wahiawa he didnt feel particularly proud of himself for shooting the enemy the americans were brave hed seen that since coming ashore they were braver than hed expected in fact even if some of them did try to surrender instead of fighting to the death that made for amusing sport but shooting them hardly seemed fair hadnt anyone taught them anything about taking cover he was one of the veterans in his regiment whod fought in china you never saw the chinese bandits till one of them put a bullet between your eyes they didnt have a lot of rifles and even less in the way of heavy weapons but they made the most of what they had and of the ground on which they fought the yankees by contrast were very well armedbetter than shimizus own men probably if their air power hadnt been knocked out they would have been tough to shift but they didnt seem to know what to do with what they hadand they paid the price for it again and again machinegun bullets snarled over shimizus head he laughed the americans must have thought hed stay upright waiting to get shot they were like someone who covered his belly when you hit him there then covered his face when you hit him there they didnt know what was coming next and they didnt think their foes did either and they paid the price for being so naive behind shimizu a mortar started going poppoppop the bombs came down around the machinegun position the yankees had incautiously revealed shimizu hoped they knocked out the gunners even if they did though they were unlikely to put the gun out of action a machine gun wasnt so complicated that ordinary soldiers couldnt handle it lieutenant yonehara crawled up to shimizus foxhole yonehara had pineapple leaves fixed to his helmet to make him harder to spot his belly never came up higher off the ground than a snakes he pointed south do you see that white frame house corporal shimizu warily raised his head for half a heartbeat then he ducked back down again yes sir i see it the one about a hundred meters behind the enemy line hai yonehara said that is the one its on high ground our company has been ordered to seize it you will prepare your men to take part in the attack yes sir shimizu said the only thing he could say when he got an order like that no not quite for he did add a few words that expressed his opinion of the order hard work sir yes hard work yonehara agreed his voice not without sympathy colonel fujikawa feels it is necessary however i will lead the attack we will use the sword and bayonet if that is what it takes to clear the americans from their positions a bayonet made a handy tool for gutting a chicken if you stabbed it in the ground the socket held a candle shimizu had yet to fight with his but if the lieutenant led he would follow yes sir he said and if the americans didnt run he would give them the bayonetunless he shot them from close range instead at my order yonehara said and crawled away shimizu passed the news to his men mortar fire picked up from farther back of the line field guns started pounding the american position when lieutenant yonehara shouted forward shimizu jumped out of his foxhole and ran toward the american line my squad with me he yelled they too came out of their holes pride filled him truly he sprang from a warrior race how could the americans hope to stop his comrades and him he got the answer to that sooner than he wanted the americans hoped to stop them with sheer firepower the machine gun that had been shooting at him opened up again so did others that had been silent till then onrushing japanese soldiers fell as if scythed a bullet tugged at shimizus sleeve as if to tell him he had to go back or go down he kept going forward nonetheless the platoon commander had given the order and he had to obey lieutenant yonehara had drawn his katana the sword blade shone in the sun it could lop off an arm or a headif yonehara ever got close enough to use it no sooner had that thought crossed shimizus mind than a bullet caught the lieutenant in the face and blew out the back of his head he crumpled as if all his bones had turned to water seeing him fall was like waking from a fevered delirium corporal shimizu looked to his right and to his left a lot of the company was down like him the men still on their feet wavered if they kept on advancing they wouldnt waver they would die shimizu could see that perfectly well machinegun bullets didnt care whether you were a warrior theyd kill you any which way but the soldiers had been ordered to advance shimizu wondered how to change that the officer whod given him the order was dead but the thing itself remained very much alive bullets couldnt slaughter an order only the soldiers who tried to obey it no one had ever trained shimizu or any other japanese soldier in retreating if he ordered the survivors to fall back they might not obey him all that ran through his head in less than a heartbeat and then fast as lightning he found the answer men were going to recover our positions he shouted that didnt say a word about retreat it got the message across even so and it gave the soldiers an honorable way to get back to the foxholes and trenches from which theyd emerged they took advantage of it too shimizu might not have called it a retreat but a retreat was what it was they dragged the wounded back with them and left the dead where they had fallen american fire stung them all the way back to their starting point a private jumped into shimizus foxhole with him akira murakami was a firstyear soldier still wet behind the earsor he had been till combat started nobody whod landed on oahu was wet behind the ears any more not like that but murakamis eyes were wide and staring as he asked what will they do to us for for coming back he wouldnt say retreat either we tried our best shimizu said maybe a tank could take that house infantry cant not by itself murakami only shrugged he didnt dare contradict a corporal but he didnt believe him either shimizu went on besides what can they do to us that the yankees machine guns wouldnt have that got home the young soldier shivered and nodded no one ever said a word about the retreat an hour and a half later aichi dive bombers screamed down out of the sky they pulverized the position the luckless company hadnt been able to overrun the order to advance went out again with the defenses shattered the japanese had no trouble pushing forward toward wahiawa why didnt they send in the bombers before the americans chewed us up shimizu wondered but he had no one he could ask that question it stayed unspoken the fight went on having got what hed asked for lieutenant jim peterson quickly discovered it wasnt all it was cracked up to be since he was still a young man he fondly imagined this discovery to be unique to himself everyone around him was too busy trying to stay alive to tell him any different the navy might have been willing to slap a tin hat on his head toss him a rifle and send him off to the front once he got there the army showed itself less than delighted to have him a sergeant looked at him and said sir youre going to have to shed those captains badges before you get a bunch of people killed captains oh a navy captainwhich had been petersons first thoughtwas the equivalent of a bird colonel in the army but the two silver bars of a navy lieutenant matched an army captains rank emblem peterson said i didnt come here to command a company damn good thing the sergeant said put him in navy blue and hed have made a good cpo he paused to light a king sano then went on up here your rank dont mean shitpardon my frenchon account of you dont know anything if you were a marine but youre not tell you the truth whats likely gonna happen is that youll get shot for nothing if i can take out a couple of japs first it wont be for nothing peterson said savagely im no infantry officer but i can shoot i know how to take orders too for the first time the sergeant looked at him as if he were something more than a fly in the soup peterson realized hed said the right thing even if it was at least half by accident after blowing a meditative smoke ring the sergeant said okay sir thats fair enough as of now youre private uhhe looked down to check the paperwork in front of himprivate peterson that suit you you bet peterson said the sergeant looked at him he realized something more was expected uh yes sergeant this man was suddenly his superior okay the noncom nodded now then like i told you get rid of those sillyass silver bars that was an order hed claimed he knew how to take them yes sergeant he said again and removed them he felt younger with them in his pocket as if nothing that had happened since annapolis counted any more in some pretty basic ways it didnt he also felt weaker which made sense everybody could tell him what to do now it was like his first year at the naval academy only worse then hed been bound for officers status now hed chucked it out the window tell you what im going to do the sergeant said meditatively im going to send you to the garrison guarding kolekole pass off to the west of schofield barracks thatll help me peel some trained soldiers out of there and put em in a part of the line where theres more going on peterson realized hed just been handed the army equivalent of the coast defense of south dakota he started to say that hed come up here to fight not to make it easier for somebody else to the words didnt pass his lips privates didnt get to make protests like that the sergeant undoubtedly knew more about how things were going than he did he managed a nod all right sergeant there you go the noncom said thats almost always the right answer truck full of beans and stuff heading over there pretty soon you hustle you can scrounge a lift and you better hope you dont see too many japs there you do were in deep shit go on scram i got more things to worry about besides you off peterson went he did catch the truck and rode in the cab with the driver the kid behind the wheel was named billy joe mckennie and hailed from somewhere deep in the south he said ifn them japsit came out jayups the first time peterson had ever heard it as a twosyllable wordtry comin over the waianaea name that had to be heard to be believedmountains theyll have to come through usns an i dont reckon they kin how do you know they wont try somewhere else peterson asked mckennie might not speak much real english but he understood it he looked at peterson as if he were crazy on account of a goatd have trouble gittin over them mountains let alone a lousy jap the truck rumbled through schofield barracks the eastwest road that cut the immense base in half remained intact the barracks and all the other buildings around the facility had taken a hell of a beating burnedout cars and trucks had been hastily dragged off the road they sprawled alongside it a terrible tangle of twisted metal peterson didnt like to think about the men whod been inside them when they were hit west of the base the land began climbing toward the mountains the closer peterson got to them the more he started to think billy joe mckennie had a point they werent especially tall but they rose swift and steep and they were covered with the thickest most impenetrablelooking jungle hed ever seen he couldnt have named half the plantshell he couldnt have named any of thembut he wouldnt have wanted to try pushing through that maze of trees and ferns and thorny bushes halfway through kolekole pass the road stopped the mountains loomed up on either side the american detachment faced west it boasted some field guns several nicely sited machine guns and a couple of command carssoldiers called them peepswith pintlemounted machine guns of their own for mobile firepower peterson helped mckennie and the soldiers already at the strongpoint unload the truck nobody seemed to find anything out of the ordinary about him he pulled his weight when mckennie drove off a whole squad of men rode in the back of the truck we give away a dozen and we get one back grumbled the major in charge of the garrison by the disgusted look on his face this wasnt the first time that had happened pretty soon well have all the guns in the world and not a soul to shoot em he stood in no serious danger of having all the guns in the world whether hed run out of men was a different question the question related to it was whether he ought to have any men there at all the more peterson looked at those mountains the more he suspected the garrison was what the army did instead of snapping its fingers to keep the elephants away sir i dont think tarzan of the apes could come at us through country like this he said the major blinked then he grinned you never can tell with tarzan he said he got around a lotthat lost roman city and he went on and on peterson realized hed run into an edgar rice burroughs fanatic the major shifted to john carter on mars then to carson napier on venus peterson had to listen to him and listen and listen the officer started talking about burroughs himself who it turned out spent a lot of his time on oahu if peterson was any judge burroughs came to a place like this to escape his fans there probably was no escape though no escape for me thats for sure peterson thought unhappily the major didnt seem to want to run dry at last he did that let peterson escape and it let him look east across the center of oahu he could trace the front all the way over to the koolau range on the other side of the island it wasnt that far if the americans could hold the japs north of schofield barracks and wahiawa he thought they had a decent chance kolekole pass would have made a hell of an observation post peterson started to say something about that then hesitated a navy lieutenant could make such suggestions what about a buck private in the army wasnt he supposed to keep his mouth shut and do as he was told that was what he would have wanted from an ordinary seaman in the navy he buttoned his lip a little later he heard the major talking into a field telephone the officer was pinpointing the location of a japanese artillery position peterson laughed at himself old granny army didnt need him to teach her how to suck eggs off in the distance artillery boomed machine guns rattled rifles crackled like fireworks here in the pass everything was quiet soldiers played pinochle or aceydeucey birds chirped peterson could no more name them than the trees in which they perched it was quiet duty considering what was going on only a few miles away it was miraculously quiet most of the men seemed delighted to be out of anything more dangerous peterson muttered and fumed he wanted to have a go at the japs not sit here twiddling his thumbs in a place where they were anything but likely to show up after fuming till the sun swung down toward the horizon he decided to beard the major after all the man heard him out then he said no im sorry private i commend your initiative it does you credit but the answer is still no we are serving a necessary function here i would sooner be in combat myself but i am doing what was ordered of me and you will do what is ordered of you is that clear yes sir peterson said that the man was obviously right only made his refusal more galling they had beans for supper beans and roast pork the beans couldnt have come off of petersons truck theyd been soaked before they were boiled they werent anything fancy but they were okay as for the pork everybody smiled and ate in a hurry peterson suspected the pigs had been liberated from some little local farm no one said anything though and he didnt think hed make himself popular by asking a whole lot of questions he rolled himself in his blanket and fell asleep on the ground some of the soldiers had mosquito netting he didnt he wondered how high a price hed pay for that he tossed and turned trying to get comfortable snores rose around him the army men had no trouble sleeping on bare ground if hed got used to sacking out in a bunk every night that was his hard luck and then some time around midnight shouts woke everybody whod managed to fall asleep out out out the major yelled weve got to get out of here before we get cut off and surrounded what the fuck somebody said which perfectly summed up what peterson was thinking the japs the major said which was no shock mussolinis men for instance were a hell of a long way away but what followed was a shocker goddamn slanteyes landed on the west coast and theyre over the mountains behind us thats why were pulling out did they get through pohakea pass south of here a soldier asked no theyre over the goddamn mountains i tell you dont ask me howthey must be part monkey but most of what weve got is up at the front god only knows how well stop em or even slow em down gotta try though come on get moving peterson scrambled out of his bedroll maybe hed see action after all it didnt occur to him to wonder if that was what he really wanted some civil war generalfletch armitage was damned if he could remember whohad said raw troops were as sensitive about their flanks as a virgin some things hadnt changed a bit in the past eighty years fletch looked west toward the waianae range he was damned if he could see how anybody human could have got over those steep junglecovered mountains for all he knew the japs werent human but they were over the mountains and square in the us armys rear with how many soldiers fletch had no idea and he didnt think any other americans did either too manythat was certain they werent just on the armys flank they were in its rear and if the americans couldnt pull back in a hurry and form some kind of new line farther south they were probably history and ancient history at that pulling back meant giving up wahiawa leaving it to its fate plenty of people in the town didnt intend to be left refugees packed the roads fletch had seen that before when the people from haleiwa and waimea ran away from the oncoming japs this was worse more people lived in wahiawa japanese fighters had a field day shooting up the kamehameha highway they didnt seem to care whether they blasted soldiers or civilians why should they they spawned chaos with every cannon shell with every burst of machinegun fire as the beatup de soto with his gun in tow slowlyso slowlyrattled south through wahiawa fletch looked now this way now that one of the infantry privates newly hauled into artillerymans duty said sure is a pretty place sure is a shame letting the japs have it i wasnt looking at the town fletch said tightly he was looking for his more or less exwife if he spotted jane he intended to shoehorn her into the car okay she didnt love him any more but after what hed seen he wouldnt have left a dying halfwitted dog to the mercy of the japs maybe jane would thank him for getting her out of there maybe shed try to spit in his eye he didnt give a damn either way if he saw her she was going but he didnt see her all he saw was wahiawa he didnt think it was all that lovely it was the sort of town that grows up alongside any army base full of cheap hastily runup buildings that held businesses designed to separate soldiers from cash bars hamburger stands chopsuey joints tailors shops that sold cheap loud clothes tattoo parlors dives that called themselves burlesque houses but were really brothels to make matters worse the japs had bombed and shelled the place no it wasnt lovely in his eyes but it wasnt so ugly as a baseside town back on the mainland would have been either palm trees swayed in the breeze hibiscus didnt care that it was december blooms of gold and red and white brightened the day fletch didnt know the names of a lot of the other flowers busily blooming in the middle of winter mynah birds and zebra doves and redheaded graybacked cardinals from south america added to the tropic scenery fletch wished he could hop out of the car and run over to the apartment where hed lived till not so long before he knew he couldnt rescuing jane if he saw her on the street would have been one thing abandoning his gun to go after her would have been something else again dereliction of duty a couple of hundred yards ahead dirt fountained into the air another shell came down and another and another most of the column there was civilian people scattered screaming son of a bitch fletch said softly sir the dragooned infantryman said those arent the bursts the japs get from their usual field pieces armitage spoke with authority hed earned the right hed seen what the enemys guns could do us troops had mountain howitzers that broke down into loads light enough for one or two soldiers to manhandle them forward no matter what the terrain evidently the japs did too he thought about manhandling even mountain guns over the waianae range who could have dreamt the japs could manage such a thing who could have dreamt the japs would strike at hawaii in the first place oh the people in charge of the army and navy here had played with the idea before but it was only play and everybody here had treated it that way the trouble was japan hadnt shed been dead serious about it and now were paying the piper fletch thought he gave the car some gas when he shifted up into second gears clashed the de soto wasnt made for towing an artillery piece it would break down altogether pretty soon in the meantime hed get what use from it he could if a shell from one of the mountain howitzers came down on him then it did that was all he had to get the gun free if he possibly could he did it a spent shell fragment clanged off his fender but he got through skirting potholes all the way down toward pearl harbor and honolulu he drove wondering where the next stop would be jane armitage stayed in her apartment when the japanese army entered wahiawa she didnt know what the japs would do to civilians she especially didnt know what they would do to white female civilians she didnt want to find out the hard way either she couldnt help looking out the window was that skinny little man skulking along the street really a soldier he looked as if he ought to be in the eighth grade he wore short pants his legs seemed skinny as matchsticks by his size the big americans she was used to should have been able to tie him in knots and throw him away but a helmet that looked too large perched on his head he carried a rifle and had the air of a man who knew what to do with it he looked up toward the window jane drew back not wanting him to see her he must not have for he kept going two more japs followed him a moment later one was even skinnier the other stocky and stronglooking but still very short the stocky soldier had an american canteen bumping on his hip occasional shots rang out the americans had pulled out hours before maybe the japs werent sure about that maybe they were shooting people for the fun of it or to put the fear of god into the ones they didnt shoot jane laughed shakily they sure know how to get what they want dont they she wondered if she should have headed south before the japs came in what shed seen and heard from the refugees out of waimea and haleiwa had made her decide to sit tight the japanese had shelled them and shot at them and strafed them from the air all they had was what they could carry american soldiers had commandeered a lot of their cars and the army men might have shot the refugees who tried to refuse to give them up what had really made jane decide to stay in wahiawa was the fear that fleeing wouldnt do any good the japs seemed only too likely to take all of oahu if they did where would she be better off in her own apartment or somewhere on the road with only the clothes on her back the choice had looked obvious now that shed gone and made it she wished she hadnt part of the island remained free but not her part if she was wrong if the army could somehow stop the japs she wondered how fletch was doing she hoped he was still alive and fighting at least as much because an artilleryman could really hurt the japs as because up till fairly recently shed loved him she hadnt seen him in the american retreat through town who could say what that proved though or if it proved anything time crawled by the gunfire gradually sputtered into silence and then a man shouting something broke the silence as he got closer jane managed to make out what he was saying everyone come to the corner of makani and california at four oclock the japanese commander will give the rules for the occupation makani and california four oclock rules for the occupation you have to be there whoever he was he spoke good english with only a slight japanese accent was he an invader whod learned the language in college on the mainland or was he a local jap doing what the occupiers told him would the local japs do what the occupiers told them were they cheering to see the stars and stripes come down and the rising sun go up some of them are i bet jane thought furiously she wondered if she ought to go listen to the jap commander or if the order was a trick or a trap reluctantly she decided she had to take the chance if the japs gave more orders at this gathering she didnt want to get shot for not knowing what the rules were makani and california was only a few blocks east of kamehameha highway and only a few from her building she locked the door behind her when she left not that that would do much good against a rifle butt other people were also coming out of hiding jane waved and nodded to the ones she recognized they all tried to pretend the japanese soldiers prowling the streets werent there the japs just eyed the haoles they talked with the japanese whod lived in wahiawa some of those japanese answered too tone of voice was plenty to tell jane the shoe was on the other foot all right one of the local japanese a man who ran a nursery stood on a table with a jap officer at makani and california the local man translated for the invader major hirabayashi says that from now on you must bow to all soldiers of the empire of japan you must make way for them on the street soldiers may stay with people here if they do you will be responsible for their room and board the locals muttered at that they did no more than mutter though not with soldiers all around major hirabayashi went on all guns must be turned in anyone found with a gun after three days time will be executed also all food in wahiawa will be shared when ordered you will deliver your supplies to a central distribution point anyone caught hoarding after that will also be executed more mutters a dull horror washed over jane so much for what shed bought if only she lived in a house with a yard she could have buried some by dead of night not with only an apartment around her and lots of nosy neighbors maybe i should have run away after all v the oshima maru s planking throbbed under jiro takahashis feet diesel growling at the sampans stern it scooted out into the pacific takahashi was happy now we get to go work again he said staying at home without working had been harder on him than all the backbreaking labor he went through here on the ocean his sons seemed less delighted merry christmas hiroshi said in sarcastic english jiro had always bought the boys presents at christmastime why not everybody else did but for the presents though the day meant nothing to him what difference did a haole holiday make in japanese hardly less sardonic kenzo added you know why theyve let us go out again dont you father i dont care why jiro said isnt it good to breathe clean air the tank farms at pearl harbor had mostly burned themselves out by now but acrid eyestinging haze still filled the air in honolulu no sooner had jiro praised the air away from the city than he lit a cigarette have to be careful with these he remarked theyre starting to run low theyre starting to run low on everything kenzo said thats why theyve let the sampans out they really need the fish we bring back as long as theres diesel fuel well do all right jiro said lots of things can happen to a fisherman but he probably wont starve how long will there be diesel fuel hiroshi asked it comes from the mainland just like everything else it came from the mainland i mean nothings going in or out not any more if japan wins she can send us diesel fuel jiro said to his annoyance hiroshi and kenzo both laughed at him dont you remember father his older son said one of the big reasons japan got into a fight with the united states was that we wouldnt sell them oil any more they wont have any to spare for hawaii kenzo nodded in agreement with his brother jiro glared at his sons he had forgotten about the oil embargo not only were they rude for laughing they were right which made it three times as bad and to hiroshi and kenzo the united states was we and japan was they jiro had already bumped into that but he liked it no better now hiroshi rubbed his nose in the point everything except pineapple and sugar comes from the mainland just about if we need blue jeans or shoes or canned milk or canned corn or flour for bread ororanything they have to ship it in remember when they had the dock strike on the west coast five years ago kenzo added we were down to two weeks worth of food by the time it endedand that was when things were coming in from the east coast and from australia and japan too where will we get supplies now well start going hungry a lot faster all right all right jiro wanted to cuff both of them he couldnt they were grown men and both bigger than he was and they were so very very different from him he wondered what hed done wrong if hed been a better father wouldnt he have had sons who were more japanese he busied himself on the sampan not that there was much to do the engine chugged away it was noisy but it was reliable he almost wished it would have broken down that would have given him the excuse to haul out the tool kit and tinker with it then he could have ignored his milkshakeguzzling hamburgermunching boys as things were he just stared back toward the receding bulk of oahu hiroshi said something in english kenzo laughed neither of them bothered to translate for jiro they must be talking about me he thought resentfully they thought they knew everything and their old man didnt know anything well by the look of things theyd backed the wrong horse in the war every day the rumble of artillery came closer to honolulu the japanese advanced the americans retreated they couldnt retreat much farther or theyd go into the pacific he felt the way the oshima maru bumped over the waves he watched terns and boobies and frigate birds he remembered gulls raucous over the inner sea when he was young they could guide a fisherman to schools of smelt or mackerel but gulls except for rare vagrants didnt come to hawaii a man had to use what other birds gave him there were boobies plunging into the sea japanese dive bombers must have looked like that when they swooped down on the american ships at pearl harbor they hadnt gone into the sea though theyd pulled up and flown away to strike again and again banzai jiro said softly banzai he didnt think his sons heard him that was just as well he steered toward the boobies one of them came to the surface with a footlong fish writhing in its beak jiro nodded he waved to hiroshi and kenzo theyd already started dumping nehus into the water and getting the lines ready they did know what needed doing thrilled to be free unaware of the fate awaiting so many of them the minnows swam off in all directions silver flecks under the blue of the sea and bigger flashes of silver rose to meet them some of those fish would get themselves a meal some would bite down on silver hooks not silver scales instead of getting meals they would become meals themselves across miles of ocean booms came from the north are those the coastdefense guns again kenzo asked that would have been jiros guess too but hiroshi shook his head i dont think so he said i think those are some of the ships in pearl harbor shooting at the japanese as they come farther south you notice they couldnt get out of pearl harbor jiro said both his sons sent him stony looks he ignored them he knew it was true and so did they however little they liked it the very day the war started japanese bombers in the third wave had sunk two light cruisers in the channel leading from the harbor to the pacific that had corked the bottle and made sure the rest of the ships stayed put since then japanese planes had pounded them again and again some of the ships still had working guns every so often they opened fire they were heavier artillery than any based on land except the coastdefense batteries jiro suspected japanese planes would return before long after that very likely fewer navy guns would fire on his countrys soldiers my countrys soldiers jiro thought again and nodded to himself yes japan was his country it always would be and if hiroshi and kenzo didnt like that or couldnt understand it too bad the fish didnt seem to care about the distant artillery when the takahashis pulled in the lines they had plenty of aku and ahi on them as well as a few mahimahi that had come to join the feast the frenzy of gutting them and getting them into storage came next then it was more minnows over the side and fish guts too and the lines went back into the pacific with them the guts jiro knew would draw sharks but sharks were also good to eat even if a lot of haoles were too dumb to believe it he didnt think he would have any trouble selling them not today he and his sons brought in fish till the sun sank low in the west then jiro started up the diesel again and took the oshima maru back to kewalo basin now we see how we do he said as they tied up there we see how scared people are you mean hiroshi said jiro only shrugged his aching shoulders in the end it all boiled down to the same thing along with the japanese and chinese buyers in the marketplace there were also tall american soldiers with bayonets on their rifles fear stabbed at jiro when he saw them were they there to enforce price controls or worse to confiscate the fish the takahashis had worked so hard to catch if they were jiro was damned if he intended to go out again the next morning hed built his life on the cornerstone of hard work but hard work with the expectation of fair pay for it if he didnt get his reward what point to putting to sea but the soldiers only kept order they needed to keep order too because the buyers sprang at jiro hiroshi and kenzo like starving wolves they frantically bid against one another by the time they were through jiro had three times as much money in his pocket as hed imagined in his fondest dreams he had so much money he was tempted not to take home some especially fine ahi for reiko but the thought of what his wife would say if he didnt was plenty to conquer even greed well be rich he said to his sons rich i tell you he could think about the money he had made if not the bit of extra cash that would have been in his pocket if hed sold the rest of the tuna then hiroshi spoiled even that saying no we wont the buyers will just jack up the price they charge everybodys jacking up the prices he charges look at that he pointed to the window of a haole grocery store they were walking past he and kenzo both read english fluently which jiro didnt flour is half again what it was when the war started rice the same onions are double and look at orangesa dollar thirtyfive a dozen thats two and a half times what they were before easy some of jiros glee evaporated then it returned or a portion of it did yes the prices are up but what i got paid is up even more how much did you shell out for diesel fuel kenzo asked jiro scowled old man okano is a highway robber he said but this time his glee didnt come back he knew he couldnt have got a better price from anybody else japanese chinese or haole diesel fuel was heading straight through the roof the army needed a lot of it and as his sons had said no more was coming in from the mainland and gasoline was going up even faster than diesel fuel which meant all right we wont get rich jiro said he was less upset than he might have been he wouldnt have known what to do as a rich man anyhow kenzo asked what happens when there is no more fuel can we take the engine off the sampan and rig a mast hiroshi and i dont know anything about handling a sail ive done it back when i was young jiro said i think i can still manage id want somebody who really knows what hes doing to see to the rigging i expect he stuck a hand in his pocket something like that wouldnt come cheap his imagined wealth seemed to be dripping away even faster than hed got it the day after christmas joe crosetti reported to the san francisco naval aviation selection board a big blond swede named lundquist chaired the board he looked at joes papers and smiled are you any relation to frankie crosetti young man he asked joe smiled too in a resigned way if he had a dime for every time somebodyd asked him if he was related to the yankees shortstop he might have been making more dough than frankie was no sir not that i know of he answered oh there may be some kind of connection between his family and mine back in the old country but its nothing anybody can prove okay doesnt matter one way or the other lundquist said i wondered thats all how old are you son im nineteen mr lundquist crosetti knew he looked younger he was fiveseven and on the skinny side with a narrow swarthy face and a thick shock of curly black hair he did have a five oclock shadow that came out at three but it was five after nine in the morning now hed got to the board as soon as it opened and hed shaved just a couple of hours before you graduated from high school a year and a half ago sir my diplomas in with my papers all right and what are you doing now im a mechanic at scalzis garage sir joe answered my old mans a fisherman sometimes on weekends i go out with him i used to do it every summer and christmas vacation till i got this job so you know your way around the water do you a little bit maybe im an okay sailor but im not a sailor you know what i mean lundquist and the rest of the men on the board looked at one another joe tried to figure out what that meant but he couldnt the chairman said when you were in high school did you play any sports yes sir joe answered i played second base on the baseball team and i was a backup guard on the basketball team no football joe shook his head i like playing touch in the park but im not a great big guy that was an understatement i didnt have a prayer of making the team how come you want to know teamwork lundquist told him basketball is good footballs even better baseball shows coordination but less of the other one of the other men spoke up second and short need it more than other positions they have to work together if theyre going to turn double plays his wiry build suggested he might have been a middle infielder in his day whether or not he was dead right and joe nodded he and danny fitzpatrick his shortstop had taken endless ground balls and practiced and double plays till each knew in his sleep what the other was going to do lundquist scribbled a note he asked have you got any flying experience no sir joe admitted wondering how much trouble the admission would get him in again he couldnt tell what lundquist was thinking the man had one of the deadest pans joe had ever seen he wouldnt have wanted to play poker against him but you do drive a car as well as work on them lundquist persisted oh yes sir joe said ive had my license since i was sixteen any accidents no sir tickets just one joe thought about lying but they could check the ticket might not wash him out if they nailed him in a lie he figured that was all she wrote the selectionboard chairman shuffled through his folder i see you have your letters of recommendation in place he looked over each of them in turn your boss and your two highschool coaches they know you pretty well if they dont nobody does joe wondered if he should have tried to get letters from important peoplejudges or politicians maybe the only trouble was he didnt know anybody like that im an ordinary joe he thought and grinned a little one more question lundquist said why do you want to do this why sir the day after the japs jumped on pearl harbor my old man tried to join the army he wanted to hit back and so do i they wouldnt take himhes fortyfive and hes got a bad back and a bad shoulder but i was so proud of him i cant even tell you and what he did got me thinking if we are going to hit back at the japs wholl get in the first licks pilots flying off carriers looks like to me so thats what i want to do the man who looked as if hed played second or short remarked kids got a head on his shoulders that made joe feel about ten feet tall he tried not to be dumber than he could help but he was no big brain if they wanted guys with high foreheads and thick glasses to fly their fighters he was out of luck why dont you step outside lundquist told him we need to talk about you behind your back for a little while joe did a double take when he heard that lundquist was a cool customer but maybe he was okay underneath joe could hear them muttering about him in there if he put his ear to the door he might make out what they were saying he didnt do it it was something else where getting caught would land him in hot water not doing it turned out to be smart ten seconds later two guys in sailor suits turned the corner and came past him they paid him no more attention than if he were part of the linoleum but if hed been leaning up against the door that would have been a different story he wanted a cigarette but didnt pull the pack of luckys out of his pocket he didnt want to have a butt in his mouth when they called him back in and itd be just his luck to get halfway down the smoke when the door opened again that turned out to be the right move because a couple of minutes later the door did open come on in son lundquist said have a seat as usual his face gave no clue to what he was thinking he might have been about to give joe what he wanted or to arrest him and send him to alcatraz silence stretched joe craved that cigarette more than ever it would have calmed his nerves slowed his pounding heart finally he couldnt stand it any more and said well well were going to make you an appointment with the psychological officers lundquist said if they dont say youve got an unfortunate tendency to raise hedgehogs in your hat well see if the navy can make a flyboy out of you thank you sir the words seemed cold and useless to joe what he really wanted to do was turn handsprings no promises mind you but you dont look too bad lundquist said the man who looked like a middle infielder added you had all your paperwork in order the first time you came in thats a good sign right thereyoud be amazed how many people have to try three times before they bring us everything we need no promises no but my guess is youve got what it takes see the petty officer at the door lundquist said make yourself a psych appointment for right after the first of the year good luck to you joe thanked him again and left the conference room his feet hardly seemed to touch the ground he might have been flying even without a fighter under him the petty officer who had an impressive array of longservice hashmarks on his sleeve set up the appointment for testing that joe had passed the selection board didnt impress him by all appearances nothing impressed him out in the street joe half expected people to stare at him and point and say theres the kid whos going to shoot tojos medals off his chest they didnt of course to them what hed accomplished didnt show the grayhaired man at the street corner who wore a helmet and an armband with cdcivil defenseon it was visibly part of the war joe wasnt on the same corner a kid in short pants was peddling the examiner more jap landings in the philippines he bawled over and over read all about it joe gave him a nickel and took a paper he read the examiner as he walked back to the garage where he worked lots of people had their noses in newspapers far more than had read as they walked before the war started every so often theyd bump into each other mutter excusemes and keep on reading as they walked not much of the news was good the navy was laying mines outside harbors on the east coast to try to keep german subs away congressmen were fuming that blackout regulations werent strict enough and were being ignored the nazis and reds were both claiming victories in russia rooting for the russians felt funny joes old man had admired mussolini before he got too chummy with hitler and couldnt stand stalin but the usa and the soviet union were on the same side now like it or not howd it go joe his boss asked when he walked in pretty good mr scalzi i think joe answered dominic scalzis family and the crosettis both came from the same village south of naples that wasnt the only reason joe had a job there but it sure didnt hurt he went on thanks again for your letter i had all my ducks in a row and they really liked that good kid thats good scalzi lit a camel joe couldnt see how he smoked them they were strong enough to grow hair on your chest the garage owner was a short round man with a graying mustache he blew a smoke ring then sighed out the rest of the drag in a bluegray cloud i shoulda told em you were a lousy goodfornothing then they wouldnt take you and you could go on workin for me a little longer probably not much joe said if i dont end up a navy flier the draftll get me pretty soon i said a little longer dominic scalzi was a precise man a good thing for a mechanic to be he jerked a thumb at the little washroom off to one side of the work area go on and change into your coveralls long as youre here im gonna get some work outa you see if you can clean the gunk outa mr jablonskis carburetor will you hes been pissing and moaning about it for weeks ill try joe said you want to know what i think i think the carb on a plymouth is a piece of crap i dont give a damn what you think i just want you to clean out the son of a bitch scalzis uniform was an almost navy blue but all it had on it was dom machineembroidered over the left breast pocket joes was just like it except for the name he grabbed a hasty cigarette of his own while he changed out of his jacket and slacks and into the scratchy denim coveralls before he came out he flushed the butt down the toilet he figured on soaking the carburetor in gasoline before he got to work on it gasoline and cigarettes didnt mix once hed soaked everything with the gasoline he went after the valves and springs and made sure no deposits could interfere with their functioning then he reassembled the carb his hands knew what to do almost without conscious thought on his part he had the carburetor back on the engine before he really noticed what he was up to the key was in the ignition he started up the plymouth listened and nodded to himself the car sounded a hell of a lot better than it had when old man jablonski brought it in he waved to his boss scalzi came over wiping his greasy hands on a rag he listened too and gave joe a thumbsup joe grinned it was turning into a pretty damn good day corporal takeo shimizu liked the way things were going nowadays much better than he had a week earlier the attack over the western mountains had made the americans fall back for their very lives they still hadnt pieced together a line to match the one theyd held in front of schofield barracks and wahiawa with a little luck they wouldnt be able to they hadnt quit though a yankee machine gun up ahead spat death across a pineapple field shimizu crouched in a foxhole sooner or later a grenade or mortar bomb would take care of the machinegun crew then hed advance again or if one of his officers gave the order hed advance sooner than that and if the machine gun blew out his brains or chopped his legs out from under him in that case like it or not one of the chowderheads in his squad would get a star on each of his redandgold collar tabs meanwhile meanwhile shimizu lit a cigarette from a pack hed taken off a dead american the tobacco was amazingly smooth and mild any way you look at it the americans live better than we do he thought he made twenty yenabout four dollars and sixty centsa month he wondered what an american corporal got paid more than that or he missed his guess cautiously he stuck his head up for a look around he saw where the machine gun was in a sandbagged position behind a creek whoeverd sited it had known what he was doing if there were no mortars handy he didnt see how anyone could knock it out the gunners would shoot a man with grenades before he got close enough to fling them he ducked down in a hurry he wasnt going to order anybody forward to throw his life away lieutenant yonehara had done that and what had it got him nothing but a grieving family back home of course colonel fujikawa or some other officer could order the men to advance and they would have to go what would happen to them afterwards that was in the hands of karma so shimizu told himself anyway this way forward its clear over here the shout came in japanese from ahead and to the right it wasnt just japanese either it was hiroshima dialectfrom shimizus own part of the countryand oldfashioned hiroshima dialect at that it sounded like somebody whod never been off a farm in the back of beyond till the army grabbed him shimizu would have thought only old grannies talked like that nowadays but if there was a way forward he sprang out of his hole shouting come on men lets drive the yankees back again he wasnt the only one whod emerged quite a few soldiers had heard that shout they all jumped up and started running ahead and to the right and the american machine gun and nearby riflemen remorselessly chopped them down shimizu had learned better than to stay on his feet very long under fire like that he threw himself flat and still on his belly started scraping himself a new hole in the ground amid the screams of the wounded somebody yelled zakennayo a pungent allpurpose obscenityand then went on must be one of those hawaii japanese shimizu dug harder he muttered zakennayo too theyd told him before he set out that there were more people of japanese blood in hawaii than any other group from what hed seen that was likely true most of them had roots around hiroshima too that was why the fifth division which drew its manpower from that region was on oahu now and theyd told him the hawaii japanese would be delighted to see these islands come under the rising sun that wasnt so obvious some of the older men and women seemed glad enough to see the japanese a lot of the younger ones the ones born here seemed anything but this fellow had just got several soldiers shot if we get our hands on him shimizu thought longingly he cursed again as he threw dirt in front of himself the americans and the damned hawaii japanese had suckered him he squeezed the entrenching tool till his knuckles whitened of course the bastard sounded as if he came from the dark side of the moon most of the japanese here had oldfashioned accents they or their ancestors had been peasants to begin with and the language here hadnt changed with time as it had in japan hed just got the foxhole half as good as the one hed left behind when mortar bombs did start whistling down around the american machine gun those bursts sounded sweet to himbut not sweet enough to make him stick his head up out of that foxhole if he did the yankees were liable to blow it off for him you got em its safe come on the alluring japanese voice came from ahead of him this time he sat tight what could they do to that fellow if they caught him hed be even more fun to play with than an ordinary captive soldiers were yelling down stay down its a trick but shimizu heard feet running through the field he also heard the machine gun stutter to life curses and screams followed so did the thuds of bodies crashing to the ground shimizu added his own curses to the din now he was swearing at his own men at least as hard as at the americans if that voice had fooled them oncewell they werent expecting it but if it fooled them twice stay down baka yaro he yelled dumb assholes they were almost dumb enough to deserve getting shot more mortar bombs fell around the machinegun nest you cant hit a damn thing that lying japanese voice jeered maybe on the principle that everything it said was full of crap the mortars really had put the american machine gun out of action maybebut corporal shimizu didnt stick his head up to find out he didnt hear any signs that the men around him were trying to advance either he breathed a sigh of relief some of them could learn after all the ones who couldnt had paid the price for their stupidity after a while the machine gun started up again this time sending a stream of bullets over to the left when another machine gun there answered the fire shimizu did look out from his hole a tank rumbled through the pineapple field straight toward the american machine gun its bow gunner shot back at the yankees enemy bullets clanged off its armor now and then striking sparks but doing no harm the snorting mechanical monster stopped the cannon in the turret bellowed the shell burst just in front of the sandbags shielding the american gun the enemy soldiers were brave they kept right on shooting at the tank it did them no good the cannon spoke again sandbags flew the machine gun kept firing even after that but not for long the tanks bow and turretmounted machine guns had a clear shot at the americans now corporal shimizu sprang from his new foxhole come on he shouted move fast maybe we can catch that hawaii japanese and give him what he deserves if anything would get the men out of their holes and advancing that ought to do the trick and it did they splashed through the creek and past the shattered machinegun nest not many riflemen had backed up the machine gunners the japanese soldiers gained several hundred meters before enemy fire forced them to hit the dirt and dig in again shimizu was proud of the dash they showed but the man whod tricked them got away he didnt know how lucky he wasor maybe he did like most nineteenyearolds in honolulu kenzo takahashi had japanese friends and haole friends and chinese friends and filipino friends and friends who were a little bit of everything everybody was packed together with everybody else in school a good many kids had parents who wished their friends came only from their own group but that wasnt how things worked in hawaiiwhich was why so many kids were a little bit of everything with his friends who werent japanese and even a lot of the time with the ones who were kenzo was just ken that suited him fine ken was a good american name and he was at least as american as he was japanese when he ate with his parents he used hashi to shovel in rice and raw fish when he wasnt with his parents he was likely to order fried chicken or spaghetti and meatballs he liked them better so did hiroshi since the attack on pearl harbor though all of a sudden his haole friends didnt want to know him any more it wasnt just that he was spending most of his time out on the oshima maru either he washed never worked so hard in his lifebut that wasnt the point going home from kewalo basin hed sometimes see people with whom hed sat for four years in math and english and history and science classes hed see them and if they were white theyd pretend they didnt see him sometimes they would even turn their backs so he couldnt possibly miss the point that cut like a knife and he knew those haoles and their folks were lining up to buy the fish he and his father and brother brought in they didnt mind doing that at all oh no especially not when the fish the sampans brought in was the only fresh food coming into honolulu these days what really hurt was when elsie sundberg acted as if shed never set eyes on him in her life thanks to the wonders of alphabetical seating hed had the desk right behind hers in just about all the classes they took together the alphabet could have played plenty of worse tricks on him elsie was blond blueeyed and curvy a cheerleader for the football team she got better grades in english and history he was stronger in science and math theyd spent a lot of time coaching each other theyd gone to a few movies together held hands hed kissed her once hed thought about asking her to the prom but by the time he got up the nerve to do it the star halfback beat him to the punch shed sounded genuinely sorry when she told him no and now now he was nothing but a lousy jap to her it made him want to cry or else to go out and kick something or somebody its not right goddammit he raged to hiroshi later that evening im as much an american as she is the one advantage of having parents whod never learned english was that he and his brother could use it without fear of eavesdropping his brother made a small production of lighting a cigarette only after a long meditative drag did he answer its tough all right some of that same shits happened to me too tough is that all you can say whats the good of trying to be an american if the stinking haoles wont let you he pointed to the pack of chesterfields let me have one of those hiroshi did and leaned close to give him a light after they were both smoking hiroshi said well what other choice have you got do you want to stand up and cheer for hirohito the way dad does jesus christ no kenzo exclaimed thats just embarrassing its worse than embarrassing these days hiroshi dropped his voice even though his and kenzos folks couldnt understand its damn near treason yeah i know kenzo said heavily but you cant tell him anything he wont listen he sucked in smoke then blew it out in a ragged cloud what with the blackout and the radio being off the air almost all the time the night was almost eerily quiet that made it easy for him to hear the thunder in the middle distanceexcept it wasnt thunder the boom of the guns got louder and louder closer and closer as the days went by what do we do if our side doesnt win i dont know his brother smoked his cigarette till the butt got too small to hold between his lips some people were even using toothpicks or alligator clips to hold tiny butts and squeeze an extra drag or two out of them tobacco wouldnt last forever nothing in honolulu would last forever if hawaii fell nothing would last very long hiroshi stubbed out the remains of the chesterfield and stared down at the ashtray what can we do try and keep our noses clean try and keep dad from busting his buttons cause hes so proud its a good thing the sampans going out again kenzo said if dads on the ocean he cant be on the streets somebodyd knock his block off for him or maybe not depending on where he is hiroshi said as long as he stays ewa side of nuuanu avenue he wont do too bad kenzo only grunted that was a half truth older japanese like his father often pulled for their native country most of the younger ones were as american as hiroshi and himself and none of the chinese and koreans and filipinos who helped crowd honolulus asian district had any use for japan that had sometimes led to fights even before pearl harbor now off in the distance the thunder that wasnt thunder rumbled again kenzo grunted again what do we do if if the japanese army marches into honolulu there hed said it what can we do his brother said kenzo shrugged he had no answer hed hoped hiroshi would saburo shindo looked down on honolulu from his zero even from his height he could see olivedrab trucks rolling through the city the time had comeas far as he was concerned the time was long since pastto give the americans a lesson he wondered why his superiors had held off for so long hed heard a lot of japanese lived in honolulu maybe the powers that be hadnt wanted to hurt them or hoped they could somehow get the americans to give up it hadnt happened as far as lieutenant shindo was concerned the best way to make somebody give up was to kick him in the teeth till he did honolulu was about to get kicked in the teeth the place was defended puffs of black smoke from antiaircraft guns were already pocking the sky around the fighters shindo led and around the bombers flying above them antiaircraft guns were a nuisance but they were only a nuisance the americans had next to no combat aircraft left that was what really mattered waggling his wings to the rest of the zeros shindo dropped his fighters nose and dove on the city below the other planes followed those olivedrab trucksand the cars and the buildings past which they droveswelled from ant size to toy size to the real thing now the antiaircraft fire was above his planes he laughed the yankees couldnt depress their guns fast enough to stay with him as if trying to make up for that smallarms fire reached for the zeros all the machine guns and rifles and pistols on the ground seemed to go off at once muzzle flashes and tracers sparked below shindo as usual he ignored them odds were all that stuff would miss him nobody could lead a speeding plane enough people with small arms shot behind aircraft they aimed at and if by bad luck this once they didnt ground fire had already winged shindos plane once it could have been worse but he couldnt do anything about it one way or the other come to that hed had to learn to shoot at ground targets he was pretty good at it now he didnt know whether that truck convoy heading west through the center of town was carrying men or supplies or ammunition he didnt care he shot it up any which way flames exploded from some of the trucks gasoline he thought the less the americans had the less good they could get out of their cars and trucks and tanks he pulled up and went around for another pass a bullet banged through the zeros fuselage about a meter behind where he sat sure as sure put enough rounds in the air and some would hit the plane kept flying this one hadnt hit anything important the truck convoy burned merrily soldiers scrambled out of some of the vehicles some of them fired into the sky others ran for cover he shot up not only the convoy but as many cars on the street as he could now he wasnt just aiming to impede military traffic though he wanted to do that his orders were to make honolulu howl the louder the city howled the likelier the american commanders were to raise the white flag as lieutenant shindo pulled up acceleration and a contemptuous grin thrust his lips back from his teeth japanese officers wouldnt give a damn about how loud civilians howled theyd fight to the last man whatever the odds but the americans were soft decadent effeminate they let extraneous factors like civilians affect even important things like war well they would pay for it shindo automatically checked six a pilot who didnt do that all the time would regret it even though he didnt think the americans could put any more fighters in the air habit was unbreakable one of his zeros went down it sent a fireball and a column of black smoke up into the sky the building it had hit was starting to burn too even in death the pilot did damage shindo nodded saluting his courage the dead mans spirit would go to the yasukunijinjathe shrine for establishing peace in the empireat kudan hill in tokyo the nakajimas and aichis that flew with the fighters were bombing the city now what civilian terror could do it would do shindo hoped it would make the americans give up he was an economical warrior he didnt believe in expending more on objectives than he had to shindo spoke to his fellow fighter pilots on the allplanes circuit mission accomplished now we return to the carriers they mostly werent landing on carrier decks any more still security persisted oahu was so small it made the war seem a miniature painting even haleiwa airstrip on the north coast of the island was less than ten minutes flying time from honolulu the front wasnt that far north of the local capital and pearl harbor the gap between the waianae range and the koolau range widened from north to south which meant the americans had to hold a longer line and stretch themselves thinner as they fell back japanese soldiers might have been the best in the world at taking advantage of weak spots in the enemys defenses other armies had more in the way of heavy equipment yes if japanese pilots hadnt had complete control of the air and smashed up a lot of american heavy equipment before it got into action this would have been a much tougher fight but nobody could match the japanese at infiltrating shells burst on and near the roads north of the front sensibly the americans were trying to deny the japanese the use of them the yankees had fought reasonably well and with considerable courage since the first crippling blows theyd suffered but those were plenty to bury them in a deep deep hole here came haleiwa it had the advantage of being out of range of most american artillery the japanese still couldnt use wheeler field even us mortars could reach the runways south of schofield barracks but the more planes and fuel and equipment the navy ferried off the carriers and onto dry land the sooner some of the precious big ships could be released for other duty down came the zero for a smooth landing not for the first time shindo thought how easy landing at an ordinary airstrip was compared to a carrier landing he got out of the fighter and jumped down groundcrew men in khaki coveralls dragged his zero into a revetment one after another the fighters that had followed him to honolulu came in he counted them nodding as the last planes landing gear kicked up dust hed lost one but no more he went to the command tent commanders genda and fuchida sat in front of a card table probably purloined from a haleiwa house the map they were examining also had to be local for it was printed in english it was larger and more detailed than any japaneselanguage map of oahu that shindo had seen he pointed where did you get it minoru genda looked up a smile half mischievous half bemused on his face from a service station he answered they give them away bako yaro shindo said thinking anyone had to be a stupid jerk to give away something that strategically valuable how did it go genda asked routine for the most part shindo answered a stolid man hed described the opening days raids on pearl harbor much the same way he went on we lost one fighter i saw it go down i dont know if the antiaircraft got any of the bombers and how do things look on your fancy new map theyre sending more and more sailors up from pearl harbor to fight in their line as infantrytrying to get some use out of them mitsuo fuchida said you can give a man a rifle but that doesnt turn him into a soldier hai honto shindo bent closer to the map english meant nothing to him but he knew the topography of oahuand his superiors had already started marking up the map in japanese whats our next move another raid on honolulu or does some part of the front need special softening up oscar van der kirks parents had raised him to be polite no matter what he paid no attention to a lot of what theyd taught him especially the stuff theyd tried to drive home with a sledgehammer but beingand stayingpolite was part of what they were and theyd made it part of what he was most of the time it didnt matter if anything it was an asset more often than not it handicapped him with susie higgins he rapidly figured out why shed got divorced hed had trouble living with her for even a few days and he was a hell of a lot more easygoing than most guys what did puzzle him was how shed got married in the first place oh she was cute and she was fun in the sack but lots of girls were cute and fun in the sack who knew that better than a waikiki beach bum she was also all smiles and happinessas long as you did exactly what she wanted when you didnt you soon discovered she was hard and rough as a steel file underneath hadnt the guy shed briefly been hitched to figured that out before she marched him down the aisle and got him to say i do evidently not poor bastard she quickly lost interest in surfriding even though she could have been good at it why do you want to go out there every single day she demanded dont you get bored he stared at her as if shed suggested getting bored with sex good lord no he said besides some of the people stuck in the hotels still want lessons how else am i going to make any money susie sent him a suspicious stare you just want to meet some gal wholl give you a throw she whined ive got a gal he said dont i you damn well wont if you dont pay more attention to me susie said you come with me oscar suggestedreasonably he thought you come shopping with me susie said that wasnt reasonable not to him the japs have blown up half the stores and how are you going to get anything you buy back to the mainland oahu would fall he could see it even if susie couldnt she started to cry which left him flummoxedhed never had to worry about that with stray kittens god damn you she choked out you dont care about anything do you you didnt even care that yesterday was new years was it oscar knew when christmas had been to celebrate hed bought some tuna from a jap fisherman so he and susie could have a christmas dinner that didnt come out of a can he wasnt much of a cook but he could manage tuna steaks till susie came to hawaii shed never set eyes on fresh tuna remembering when the tuna dinner had been oscar had to count on his fingers to work out that yesterday really had been january first a little sheepishly he said well happy yeah sure susie said bitterly i wish to god id never come here the japs are gonna she didnt say what the japs were going to do instead she dissolved into fresh tears maybe she could see the writing on the wall she wasnt dumb just spoiled as threedayold potato salad oscar realized he was supposed to do something even if he wasnt quite sure what he tried stroking her hair which was what they did in the movies when a girl started crying susie turned and snapped she didnt actually bite but only because he jerked his hand away in a hell of a hurry what do you care why do you give a damn she demanded as long as you can ride your stinking surfboard so what if the japs are in charge of things he gave her a dirty look but no more than a dirty look he was too easygoing to relish screaming rows let alone to smack her in the jaw he wondered if something like that would knock some sense into her stubborn little head but all he did was wonder tears came harder than ever what are we going to do she wailed what do you mean we kemo sabe thought oscar whod followed the lone ranger on the radio till he ended up in hawaiithe local stations didnt carry it but that wasnt fair nobodyd held a gun on him when he invited susie here after the bomb blew her room to hell and gone oh hed had ulterior motives but still ill take care of you the best i can he said scorn blazed from her blue blue eyes you cant even take care of yourself oscar oh yeah what do you call this his wave encompassed the apartment what do i call it susie spoke with deadly precision not much thats what i call it this isnt life this is just drifting existing she was right of course oscar knew that it was part of what had attracted him to hawaii in the first place happens i like it he said mildly and even the most easygoing temper can fray his voice rose if you dont sweetheart you can just darn well hit the highway he pointed to the door he more than half hoped susie would storm out through it she didnt she went pale under her sunburn where would i go what would i do go down to hotel street stand on a corner show a lot of leg i dont care if the japs are bombing downtown honolulu right this minutesomebodyll pick you up in jig time but oscar swallowed that instead of saying it susie might have round heelsshe hadnt wasted any time falling into bed with himbut she wasnt a pro what oscar did say was well if you want to keep on staying here try acting like it okay okay she said in an unwontedly small voice off in the distancenot so very far in the distanceartillery rumbled susie involuntarily turned toward the sound then with what looked like a distinct effort of will she looked back to oscar what do we do if the japs win no she wasnt so dumb she could see what was in front of her nose anyhow i dont know babe oscar answered the best we can i guess theyre going to arent they sure looks like it to me he didnt fancy it any more than she did he didnt see much point in lying to her though i wish id never come here shed said that before yeah well oscar shrugged a little too late to worry about it now dont you think he thought it was a lot too late himself he didnt tell her so it would only have upset her more and what could either one of them do about it not a damn thing not that he could see jim peterson had been eager to get into the fighting hed been so eager hed volunteered to go from navy officer to doughboy in one fell swoop now hed seen some of the war up close and he had only one conclusionhed been out of his goddamn mind he crouched somewhere in the cane fields north of pearl city a jap machine gun was hammering away much too close bullets snarled past him hed acquired an entrenching tool from a skinny blond corporal who wouldnt need it any more he dug like a man possessed in an air fight you had the advantage if you got the edge in altitude here on the ground the deeper your hole the better off you were by the time im done this one will be deep enough to bury me in he thought then he swore under his breath that wasnt how hed wanted to put it no matter what hed wanted though it was liable to be true half the men holding this part of the line were sailors they had plenty of spunk as hed been they were eager for a crack at the enemy but they didnt know the first thing about taking cover or supporting one another or anything about being an infantryman peterson didnt know much only what hed learned falling back from kolekole pass but what hed learned since the japs sent their men into the armys rear made him a seasoned veteran next to most of these guys hed trained and trained and trained to fly a wildcat he knew how hard how complex that was hed never dreamt there was anything particularly hard about being an infantryman he knew better now quite a few of these gobs would turn into pretty fair foot soldiers if they lived long enough a hell of a lot of them would get killed before they learned what they needed to know a wet slapping noise meant a bullet had struck home somewhere close by the howl the wounded man let out meant it hadnt killed him right away hang in there andy an american yelled ill bring you in he came crashing forward through the growing sugarcane all he thought about was saving his buddy saving himself never crossed his mindeither that or more likely he had not the foggiest idea how to do it get down peterson shouted get down you stupid fool maybe he said something stronger than fool he didnt remember afterwards whatever he said it didnt do a damn bit of good the japanese machine gunner was no doubt a louse a stinker a rotten dirty son of a bitch but he was no fool if the american was generous enough to give him a perfect target hed take it he squeezed off a quick tidy burstthree or four rounds the american whod intended to rescue andy crashed down before he got real close to him he wasnt dead either he started moaning for his mother and another brave stupid fellow hurried up to try to rescue both wounded men he had no more idea how to go about it than the first wouldbe hero had and he got shot too oh for christs sake peterson muttered under his breath they were liable to get bled white greenhorns going forward and getting nailed till they ran out of greenhorns or the japs ran out of ammo the japs hadnt shown any signs of running short if you want something done right do it yourself went through petersons mind he did some more muttering this time of the sulfurous sort all three of those wounded men were screaming and moaning he couldnt just leave them out there theyd attract more suckers for that jap to murder either that or hed start shooting them up for the fun of it peterson had seen a few samples of what the japs called fun and heard about more he wouldnt have wished them on a mad dog before he could ask himself what the hell he was doing he scrambled out of his foxhole and crawled toward the wounded men his belly scraped along the ground like a lizards hed learned a thing or two if not three he wished he didnt have his rifle slung on his back but one of the things hed learned was that he couldnt afford to be taken alive if the japs wanted him theyd have to pay for himand he intended to save the last bullet for himself he almost bumped noses with a mongoose which of them was more surprised and appalled would have been hard to say the mongoose scurried away it reminded him of a weasel all slithery grace heart thumping he crawled on the thrashing in the cane up ahead wasnt coming from any mongoose hey up there peterson hissed whos hit worst one of the men just kept calling for his mother another one though said take steve he got a slug in the chest that took balls lying there shot and saying somebody else was worse off than you steve turned out to be the one who wanted his mother andy had a wounded leg the third guy a shattered right arm you can crawl peterson told him follow me back i dont want to leave andy the sailor said through clenched teethhe wore a us navy armband on the left sleeve of a khaki shirt he couldnt do much with one good arm but peterson didnt waste time arguing with him he figured steve would buy his plot if he wasted time going back was ten times as bad as coming forward had been he had to drag the wounded man behind him after a while steve stopped moaning peterson wished he would start again he didnt want to think he might be dragging a corpse and just to make matters worse the japanese machine gunner started spraying bullets around again they made little clipclipclip noises as they cut through the cane peterson knew what kind of noises one of them would make if it cut through him he knew what kind of noises he would make then too a jumpy american almost shot him when he got back into the lines he managed to persuade the kid that he wasnt hirohitos brotherinlaw steve was still breathing peterson managed some weary pride at that stretcherbearers took the injured man away you did good soldier a sergeant said to peterson and then his voice rising in surprise hey where the hell you going two more wounded out there peterson answered if i bring one the other can make it back on his own hes standing guard on his buddy you bring him back and ill make you a corporal on the spot the sergeant promised for a navy lieutenant to be thrilled at the prospect of getting two stripes on his sleeve was one of the more surreal things that had happened since the japs hit pearl harbor but peterson was he crawled back into the cane hoping he would find andy and the man whose name he didnt know they were still making noise so it wasnt too hard but he must have got overenthusiastic moving toward them because the jap machine gunner sent a long burst slicing after him he flattened out like a toad after a truck ran over it working a springfield onehanded was a bastard especially if that one hand was your left but andys buddy had found a way hed propped the muzzle end of the rifle on a rock and aimed it in the direction of the japanese look at young tom edison peterson said the man with the wounded arm managed a grin instead of dragging andy peterson got him up on his back andy was healthy enough to let out a yelp when he did the jap with the machine gun started shooting again a bullet hit peterson heard it he didnt feel it though andy didnt jerk awkwardly peterson looked behind him the man with the wounded arm had been coming after him and andy now the fellow sprawled bonelessly his brains splashed over the dirt aw shit peterson said softly he brought andy in that sergeant saw him do it and gave him the two stripes and a threaded needle two out of three wasnt bad so he told himself again and again but remembering the guy whod stopped a machinegun round with his ear sucked all the pride out of the promotion that could have been me dinned in petersons head sweet jesus that could have been me commander mitsuo fuchida looked down on honolulu from his nakajima bn now remember fuchida told his bombardier we dont want to hit too far inland this time and we dont want to hit too far west thats the japanese part of town yes sir the bombardier sounded more resigned than anything else fuchida tried to remember how many times hed told the man the same thing more than he should have probably the americans kept throwing up antiaircraft fire they showed more spirit than fuchida had expected hed thought they would surrender once they realized japan had got the upper hand but they were still putting up the best fight they could it wouldnt be enough fuchida could see that he suspected the enemy could too that didnt keep the americans from making the fight a shell burst near the nakajima the plane staggered in the air fuchida didnt hear any shrapnel bang the fuselage or wing theres the aloha tower he told the bombardier do you see it yes sir the man replied shall we go after the docks again yes plenty of warehouses there the sooner the americans get hungry the sooner they do what we want down went the stick of bombs the bn bounced in the air not so rudely as it had from the near miss by the shell fuchida watched the bombs tumble toward their target the bursts sent up clouds of smoke and dust ha the bombardier said i think one of those hit the tower itself nicely done fuchida wanted to keep his crewman happy he didnt care about the aloha tower one way or the other it mounted no guns as far as he knew it stored no food still if you did hit it that will be a blow to the americans pride hai the bombardier said pride is about all they have left neh they still have soldiers and guns fuchida pointed out the bombardier laughed fat lot of good those have done them in a strictly military sense he was right but the japanese were monitoring radio stories from the mainland about the heroes of hawaii the americans here might be doomed to failure they still made good propaganda and helped distract the people of the usa from the advances general hommas army was making in the philippines and the rapid push down the malayan peninsula toward singapore against the british things are going our way fuchida thought we have to keep moving fast if we let up if we let our enemies catch their balance we could be in trouble but so far everything is fine other bombers were pounding the docks and the area just inland from them unopposed bombers could do dreadful things to cities the germans had shown as much over rotterdam and belgrade now japan having swept away american air power in hawaii and the philippines was teaching the same lesson to honolulu and manila fuchida wondered if the rumors hed heard could be true had the americans in the philippines really let their planes get caught on the ground the japanese hadnt hit them from formosa till a day after fighting opened here in hawaii people said general macarthur was supposed to be a good commander if hed been caught with his pants down like that though a japanese officer would have slit his belly to atone for the disgrace the americans seemed to lack the idea of seeking an honorable death they lacked all sorts of notions of honor and yet no one could fault the courage with which theyd fought here in hawaii the contrast left fuchida puzzled how could courage come into being without honor the other thing that puzzled him was how so much courage sprang from so much wealth the homes the swarms of motorcars the vast numbers of telephones and radios all of it made a japanese stare in astonished disbelief the meat and vegetables in the shops had been a surprise too but they were starting to run low put everything together and it was amazing the yankees werent too soft to fight somehow though they werent fuchida swung the bn back to the north for the short hop back to haleiwa all hops here were short which saved fuel not all of what the bomber was burning had come off the akagi quite a bit was taken from captured filling stations the americans with all the petroleum in the world at their fingertips hadnt thought to destroy much of what was in that stock to keep the japanese from using it more antiaircraft shells burst around the bomber as fuchida flew over the front the americans were falling back into the high ground that covered honolulu from the north they might be hard to root out of there fuchida shrugged in the privacy of the cockpit the army had done a good job so farbetter than hed expected it should be up to this too wish we had some more bombs on board sir so we could drop some on these fellows heads the bombardier said we have people paying attention to them i promise fuchida said dryly i know that sir the bombardier answered but i want to do it myself every man in his place fuchida said but the bombardier showed fine martial spirit of course the japanese had it they were a warrior race schooled in the ways of bushido it was the americans who should have been without it but they made warriors too fuchida shrugged again however strange that was it was the truth he landed at that first captured airstrip by haleiwa elsewhere in the north combat engineers were making new runways with captured earthmoving equipment ordinary american builders had more bulldozers and other heavy machinery than japanese military engineersanother example of american prodigality or maybe just of american wealth how did it go sir a groundcrew man asked as fuchida climbed out of the bomber according to plan he answered and laughedhe sounded like lieutenant shindo but it was true just according to plan lousy jap kenzo takahashi heard that shout every time he stuck his nose outside lousy stinking jap it had been bad before it was worse now that the japanese were bombing honolulu that brought the war home to people for whom even after pearl harbor it hadnt seemed quite real hard to deny reality when you were out on the street because your house and maybe your wife or your son too had been blown to smithereens the only good thing about being out on the street in honolulu in january was that you wouldnt freeze the way you might somewhere on the mainland if you had a sweater that was plenty even if you didnt youd get by but if you were on the street and you saw a young man with goldenbrown skin high cheekbones slanted eyes and coarse black hair you werent going to wish him the top of the morning and ask him how he was im not a jap im an american kenzo had tried protesting the first few times people showered abuse on him it had got him exactly nowhere accomplished exactly nothing it just made people yell at him even more it had also almost got him into a couple of fistfights one of those would have happened if a cop hadnt broken it up the policeman a haole hadnt wanted his thanks i aint got much use for you neither kid he said but theres too much real shit going on to waste time with pissant stuff get the hell out of here kenzo got he told hiroshi about it he didnt tell his father he knew what his old man would have said that it proved he ought to be saluting the rising sun and not the stars and stripes he couldnt stomach that i am an american dammit he raged even if the haoles cant see it yeah i know me too hiroshi said but you know what its not just the haoles yelling at us these days its everybodychinese koreans filipinos his grin was haggard kenzo only grunted part of that fell under what can you expect japan was at war with china ruled korea and now had invaded the philippines but it still stung just as haoles in hawaii looked down their noses at everybody else with the partial exception of the hawaiians themselves and they werent competition the japanese here thought themselves better than koreans and filipinos and probably chinese too you know how bad it is hiroshi said kenzo shook his head his brother said even the puerto ricans are yelling goddamn jap these days oh jesus christ kenzo said unconsciously echoing his father there werent many puerto ricans in hawaii the ones who were there were seen as thieves and crooks and grifters by everybody else the story was that the governor of puerto rico lo these many years ago asked for a shipload of laborers had provided it by emptying the local jails and whorehouses kenzo didnt know if the story was true but everybody told it getting out on the pacific in the oshima maru was something of a relief kenzo had never imagined he would think something like that but his father however loopy the old mans ideas were didnt hate him the other advantage of going to sea was not being there when the bombs went off that didnt help so much though because kenzo still worried about his mother as they pulled out of kewalo basin hiroshi said father why not bring mother on the sampan that way wed all be safe together i said this father answered she told me she didnt want to come what am i supposed to do drag her hiroshi didnt say anything to that kenzo wouldnt have known what to say to it either they just stood there listening to the engine the sampan had enough fuel to get to kauai or maui but so what what difference did that make even if they got mother aboard theyd be nothing but refugees and for all kenzo knew the japanese army was already on the other islands even if it wasnt it probably would be soon the us army hadnt garrisoned them they couldnt put up any kind of a fight oahu now oahu had put up a hell of a battle and a whole lot of good its done anybody too kenzo thought bitterly the fighting here couldnt go on much longer either the diesel throbbed under his feet for how long would his father be able to keep it fueled how much longer would the food last what would people do when it started running out starve was what occurred to kenzo that might be a reason to get off oahu the other islands had fewer people and might have bigger reserves or they might notwith fewer people maybe theyd got less in the way of supplies to begin with that was probably how things went all right they seemed to be going the worst way they could vi the gardener who spoke for major hirabayashi in wahiawa was named tsuyoshi nakayama some people called him yosh till this mess started jane armitage hadnt called him anything shed never had anything to do with him what she and a few other haoles were calling him these days was quisling they were careful about where when and to whom they said it though let the wrong ears hear and jane didnt know what would happen then she didnt want to find out either to give nakayama his due he didnt seem to relish being the occupiers mouthpiece he didnt shrink from the job though what the japs told him to do and say he did and said theyd confiscated guns and food just after they took the town radios lasted only a couple of days longer if jane had had a little one she might have tried to hide it she didnt have a prayer with the big bulky shortwave set when a japanese soldier carried it away she felt as if he were stealing the world from her she soon discovered she was lucky she hadnt tried anything cute mr murphy the principal at the elementary school had had two radios hed given the japanese one and secretly hung on to the other not secretly enoughsomebody ratted on him through yosh nakayama major hirabayashi called the people of wahiawa into the streets mr murphy hands tied behind his back stood in front of hirabayashi the officer spoke in japanese nakayama translated this man disobeyed an order of the imperial japanese army the punishment for disobeying an order is death he will receive the punishment watch and think about him so this does not happen to you two soldiers forced mr murphy down to his knees the principal looked astonished as if he couldnt believe this was happening to him he didnt seem afraid which also argued that he didnt believe it surely the japs would call it off once theyd taught him his lesson major hirabayashi drew his sword jane had seen it there on his hip before she hadnt thought about it it seemed about as useful in modern war as a buggy whip now all at once she noticed that the major had lovingly kept it sharp the blade was slightly curved the edge glittered in the sun hirabayashi raised the sword above his head with a sudden wordless shout he swung it in a gleaming arc of death it bit intobit throughmr murphys neck the principals head leaped from his shoulders blood fountained amazingly red some of it splashed the soldiers whod held the american mr murphys body convulsed the spasms went on for a couple of minutes his head lay in the street it blinked once before the features slackened into deaths blankness somehow that blink sickened jane worse than all the gore and the flopping had he known what had happened to him even if just for a few seconds some people in the crowdwomen and men bothscreamed several threw up some made the sign of the cross a hulking sixfooter who ran a hardware store keeled over in a faint his wife who barely came up to his chin kept him from smashing his face on the asphalt hirabayashi wiped his bloody blade on mr murphys trousers then slid it back into the scabbard he shouted something angrysounding in japanese you will obey yosh nakayama translated if you do not obey you will be sorry do you understand no one said anything hirabayashi shouted again even louder nakayama said he wants to know if you understand a ragged chorus of yeses rose from the crowd some of the people whod crossed themselves did it again major hirabayashi grunted again and turned his back nakayama gestured to the locals it was over singly and in small groups they straggled back to their homes jane was aloneand had never felt more alone in her life shed seen mr murphy every day since getting her teaching job here he wasnt the most exciting human being ever bornwhat principal was but he was solid competent plenty likable if you didnt happen to be a fourthgrader in trouble now he was dead for a radio he was dead hardly anyone talked about themurder execution as the crowd drained away part of that no doubt was shock and part of it probably had to do with fear over who might be listening somebody youd lived across the street from for the last twenty years might sell you down the river to the japs how could you know till too late why would you take the chance people in russia and nazi germany and the countries hitler had overrun had to make calculations like that americans even a month earlier jane never would have believed it but if you didnt make those calculations or if you got them wrong you might be the next mr murphy and it wasnt just the local japanese you had to look out for jane had seen more than one haole sucking up to the occupiers some people had to be on the ins with whoever was in charge if it was the usual authorities fine if it was a bunch of bastards with gunsand with swords oh yes with swordswell that was fine too there was one more thing jane wouldnt have believed till she saw it with her own eyes she locked the door behind her when she got to the apartment she hadnt been in the habit of doing that till the japs came it wouldnt help her a hell of a lot now either the rational part of her mind knew that she locked the door anyway because she wasnt feeling any too rational these days she wished she could fix herself a good stiff drink but fletch had taken most of the booze when he left shed been glad to see it go toothen and the rest had been confiscated along with the food she was stuck with her own thoughts no matter how much she hated them the thunk of the sword as it slammed into mr murphys neck that last blink after he wasafter he had to bedead oh jesus she moaned as close to a prayer as had passed her lips in years the worst of it was shed have to go out again for supper the communal meals had started off bad and were getting worse as stocks of this and that began to run out she was damned if she knew what they would do in a few months damned is right jane muttered and damnation might not wait for months it might be only weeks away she wondered how much food other people had given up and how much the japs had taken from groceries how long would it last how long could it last well find out she also wondered whether the occupiers gave a damn wouldnt they be just as happy if everybody on oahu except maybe their few special friends starved to death then they wouldnt have to worry about keeping an eye on them any more with that cheery thought echoing in her head she went to supper it was rice and noodles and local vegetables and a small chunk of cheese that was starting to be past it before the japs came the food would have appalled her now all she cared about was that it filled her belly quantity had routed quality people had chatted over meals no one said much this evening mr murphys death hung over wahiawa the way that cloud of black smoke had hung over pearl harbor for so long jane went straight home when she finished eating shed been on dishwashing detail the week before all the women in town took turns at it not for the first time jane wondered why nobody had included the men who was going to suggest it to major hirabayashi though that chopped the head off that idea stop it she told herself fiercely but she couldnt two days later somebody knocked at the door fear shot through her these days a knock on the door was likely to mean trouble not a neighbor wanting to borrow a stick of butter the knock came again loud insistent jane trembled as she went to open the door shed started taking in another lesson americans should never have had to learn tsuyoshi nakayama stood there with two younger local japanese behind him you are mrs jane armitage he said jane nodded he made a checkmark on a list where is your husband mrs armitage i dont know we were getting a divorce whenwhen the war started jane answered that was true no one could say it wasnt she didnt want to tell him shed been married to a soldier who could guess what he or hirabayashi might do if she did he could find out if he poked around but even if he did she hadnt lied the gardener just shrugged now you live here alone then he asked janes head went up and down again yosh nakayama nodded too he wrote something else on the list what was it jane couldnt tell not knowing alarmed her nakayama looked up we may run short of food he said this time jane nodded eagerly if he wanted to talk about food he didnt want to talk about fletch everybody had to worry about eating not everybody had to worry about a husband in the army i am going to give you turnip seeds and pieces of potatoes with eyes nakayama said you will plant them you will grow them you will take care of them we hope we can start growing things to eat soon enough to keep from getting too hungry plant them where how jane asked she didnt know the first thing about farming but it looks like im going to find out you have been assigned a plot yosh nakayama told her i have tools for you the young men behind him carried a spade a hoe a rake and a trowel they thrust them at jane now nakayama went on plenty of people here know what to do ask them they will be in the fields too and the seeds come with instructions follow them follow them with care turnips jane couldnt remember the last time shed eaten a turnip back in ohio they fed hogs more often than people nakayama shrugged they grow fast you can eat the root and the greens we have to do whatever we can we will all be hungry soon other people will raise beans and corn and squash and whatever else we have we need to work hard otherwise we will be worse than hungry what about the jap soldiers will they help us farm but jane didnt have the nerve to ask the question she accepted the seeds and the quartered potatoes all she did ask was where will my uh plot be i will show you come on he led her downstairs and out to the street a whole stretch of lawn had been divided into sections with stakes and twine yosh nakayama pointed to one of those sections this is yours you will clear it and plant it clear it jane echoed the gardener just nodded impatiently jane looked down at her hands they were nice and soft the only callus she had was a small one on the middle finger of her right hand a writers callus that was going to change if she had to dig out all that grass and plant vegetables she sighed not too loud what about bugs and things it is a problem nakayama admitted hawaii was chock full of all kinds of bugs you couldnt ship local fruit to the mainland for fear of turning them loose there he went on we do have to try though if we dont try we try starving instead which would you rather do jane had no answer to that none at all fletcher armitage stared in dismay at the de soto that had hauled his down from the north coast of oahu to not far from the outskirts of honolulu the de soto sat on the grass sad and lopsided fletch was glad the burst of japanese machinegun fire had missed him and his crew and so it had but there were fresh holes in the car and three of its tires were flat one of the infantrymen hed collared into serving the gun came up beside him and said sir if it was a horse id shoot it yeah fletch had fixed flats before but he saw no way in hell to do it this time two of those inner tubes didnt just have holes in them theyd been chewed to pieces then he brightened tell you what clancy theres houses around here if you and your buddies bring me back wheels with fresh tires on em i wont care where they came from hed started breaking rules when he commandeered the de soto in the first place he was ready to keep right on doing it if that meant he could go on hitting back at the japs maybe somebody would make him go stand in a corner later on hed worry about that then if there was a then ill see what we can do lieutenant clancy said with a grin hey dave arnie come on he appreciated larceny by now he and his pals made pretty fair artillerymen too baptism by total immersion fletch thought the soldiers grabbed their rifles and hurried off if some civilian didnt fancy watching the wheels from his car walk with jesus a springfield was a terrific persuader fletch hoped the men found a jap to rob not a haole that wasnt fair but he didnt give a damn every time he saw an oriental face he suspected its owner was on the enemys side airplanes droned by high overhead he gave the japanese bombers the finger that was all he could give them even as he did it he knew a certain amount of relief they werent going to drop anything on him if not for the japs air power he thought the army would have held them yeah and if ifs and buts were candied nuts wed all have a hell of a christmas as things were the americans were losing hope he could feel it theyd thought they could stop the japs in front of schofield barracks and wahiawa then those enemy soldiers appeared in their rearand they hadnt been the same since he had to admire the japs whod got over the waianae range that didnt mean he didnt want to kill them all but he knew theyd pulled off something astonishing after its hasty retreat from a line that was just coming together the us army simply hadnt been the same if it got shoved off the hills here the next stops were pearl harbor and honolulu fletch wondered if hed have to aim his up hotel street at the advancing japanese soldiers and sailors would fight like madmen to hang on to the redlight district wouldnt they he heard more airplane engines these werent droningthey were screaming fletch dove for a hole in the ground he hadnt been on the receiving end of a divebomber attack for a while he could have done without the honor now too the japs cared for his opinion as much as they usually did one of the planes shot by overhead almost low enough for him to reach up and snag the fixed landing gear the bomb went off much too close it slammed his face down into the dirt he spat mud and tasted blood when he did it that didnt surprise him he was probably also bleeding from the nose and ears he counted himself lucky he was still breathing and with luck he still had his gun crew clancy and dave and arnie were off scrounging tires fletch climbed out of the hole his dive left him even filthier than he had been a minute before they said it couldnt be done he thought vaguely he felt vague all right as if hed just taken a joe louis right to the jaw blast could do that to you then looking around he couldnt decide whether to laugh or cry the bomb had flipped the commandeered de soto over on its back like a turtle except turtles didnt catch fire when that happened to them with or without new tires or wheels it wasnt going anywhere ever again that was almost funny but the bomb had also knocked his gun over on its side the weighed almost two and a half tons on its carriage that hadnt been enough to keep it upright one wheel still spun lazily fletch wanted to kick the piece he couldnt fire it he couldnt move it i cant do shit he said and heard himself as if from very far away then he remembered the de soto had been carrying ammunition he yelped sprang back into the hole in the ground and flattened himself out again sure as hell the shells started cooking off one after another as the flames got to them that probably made for a spectacular fireworks display but you wouldnt have wanted to watch from too close fletch hugging the ground as shell fragments screeched past overhead was much too close when the booming stopped he cautiously looked up from the hole he might have been a groundhog curious about his shadow what he was curious about was the de soto and whether any pieces of it bigger than a bobby pin were left as far as he could tell the answer was no ten minutes later the men from the gun crew came back each of them rolling along a wheel with tire and inner tube on it they stared at the overturned gun and at what was left of the car that had drawn it fuck lieutenant clancy said why didnt you tell us to bring back a whole automobile please accept my apologies gentlemen fletch said with what he thought was commendable dignity if you can get one please do some rope would be nice too maybe we can get the gun back on its wheels he thought he would need to do that pretty damn quick if he was going to do it at all it wasnt just that he wanted to keep shooting at the japs though he did but it looked as if the army was going to retreat again and he wanted to hang on to the gun if he possibly could hed brought it this far after all what went through his head was yeah and a hell of a lot of good its done me what had he accomplished with the oh hed blown up a tank and hed probably killed or maimed a bunch of japanese soldiers hed never seen but so what if hed done anything really worth bragging about would the us army have been down here on the outskirts of honolulu if everybodyd done something really worth bragging about if that had happened some scout plane would have spotted the japanese carriers and the invasion force before they plastered oahu the carriers would have been attacked and driven off or sunk if the landing force had managed to hit the beach it would have been slaughtered right there as soon as the japs wrecked the fleet and worse wrecked the local us air power that was the ballgame right there clancy and dave and arnie didnt worry about such thingsor if they did they didnt show it well find you a ride lieutenant dave said aint nothin to get all hot and bothered about he nudged his pals come on guys lets get it done off they went with as much swagger as if they were still fighting at waimea fletch wearily shook his head he wished he could keep his pecker up like that japanese artillery started pounding the positions in front of him the jap guns were poorly sited he could see their muzzle flashes if hed had anything to shoot back with he would have made them sorry but all he could do right now was watch few of their shells came back far enough to get close to him none came close enough to make him dive for cover he would have for some of them when the war got started misses that would have terrified him then he took for granted now what he didnt take for granted were men straggling away from the line the japs were shelling they looked as if theyd had themselves a bellyful of war and didnt want any more get back to your positions he shouted at them what the hell do you think youre doing some of them just kept walking they werent running but they werent going to fight any more either one man said it dont make no fuckin difference now shit were licked two or three others nodded get back to your positions fletch snapped thats an order goddammit they ignored him he didnt know what to do if he picked up his rifle and tried giving that order again quite a few of them had rifles too they might not want to use them against the japs any more but he didnt think theyd be shy about turning them on him what was an army when soldiers stopped obeying officers it wasnt an army any more that was for damn sure it was just a mob that had happened to the russians and the germans at the end of the last war now fletch saw it here the soldiers trudged past him more followed in their wake the americans had done everything they could here now some of thema lot of themwere deciding they couldnt do any more and might as well save their own skins was anybody still at the front would the japs be along in another ten minutes fletch didnt want to meet them by himself unlike a lot of his countrymen though he didnt want to run away from them either he stood irresolute peering north and west a shiny maroon ford convertible drove up against the tide of retreating men clancy waved to fletch aint this some snazzy hot rod he yelled from behind the wheel itll do fletch said grateful his merry men hadnt got the hell out of there in that snazzy hot rod you have rope dave and arnie hopped out of the ford dave displayed a coil he and fletch fixed it to the gun while arnie tied the other end to the cars front bumper fletch waved to clancy who put it in reverse the rope came taut the tires spun kicking up dust fletch figured either nothing would happen or the dead weight would pull the fords bumper off but when the stirred a little hope also stirred in him he rushed to the gun and started pushing with all his might come on goddammit he yelled to arnie and dave they joined him grunting and straining we can do it maybe we can do it put your backs into it give us a hand you lazy bastards arnie growled at three retreating soldiers for a wonder they did for an even bigger wonder the gun thumped over into its wheels sweat ran down fletchs face hed pulled something in the small of his back he didnt give a damn thats the way he panted lets get her hitched up and he stopped after that what else could he do but retreat too this is the way the world ends jim peterson thought t s eliot hadnt known a thing about it when the british surrendered to the american colonists at yorktown their band had played the world turned upside down petersons world was turning upside down under his feet the little yellow men from tokyo were walloping the tar out of their american foes that wasnt supposed to happen it wasnt supposed to be possible but it was real real as the stink that rose from him because he hadnt bathed in he couldnt remember how long pearl city lay just north of pearl harbor it housed sailors whod been stationed there and civilians whod worked there it had been a pleasant little town now it was on the front line palm trees and norfolk island pines lay in the streets uprooted by bombs and shells what had been nice little homes were now smoldering bulletpocked rubble as far as fighting went rubble wasnt so bad it gave better cover than it would have before it got smashed hey peterson said the sergeant whod given him his stripes the mans name was bill mckinley and he answered to prez peterson just grunted they crouched in a wrecked kitchen peering out through the glassless window toward the north a hole in the roof about the size of a cow let in sun and rainsometimes both at once mckinley went on you take any money or any other shit off a dead jap nope peterson shook his head how come on account of if you did i was gonna tell you to ditch it the sergeant answered the japs catch you with any of that stuff they figured you killed one of their boys theyre even worse on you then than they are any other time not me motion up ahead made petersons finger tense on the trigger then he relaxed it was just a mynah bird hopping across a lawn looking for worms and bugs the birds had no idea what war was all about peterson wished he didnt he shot mckinley a sidelong glance you figure the japs are going to catch us dont get me wrongim still fighting mckinley said hastily but i dont see the cavalry riding over the hill in the last reel do you before peterson could say anything a gunshot made him flinch he hated doing that but couldnt help it his only consolation was that almost everybody else did it too he said looking at where were at id say we could use the goddamn cavalry right about now bet your ass sergeant mckinley said but if we aint got it that motion behind a hibiscus bush wasnt a mynah peterson brought up his rifle fired and ducked away from the window all in one smooth motion he worked the bolt to chamber a fresh round the brass cartridge from the last one clinked on the linoleum at his feet youre getting pretty good at this shit navy mckinley said by now he knew about petersons disreputable origins up yours prez peterson said mildly you cant say i havent had practice youre still breathing so you musta done something right the sergeant laughed if you were in your right uniform youd be tellin me what to do instead of the other way round damn near makes it worth my while peterson said and mckinley laughed again an american machine gun a couple of houses over fired a short burst then a longer one very cautiously peterson went to the window and peered out if the japs were up to something he wanted to find out what it was some men in the dark khaki that they wore were moving a few hundred yards to the north but he didnt have a clear shot at them he ducked away again well mckinley asked nothing much i dont think he answered i wish to hell this kitchen had two windows so we could look out from more than one place way things are if a jap sniper draws a bead on that one hes liable to punch our tickets for us you want to move its okay by me mckinley said before peterson could answer he heard freighttrain noises in the air he threw himself flat before the first shells started bursting japanese artillery was probably after that machine gun but that meant it was coming down on his head too he was glad mckinley hadnt spoken sooner if there was anything worse than being upright and out in the open when shellfire started coming in he didnt know offhand what it might be just their lousy threeinch popguns mckinley shouted through the din yeah i know peterson answered but wheres our artillery most of it had been wrecked and most us artillerymen were likely dead jap fighters and dive bombers had gone after the american guns with everything they had it made sense rifles and machine guns were just nuisances on the battlefield artillery killed artillery also pinned down us infantry so japanese foot soldiers could advance if you rose up to shoot at the japs you asked to get flayed by flying fragments if you didnt you had the enemy sliding around your flank peterson and mckinley both rose up you could take your chances with shellfire sometimes you had to but if the japs flanked them out of this position where would they go into the pacific that was where they had next to no place left to retreat and sure enough the japs were coming both americans fired the japanese soldiers went down some of them shot back others dashed past them running all crouched over then they dove for cover and the ones in the rear advanced fire and move mckinley said slapping in a fresh clip its pretty when you do it well and those bastards know how terrific peterson snapped off another shot this was one of the intricacies of ground combat hed never imagined when he was flying fighter planes the sailors coming up into the line from pearl harbor hadnt either maybe some of them did now a lot of them had got shot before they could learn a shell slammed into the house with a rending crash the walls shook part of the roof that hadnt fallen in did now a bullet came in through the window and clanged off a pot hanging on the far wall peterson waited for the american machine gun to start slaughtering the oncoming japs when it stayed silent he glanced over to sergeant mckinley if prez said this was the place to make a stand hed do it this was part of what hed signed up for but mckinley said wed better fall back a couple of houses we dont want em to go sliding around behind us and cutting us off thats how you get captured he made a horrible face right peterson said tightly and made another one they did fall back and fell in with more americans it was only a tiny retreat now the japs would have a tougher time breaking through so peterson told himself over and over again he had a devil of a time making himself believe it by the time the train pulled into the station at durham north carolina joe crosetti whod never been out of california before had stared out the window in fascination all the way across the country going over the rockies had been something going across the great plains had been something toomiles and miles and miles as flat as if somebodyd ironed them half the time under a blanket of snow seeing all that white was pretty amazing by itself it had snowed in san francisco only two or three times in crosettis life and never since he was a kid but there it was white and silent and beautiful joe thought so anyway sitting next to him was a guy named orson sharp whod got on the train in salt lake city its just snow for heavens sake he said he was blond and pinkcheeked and earnest with the start of a double chin aside from that there was nothing soft about him he was on the chunky side that was all the sort who would have played the line in football maybe its just snow to you but its snow to me joe answered orson sharp only shrugged joe got the feeling he thought that was funny to the point of being ridiculous but was too polite to say so most fellows his age would have razzed joe unmercifully if they thought something like that crosetti eyed sharp with something approaching suspicion wondering what his angle was as the train got farther east it rolled pastsometimes rolled throughforests full of barebranched trees that bemused joe too some of the trees in san francisco lost their leaves some yeah but not all these looked like a horde of skeletons with their arms held high streams and ponds had ice on themnot all but the smaller ones that was something else joe hardly ever saw back home san francisco never got very hot and it never got very cold either as far as he was concerned that was the way things were supposed to work when he said so orson sharp did laugh maybe where you come from he said in salt lake it can get up over a hundred and down below zero too having the same weather all the time must get boring its not the same all the time joe said he didnt think so anyway maybe things looked different if you came from somewhere like utah he hadnt needed long to decide orson sharp was a strange breed of cat trainees bound for chapel hill filled the car blue language filled the air most guys among themselves used profanity for emphasis almost for punctuation joe did and hed never thought of himself as particularly foulmouthed but as far as he could tell sharp didnt swear at all he didnt drink coffee either when they went to the dining car joe guzzled the stuff gotta get my heart started some kind of way he said he wondered if sharp would give him an argument the way temperance people did if you had anything good to say about the demon rum but the wouldbe flier from salt lake just nodded and said whatever you think is right for yourself how come you dont think its right for you joe asked quickly adding dont answer if you think im sticking my nose in where it doesnt belong he didnt want to get sharp mad strange breed of cat or not he seemed a pretty good guy and he smiled now thats okay i dont mind my religion teaches that we shouldnt smoke or drink alcohol or coffee or tea your religion joe scratched his head he knew some jews and knew they didnt eat pork or if they were strict enough shrimp or lobsters or clams either but they drankand they drank coffee too and they smoked then probably slower than it should have a light went on in his head youre one of those mormons arent you thats right orson sharp laughed havent you ever seen one before probablysan franciscos a big city but not that i ever knew of joe gave sharp a curious look did he have three wives back home did his father have three wives or thirtythree that was what you heard about mormons he suddenly realized sharp knew just what he was thinking well the other young man said no fangs no horns no tail joes ears got hot he suspected he turned red to keep from showing it he raised his coffee cup to his lips then he lowered it even something as ordinary as drinking coffee all at once felt funny heck with it he said im a catholic theres people who dont like us either but were all americans first right instead of coffee orson sharp had a glass of apple juice by his plate of bacon and eggs and hash browns he lifted it as if making a toast were all americans first thats just right and were not america first either damn straight joe exclaimed those damn fools helped the japs catch us with our pants down in hawaii you listen to them nothing could ever happen to us so we didnt have to worry about the war shows how much they knew doesnt it most of them have wised up since then sharp said and joe nodded pearl harbor and the invasion had knocked the bottom out of isolationism just about everyone whod believed in it had come to his senses since the handful who hadnt were crackpots and chowderheads and profascists nobody worth paying any attention to listen joe said if we get a chance to pick roomies when we get where were going you want to stick together sure sharp said why not he stuck out his hand in the clasp it almost swallowed up joes young navy officersensigns and lieutenants junior grademet the train at the durham station they divided the newly arrived flying cadets into groups of fifty or so the ensign in charge of joes group was a tall greeneyed fellow named don ward i am your mother he announced in an accent not far removed from where they were several people snickered ward waited till they were through then repeated himself i am your mother thats what they call my duty i am supposed to shepherd you all through this here training course and i aim to do it i am also supposed to keep you out of mischief and i aim to do that too he got his charges aboard a bus that barely held them and their luggage with much grinding of gears the bus chugged toward chapel hill about twelve miles away the town proved tiny the business block hardly more than a block long homes seemed pleasant enough often separated from one another by ivycovered walls except for the cedars all the trees that would have given shade in the summertime were naked now without their leaves on them joe couldnt tell one kind from another the university of north carolina dominated chapel hill the bus wheezed to a stop in front of a threestory brick building a native californian joe didnt like brick buildings they fell down in earthquakes he laughed at himself wondering when north carolina had last had an earthquake that would be okay this is old east ensign ward told his charges its almost a hundred and fifty years oldthe oldest state college building in the country maybe he thought people would be impressed to hear that joe was impressed all right but probably not the way dillon had in mind wonderful he thought theyre sticking us in a goddamn ruin old east will be your home while youre here you will be four to a room ward waited out the groans then went on this is not the worst introduction to navy life if you cant get the hang of living in each others pockets you probably dont belong here ships are crowded places you need to get used to the idea if youve already started pairing off thats okay well try to accommodate you joe caught orson sharps eye the cadet from utah nodded in a voiceless whisper joe asked got anybody else in mind sharp shook his head not yet how about you he answered just as quietly nope joe said want to trust to luck or do you see anybody you especially want to snag luck will do sharp said this looks like a pretty good bunch of guys how can we go wrong he and joe were about the same age but joe felt ten years older somehow the cadet from utah had missed out on his share of cynicism how can we go wrong joe thought just wait and see youll find out how we can but orson sharp expected things to go right not wrong joe didnt know whether to call him a pollyanna or to envy him his confidence they got joined up with bill frank who was from oakland and otis davis whod got on the train in st louis frank and davis seemed to be a pair too that made joe feel a little betterat least they werent guys nobody else wanted anything to do with the room wasnt as bad as joe had expected that was about as much as he could say for it it wasnt big enough to swing a cat but he hadnt looked for anything different there the ironframed bunk beds also came as no surprise it did boast electricity and running water even if you could tell they were addons the people whod built the room hadnt thought there would ever be such things whoever built the room hadnt thought there would ever be such things as human beings in it either that was how it seemed to joe anyhow the window was tiny and set high in the wall so it let in only a little light and gave a lousy view and the place had a peculiar kind of airlessness to it it felt stuffy with the door open and got downright stifling with the door closed otis davis said im glad well be out of there before the hot weather comes this placed be a bake oven like you wouldnt believe gevalt bill frank said i hadnt thought of that only goes to show youre from the west coast davis said if you came from a place where it gets hot and muggy youd know the signs this is a pretty crazy town not even big enough for a train station joe said don ward stuck his head into the room supper at he announced thats an hour and a half from now lights out at reveille tomorrowand every dayat tomorrow youll draw your clothes and do another pile of paperwork and after that gentlemenhis grin went hard and ruthlesswe put you to work joe was still slow at translating military time into what he was used to he said lights out at half past nine sir is that right he hadnt gone to bed that early since he was thirteen years old but ward only nodded that is correct mr crosetti people didnt have any trouble remembering joes last name once they heard it accurately interpreting the expression on his face ward added youll find enough to do to tire yourself out by then trust me mr crosettiyou will and leaving that promise behind he went down the hall to pass the word to the next dorm room so sorry jirosan tomatsu okamoto said nervously so sorry but i havent got any more fuel to sell you im all out flanked by his sons jiro takahashi glowered at the man from whom hed been buying diesel fuel for years hed known this day was coming but he hadnt expected it so soon you had plenty day before yesterday he growled where did it go did you drink it okamoto laughed nervously not me he said the army confiscated everything i had left they said they had to keep their trucks running as long as they could does anybody else have any jiro asked do you know i dont know not for a fact but i wouldnt bet on it okamoto answered im not a big operator not even close if theyre down to taking away my stock theyve already sucked the others dry jiro nodded that made more sense than he wished it did what am i going to do now he asked not so much of old man okamoto as of the whole uncaring world around him how am i supposed to take the oshima maru out if i cant get fuel for her werent you talking about knowing somebody who could fit her out with a mast and sail father hiroshi said its about time yes i was talking about that jiro said but i dont know how long it will take i dont know how much it will cost jesus christ he clapped a hand to his forehead i dont even know if that doi fellow is still alive if he isnt itll take longer kenzo said hiroshi laughed even old man okamoto laughed jiro glared at his younger son what kind of a joke was that an american joke that was what jiro didnt think it was funny though he might have if okamoto had told it it was just annoying to him eizo doi the handyman fellow okamoto asked jiro nodded okamoto said hes still aroundat least i saw him three or four days ago you think he can put a sail on a sampan i dont know for sure hes talked about it jiro answered if he can im still in business whatever business there is if he cant the fisherman spat on the sidewalk if he cant i have to find something else to do like what okamoto asked with interest jiro only shrugged except for his stint in the fields hed been a fisherman all his life he didnt know anything else he didnt want to know anything else what are we going to do if we cant put to sea today hiroshi asked jiro shrugged again again he had no idea reiko would be surprised to see him and their sons home so early whether shed be happy to see them that was liable to be another story hiroshi and kenzo and he had just started back from old man okamotos when japanese bombers appeared overhead the airraid sirens didnt begin to wail until after antiaircraft guns opened fire and bombs started whistling down oh jesus christ jiro exclaimed in dismay his sons both swore in english he wasnt so frightened as he might have been the japanese planes had been in the habit of dropping most of their bombs farther east on the haole part of town the ones that had hit around here had seemed like accidentsto everyone except the people they landed on of course but things were different this morning this morning bombs rained down all over honolulu when one burst a couple of hundred yards ahead it sounded like the end of the world if it had burst any closer than that kenzo grabbed him by the arm weve got to find some cover father he was right jiro could see that but where farther east where things were more open theyd dug airraid trenches not many of those here not with concrete and asphalt covering so much of the ground not many cellars to huddle in either hardly any buildings in honolulu had them his younger son pointed to a deep doorway that would have to do it would unless a bomb burst right in front of themor unless the building came down on top of them jiro did his best not to think of such things more and more people crowded into the doorway women screamed when bombs burst close by so did several men others cursed in a variety of languages so did several women neither the mens screams nor the womens curses affronted jiro the way they would have under different circumstances he was almost frightened enough to piss himself why should anyone else be different hiroshi pointed up into the sky one of thems coming down he shouted in japanese then he said what was probably the same thing in english sure enough a japanese bomber trailing smoke and fire plummeted out of the sky swelling enormously as it did jiro wondered about the men inside were they dead if they werent what were they thinking as they plunged to their deaths could they keep the emperor in their minds or did bright panic swallow everything else panic swallowed everything else in the voice of a woman by jiro as she shrieked its coming down on us jiro wanted to call her a stupid idiot he wished he could but she was right he started to scream himself when he thought the doomed bomber would smash into the building in whose doorway he huddled it didnt it crashed into a laundry half a block away a fireball eruptedthe plane must have had almost a full load of fuel on board blazing fragments pinwheeled off and went flying along the street come on now jiro grabbed his sons instead of the other way around we cant stay here that fire will burn this whole block they had to fight their way out of the doorway some people couldnt think of anything but the moments shelter but what good was staying in the roasting pan if it was about to go into the oven bombs kept screaming down the takahashis werent safe in the street either but they had to get away from the spreading fireif they could this whole part of town is liable to burn kenzo shouted wed better get mother out if we can hiroshi said i wish shed been willing to get on the sampan with us so do i jiro said fear for reiko rose like a choking cloud within him some of it turned to fury and i wish the americans had surrendered a long time ago they cant win they cant hope to win theyre the ones who are making japan do this to honolulu his sons looked at each other their shoulders went up and down in identical shrugs those could have said he may be right jiro didnt think they did he thought they meant hes crazy but what can you do that only made him angrier before he could say anything more though hiroshi said we can worry about that another time father for now lets see if we can get back to the apartment and make sure mothers all right inside jiro the rage collapsed the fear didntit kept growing he nodded brusquely yes lets do that kenzo had been right the burning bomber hadnt started the only fire in the asian part of honolulu streets and alleys were crowded here people packed together far more tightly than they did on the haole east side that didnt bother jiro to him it was water to a fish if anything honolulu was less crowded than he remembered cities in japan being but once fires got going here they had no trouble spreading and the narrow streets and the rubble choking them made it hard for fire engines to come to the rescue bombs kept on falling too jiro ignored them some people like his sons and him were trying to push deeper into the city to find their loved ones others were fleeing toward the pacific there if anywhere theyd be safe from the spreading flames and some people simply lay where they had fallen struck down by blast or flying fragments of bomb casing or falling debris in a handful of horrible minutes jiro saw more ways the human body could be mangled than hed ever imagined he had to step over bodies and pieces of bodies he had to step over writhing howling bleeding people who werent dead yet too part of him wanted to help them but he didnt think he could do much for most and if hed tried he never would have got back to the apartment there were too many wounded and they would have taken too much time he and his sons were getting close but the flames and smoke up ahead were getting thicker somebody coming the other way shouted in japanese go back you cant go any farther its all fire up ahead youll just kill yourselves jiro and hiroshi and kenzo looked at one another none of them said anything or needed to they plunged ahead with no more hesitation than that jiro knew a moment of somber satisfaction the boys might not be everything he would have hoped for but they were no cowards courage here helped not at all the shouting japanese man proved right fire and smoke blocked the way forward jiro coughed and hacked as if hed smoked a hundred packs of cigarettes all at once hiroshi and kenzo were coughing too but their faces remained grim and determined they were going to go forward even if it killed them and it was liable to jiro realized his sons would retreat only if he spoke first he also realized he had to we cant get through this way can we go back around and try from the side i think wed better father soot stained kenzos face sweat streaked it he didnt seem to know he had a burn on his cheek wed have more of a chance they had no chance pushing straight ahead jiro could see that he led the way his sons followed he went west not east the japanese overhead were still bombing more heavily toward the east that was where the haoles lived where their enemies lived or some of their enemies anyway a roundfaced man with oriental features sitting in the street cradled a dead woman in his arms tears ran down his face as he howled curses to the uncaring sky in singsong chinese he didnt seem to notice when the takahashis ran by which might have been just as well the chinese man would have hated jiro just then jiro didnt hate him he felt a horrid sympathy for him and with him in fact that could be me holding reiko he muttered to himself trying to repel the evil omen panting he went around a cornerand dug in his heels to stop as fast as he could burning cars up ahead made the street an inferno heat blasted into his face he went up another block only to find another fire people were running away not going toward the flames jiro scanned faces hoping to see reikos he didnt which only made his fear worse come away baka yaro someone yelled at him you cant do anything here he looked to his sons what do you think well get trapped if we stay much longer hiroshi said but ill go on if you want to kenzo nodded no they werent cowards even if they were americans and jiros older son had thrown the choice back on his shoulders hed hoped one of the boys would make it for him no such luck he ground his teeth we cant go there he said they didnt argue with him he wished they would have because they didnt he had to spell everything out himself if we cant get there we cant do your mother any good we have to hope the place isnt burning and that she got out and we just havent seen her his sons nodded kenzo cursed in english he was cursing japan but jiro didnt try to stop him it wouldnt change anything anyhow neither kenzo nor hiroshi made the slightest move to withdraw from the advancing flames jiro realized they were leaving that to him too part of him wanted to rush forward into the fire and embrace oblivion but reiko might be all rightand in any case the boys needed someone to keep an eye on them and make sure they stayed out of trouble wed better get away then he said only when he started back down toward the ocean did hiroshi and kenzo move he reached up to put an arm around each of their shoulders they werent everything hed wanted in sons but he could have done worse as well as better fletcher armitage set a hand on the barrel of his he felt like a cowboy saying goodbye to his favorite horse he was out of ammunition for the gun he had no idea where to get more or how soon it might come up if by some miracle he found out after more than a month of fighting as hard as it could the american army was visibly starting to come to pieces now it had done as much as flesh and blood could doand that hadnt turned out to be enough smallarms fire rattled in front of fletchs position and off to the left flank too the end hadnt come yet but it was getting closer he glanced over to the shiny ford his infantrymenturnedgunbunnies had shanghaied the car had three flats the same as the de soto had had a few days earlier it wasnt going anywhere maybe his merry men could commandeer another one what point when the gun had no shells if hed had a horse and needed to deny it to pursuing indians he would have shot it instead he took the breech block out of the a stream ran down from the mountains not far from where the gun rested he carried the heavy steel casting to the bank and threw it in the water hed picked a place where the flow was turbulent as hed hoped bubbles and foam hid the breech block from prying eyes the japs might get their hands on that but they wouldnt be able to do anything with it wearily he trudged back to what was now a quaker cannon his makeshift crew stood by the gun waiting to see what happened next fletch wished he knew he said well boys i made artillerymen out of you for a while now it looks like ive joined the infantry clancy and arnie and dave looked at one another clancy talked more than either of the other two no offense lieutenant but you picked a shitty time to go slumming in spite of everything fletch laughed they say timings everything he reached up and touched the springfield slung on his shoulder i havent quit fighting i dont intend to either as if to mock him the rattle of gunfire from the left got louder it also moved farther south down toward the seamakai they said here without seeming to know that wasnt really an english word the japanese were pushing forward the americans falling back that was how it had gone since the beginning but the americans couldnt fall back any more not if they were going to have any real chance of holding on they were falling back anyhow no doubt that said they had no real chance fletch scowled he didnt want to think about that he said wed better move back toward honolulu things are still holding together there or they were the last i heard wed better move back somewhere thats for damn sure clancy said the other two enlisted men nodded arnie said if we dont the japs are liable to cut us off he stopped right there he didnt need to say another word if advancing japanese soldiers cut them off they were liable to capture them nobody in his right mind cared to chance that come on fletch said harshly lets get going off they went retreating to the south and east they werent the only onesfar from it singly and in small groups like theirs other soldiers tramped along the side of the road or out in the middle of it clouds drifted overhead a spatter of rain fell though the sun never disappeared the landscape was one of almost unearthly beauty jungleclad hills to the north palm trees and blossoming hibiscus close at hand mynahs and bluishfaced zebra doves pecking for whatever they could find the sapphire sea visible to the south where beauty failed it failed because of man rather than nature ahead honolulu lay mired in smoke after the latest japanese bombing attack if fletch turned his head to look west he could see more ruin in pearl harbor he didnt he was too stubborn but when he looked around he saw the ugliness in his comrades and himself they were scrawny and filthy and unshaven they smelled bad at least half of them had minor wounds they all had the hangdog air of beaten men that was one more thing fletch had no idea how to cure he was sure he had that same hangdog air himself oahu was going to fall it would fall sooner not later too and what would the japs do with all the soldiers they captured then what would they do to them whatever they want to fletch thought and shuddered somewhere not far away an officer was shouting frantically trying to get men to form a defensive line come on you sorry bastards he howled weve still got a chance as long as we dont quit fletch gathered up his erstwhile gun team by eye lets go he said they didnt argue with him they showed no great enthusiasm but they went along maybe they were also wondering what would happen if and when they had to lay down their arms that one gnawed at fletch because it gnawed at him he shoved it to the back of his mind he found the loud officera captainbehind a bougainvillea hedge what do you need sir he asked fucking everything the captain exclaimed then he amplified that pointing north toward the hills overlooking honolulu he said weve got to stop the advancing enemy but sir fletch pointed west the direction from which hed come the japs are over there i know that goddammit the captain said impatiently but theyre sneaking down through the hills too to get on our flank and rear fletch didnt know why he was surprised if the japs could get men over the waianae range these lower less rugged hills would prove no great challenge to them but he couldnt help asking why didnt we have men up there to stop them in that jungle who would have figured they could get through it the captain said proving some people had trouble learning even from experience it wasnt the captains fault alone of course his superiors had to have the same attitude ostriches eventually pulled their heads out of the sand and ran didnt they that only proved they were one up on the top brass in the hawaiian department uh sir fletch gestured for the captain to step aside with him for a moment the other officer did in a low voice fletch said meaning no disrespect sir but if theyre coming at us from the north and from the west we are really and truly screwed the captain nodded yes i realize that and so lieutenant have you heard an order to surrender no sir fletch said neither have i that being so we had better keep fighting dont you think as if to underscore the captains words mortar bombs started whistling down not nearly far enough away the captain and fletch both threw themselves flat on the ground before the first one burst jagged fragments of steel hissed and whistled through the air a soldier cried out sounding startled and hurt at the same time the captain started shouting again without raising his head more than a couple of inches stay ready men they may try to follow this up with foot soldiers christ fletch said are they down this far already before the captain could answer japanese rifle fire did it for him the arisaka rifle the japs used sounded less robust than the springfield it was only caliber and didnt have quite the stopping power of the bigger heavier american round the arisaka had proved plenty good enough though men began slipping away from the captains makeshift line he cursed them with weary hopelessness fletch understood that it was exactly the way he felt himself corporal takeo shimizu hadnt known what to expect from honolulu it sprawled ahead of him now hard by the pacific the buildings were large and solid in the western style all the same it couldnt have held much more than half as many people as hiroshima the japanese city closest to his farm here and there in little stubborn knots the americans still fought hard but now that resistance began to feel like the last spasms of some dying thing the japanese could bypass the men who did keep battling because in a lot of places there werent any that let them surround the pockets of diehards and dispose of them at their leisure when shimizu sent young shiro wakuzawa out to scrounge supplies for the squad as the sun sank in the west the firstyear soldier went off with a sigh his squadmates murmured hard work in sympathy shimizu didnt care somebody had to do it hed done it himself often enough in china before he got promoted wakuzawa came back with a big burlap sack slung over his shoulder and an enormous smile on his face you look like the monkey who found the apple tree shimizu said what have you got in there wait till you see corporalsan wakuzawa let the sack down on the grass by the fire the japanese had started the fire was purely force of habit hawaiian nights didnt come close to requiring one as the youngster reached into the sack he went on i came across a grocery store that hadnt been looted empty ahhh the whole squad said as one man they said it again when wakuzawa took out three cartons of mild flavorful american cigarettes boxes of crackers followed and then wakuzawas triumph can after can of meat its pink glory displayed against a dark blue painted background big yellow letters told what it was but shimizu couldnt read the roman alphabet does anyone know what it says he asked its called spam corporal senior private yasuo furusawa answered hed always struck shimizu as a bookish type how do you know the corporal asked my father is a druggist in hiroshima furusawa said i was learning the trade till i got drafted some of the medicines he got came from the west so i had to learn the characters the gaijin use the spam cans opened with keys conveniently soldered to them the meat inside them looked just like the tempting illustration the soldiers hacked it into rough slices with their bayonets and ate it on crackers some of them toasted the spam over the fire first others didnt bother shimizu didnthe was too hungry to care he wolfed down the meat thats one of the most delicious things i ever ate senior private furusawa said with a sigh of pleasure hai honto shimizu agreed hed been thinking the same thing even better than sashimi if you ask me why dont we have things like this in japan he took a pack from one of the cartons opened it and began to smoke this is better tobacco than we get at home too weve already found that out its ours now by right of conquest somebody said banzai for wakuzawa who conquered it for us somebody else added a soft chorus of banzai s rang out shiro wakuzawa blushed like a schoolgirl corporal shimizu hid a smile wakuzawa might be only a lowly firstyear soldier but he was the hero of the moment i dont remember the last time i felt so full furusawa said i want to go to sleep right where im sitting several soldiers incautiously nodded youd better not shimizu said well have sentries out through the night never can tell what the americans might do if they catch us all snoring here furusawa youll take the first watch yes corporal the senior private said that was work but not too bad at least he wouldnt have his sleep interrupted the way the men who came later would and then tomorrow shimizu went on tomorrow i think we push on into honolulu at last he wondered how hard the americans would fight for the city clearing them out one house at a time one block at a time would be expensive and leave the place in worse ruins than it was already he shrugged it would be as it was he couldnt do anything about it any which way he rolled himself in his blanket and fell asleep he slept through the nightone of the privileges of his rank was that he didnt have to stand sentry he woke just before sunrise hawaiis unfamiliar birds were calling he got up and stretched then went behind a tree to ease himself spatters of gunfire came from the east but only spatters maybe it wouldnt be too bad he tried to make himself believe it smoking one of those smooth american cigarettes helped and then with the air of a magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat shiro wakuzawa produced three more cans of spam they made as fine a breakfast as they had a supper the other privates in the squad pounded wakuzawa on the back and told him what a fine fellow he was such displays were beneath a corporals dignity but shimizu was glad to have something good in his stomach too he told himself hed go a little easieronly a little mindon wakuzawa for a while the kid had earned some respect cautiously the squad moved forward shimizu preferred the fields where they had been fighting to the houses that surrounded him now who could say how many big fierce american soldiers they were hiding things stayed fairly quiet a machine gun in a brick building made its presence known too soon if the gunner had held off a little longer he could have slaughtered the japanese as they came forward across the grass in front of the building as things were they got the chance to take cover the gunner seemed to have all the ammunition in the world and to enjoy hosing it around shimizu crouched behind some rubble he wasnt going to stick his nose out unless ordered sooner or later soldiers to the north or south would outflank that machine gun till they did going straight at it was a recipe for suicide about halfway through the morning the machine gun fell silent shimizu sat tight maybe the american had run out of ammo after all or maybeand more likelyhe was just waiting for his foes to think he had but then senior private furusawa called corporal theres an american soldier coming forward with a white flag that made shimizu stick his head up sure enough a tall yankee with a flag of truce strode toward him a nervouslooking local japanese man stuck close to the soldiers side what do you want shimizu called the american spoke in english without a word of the language shimizu could hear how bitter he sounded the translator said captain trexler wishes to seek surrender terms for us forces on oahu he spoke oldfashioned hiroshima dialect had he been one of the men fooling japanese soldiers if he had he would pay next to the other though that was a small thing if the americans were surrendering if theyre surrendering i wont get shot shimizu thought happily i will take the captain back through our lines he said aloud the local japanese spoke in english with a curt nod the american came on vii commander mitsuo fuchida adjusted the cap of his white dress uniform as he walked up to iolani palace to take part in the surrender ceremony the cap with its anchorandchrysanthemum badge felt odd on his head he was more used to a flying mans leather helmet that covered his ears he turned to commander minoru genda who walked along beside him also in dress uniform honolulus bright sun flashed from the two silver chrysanthemums on each of gendas gold shoulder boards like fuchidas those shoulder boards were striped with an aviators blue congratulations fuchida said you are the architect of this day modest as usual genda shook his head admiral yamamoto planned the attack he said and you so ably led the fliers both of you deserve far more credit than i do although burly general tomoyuki yamashita and his aides stumped along ahead of the navy officers genda said not a word about what the army had contributed to the conquest of oahu fuchida understood that he was sure yamashita had not a single good word for the navy either though without it the soldiers the general led could not have come within five thousand kilometers of hawaii iolani palace luckily had not suffered much during the japanese bombardment of honolulu ornamental plaster and cement work covered the brick walls castiron columns with fancy floral capitals upheld the deep veranda on the second floor shorter but otherwise similar columns therethese with a fancy iron balustrade between themhelped support the roof atop the palace the flags of the united states and the territory of hawaii still fluttered the territorial flagalso the flag of the former kingdom of hawaiiamused fuchida the hawaiians had been doing their best to please and appease britain and the usa at the same time red white and blue stripes covered most of the field the union jack occupied the canton much good such pandering had done the hawaiians the united states annexed their islands anyway and now hawaii had a new master the territorial flag might go on flying the stars and stripes would be coming down the rising sun would wave in their place a low broad stairway led up into the palace general yamashita tramped up the stairs as if he intended to capture the place singlehanded captain kiichi hasegawa skipper of the akagi led the naval delegation the akagi and the soryu would stay in hawaiian waters to defend the new conquest against attack from the american mainland the damaged kaga was already under repair in japan admiral nagumo had taken the other three carriers west to aid the japanese advance through the dutch east indies at the top of the stairway an american honor guard came to attention and presented arms as the japanese dignitaries approached general yamashita brushed past the american soldiers as if they did not exist the navy officers fuchida among them did the same how could any men who were surrendering imagine they still kept their honor just inside the entrance stood three wearylooking americans and a nervous local japanese man in a business suit the latter bowed and said i am izumi shirakawa i am the interpreter for the americans i present to you admiral kimmel general short and governor poindexter he turned and spoke in english explaining what hed just said admiral kimmel spoke shirakawa turned his words to japanese he says he hopes you will use the americans in the spirit of bravery with which they fought general yamashita grunted lets get on with it was all he said kimmels face fell when the interpreter translated that governor poindexter who was older than the two military men with him said this way to the throne room gentlemen that is where the territorial legislature meets and so we thought it fitting that he ran down like a watch in need of winding where you surrender does not matter yamashita said that you surrender matters air seemed to leak out of the governor he turned and walked into the palace admiral kimmel followed general short who wore cavalry breeches tucked into shiny boots paused for a moment he had to call back the interpreter whod started to go with poindexter short said i know that japan has not signed the geneva convention but i trust you will treat the prisoners of war you are taking in accordance with its usages he waited fuchida did not think general yamashita would answer but one of yamashitas aides murmured something to him the army commander nodded brusquely we will do what is necessary to secure these islands he said general short had to be contentor discontentedwith that into the palace the japanese delegation went commander fuchida admired the grand hall handsome he murmured to genda if you like the oldfashioned european style yes answered genda whose tastes were modern even radical fuchida was more conservative he admired the tall arched doorways with their wooden frames the portraits of hawaiian monarchs hung between them and most of all the splendid staircase ascending to the second floor the rich brown wood of which it was made seemed to glow under the electric lights statues carved from the same wood sprang from the pillars at the bottom of the bannisters the throne room was all white plaster red velvet hangings and red carpet underfoot the territorial legislators desks looked small and silly and out of place in the midst of such magnificence so did the table that had been brought in for the surrender ceremony flashbulbs popped as the american dignitaries sat down on one side of the table general yamashita and captain hasegawa took the other army and navy aides on both sides grouped themselves behind their principals yamashita set the instrument of surrenderwritten in both japanese and englishon the table this surrender is unconditional on your part he told short and kimmel all military men in the hawaiian islands will yield to the empire of japan they are prisoners all destruction of military stores and weapons is to cease at once all civil authority is suspended all civil functionaries will obey orders from the japanese military any violation of these terms will be punished most severely is that clear may we read the terms admiral kimmel asked you may read yamashita said and then you may sign he hardly bothered hiding his scorn for men who would surrender kimmelerect grayhaired handsomeand shortpinchfaced looking stunned at the disaster that had overtaken his sidestudied the english half of the document fuchida would not have been surprised if the english was imperfect that did not matter as long as it was understandable when the military men were done they passed the instrument to governor poindexter his presence here was plainly an afterthought their own declaration of martial law had already superseded his authority kimmel said these terms are very harsh the best way not to get harsh terms is not to lose the fight general yamashita said when izumi shirakawa translated that kimmel bit his lip and stared down at the table may i say a few words governor poindexter asked through the interpreter for a moment mitsuo fuchida thought general yamashita would refuse then the army commandant gave another curt nod thank you poindexter said i speak on behalf of the civilians in hawaii who now come under your control food is already in short supply and will only grow more scarce as time goes by if we are to avoid starvation we will need help from the empire of japan in feeding our people we will do what we can yamashita said the american official looked relieved commander fuchida had a hard time holding his face straight was poindexter really so naive did he think hed got a promise from yamashita surely anyone could tell that was nothing but a polite phrase intended to keep him quiet it had worked better than yamashita probably intended this is the hardest duty of my life admiral kimmel said in spite of the handicaps of surprise isolation lack of food and lack of ammunition we have given the world a shining example of patriotic fortitude and selfsacrifice we yield now more to save civilian lives than our own the american people can ask for no finer example of tenacity and steadfast courage than our men have shown he looked to yamashita perhaps hoping for some sympathetic response yamashita said only it is over now you must sign the surrender the imperial japanese army and navy will continue to prosecute the war until it formally ends kimmel sighed the morning the fighting started a spent bullet hit me in the chesthe tapped his left breast pocket with a forefingerand fell to the ground at my feet that round should have killed me there was the first thing hed said that made sense to fuchida of course an officer whod seen his command caught flatfooted would not wish to go on living afterwards a japanese officer in that position would have taken matters into his own hands but the americans were soft kimmel looked across the table general yamashita stared back stonily captain hasegawa was a livelier man than the army commandant but was also junior to him he did not give the american admiral whatever he was looking foratonement perhaps either kimmel lowered his head and scratched his name below the english text of the surrender general short and governor poindexter also signed the civilian hid his face in his hands his shoulders shook yamashita and hasegawa signed for japan to fuchidas surprise the taciturn army commandant proved a formidable calligrapher you never could tell what sort of accomplishments a man hid within himself bombs burst not too far away general short said its over now he seemed to be fighting tears its over dammit call off your attacks sir they arent needed any more they will stop yamashita said those who have surrendered though are in no position to make demands no positiondo you hear me i hear you short replied id hoped to hear something worthy of a soldier yamashita growled down deep in his chest something ugly could have happened then captain hasegawa forestalled it by pointing to the two american officers and saying your sidearms with a face that might have been carved from stone admiral kimmel took his ceremonial sword from his belt and laid it on the table short wore no sword he pulled a pistol from the holster on his belt and set it beside the sword more photographs recorded the moment with illdisguised greed yamashita grabbed the goldhilted blade that left the pistol an ordinary for captain hasegawa he took it with no outward show of anger since hed suggested that the american commanders turn over their weapons commander fuchida thought he should have had first choice now it is over yamashita said satisfaction in his voice shirakawa translated that into english yamashita turned to one of his aides order the ceasefire effective immediately the interpreter translated that too the army commandant sent him a hard look but it was done kimmel might have been a dead man talking as he said we are your captives sir what are your orders for us maybe he was trying to rouse sympathy in the japanese if so hed made a mistake to a japanese soldier captives roused nothing but contempt yamashita did not bother to hide it as he answered just stay here you will be taken care of he gathered up his officers by eye lets go once out in the bright sunshine again fuchida looked up at the central flagpole the tallest of the five atop iolani palace the american flag had come down during the ceremony the japanese flag flew there in its place tears stung fuchidas eyes such a gamblebut theyd brought it off he turned to minoru genda no matter how modest genda was he more than any other man had been the man who made this victory possible impulsively fuchida bowed low congratulations he said once more genda returned the bow it was for the empire he said but not even his quiet words could hide all the pride in his voice rumors of surrender had swept through the americans still fighting for a couple of days before they turned out to be true even then fletcher armitage didnt want to believe them neither did the men hed hauled into serving his nowabandoned what do you think sir clancy asked should we steal us some civvies and make like we were never in the army ill be damned if i want to put myself in the hands o them heathen bastards i seen what they do to prisoners im not going to give you any orders about that fletch answered if you want to try and disappear go ahead i wont say boo i dont know who you are but if you try and disappear and the japs find out who you are your neck isnt worth a plugged nickel arnie said if everybodys surrendering theyll have to play fair by us wont they get your head out of your ass man dave said theyre the japs they just won they fucking licked us they dont have to do shit they can do whatever they goddamn well want clancy nodded thats what im afraid of thats why im thinking about bugging out he glanced over to fletch what are you gonna do lieutenant back when he was still married to jane fletch might have tried to get up to wahiawa and pretended to be part of a civilian couple with her and you might have been an idiot too he thought what if one of your neighbors turned you in youd get shot and so would she he shrugged he didnt have that choice any more im sticking he said i am in the army goddammit but im not going to tell anybody else what to do not for this whatever you think gives you the best chance you go ahead and do it and good luck to you clancy set his rifle and his tin hat on the ground im gone he said good luck back atcha lieutenant he slipped away dave followed arnie stayed they looked at each other what the hell happens next arnie asked uh sir beats me fletch said we had drills and exercises for everything under the sun but i dont think we ever practiced surrendering no american had ever imagined that he could taste defeat after the japanese landed on oahu fletchs imagination had been expanded somewhere not far away someone with a loud officialsounding voice shouted come stack your weapons here fightings done come stack your weapons jesus arnie muttered he was a little swarthy guy with a clotted chicago accent got to get rid of your piece even if you bug out fletch reminded him japs catch you with it youre history there were placesthe philippines for instancewhere a man might take to the jungle and go on with the fight oahu wasnt a place like that it had jungles sure enough but they didnt have anything to eat in them jesus arnie said again and then they really gonna treat us like prisoners of war now that poked fletchs worst fears he remembered too well what the japs had done to american soldiers theyd captured but they couldnt do things like that to all the men whod surrendered could they he shook his head impossible theyre supposed to he answered we wouldnt have quit if we thought they wouldnt would we i guess not arnie still sounded dubious but he nodded lead the way lieutenant rank hath its privileges fletch thought this was one he could have done without but he had no choice now that hed decided not to disappear he trudged along the road toward the man who was shouting about stacking arms here in the western suburbs of honolulu buildings werent jammed together the way they were in the city proper there was more greenery than there were houses and shops but war had laid its hand here shell and bomb craters scarred the ground flame had gutted one of the houses fletch and arnie walked past and the sicklysweet battlefield reek of dead meat was in the air springfields made neat pyramids on the grass stocks down barrels pointing up the soldiers whod already stacked their weapons were anything but neat they looked like fletch and arnie dirty weary tattered dejected they looked fearful too what the hell are the japs gonna do to us was a question fletch heard again and again the answer to that one would win the sixtyfour dollars all right it might win something even better life a few minutes later somebody pointed west and said here they come several soldiers arnie among them crossed themselves the japs advanced cautiously rifles at the ready fletch had seen them before but theyd only been targets to him now suddenly they were men most of them were shorter and skinnier than their american opposite numbersmost but not all they werent the bucktoothed bespectacled caricatures hed more or less subconsciously expected they looked like the japanese men who lived in hawaii what a surprise fletch thought sarcastically and yet in a lot of ways it was a surprise attention shouted the american with the authoritative voice form ranks some soldiers heeded him more didnt but just stood around waiting to see what happened next fletch was one of those hed had all the shouting he could stand a japanese soldier with a scraggly mustache came up to him he made himself hold still and nod to the victor tabako the jap asked holding out his hand fletch frowned tabako the soldier repeated more insistently this time a light dawned fletch pulled out a mostly empty pack of cigarettes and handed it to the jap the fellow grinned and stuck one in his mouth then he looked crestfallen he mimed striking a match fletch fumbled in his pockets did he have any matches he did and gave them to the soldier the man lit the cigarette he seemed happy as a hog in front of a bucket of strawberries after a long almost ecstatic drag though he pointed to fletchs wristwatch fletch hesitated he didnt want to give that up but he didnt want to get shot or bayoneted either before he had to make up his mind a noncom strode over he said something to the soldier who answered hesitantly wham the noncom hauled off and hit the other jap a lick that sent his cigarette flying and snapped his head back wham this time it was a backhand across the face the soldier staggered but did his best to stay at attention the noncom screamed what was obviously abuse at him the jap soldier stood there wooden as a cigarstore indian a tiny trickle of blood ran from the corner of his mouth his cheeks looked to be on fire the noncom belted him one more time then barked something contemptuous face still impassive the soldier bowed and got the hell out of there jesus h christ fletch thought this is what they do to their own guys no wonder theyre hell on wheels to the poor suckers they catch the noncom looked him over he made himself stand there if he showed any kind of fear he thought he was a dead man if this monkey started beating on him though well in that case he would be a dead man because he intended to jump the jap he also intended to take the noncom down to hell with him instead of hitting him the fellow pointed to his wristwatch the same as the ordinary soldier had done despite what fletch had seen the noncom do he hesitated again plundering prisoners was supposed to be against the rules maybe it wasif you were a private and a corporal or sergeant or whatever this bastard was caught you at it for him though to the victors go the spoils a curt word or two of japanese had to mean make it snappy charlie the noncom reached out and undid the watchband himself fletch didnt knock his hands away however much he wanted to the jap put the watch on his own wrist when he fastened it he closed the band a couple of holes farther along than fletch did off he went peacockproud other japanese soldiers were relieving american prisoners of their minor valuables seeing his countrymen robbed made fletch feel a little better maybe misery really did love company and it could have been worse it wasnt a massacre that noncom had done worse to the poor greedy private than the japs were doing to the americans you know youve hit bottom when youre glad cause theyve only stolen your watch fletch thought he was glad too maybe it would be all right or at least not too bad when the order to cease fire and lay down his arms reached jim peterson he was in a house in pearl city with his back to the sea he couldnt have stayed there too much longer either hed get killed or hed be squeezed off into the westinto irrelevancewhile the japs reached the oilbefouled waters of pearl harbor he was damned if he felt like giving up he had a good position and plenty of clips for his springfield had he signed up as a groundpounder only to surrender to the enemy what would you have done if youd stayed aboard the enterprise he jeered at himself youd have been shot out of the sky or gone down with her as a matter of fact he had got shot out of the sky but hed had golfers for company not sharks the pacific was a wide and lonely place he wondered if he ought to put his lieutenants bars back on he might get better treatment if he did after a moments thought he shook his head hed signed up to be an infantryman and hed go into captivity as one he knew that was pride talkingperverse pride probably he shrugged he didnt give a damn perverse or not it was his come out and assemble some loudmouth was yelling come out if the japs take you later theyll say you tried to go on fighting after the surrender you dont want that to happen believe me you dont loudmouth or not he was much too likely to be right regretfully peterson slung his rifle and came out of the house other similarly draggled men were doing the same thing elsewhere along the block theyd been in close contact with the japs japanese soldiers were coming out too to look them over the japs were about as grubby as the americans their beards werent so thick but plenty of them needed shaves too even though neither side showed much in the way of spit and polish you could sure as hell tell whod won and whod lost the americans walked with their shoulders slumped and their heads down they mooched along as if theyd just watched a tank run over their cat that was about how peterson felt too by contrast the japs might have just conquered the world theyd sure as hell just conquered one of the nicest corners of it and boy were they proud of themselves they swaggered they strutted they grinned some of them seemed almost drunk with happinessor was it relief japanese officers were easy to spot they were the ones who wore swords peterson had seen they really thought they could fight with them too at close quarters he would have preferred a bayonetit gave more reach he hadnt seen any handtohand combat though people shot each other before they got that close bayonets were handy things to have but they didnt get blood on them very often over here the loudmouth bawled stack arms one of the jap officers had a local oriental with him the local gave him a running translation he nodded in reply collaborators already peterson thought happy day the officer said something in japanese the local japanese man translated even though you have surrendered and are dishonored you must try to remember that you are men that was a dangerous thing to say to soldiers with weapons still in their hands for a nickel peterson would have blown that japs head off for him fear for himself didnt keep him from doing it fear for what would happen to other americans all over oahu did his rifle joined others stacked in neat pyramids japanese soldiers watched the americans giving up their weapons peterson looked down at his hands when the springfield was gone for good he felt naked without the rifle whatever the japs wanted to do to him they could dishonored maybe that officer hadnt been so far wrong if losing to these bastards wasnt a humiliation what was as far as he was concerned the usa should have been able to lick japan with one hand tied behind its back maybe it had tied both hands back there because it had sure as hell lost and what would happen next how the devil was the united states supposed to fight a war in the pacific from the west coast what would happen to australia and new zealand how could america get soldiers and supplies down there without going through hawaii it wouldnt be easyif it was possible at all hey you lousy little monkey keep your goddamn hands off me a soldier with a thick southern drawl said angrily he shoved away a jap whod been about to lift something from him peterson didnt think the japanese soldiers spoke any english that didnt matter the tone and the shove were all they needed half a dozen of them jumped the american all the others close by raised their rifles warning the rest of the newly surrendered americans not to butt in they stomped the southerner it was angry at first and got angrier when he managed to land a blow or two of his own that didnt last long not against six after he stopped fighting back it turned coldblooded and methodical to petersons mind that was worse they knew exactly what they intended to do and they did it by the time they finished it wasnt a human being on the ground any more only dead meat in khaki wrappings they had blood on their boots and puttees to petersons surprise they didnt have smiles on their faces they hadnt particularly enjoyed what theyd donewhich didnt mean they hadnt done it it was just part of a days work that was pretty scary too the japanese officer watched the whole thing without making a move to interfere and without batting an eye he spoke in his own language the local jap by contrast was green and gulping the officer had to nudge him before he remembered to translate let this be a lesson to you you are prisoners nothing more when a japanese soldier comes up to you you are to bow and you are to obey do you understand appalled silence answered him he spoke again sharply he didnt have to nudge the local this time do you understand yes sir it was a ragged chorus but it plainly said what the jap wanted to hear peterson joined in he understood all right he understood this was nastier trouble than hed imagined in his worst nightmares you should have run away he jeered at himself but where could he have run oahu had nowhere to hide except maybe among the civilians in honolulu he hadnt been able to stomach the notion and now it was too late a japanese soldier came up to him and waited expectantly you are to bow and you are to obey tasting the gall of the defeated peterson bowed its only politeness he told himself its what they do too it would have been only politeness had the jap returned the bow he didnt he accepted it as nothing less than his due he deserved it for being on the winning side and he didnt have to give it back he reached into petersons pockets peterson stood there stiff as a statue you lost this is what happens when you lose the jap found his navy rank badges he kept them all he cared about was that they were silver i really am nothing but a corporal now then the jap found his billfold he had fourteen dollars just about what hed had when he took off from the enterprise s flight deck it wasnt a whole lot of money and he sure hadnt had any place to spend it since hed parachuted down onto that golf course by the way the jap clutched the greenbacks in his fist and hopped up and down and jabbered in his own language he might have broken into fort knox people talked about inscrutable orientals but this guy wasnt inscrutable he was damn near out of his mind with glee he was so overjoyed he even gave the wallet back to peterson once hed pocketed the money thanks a lot peterson said sarcastic before he remembered sarcasm might be deadly dangerous then he had a rush of brains to the head he bowed again this time the jap bowed back youre nothing but a lousy prisoner but i can be polite about robbing you that was what it boiled down to it couldnt mean anything else you son of a bitch peterson thought you rotten stinking son of a bitch the other japs were plundering the rest of the americans the prisoners took it quietly flies landed on the ruined face of the soldier whod resented it the japanese officer barked a command the interpreter said this way and pointed the americans trudged off into the new world of captivity susie higgins lay on the narrow bed and sobbed i wish to god id never come here she wailed even though oscar van der kirk had come to hawaii years before susie had that same thought had occurred to him he said a little too late to worry about it now she glared at him even with her makeup smeared and tear streaks down her face she looked good not a hell of a lot of women could say that what are we going to do the japs are taking over the island yeah i noticed that oscar said i dont know what we can do except keep our heads down try to stay out of trouble and hope therell be enough to eat have you seen the prices foods going up like a fourth of july skyrocket we lost susie exclaimed that wasnt supposed to happen you knew it was going to same as i did oscar answered you said so this time susie glared at him in a different way she didnt like getting reminded of what shed already said theyre japs she said theyre not americans theyre not even white men they shouldnt be able to do this oscar shrugged the guy who owns this building is a jap a lot of the people whove made it big for themselves here are japsand thats in spite of everything the haoles do to hold em down when i first moved here i thought the same way you do the longer ive stayed the more i dont the japs can do anything we can do and i dont give a damn if theyre green are you going to teach them to surfride she spat he grunted that question had occurred to him too and he wished it hadnt i guess so if they want to learn if they want to pay me he said slowly their moneyd spend just like anybody elses lord knows were going to need it i wouldnt have anything to do with them susie said yeah well surfriding lessons arent what theyd want from you oscar said susies hand reached out for something to throw fortunately nothing was in reach of where she lay and if i gave em that how would it be any different than you giving em lessons it would thats all oscar had to stop and figure out how he did his best giving lessons is what i do for a living itd be like a cabby giving a jap a ride the otherif you did that youd be doing it cause you wanted to not because it was your job if he said it was shed get up to find something to throw at him hed deserve it too instead of getting up she changed the subject she hardly ever came out and admitted she was wrong this sort of thing was her nearest approach she asked are you going to watch the victory parade tomorrow heck i dont know i was thinking about it he answered why not its something to do im not going to cheer or anything jesus i hope not she said i bet everybody whos therell be a jap though oscar grunted again he hadnt thought of that i bet youre right okay ill stay away wouldnt that be just what i need showing up on some lousy jap propaganda newsreel if it got back to my folks theyd never live it down thats more like it she said whatll we do instead we can go out on the ocean or else we can stay here your call he said she shrugged worry about it in the morning she got up from the bed and looked at herself in the little mirror over the sink lord im a fright why didnt you tell me then wed fight over something else he thought aloud he said you always look good to me babe that was true enough he knew exactly what hold susie had on him knowing it didnt make it any less real in the morning he wanted to go out to the pacific susie said go ahead i just dont feel like it she looked at him in a way that would have been sidelong except in a fashion he couldnt quite define it wasnt i dont much feel like anything else today either she added just in case he hadnt got the point but he had he was no dummy not where people were concerned see you later he said and hurried out the door he trotted down toward waikiki beach like a man going toward his beloved he got his surfboard from the outrigger club and was heading across the soft sand of the beach to the sea when somebody behind him let out a yell he stopped there was charlie kaapu also with his surfboard under his arm you cant stand the japs either hey charlie said thats part of it oscar answered come onlets go they entered the water side by side setting his skill against the surf oscar didnt have to think about the japs or anything else if he had done any thinking he surely would have taken a tumble if you were anything but a creature of reflex and reaction on the waves you were in trouble when he and charlie came up onto the beach after one long smooth ride he saw a pair of japanese officers watching well would i teach a jap to surfride he wondered he didnt want to think about that either and plunged into the pacific again but the japanese officers were still there when he got back so were the rest of his troubles of course he knew they wouldnt disappear no matter how he ran knowing didnt stop him from running after a while hed had enough he walked up the beach to the outrigger club he passed within about ten feet of the two japs he wanted to pretend they didnt exist but they both bowed to him hed heard things about how touchy japs were so he figured hed better nod back that seemed to satisfy them hed never been sorry to get a salute for what he did on a surfboard but he was now the apartment was empty when he walked in a note lay on the bed he picked it up good luck susie had written it isnt fun any more nothing is much fun any more he stared down at that then slowly nodded it wasnt as if she were wrong then he checked the place she hadnt cleaned him out maybe that meant that in her own way she had style maybe it just meant he didnt own anything she thought worth stealing he went back and looked at the note again good luck susie he said jiro takahashi climbed out of the tent where he and his sons were living they were lucky to have even a tent their apartment building was a burntout wreck no one had found any trace of his wife officially reiko was listed as missing jiro clung to that he knew what it meant knew what it almost had to mean the less he had to think about that though the better escaping the tent felt good if he stayed in there hed just quarrel with hiroshi and kenzo again they blamed japan for the bombs that had left them without a home and their mother missing or worse he blamed the americans for not surrendering once things were hopeless he also scorned them for surrendering at all he didnt even notice the inconsistency before the tent city sprang up this had been a botanical garden a lot of the trees here had come down for the sake of firewood at first the haole in charge of the place had fussed about that but people had to cook food and heat water what were they supposed to do go without fire ha takahashi there was old man okamoto hed lost his house in the bombing too you going to watch the parade i dont know jiro answered its hard to care about anything any more you know what i mean life is all confused okamoto said hai honto jiro agreed confused he was when the fighting started hed wanted japan to teach the united states a lesson haoles had the arrogance to treat japanese like inferiors they deserved a comeuppance and theyd got it oahu belonged to the empire of japan all the hawaiian islands did but jiro had never imagined victory would come at such a high price to him hed never imagined the war would come home to civilians at all when you thought of war you thought of soldiers shooting at soldiers of airplanes shooting down airplanes of ships sinking ships you didnt think of bombs and shells landing on your city on your home you didnt think any of your loved ones would go missing which was only a politer way of saying get killed you didnt think about that but you were only a civilian so what did you know the officers in the fancy uniforms figured that war involved making your life miserable they were the ones who gave orders to the soldiers and the airplanes and the ships what they said went and if you happened to get in the way well too bad for you come on old man okamoto said i mean what else have we got to do takahashi had no answer for that he could stay here and brood or he could stay here and quarrel with his sons which was a loud external kind of brooding over whose officers in fancy uniforms were to blame for the way things were in honolulu all right jiro said his mouth making up its mind before his brain did lets go to get to king street down which the parade would run they had to walk down nuuanu avenue through the bombedout part of town scavengers picked through the ruins for whatever they could salvage jiro walked on his face hard and set as a stone he would not think of reiko lying there lost in the wreckage he would not think that her body added to the stench of death still lingering here he would notbut he did king street wasnt too badly damaged here and there buildings had broken windows or perhaps plywood where windows had been takahashi didnt see any craters in the street itself rising sun flags fluttered from lamp poles okamoto pointed to one of them and said the japanese consulate had people putting those up yesterday really jiro said i know the consul a little ive sold kitasan tuna fairly oftenwhenever i had some that was particularly good and morimura the chancellor at the consulate knows a good piece of fish too i wouldnt be surprised okamoto said morimura drives all over the place did you ever notice i wonder how much spying he did for japan i dont know anything about that jiro said i was out on the ocean i only paid attention to him when i had fish i thought he might like well he did he bought gas from me plenty of times okamoto said and oahus not a big island you can do a lot of driving here without using much gas so if youre filling up twice a week or even three times youre doing a lot of driving before takahashi could answer a japanese boy who couldnt have been more than six handed him a small japanese flag on a stick here mister the boy said in english he gave okamoto a flag too and then went on up the sidewalk passing them out following the kid with his eyes jiro took in the other people whod come to watch the imperial japanese armys victory parade almost all of them unsurprisingly were japanese themselves most of them were of his generation the generation that had been born in japan a few men and women in their twenties and thirties accompanied them but only a few here they come people pointed west jiro craned his neck to see better hed watched us military parades often enough so he had some idea what to expect this one didnt seem too different not at first standardbearers carrying japanese flags led the procession half a dozen tanks followed them the tanks were both more and less impressive than jiro had expected they werent very big but theyd plainly seen combat they were splashed with mud and other stains their yellowgreen paint was chipped and scarred by american bullets still the bullets hadnt penetrated their armor the tanks were here theyd won here and there someone would clap or shout out banzai most of the crowd stayed quiet though that made jiro notice the absence of a marching band hed never paid much attention to the ones in american parades now to his surprise he found himself missing them japanese officers stood in open cars and waved to the crowd unlike the tanks the cars hadnt come from japan they were convertibles with hawaii license plates that didnt bother takahashi too much if you won you captured what you needed japan had won behind the tanks and the officers came regiment after regiment of japanese soldiers more banzai s and applause rang out for them they marched proudly eyes straight ahead faces expressionless bayoneted rifles on their shoulders they look brave they look tough jiro said to old man okamoto the other japanese nodded and then sudden silence slammed down on the crowd after the neat ranks of imperial soldiers and plainly included as a contrast shambled a swarm of american prisoners the us army men went up the street in no particular order they were skinny they were dirty they were unshaven their uniforms were torn and filthy most of them trudged along with their heads down as if they didnt want to meet the eyes of the people staring at them for as long as anyone but the oldest residents could remember americans had ruled the roost and called the shots in hawaii the sight of those prisonersand the smell of them for they hadnt bathed any time lately which became only too clear as they went bysaid one era had passed here and another was beginning the handful of japanese guards who herded the americans along seemed a different and superior species still more japanese soldiers followed the prisoners not bad okamoto said funny watching all those haoles go by like so many sheep i was thinking the same thing jiro answered they didnt let japanese join their divisions here now theyre paying the price thats the truth but okamoto lowered his voice and added were all paying the price now its going to be a hungry time takahashi nodded ive got to get that doi fellow to put a mast on my sampan thats not going to wait any more if i can catch fish i wont starve soup kitchens fed the refugees in the botanical garden there wasnt enough to go around and what there was wasnt very good bound to be a good idea for you nobody knows where fuels going to come from now okamoto said he nudged jiro nobody will know what you eat that you dont bring in either youre lucky some luck jiro said no home his wife missing and probably dead no matter what he thought old man okamoto nodded this time yes lucky your children are alive and fishermen dont starve any more than cooks do i wont be a fisherman any more if doi cant rig the sampan as always saying that frightened jiro hed been a fisherman as long as he could remember his father had started taking him out on the inland sea when he was a very little boy if he couldnt be a fisherman what could he be anything at all okamoto shrugged hell manage hed better manage if we dont get boats out there nobody eats jiro grunted that was too likely to be true as stocks of everything got shorter prices went on soaring but if okamoto or anybody else thought the sampan fleet could feed oahu by itself jiro knew what a dream that was there werent enough sampans there probably werent enough fish either and the sampans wouldnt be able to go out nearly so far with sails as they could with their diesels or if they did go out as far they wouldnt be able to do it so often japan cant want us to starve jiro said another shrug from okamoto why should she care as long as shes got soldiers and airplanes here what difference do we make were just a nuisance shaking his head jiro said that cant be so you and i were japanese too old man okamoto only shrugged again at ohio state jane armitage had read candide the advice the naive hero had got could be boiled down to one phrase tend your garden while jane was in college shed never understood what important advice it could be she did now now she had a garden of her own her little plot of turnips and potatoes had sprouted with luck they would grow fast she eyed the turnip greens the only people shed ever heard of who ate such things were niggers she shrugged if you got hungry enough youd eat almost anything a mynah bird fluttered down and landed in her plot it pecked at something a bug good for you jane said eat lots of bugs get fat were mynahs good to eat she wouldnt have been surprised if somewhere on the island some people were already finding out and then there were zebra doves the bluefaced birds were so tame you could grab them with your bare hands they made pigeons seem smart by comparison they werent very big but they were meat and they were all over the place they ate anything that wasnt nailed down shed shooed them out of the plot more times than she could count if she didnt shoo them if she grabbed them or netted them could i wring their necks could i pluck them and gut them she wasnt a farm girl shed never dealt with chickens or hogs or anything like that she suspected that gutting a zebra dove might make her lose her lunch but if she had no lunch to lose if she was empty in there and after shed done it a few times wouldnt she get used to it something brown and low to the ground skittered toward the mynah bird which fluttered away the mongoose reared up in almost palpable frustration jane didnt worry about him he didnt care about turnips or potatoes or any of the other crops different people were growing he might assassinate some zebra doves but that was as far as he went toward being a pest jane wished he would have gone as far as assassinating rats that was why people had brought mongooses here in the first place but the mongooses preferred eating birds that were out and about during the day as they were rats came out at night traps didnt do much to discourage them jane had known about rats back in columbus nothing did much to discourage them a japanese soldier tramped by jane bent and dug out a weed with her trowel she didnt want the jap paying any special attention to her either because he thought she was lazy or because he liked her looks bad things could happen both ways he kept going she breathed a silent sigh of relief some of the local japanese women had got friendly or more than friendly with the new occupiers and to janes shame so had a few of the local white women if you cant join em lick em she thought scornfully the heat that rose to her cheeks after that had nothing to do with the warm sun in the sky that was the sort of thing fletch would have said as she got rid of another weed she wondered how fletch was doing however much she wanted not to she couldnt help herself theyd been together most of her adult life and apart for not very long she was used to worrying about what was going on with him she didnt want him dead just out of her life shed got that for all she knew he was dead whether she wanted him that way or not a shadow made her look up there stood yosh nakayama watching her major hirabayashis local gobetween nodded you do well he said in his slow careful english plot looks good thanks jane said she didnt want to collaborate with the japs and their quislings but she didnt want to get them angry at her either very bad things happened if the japs got mad at you hope everything grows fast nakayama said hope food we have lasts till it does arent the japanesejane was careful not to say japs to a jap bringing in supplies for their own men yes for anybody else nakayama shrugged they dont have a lot of ships to spare by the way he said it that was liable to be an understatement what do we do if if things run out the hawaiian japanese man shrugged again eat sugarcane eat pineapple eat whatever birds and fruit we can then we start to starve he didnt wait for any more questions with a curt nod he walked away to inspect the work of some other involuntary gardener jane eyed the zebra doves even more thoughtfully than she had before she worked till almost sundown her hands had blistered at first now they were starting to callus her nails were short and had dirt under them her face was sunburned her hair a sweaty mess she didnt worry as much about that as shed thought she would all her neighbors were in the same boat and if that boat happened to be the titanic she shoved the thought aside she still had running water in her apartment she didnt have hot water though and she couldnt even make any on the stove like the water heater the stove ran on natural gas there was no more natural gas for them to run on a cold shower in january would have been an invitation to double pneumoniato say nothing of frostbitein columbus here in wahiawa it was refreshing as long as she didnt linger under the water too long no more shampoo either jane did still have a couple of bars of ivory left after the one she was using what she would do once the last suds gurgled down the drain she didnt know her mouth twisted as she brushed her hair in front of the mirror figuring out what shed do then wasnt very hard one of her pupils could have done it with no trouble at all shed be filthy and shed stink that was what other such worries were cropping up too she was almost out of kotex pads like everything else those came or had come from the mainland what would she use without them rags she supposed what else was there her mouth twisted again harder this time she put on a sun dress to go to the communal supper it was fairly clean she didnt do farm work in it most people dressed a little nicer than usual for supper some didnt bother a couple of japanese soldiers with rifles on their shoulders strode up the street toward her she got out of their way and bowed holding the pose till theyd gone past they mostly didnt bother people who followed the rules theyd set mostly but you never could tell that was part of what made them so scary supper was rice and noodles with a little tomato sauce and some canned mushrooms for flavor dessert was canned pineapple that had been the only dessert for some time jane was sick of it but ate it anyhow her body cried out for all the food it could get supper wasnt really enough when she finished she didnt feel she was starving any more but she didnt feel full either everybody else seemed as tired as she was nobody said much nobody said anything at all about the japs early on a woman had cursed them at a communal meal a couple of days later she abruptly stopped showing up no one had seen her since somebody had listened to her somebody had betrayed her nobody knew who or even whether the informer was japanese chinese or haole nobody was inclined to take a chance the first lesson of tyranny shut up and keep your head down jane thought something with eyes that glowed in the dark startled her as she was walking home after a moment she realized it was only a cat she relaxed and walked on and then all unbidden a phrase shed heard in an italian restaurant in columbus popped into her mind roof rabbit the fellow whod said it had laughed so had the girl with him maybe an occasional cat had gone into the pot back in the old country people in america didnt do things like that did they what jane thought was a lot more meat on a cat than on one of those little zebra doves spit flooded into her mouth it had been a while since shed tasted meat then tears stung her eyes was this what hunger and fear of hunger did to people she nodded to herself there in the night so it seemed corporal takeo shimizu stood in a long line at a japanese field post office in honolulu the package he carried was addressed to his parents the line moved with the glacial pace of postoffice lines everywhere he didnt care hed expected nothing different sooner or later hed get to the front of it he didnt have anything else going on in the meantime at last he came up to a clerk the man looked even more bored than shimizu felt contents of the package he asked by his tone he couldnt have cared less souvenirs of war an american flag and a bayonet i took from the rifle of a dead yankee shimizu answered i want my honorable parents to see that i have not been idle here the postal clerk grunted had he seen any combat while the japanese were overrunning oahu shimizu wouldnt have bet on it some people always managed to land soft jobs behind the lines the clerk threw the package on a scale postage is seventyfive sen he announced shimizu gave him a oneyen coin and got his change the clerk put stamps on the package they were shimizu saw american stamps but they had a blue overprint that said hawaii in japanese characters one was also overprinted the other our islands now shimizu said not without a certain pride hed earned the right to be proud as far as he was concerned the hawaiian islands were japanese now because of him and men like him hai the clerk sounded indifferent he didnt quite yawn in shimizus face but he came close what were you to do with such people yes my friend have you ever seen machinegun fire shimizu wondered how would you like it if you did would you still be bored i doubt it he stepped away from the clerk another japanese soldier walked up with a bigger heavier package than the one hed just mailed what was in that one clothes maybe shimizu thought shirts and trousers would make very good spoils of war to send home when shimizu went outside a white woman was walking up the street toward him she hastily dipped her headit wasnt much of a bow but it would doand got out of his way he walked past her as if she didnt exist hed never seen a white woman before he landed on oahu he could count the times hed seen white men on the fingers of one hand a local japanese man about his own age who wore americanstyle clothes did a better job of bowing with him shimizu felt he could unbend a little this is the prettiest country in the world youre lucky to live here all the time please talk slow the local said talk only little japanese so sorry he wasnt kidding he didnt just have a peasant accent either he had the sort of accent an englishspeaker would he might look japanese on the outside but he was american where it counted corporal shimizu felt betrayed why didnt your parents teach you the way they should have he asked angrily the young man flinched as if shimizu had threatened him with a bayonet so sorry he said again he sounded tolerably japanese when he brought out the stock phrase but then he went on fumbling for words and butchering his grammar grandfather grandmother come here father mother born here they speak japanese with grandfather grandmother speak english with me speak japanese when no want i to know what they meaning i learn some not much english number one here disgraceful shimizu said what was even more disgraceful was that the young local didnt even understand the word shimizu tried again bad yes the local got that he bowed again repeating gomen nasai shimizu didnt care if he was sorry or not he jerked his thumb down the street the young man hurried away when shimizu got back to his companys encampment he was still in a foul mood whats the matter corporalsan shiro wakuzawa asked you look like you could bite nails in two ill tell you thats how i feel shimizu said the story of the young man who could hardly speak japanese poured out of him and he was happy that way he raged happy english number one here he saidenglish ichiban he mocked the way the local spoke and he couldnt even understand when i told him what a disgrace he was so sorry corporal wakuzawa said that did nothing to make shimizu feel better it just reminded him of the hawaiian japanese stuttering apologies private wakuzawa went on everything is pretty crazy here though some of the policemen in honolulu are koreans koreans if you can believe it and everybody even the japanese even the whites has to do what they say koreans that is crazy shimizu agreed korea had been part of the japanese empire longer than hed been alive any japanese knew koreans were hewers of wood and drawers of water and that was about all they got drafted into the army but as laborers and prison guards they werent good for anything else shimizu wouldnt have wanted to go into battle alongside koreans with rifles in their hands he said americans have to be a little screwy to let something like that go on i bet we take care of it now that were in charge i hope so corporal wakuzawa said if anybody thinks im going to do what some korean tells me to do hed better think twice oh no shimizu shook his head maybe they call themselves americans not koreans i dont care if they do maybe they call themselves policemen i dont care about that either we are soldiers of the imperial japanese army we obey no one except our superiors in the army if some korean copor even a real american coptries to tell you what to do kick him in the teeth wakuzawa was a skinny little fellow with a ready smile he couldnt look very fierce no matter how hard he tried but he did his best now hai corporalsan he said and mimed a kick at someone taller than he was shimizu laughed out loud i dont think youd get him in the teeth with that but it would probably do the job he slapped the private on the back in japan that would have been an unheardof familiarity between noncom and firstyear soldier here in easygoing hawaii it seemed natural enough kenzo and hiroshi takahashi used shovels and rakes and hoes to clear rubble from the streets of honolulu till the oshima maru put to sea with sails taking the place of her engine that was the most use they could be the job also paid well three full meals a day plus a dollar the work was steady if you liked that sort of thing kenzo didnt is this why we graduated from high school he asked bitterly filling the shovel full of broken bits of brick and dumping them into a waiting wheelbarrow his older brother shrugged and added a shovelful of his own its what weve got hiroshi answered if we dont pitch in the town just stays a mess yeah i suppose so kenzo said he and hiroshi didnt just speak englishthey made a point of speaking english he wondered if it was a point the rest of the men in the labor gang understood or even cared about like any outfit in honolulu the rubbleclearing party had men of every blood and every mix of bloods in it some of them used english some the pidgin that did duty for english among those who didnt speak it very well and some the languages of their homelands the straw boss was a hawaiian japanese who was fluently profane in both his own language and an english that was almost but not quite pidgin no waste time the straw boss shouted you waste your time you waste my time you waste my time you be sorry this was harder work than fishing kenzo hadnt thought anything could be it never got as frantic as pulling tuna off the line and gutting them one after another but it never let up either one shovelful after another the whole day long the guys who built the pyramids worked like this he said hiroshi shook his head they didnt have wheelbarrows kenzo grunted he sounded very much like his father when he did it though he would have brained anybody who said so with his shovel he said well youre right it could be worse i wouldntve believed it keep an eye peeled for cans hiroshi added guys who built the pyramids didnt have those either this time kenzo refused to back down they didnt know how lucky they were he said the rule was that any cans found intact had to go into the communal food store nobody paid attention to the rule unless japanese soldiers were close by to enforce it otherwise an older rule prevailed finders keepers of course half the time you didnt know what youd found till you got it open labels didnt last not when big chunks of the city had turned into wasteland cornedbeef hash canned peaches tomato soup nobody was fussy not these days every so often japanese soldiers would march past when they did the laborers had to stop what they were doing and bow kenzo ground his teeth at showing the invaders a respect he didnt feel like most japanese his age in hawaii hed always felt more ties with america than with the old country japan had been something for his father to talk about nostalgically but the war had made sure no haole no chinese no koreannobodywould ever treat him as anything but a damn jap after lowering his spade one more time to bow to some soldiers he noticed something interesting you see what i see he asked hiroshi in a voice not much above a whisper whats that his brother said just as quietly they dont come around by ones or twos any more kenzo said theyre always in buncheslike bananas heh hiroshi saidabout as much laughter as the crack deserved i can tell you how come if you really want to know sure kenzo said spit it out hiroshi paused till the straw boss went by he didnt stop shoveling neither did kenzo the straw boss went on to yell at somebody else the two takahashis looked busy enough to suit him once hed moved out of earshot hiroshi said they dont go around by ones or twos any more because they got knocked over the head when they didalways where nobody could see anything or find out what happened yeah kenzo asked eagerly yeah his brother said no way to take hostages or anything when they havent got any idea who done it he threw another shovelful of wreckage into the wheelbarrow then stopped when he took a look at kenzos face dont you go getting any dumb ideas now he wagged a finger at kenzo if im going to knock anybody over the head ill start with dad kenzo said hiroshi snorted as if hed been joking to show he wasnt he went on even after what they did to mother he still went to their stinking parade hell you know dad hiroshi said he stands up and whinnies when he hears kimigayo that made kenzo snort it damn near made him giggle he could picture his fatherpicture him all too wellas an aging cart horse responding to the japanese national anthem damn you he said still snorting now im going to want to give him a lump of sugar whenever i see him well go ahead hiroshi said were short on all kinds of stuff but weve got sugar sugar and pineapple how long can we eat em heres hoping we dont have to find out thats all when kenzo thought about food he didnt feel like joking any more he went back to work if he was busy he wouldnt have to think so much and laborers were getting fed well so far anyhow japanese soldiers werent the only people on the streets there were also scroungers men and women picking through the ruins for whatever they could grab both laborers and soldiers chased them when they saw them but the scroungers were like mongooses they were good at not being seen and there were ordinary people trying to lead ordinary lives in times that were anything but ordinary they often had a faintly lost air as if they not only couldnt believe how much things had changed but also refused to acknowledge it most of the people like that seemed to be haoles theyd been on top so long theyd come to take it for granted they didnt know how to cope now that hawaii was under new management they seemed to think this was all a bad dream theyd wake up pretty soon and everything would be fine except it wouldnt kenzo froze with his shovel in midair up the street toward him came elsie sundberg and a couple of other girls the last time shed seen him shed pretended she hadnt the memory of that still burned would she do it again he didnt think he could stand it if she did even though she wasnt exactly his girlfriend and never had been he knew just when she recognized him she half missed a step then turned to one of her friends and said something kenzo was too far away to catch the other girls just shrugged which told him nothing elsie squared her shoulders she kept walking when she came to where kenzo was working she nodded and said hello ken how are you he felt like cheering instead he nodded back im okay how are you is your family all right im here she answered that could have meant anything my familys safe yes how about you i see your brothers here yes kenzo nodded jerkily and my fathers fine my mother he didnt go on his face twisted i wont cry in front of her i wont he told himself and somehow he didnt oh ken im so sorry all of a sudden elsie sounded like the girl hed known for so long not the nearstranger who thought he was nothing but a jap one of the girls she was with a brunette named joyce something whod graduated a couple of years ahead of her and kenzo said i didnt know the japs did anything to their own he gripped the handle on the shovel very tightly she probably hasnt got any brains to knock out he told himself he made himself hold still it wasnt easy neither was holding his voice steady as he answered im not a jap im an american just as much as you areor i would be if youd let me by the way joyce looked at him he might as well have spoken to her in japanese elsies other friend rolled her eyes as if to say shed heard it before and didnt believe a word of it kenzo waited to see what elsie would do she eyed him as if she were seeing him for the first time in a way maybe she was she said take care of yourself ive got to go and she did joyce wagged a finger at her she just shrugged the straw boss yelled you work takahashi you lazy baka yaro kenzo did maybe the world wasnt such a wretched place after all viii lieutenant saburo shindo strode along the runway at wheeler field his boots clumped on concrete the wreckage of american warplanes caught on the ground had been bulldozed off to the grass alongside the runways japanese technicians attacked the wrecks with pliers and wrenches and screwdrivers and wirecutters salvaging what they could a lot of japanese flight instruments were based on their american equivalents in a pinch the american ones might do and spare parts wherever they came from were always welcome turning to commander fuchida shindo said the americans had so much here hai fuchida nodded we knew that before we started this we knew it yes but did we know it shindo said did we feel it in our bellies i dont think so if we had known how much they had would we have had the nerve to try what we tried this time fuchida shrugged what you have is one thing what you do with it is something else and we had the advantage of surprise he waved to the shattered hulks of airplanes once we caught them on the ground they never had the chance to recover yes sir shindo said that was the point of the exercise all right fuchida turned away toward the northeast now we make them come to us if they want to fight a war in the pacific from their own west coast theyre welcome to try he paused then resumed commander genda was right if wed struck the fleet and gone away they would have used this for their advance base not san francisco and who knows what they might have interfered with but hawaii shields everything were doing farther west oh yes we make good progress in the philippines and the dutch east indies they say shindo paused for the first time really hearing something commander genda sir thats right fuchida answered a small smile on his face but i thought the plan for the attack on pearl harbor came from admiral yamamoto shindo said and if you ask gendasan about it youll go right on thinking the same thing fuchida told him i sometimes think genda is much too modest for his own good but i happen to know he was the one who persuaded yamamoto to follow up the air strike with an invasion hell say yamamoto was the one who persuaded the army and that was what counted but he gave yamamoto the idea i had no idea shindo murmured genda has said not a word of this he wouldnt its not his style fuchida said from what shindo knew of genda that was true to genda the operation counted for more than anything else including who proposed it shindo suddenly snapped his fingers an unusual display for him something ive been meaning to ask you sirhave the technicians made any more sense of the wreckage we found at that opana place not so much as id like fuchida answered whatever it was the americans didnt want us to know anything about it they did a good thorough job of destroying it after we landed i can make a guess shindo said fuchida gestured for him to go on he did when we attacked the first american carrierthe one that turned out to be the enterprise she had fighters up and waiting for us before we got there we didnt see any american patrol planes as we flew toward her i dont think there were any i think the americans have instruments that let them spot planes at some very long distance fuchida frowned thoughtfully and you think the opana installation is one of these opana is a logical place for one shindo replied its as far north as you can go on oahu near enough any attack was likeliest to come from the north and the yankees would do a good job of destroying something that important if they had that kind of device there why didnt it find our first attack wave fuchida asked it didnt you know our surprise was complete lieutenant shindo shrugged this time maybe something went wrong with it maybe the americans just didnt pay any attention to it they were like those big birds that stick their heads in the sand ostriches fuchida supplied they dont really do that you know so what shindo shrugged once more the americans did and thats what counts yes fuchida turned toward the northeast once more they did a bad job of scouting and it cost them wed better not imitate them or it will cost us too well need longrange patrols to make sure they dont try to cause trouble can we afford the fuel to do a proper job of it shindo asked the cost of using up the fuel is one thing the cost of not using it up is liable to be something else again fuchida said or do you think im wrong if you do dont be shy lieutenant shindo was seldom shy he was if anything unusually forthright for a japanese because he didnt ruffle easily he didnt think anyone else should either but he shook his head now no sir youre not wrong its just one of the things weve got to think about oh yes fuchida mimed letting his shoulders sag as if the weight of the world lay heavy upon them but then he gestured not just at the technicians stripping us airplanes but at all of wheeler field so many things to think about and this would be much harder if not for everything weve captured from the americans ive thought the same thing ever since i saw the bulldozers and other earthmoving equipment we used to fix the airstrip up at haleiwa shindo said and that was just civilian stuff what the local builders used fuchida said the military gear is even better though a lot of it got ruined in the fighting and the americans sabotaged what they could of the rest by what ive seen they might have done a better job with that shindo said now commander fuchida shrugged again theyre rich he said and said no more lieutenant shindo inclined his head in silent agreement he understood exactly what his superior meant because the yankees had so much they didnt seem to realize how valuable even their scraps and leavings were to the japanese along with the earthmoving machinery theyd left plenty of automobiles behind as they fell back from the northern part of oahu and they hadnt torched all the filling stations either the japanese had made good use of both the cars and the precious gasoline the same held true elsewhere hawaii had an astonishing telephone network there was a phone for every ten people in the islands in japan the figure was more like one for every sixty people outside of tokyo it wasnt far from one for every hundred people you could talk to anyone here or any place on the islands almost instantly the americans took that so much for granted they hadnt bothered to destroy the phone lines or the switching system that would make it much easier for japan to defend its conquests japanese soldiers slept in us barracks that hadnt been blown up to deny them to the invaders they lived softer than they would have at home the list went on and on fuchida kept looking toward the american mainland sooner or later they will try to come back he predicted let them try shindo said well give them a set of lumps for their troubles and then they can try again he and fuchida smiled at each other the sun shone down brightly it was a perfect morning but then what morning wasnt perfect in hawaii once upon a time in the dim and vanished days before the war came to oahu kapiolani park had been a place where tourists and locals could get away from the frenzy of waikiki for a little while lying by the road out to diamond head the expanse of grass and trees had featured among other things a fancy band shell where the royal hawaiian band played on sunday afternoons now barbed wire and machinegun towers ringed kapiolani park japanese soldiers patrolled the perimeter in the park itself tents sprouted like a swarm of toadstools this was what being a prisoner of war meant a mynah hopped along the grass between the tents head cocked to one side as it studied the ground for worms and grubs fletcher armitage studied the mynah the same way the bird studied the ground and with the same hunger he had a rock in his hand he also watched his fellow captives if he knocked the bird over could one of them grab it before he did that was an important question everybody on oahu was going to get hungry by and by fletch had seen as much before the surrender for pows though by and by was already here the japanese fed them a little rice or noodles every day sometimes green leaves of one sort or another were mixed in with the mess more rarely so were bits of fish even when they were the days ration wouldnt have kept a fouryearold healthy let along a grown man come a little closer you stupid bird fletch murmured mynahs took people pretty much for granted why not people had always let them alone people had till they started getting hungry fletchs belly growled at the thought of mynah meat hed never been fat he was getting skinnier by the day hed traded his belt for a length of rope and half a dozen cigarettes hed smoked all the cigarettes the day he got them the rope would go on holding up his pants after he got too skinny for the belt to do him any good closer came the mynah and closer still till it got within about six feet of him then it paused tilting its head to one side and watching him with a beady black eye it was fairly tame yes but not suicidally so like a zebra dove come on fletch crooned come on baby the mynah bird kept on casing him it came no closer he crooned curses when he decided it wasnt going to hed just have to take his best shot he let fly with the rock the motion of his arm startled the bird it was already on the wing and squawking when the rock thudded down somewhere close to where it had been would he have hit it if it hadnt taken off maybe maybe not too coming out with some curses that werent crooned at all fletch turned away in disgust too bad buddy said a soldier in a tent across the narrow track woulda been good i bet yeah fletch said it wouldve been the rest of the day looked black and gloomy if hed made the kill he could have had a few bites of real meat even if mynahs werent anything to make you forget fried chicken now hed have to get by on rations alone the only trouble with that was a man couldnt possibly do it he went over and picked up the rock before somebody else got hold of it it was a good size for clouting birds some time before too long hed get another chance dont blow it he told himself sternly how smart were birds how long would they take to figure out that theyd suddenly become fair game how long before they started staying away from kapiolani park if they did that would be very bad the japs didnt bother bringing drinking water into the park they just left the drinking fountains in place generous of them fletch thought sourly if a man had to stand in line for an hour just to wet his whistle well so what that was no skin off the japs noses anyone who wanted to wash had to do it at the drinking fountains too that meant anything resembling real washing was impossible fletch noticed the stink less than hed thought he would when everybody smelled nobody smelled and everybody sure smelled here rank had no privileges in line as far as fletch could see rank had no privileges anywhere in the camp any more if enlisted men obeyed officers it was because they respected them or liked them not because they thought they had to and if they didnt what could the officers do about it not much the japs wouldnt back them up the japs didnt care what happened here slowly slowly the line snaked forward fletch sighed he was thirsty he was tired and he was hungry anyone who was hungry enough to want to eat a mynah bird was hungry all right unless he caught a mynah or a dove hed stay hungry till he got supper he shook his head hed stay hungry after he got supper too because it wouldnt be nearly enough his turn at the water fountain finally came he drank and drank and drank if he drank enough he could trick his belly into thinking he was full at least for a little while he splashed water on his face and hands too come on buddy shake a leg the soldier behind him growled reluctantly fletch moved away from the fountain the breeze off the ocean a few hundred yards away dried the water on his face as usual the weather was perfect not too hot not too cold moist but not too humid diamond head towered in the middle distance the inside of the dead volcano was supposed to be honeycombed with tunnels fortified beyond belief when the rest of oahu was hostage to the japs though that hadnt turned out to matter a whole hell of a lot a bunch of things everybody had thought would be important hadnt turned out to matter a whole hell of a lot the innate superiority of the white man to the oriental was one that occurred to fletch here in this pow camp he didnt feel very goddamn superior the japs went out of their way to rub it in that he wasnt too a squad of guards strode through the camp bayonets glittering on their rifles americans scrambled to get out of the soldiers way along with everybody else fletch bowed when the guards passed him everyone had learned that lesson in a hurry the japanese set on and savagely beat anybody who forgot a couple of americans were supposed to have died from their mistreatment fletch didnt know if that was true but he wouldnt have been surprised the japs didnt give a rats ass whether americans lived or died fletch sat down in front of his tent there wasnt much else to do in fact there wasnt anything else to do hunger left him slow and lethargic a fly landed on his arm slowly and lethargically he brushed it away there seemed to be more flies in the pow camp every day that only made sense the latrines got fouler every day fletch didnt know how many thousands of prisoners were jammed in here enough so that their wastes overwhelmed the lime chloride the japs deigned to sprinkle into the latrine trenches how long before they ran out of lime chloride altogether how long before they ran out of chlorine for treating the drinking water probably not longlike damn near everything else the chemicals came or had come from the mainland what would happen when they did run out dysentery was the word that came to mind after half an hour or so fletch heaved himself to his feet the one drawback to filling yourself full of water was that you didnt stay full it worked its way through he trudged off toward the slit trenches he might as well have been moving in slow motion he didnt have the energy to hurry he stood at the edge of a trench unfastened his fly and eased himself out beyond the barbed wire japanese soldiers kept an eye on him and on the other americans using the slit trenches fletch caught a guards eye as he put himself back in his pants yeah you son of a bitch ive got a bigger one than you do he thought he turned away such games were dangerous if he got too obvious the japs were liable to understand exactly what he meant then thered be hell to pay he ambled off the guard didnt start yelling or open fire so hed got away with it fletch is that you i thought sure you were dead gordy ill be goddamned i thought you were too fletch pumped gordon douglas hand then both men seemed to decide at the same instant that that wasnt good enough they clung to each other as if each were drowning and the other a life preserver douglas was dirty and thinner than fletch ever remembered seeing him seeing him at all was great though how the hell did you end up in one piece the other artillery lieutenant shrugged half the time i ask myself the same thing they started shooting us up when we were just going out of schofield barracks yeah us too fletch broke in you would have been in the truck convoy right in front of mine or maybe right behind it behind it i think douglas rubbed at a nasty halfhealed scar on his arm but jesus god fletch you cant do shit when the other guys got planes in the air and you dont youre dead as what comes out of a spam can i found that out too armitage said we didnt get to our position till the japs were already hitting the beaches and that was too late shit you did better than we did douglas said we never made it to haleiwa at all it cant be more than fifteen fucking miles but we never fucking got there air attacks traffic on the road coming south wrecks to try and go aroundexcept sometimes you couldnt go around them you had to clear emby handand that took forever tell me about it fletch exclaimed our truck got shot up we commandeered a civilian car you shouldve heard the nips in it howl when we threw em the hell out try towing a with one of those babies if you want a fun time you kept your piece you dont know how lucky you are douglas said we had a bomb burst right under ours early that second morning took out most of my crew i was farther awaythats when i got this he rubbed the scar again they slapped a bandage on it but after that i was an infantryman and a pisspoor infantryman too let me be the first to tell you i had all groundpounders on the gun except for me by the time we folded up fletch said they learned the ropes pretty good when its root hog or die you learn or you go under douglas shrugged i learned too or learned enough i mustveim still here fletch didnt say anything to that from what hed seen who lived and who died when bombs and bullets started flying was oftennot always but oftena matter of luck instead he waved at what had been the charming kapiolani park and was now the anything but charming pow camp yeah were here all right and aint it a garden spot gordon douglas only shrugged again the goddamn monkeys didnt murder us all after we surrendered far as im concerned thats a step up from what they couldve done step up from what i figured theyd do too some of the shit i saw he spat but didnt go into detail all fletch did was nod and say yeah he scratched at himself he was itching more and more as time went by fleas lice bedbugs all of the above probably all of the above then he waved at the camp again they didnt need to murder us all at once looks like theyre gonna do it by inches instead he poked douglas in the belly the other man had always had trouble keeping the pounds off he didnt any more youre skinnier than you used to be so am i dont remind me douglas said they give us this horrible slop and they dont give us enough of it and its the most delicious stuff in the world when you get it on account of then you feel a little less empty for a little while i know i know oh god do i know fletch looked toward the kitchen tents he knew how long it was till supper tooknew to the minute even without a watch too long too goddamn long when oscar van der kirk and charlie kaapu got their surfboards from the outrigger club charlie asked you giving lessons today this afternoon yeah not now oscar answered how about you his hapa hawaiian buddy only shrugged not now oscar always thought of himself as a happygolucky guy next to most of the population of hawaii much less the mainland he was next to charlie kaapu he might have been a rockefeller or a du pont charlie what the hell do you do for money he asked charlie shrugged never have much never worry much too much worry too much huhu waste time he slapped his rockhard belly i dont starve yet yeah oscars voice rang a little hollow before the japs took over that would have been a joke it wasnt so funny now people were short of everything from pasta and tomatoes to toilet paper that wouldnt get better only worse every once in a while even though shed walked out on him he wondered how susie higgins was doing and where her next meal was coming from he didnt waste a whole lot of grief on her though she was the kind whod always land on her feetor if she had to on her back his toes dug into the sand as he and charlie walked down to the pacific waikiki beach was crowded this morningnot with tourists the way it usually was but with fishermen swarms of people with a rod and reel and quite a few people with just a rod and a length of line and a hook were out trying their luck a man in a straw hat a loud floral shirt and bermuda shorts hauled a silvery fish out of the water it wasnt very big but all his neighbors stared jealously he stashed the fish in a creel he kept between his feet nobody was going to take his prize away from him excuse us scuse us oscar said over and over pushing past the fishermen to get into the sea charlie was more direct he used his surfboards nose to clear a path for himself a couple of fishermen gave him nasty looks he looked right back at them they muttered to themselves but that was all they did charlie hardly ever got into fights that was mostly because nobody was crazy enough to want to take him on a hook splashed into the water right by oscars shoulder as he paddled out to sea that wouldnt have been any fun if it had bitten into him he scowled back toward the beach but he couldnt even tell which wouldbe izaak walton had launched it he breathed a sigh of relief when he and charlie got out of range of such missiles well they wont catch us instead of their minnows he said yeah charlie said and then that one guy got a real fish dont see that all the time not off waikiki beach these days you take whatever you get oscar said along with their surfboards he and charlie had hand nets and canvas sacks to hold whatever they caught they could get a lot farther out to sea than the optimists who fished from the waters edge or maybe they werent optimists maybe they were just hungry men doing what they could anything was better than nothing were he giving a lesson oscar would have turned back toward shore long since but he wasnt oahu receded behind him the breeze came off the land he wrinkled his nose at just about the same time charlie said whats that stink its got to be the prisoners camp in kapiolani park oscar answered i cant think of anything else it could be charlie kaapu grunted thats a nasty business everything thats happened since the japs landed is a nasty business oscar said charlie grunted again he didnt say anything more so oscar took it for a grunt of agreement off in the distance a couple of fishing sampans headed out to sea the light breeze filled their sails more and more sampans were abandoning engines for the wind without fuel what good were engines without fuel what good was anything oscars chevy sat on the street it wasnt going anywhere even if he could get gas for it the battery was sure to be dead by now he was jealous of the sampans for the same reason the surf fishermen were bound to be jealous of him as he could get fish the men on the beach couldnt so the sampans could find fish hed never see hey charlie he called charlie kaapu looked up from his paddling what you want you think we could rig a little mast and sail on a surfboard that would let us get a lot farther out to sea than we can like this charlie thought it over then shook his head waste time he said oscar shrugged his friend might well be right something nibbled his finger he looked into the water a minnow darted away oscar laughed his hands and feet were the bait he fished with even as he laughed though he also scanned the sea fish he wanted to catch werent the only sort out there the pacific also held fish that wanted to catch him sharks big enough to be dangerous were rare some people on the mainland imagined surfriders devoured every day that was a bunch of hooey but a man who ignored the risk was a fool too it was like not watching the road when you got behind the wheel what do you think he asked charlie after a while we out far enough charlie looked back toward the shore i guess maybe we dont get anything we can paddle some more okay oscar stopped paddling and let his arm trail in the water he fluttered his fingers now he wanted fish to come up to him here isnt this an interesting piece of seaweed that was what he wanted to put across to the fish i should be writing radio spots he thought a fish came up to see what he was selling he had the net in his other hand he didnt advertise the net he made a swipe with itand the fish got away oh shit he said without too much heat such mishaps happened all the time charlie made a swipe of his own he hauled something silvery out of the sea as he stuffed it into his sack he sent oscar a sly smile oscar took his hand out of the water and flipped charlie off they both laughed no mystical native talent had let charlie catch a fish where oscar failed before long oscar would be smiling and charlie cussing they both knew it there wasnt any point in getting excited if you werent patient youd never make it as a fisherman after a while oscar caught a little ray before he came to hawaii he would have thrown the batwinged fish back a few visits to chinese and japanese restaurants though had convinced him ray and even shark could be pretty tasty if you did them right and he couldnt be too choosy these days anyhow a swarm of minnows flashed by like shooting stars under the surface of the sea oscar and charlie looked up the same hopeful expression on both their faces minnows wouldnt swim that way unless something was after them and whatever was after them might really be worth catching oscar swiped with his net he let out a whoophis catch almost tore the handle out of his grasp he hauled a mackerel up onto his surfboard a few seconds later charlie caught one too they both stuffed the fish into their sacks and thrust the nets into the sea again if there were more they wanted them and there were oscar got another one in nothing flat i eat today he thought lots of people in honolulu had such worries these days unlike most of those people oscar had had them before hed spent a lot of time living from hand to mouth there was a difference though when hed worried about going hungry before it was because hed been short of money now he was short of food and so was everybody else he went on fishing even after he caught the second mackerel what he didnt eat today could go into the little icebox in his room for tomorrow or he could trade it for other food or sell it to get the money he needed to pay the rent he wondered if his landlord would take fish for the rent in place of cash before the war started the idea would have been ridiculous not any more well shall we head back he asked at last after a long dry stretch why not charlie kaapu said plenty for today he worried about tomorrow even less than oscar did they turned their surfboards toward the shore and began to paddle again that was work familiar work but work oscar thought some more about putting a sail on the surfboard it wouldnt be pretty but he was damned if he could see why it wouldnt work you did what you had to do if you were making your living as a surfrider that was one thing if you were using your surfboard mostly as a fishing boat that was something else again waikiki beach neared the fishermen still cast their lines upon the water oscar glanced over to charlie shall we give em a show he said what else we got to do charlie answered they rode the breakers back to the beach oscar was used to standing up on a surfboard supporting a skittish tourist doing the same thing with a net in one hand and his sack of fish in the other was no huhu beside him charlie kaapu might have been the incarnation of kuula the hawaiian god of fishermen you got the feeling nothing could make him come off his surfboard that feeling might be wrong charlie could take a tumble like anybody else but oscar didnt think he would not this time and he didnt neither did oscar they glided smoothly up onto the sand the fishermen gave them a smattering of applause somebody reached into his pocket and tossed oscar a quarter oscar caught it out of the air with his net that won him some more cheers he would have got more still if he could have balanced the coin on the end of his nose he shrugged as he walked back to his apartment he was a performer when he got on a surfboard if he got paid for being a performer what was wrong with that a japanese officer shouted in his own language along with the rest of the prisoners in the pearl city camp jim peterson waited for the english translation he didnt have to wait long as usual a hawaiianborn jap about his own age stood next to the officer the local wore a sharp sharkskin suit he seemed happy as a clam to serve his new bosses you will be moved he said you will go to the north and central part of the island some of you will work in the fields you will be well fed and well treated peterson turned his head ever so slightly toward prez mckinley who stood beside him yeah and the check is in the mail he said out of the side of his mouth mckinley snickered he didnt do it very loud though guards watched the pows if you got out of line they beat you they stomped you too and hit you with sticks theyd already killed at least one american nobody wanted to give them any excuse to go to work and there were probably prisoners who couldnt be trusted peterson didnt like thinking so but it was the way to bet some people were out for themselves first last and always if you cant beat em join em if you cant lick em lick their boots the jap with the sword on his hip shouted some more the quisling in the sharkskin suit translated this move will begin in one hour all ablebodied prisoners must go it is an order from the japanese imperial army the way he said it god might have handed it to moses on a tablet of stone what about the wounded what about the sick somebody called questionsthe mere idea that there could be questionsseemed to surprise both the translator and the officer the officer growled something if it didnt mean what the devil was that peterson would have eaten his hat the local jap spoke nervously in japanese the officer said something else the translator returned to english they will come when they are fit until then they stay here they could put most of em on trucks and bring em along mckinley said as the gathering broke up they could yeah but why would they peterson answered they cant have a whole lot of fuel here you think theyre going to waste it on americans you think theyre going to waste it on american prisoners for crying out loud for crying out loud is right mckinley said dont know what the hell i was thinking i musta been outa my tree for japs theyre being damn nice to give us an hour to get ready peterson said its not like ive got a lot to pack outside of the clothes on my back what ive got is a canteen and a deck of cards take em prez mckinley said you can kill a lot of time with cards and fill up the canteen before you start god knows whether those monkeysll give us anything no matter what they say that made more sense than peterson wished it did rations had been anything but abundant here and the japanese didnt bother to hide their contempt for the men whod surrendered any american who gave them even the slightest excuse got beaten up as far as the japs were concerned they were on top the prisoners were on the bottom and anybody who didnt remember that was how things were supposed to work was asking for it he had to stand in line to fill the canteen he had to stand in line for everything in the prison camp might as well be in the service or something he thought wryly the one faucet the pows were allowed to use was at the back of what had been a park building two japs in a sandbagged machinegun nest kept an eye on the queue mckinley had a canteen too he rubbed his chin which was sporting a pretty fair crop of grizzled whiskers christ what i wouldnt do for some shaving soap and a razor he said peterson nodded oh yeah were all going to look like we play for the house of david before too long they set out when the japanese officer blew a whistle it felt like about an hour to peterson he didnt know for sure having been relieved of his watch the jap had one on his wrist peterson wondered if hed worn it when he got here or if hed stolen it since he sure didnt want to know badly enough to ask though the japanese soldiers nervously eyed the prisoners as they came out of the barbedwire enclosure the japs had thrown up around the park the soldiers gestured with their rifles this way every one of the rifles had a bayonet fixed to it the long blades gleamed in the sun they werent worth much in combat but for sticking a prisoner who couldnt fight back theyd do just fine along with the other men peterson started to walk the journey north was like running a newsreel backwards the farther he went the more distant in time the remains of the fighting were things seemed to go in waves that hadnt been apparent while he crouched on the landscape with a rifle in his hand a stretch of ground would look as if a giant had been stamping on it with hobnailed boots that would be a place where the americans had tried to make a stand then he would go forward through a few hundred yards of relatively unchewed terrain after that would come another battered stretch of ground that would in fact have been the previous us line once they got out of pearl city and onto kamehameha highway there were places where the retreating americans had blown up the road to keep japrun vehicles from moving forward along it not all the holes had been repaired some of them were ten feet deep and thirty feet across the prisoners naturally tried to go into the fields on either side to get around them the guards shook their heads and gestured with their rifles kinjiru they shouted kinjiru meant something like you cant do that it was one of the bits of japanese peterson had started picking up however little he wanted any what do they want us to do prez he asked sergeant mckinley go through the goddamn hole thats nuts nuts or not it was what the japs had in mind you make said one of them who knew a few words of english you go in plainly none of the prisoners wanted to do that they piled up at the edge of the crater the guards did some more yelling some of the gestures they used were pretty explicit if you dont go in youre going to get it not a pow went forward though they cant shoot all of us somebody said jim peterson wished he were sure of that for the moment though it seemed to be true one of the guards went pelting off toward the rear the most junior man mckinley remarked yeah i noticed peterson said by now hed got the hang of reading jap army rank badges the more gold and the less red in the background the higher the grade within each grade the more stars the higher the rank for most of an hour the standoff continued then that poor miserable private his tunic now all sweaty returned with the japanese officer whod started the parade and his interpreter he looked things over then spoke in his own language the interpreter said he says you have to the count of five to obey the order you have been given after that the guards will begin to shoot they will not stop shooting until you obey ichi the officer said the interpreter held up one finger ni two fingers san three the guards raised their rifles to their shoulders and stared down the barrels peterson didnt find out how to say four or five in japanese with almost identical frightened moans half a dozen prisoners in the front ranks plunged down into the crater they floundered over to the other side and started scrambling up toward the asphalt once more other men followed them as soon as a couple made it up onto the highway again they reached into the hole in the ground to help their buddies climb out along with everybody else peterson went through the hole he was filthy and weary by the time he made it to the other side going around would have saved time it would have been ever so much easier but it wasnt what the japs wanted you know what theyre doing he said as the march north resumed lording it over us you mean prez mckinley said trying without much luck to get the dirt off his tunic yeah that too peterson answered but theyre breaking us taming us like youd break a mustang or something mckinley muttered to himself it sounded like try and break me will they and maybe he had a point but maybe not too if the japs could get the americans to do what they wanted without making a fuss for fear something worse would happen if they didnt wouldnt that be enough to keep them happy what more could they want egg in their beer plenty of people were out in the fields cutting down sugarcane and pulling up pineapple plants the big five the companies that had run hawaii ever since the annexation were probably having heart attacks what the big five thought was the least of jim petersons worries what he saw here actually made some sense if hawaii couldnt import what it needed from the mainland it would have to grow its own food people were taking the first steps in that direction anyhow yes but can they grow enough soon enough he wondered all he could do was give a mental shrug he didnt know at least they were trying on went the pows a few people in the fields waved to them that took guts with japanese soldiers watching the prisoners and others watching the laborers peterson wanted to wave back he didnt though it might have drawn the japs notice to people who werent afraid to show they didnt like the occupiers they were nearing the turnoff for wheeler field when a soldier whod been visibly dragging for a while went over to the side of the road and sat down on his haunches cantgo onfor a while he panted get my breathcatch up later his face was gray with fatigue peterson wondered if hed been hiding a wound two guards rushed over to him kinjiru they shouted one of them made a motion with his rifle get up so sorry soldiersan the american soldier said shaking his head cant do it too damn tired let me resta little then ill come kinjiru the guards yelled once more the one whod gestured did it again when the american didnt get up they both kicked him he howled and rolled over onto his side they waited a moment then kicked him again he groaned with an effort he made it to his hands and knees they waited a minute or so when he didnt get to his feet they kicked him some more plainly they were ready to kick him to death if he didnt straighten up and fly right he must have figured that out at about the same time peterson did with another groan he heaved himself up onto his pins he stood swaying like a cypress in a hurricane but he didnt fall down one of the guards shoved him back into the pack two pows caught him and held him upright otherwise he would have fallen on his face the other guard used his rifle to urge the whole gang of prisoners forward again the exhausted soldier had a devil of a time going forward the guards watched him like wolves eyeing a sickly elk that couldnt keep up with the herd if he fell again he was theirs he saw it too you better get away from me boys he croaked if they decide to shoot me they might hit one of you by mistake rage kindled in peterson fuck em all he said well get you there goddammit he draped the flagging mans arm around his shoulder well take turns ive got him next prez mckinley said other men clamored to volunteer the japs didnt make a fuss as long as everybody kept up they didnt care how peterson strode ahead taking his weight and a good part of the other mans till prez cut in on him almost as if at a dance thisll work as long as most of us are sound enough to help the ones who arent he thought good thing oahus a small island they cant take us too far this might turn into a death march if they could as the sun sank down toward the waianae range a couple of trucks forced their way through the column of prisoners they were us army vehicles the white star on the driversside door hastily painted over with a japanese meatball goddamn guards didnt want to shoot them for going around the holes in the road peterson whispered to prez mckinley oh hell no mckinley whispered back they got japs driving em you suppose theyve brought rations for us thatd be nice peterson said in spite of the japanese officers promise the prisoners had got no food as they tramped up kamehameha highway petersons stomach was growling like an angry bear but instead of rations the trucks disgorged machinegun teams who deployed onto high ground from which they could rake the throng of prisoners a buick came up a few minutes later in it were the japanese officer and his local stooge the officer spoke in his own tongue the translator turned it into english if anyone tries to escape we will open fire on all of you you are responsible for one another see to it wheres our food the question came from half a dozen places in the crowd the local obviously didnt want to translate it into japanese but the officer nudged him just as obviously asking what was going on the local jap spoke so did the officer the fellow in the sharkskin suit said you disgraced yourselves with disobedience at the first hole in the road going hungry is the price you pay you should be thankful it is no worse jim peterson was anything but thankful with all those machine guns staring down at him though he couldnt do a thing about the way he really felt jiro takahashi and his sons looked over the oshima maru as she bobbed in the light chop in kewalo basin she hardly seemed like the same sampan a tall mast and a gaff rig changed her into something much more graceful than she had been with a diesel stuck on her stern that she was also much slower than she had been and dependent on the breezes seemed almost an afterthought shes ready eizo doi said the handyman cracked his knuckles producing a noise alarmingly like a machinegun burst you sure you know what youre doing with her takahashisan if you dont you should only take her out a little ways the first few times till you get the hang of it ill manage jiro said i helped my father man a boat on the inland sea how to place the sail and which line to pull theyll come back to me soon enough what i really need to do is show the boys how everything works kenzo said something to hiroshi in english jiro caught the words moby dick was that some sort of strange obscenity hed never heard before he knew what a dick was but the moby part went right over his head please yourself doi said just dont get in trouble before you finish bringing me my fish the way things were these days most people were happier to get paid in food than in cash as supplies got tighter mere money bought less and less nimble as a mongoose doi hopped up onto the wharf good luck he told jiro and bowed the fisherman returned it half a beat slower than they should have so did his sons no they arent properly japanese at all jiro thought with yet another mental sigh eizo doi was polite enough to pretend he hadnt noticed they were slow he ambled off towards another sampan jiro wondered if he was doing anything these days besides putting masts and sails on boats that couldnt use their engines any more jiro stepped down into the oshima maru hiroshi and kenzo followed a little more slowly they couldnt act as if they knew it all here because they damn well didnt okay father what do we do hiroshi asked the first word was english but jiro got it hereyou go to the rudder for now you know what to do with that neh jiro said and his elder son nodded jiro turned to kenzo all right you come with me im here kenzo said good first we find which way the wind is blowing jiro said for the moment that was easy it came off the hills in back of honolulu and would waft the oshima maru out to sea once the sampan sailed out onto the pacific though things would get more complicated next thing to remember is mind the booms they can swing and knock you right into the water hai kenzo said jiro looked back toward the stern yes hiroshi was listening good he would need to know too jiro went on we set the foresail to one side of the mast and the jib on the other he did that then tied the booms to the belaying pins doi had mounted on the rail now we cast off and were ready to go he brought in the rope that bound the oshima maru to the wharf light as a feather the sampan glided out of kewalo basin hiroshi steered well enoughhe did know how to do that even so a look of surprise and delight spread over his face she feels so different he exclaimed and she did before with the motor pushing her forward shed been a creature of straight lines if the small waves were moving at an angle to her path shed just chopped through them not any more kenzo noted another essential difference shes so quiet too jiro had got used to the relentless pounding and throbbing of the diesel without it the oshima maru might have been a ghost of her former self all he heard were the waves and the distant squawks of sea birds and the breeze thrumming in the lines and bellying out the sails the sampan also felt different underfoot hed always got the engines vibration through the soles of his feet theyd told him as much about how it was running as his ears did now all he felt was the boats pure motion he smiled he couldnt help himself im younger than you are he told his sons im with my father on the inland sea kenzo and hiroshi looked at each other they probably thought he was crazy they often did he didnt care he could see the rising sun on those crowded waters the headlands that looked so different from the jungled slopes of oahu sometimes a flight of longnecked cranes overhead he hadnt thought about cranes in years or realized how much he missed them he ran straight before the wind for a while and talked his sons through adjusting the sails to compensate as it shifted slightly he showed them how if you wanted to swing to port you had to swing the mainsail to starboard it seemed backward but they soon saw it was what needed doing theres a lot more to think about now hiroshi said oh yes jiro agreed of course you are thinking about it now and that makes it seem harder after youve done it for a while you wont need to wonder what to do youll just do it he wasnt doing things automatically himselfno not even close part of him might have been that fourteenyearold out on the inland sea with his father the rest was a middleaged man trying to remember what went where and why his fathers boat had been rigged differently he knew the principles here but none of the details were the same he didnt want his sons seeing that kenzo asked if the wind is still off the mountains when we come back to the basin how do we get there we tack jiro answered it means we slide in at an angle you cant sail straight against the wind but you can go against it ill show you all right kenzos voice was uncommonly subdued jiro almost laughed in his sons face yes the old man still knew a few things the young one hadnt imagined that always came as a painful surprise to the younger generation a tern soared down and perched at the very tip of the mast it stared at the takahashis out of big black eyes that seemed all the bigger because the rest of it was so perfectly white that never would have happened when we had the diesel hiroshi said of course not there wouldnt have been any place for it to land then jiro said hiroshi stirred as if that wasnt exactly what hed meant but he didnt try to explain himself as far as jiro was concerned that was fine jiro had his sons practice setting the sails with the wind astern and at either quarter they got the hang of it pretty fast they knew the oshima maru and how she had handled that helped them now what jiro didnt let on was that he was learning almost as much as they were no he hadnt handled sails in a lot of years himself but he did remember enough to send the sampan on two long gliding reaches into the wind you see how we beat back toward the shore he said hiroshi and kenzo both nodded they seemed impressed jiro was impressed that hed remembered enough to manage to do that too he had more sense than to show it though however serene the sampan was under sail she wasnt swift jiro had come to take the noisy smelly diesel for granted it got him where he needed to go and got him there pretty quick now she took a lot longer to reach likely fishing grounds well probably have to spend the night in the boat hiroshi said well so what kenzo answered its not like weve got anything much to come home to jiro and hiroshi both grimaced not because he was wrong but because he was right they spilled minnows into the pacific they had fewer than usual the boats that had caught the nehus were dieselpowered too all three takahashis had netted these themselves using choppedup bits of rice from their own rations as bait then the fishing lines with their big silvery hooks went into the sea jiro hoped for a good catch to make up for the rice theyd lost one more problem with the new sail kenzo said people can see us for a long way he was also right about that like most sampans the oshima maru was painted a blue somewhere between sea and sky not least because the color made it hard for competitors to find her but what good did the camouflage do when the mast and sail stuck up there like a christmas tree it did work both ways if three or four other boats could spy the sampan jiro could see them too what he wanted to see was what hed caught he felt like shouting when the first few hooks yielded aku and ahi both he and his sons worked like men inhabited by demons they gutted fish and chucked them into storage one after another jiro noted that hiroshi and kenzo set aside a prime ahi as he did when theyd finished the lines they all gorged on strip after strip of flavorful tuna it was always delicious and all the more so after days of the horrible slop the soup kitchens served hiroshi and kenzo ate with every bit as much gusto as jiro they might prefer hamburgers to sashimi but anybody in his right mind would prefer sashimi to the bowls of rice and noodles and beans all overcooked together theyd been getting that kind of food might keep you alive but it made you wonder why you went on living this this was worth eating ahhh jiro smiled and smacked his belly ive missed that kenzo nodded hiroshi was still chewing me too he said with his mouth full well use the guts and things for bait this time jiro said thatll draw more sharks but nobody these days will turn up his nose at shark meat we dont sell just the fins now food is food hiroshi agreed even the haoles arent so fussy now maybe theyll call it something like sea steak he said the words in english then translated them into japaneseso they dont have to think about what theyre really eating but theyll eat it when they drew in the lines this time they did catch some sharks but they also got one of the nicest ahi jiro had ever seen even better than the one hed feasted on before he started to cut more sashimi from it but paused with his knife poised above its stillglittering side go ahead father kenzo said you took it off the hook so its yours itll be good he smacked his lips he was eating more raw fish jiro shook his head ill choose another this one i think ill save for kitasan his sons looked at each other the way they often did when he said something they didnt like he waited for them to start shouting at him for having anything to do with the japanese consul to his surprise they kept quiet he supposed it was because hed sometimes brought fish to the consulate before the war started they couldnt say he was doing it to curry favor with kita now kenzo did sigh but all he said was have it your way you will anyhow arigato goziemasu jiro made the thankyou as sarcastic as he could then he cut strips of tender deep pink flesh from another ahi maybe that fish wasnt quite so perfect as the one hed set aside for the consul but it was plenty good enough for him he and his sons threw the offal from the second run into the sea as bait for a third they didnt do so well this time they already taken most of what that stretch of the pacific had to offer after theyd stowed what fish they had caught jiro turned the oshima maru s bow toward the shoreactually toward the northeast rather than due north hed have to tack all the way home unless the wind shifted will we need to spend the night on the ocean hiroshi asked maybe i dont know yet it all depends on the wind jiro answered actually that wasnt quite true it also depended on how tired he was if he decided he had to roll himself in a blanket before the sampan got back to kewalo basin well then they wouldnt come in till morning but the wind stayed steady and the oshima maru handled better than jiro remembered his fathers boat doing back when he was a boy sampans werent prettywhich was if anything an understatementbut they were seaworthy he steered the boat into kewalo basin a little past nine oclock mars saturn and jupiter shone in the night sky mars farthest west jupiter almost straight overhead the moon nearly full glowed in the east and had done its share to help him home japanese soldiers waited by the wharfs where armed americans had stood before they weighed the takahashis fish and gave them their price based on that weight not on quality to jiros relief they didnt quarrel when he and his sons took some fish off the oshima maru personal use a sergeant asked for us hai and to pay the man who added the mast and sails to the sampan and a fine tuna for kitasan the japanese consul jiro answered ah so desu the sergeant bowed i am sure he will be glad to have it kind of you to think of him he waved jiro and hiroshi and kenzo on into honolulu jiro thought about pointing out to his sons how useful that ahi had proved but he didnt they wouldnt pay any attention eizo doi was glad to get thirty pounds of fish when the takahashis knocked on his door but had his own worries where am i going to freeze all of it its more than my freezer will hold that wasnt jiros problem after he and his sons left dois house hiroshi and kenzo went back to their tent in the botanical garden they wanted nothing to do with kita or the japanese consulate jiro kept walking north up nuuanu avenue to the corner of kuakini street the japanese consular compound there had become one of the nerve centers of the imperial occupation of hawaii iolani palace was the other like the rest of honolulu the consular compound remained blacked out jiro didnt understand why no american plane could hope to bomb the city and return to the mainland he wasnt even sure a us plane could carry bombs all the way from the mainland to hawaii but the japanese military could be just as unreasonable as its american counterpart halt a sentry called from out of the darkness state your name and business when jiro did the sentry said ah go on in youll be very welcome especially after the torpedoing torpedoing jiro said whats this ive been out on the ocean all day without a radio a damned american submarine sank the bordeaux maru this afternoon the soldier told him she was bringing supplies to the island but karma neh the americans want everyone here to starve thats why i said kitasan would be so glad to get your tuna he opened the door for jiro who took the ahi inside nagao kita the consul was a short stocky roundfaced man he was in animated conversation with three or four army and navy officers but broke off when he saw jiro takahashisan he said and the fisherman was proud this important personage had remembered his name a broad smile spread across the consuls face what have you got there my friend doesnt that look beautiful its for you sir jiro said and maybe for these gentlemen if you feel like sharing yes if i do kita said and laughed the officers were ogling the splendid ahi too a navy captain licked his lips then tried to pretend he hadnt kita stepped up and took the fish from jiro the consul gave him a more than polite bow very kind of you to think of me takahashisan very kind i wont forget it believe me when i have the chance you can bet ill think of you delighted jiro returned the bow im sure thats not necessary sir i think it is having received the tuna with his own hands kita called for one of his aides to take charge of it he turned back to jiro im afraid youll have to excuse me now we have to figure out what to do about the miserable business this afternoon he didnt say what the business was jiro didnt show he knew that might have landed the sentry in hot water he just nodded and said of course sir and turned to go i wont forget you kita promised youre a reliable man as jiro pushed through the blackout curtains that kept light from escaping when the door opened he felt ready to burst with pride the consul thought he was reliable the emperor might have just pinned the order of the rising sun on his chest joe crosettis instructor in essentials of naval service was a graying lieutenant named larry moore he had a face as long as a basset hounds and normally about as doleful too when he came into the classroom wreathed in smiles one morning joe figured something was up and he was right lieutenant moore said gentlemen yesterday the grunion sent a jap freighter to the bottom off the north coast of kauai we are starting to hit back at those slantyeyed soandsos a savage cheeralmost a growlrose from the throats of the flying cadets joe joined in several young men clapped their hands orson sharp raised his when moore pointed to him he said sir are the japs making any effort to bring in supplies for the civilians in hawaii or is everything theyre shipping in for their garrison thats not entirely obvious moore said after a brief pause but that ship could have been carrying munitions or aircraft as readily as rice for soldiers or civilians yes sir as usual sharp was punctiliously polite were there secondary explosions after the torpedo hit i dont know one way or the other so i cant tell you the instructor answered if youd be so kind though you might tell me why youre wasting grief on a bunch of damn japs most cadets if challenged that way would have lost their temper or backed down orson sharp did neither sir ill wave byebye to all the japs we send to the bottom but there are an awful lot of hungry people in the hawaiian islands if theyre going to get hungrier i am sorry about that lieutenant moore studied him sharp hadnt been disrespectful or insubordinate in any way he had an opinion and hed come out with it if it wasnt one the instructor happened to share well was this still a free country or not no joe realized that wasnt the right question the country was still free how freely anyone in the navy could speak up was a whole different ballgame at last moore said well well let it go this time then he sounded like a governor pardoning a prisoner who probably didnt deserve it after another moment or two moore went on where were we oh yes we were going to talk about yesterdays quiz about half of you didnt know that a chief bosun cant be tried by summary courtmartial well gentlemen he cant a chief bosun is a warrant officer which means the rules for ratings dont apply to him bill frank who was sitting to joes left while sharp sat to his right whispered did you get that one joe nodded infinitesimally yeah he whispered back how about you i think i blew it his roomie put a world of pathos into five almost inaudible words lieutenant moore went over the quiz item by item concentrating on the ones a lot of cadets had missed along with courts and boards essentials of naval service covered ranks and their duties naval customs and usages and all the endless formalities that let officers and ratings work together smoothly joe had seen a commander tromp all over a jg for something dumb the junior officer did one morning then play bridge with him that night as if nothing had happened he didnt fully understand how that worked if anybody had been so bitingly rude to him he would have wanted to brain the son of a bitch with a tire iron not play cards with him but the career navy men seemed able to build a wall between what happened on duty and what happened off of course theyd had years of practice that kind of discipline didnt come naturally without it though a lot of guys would have grabbed tire irons the instructor might have been reading his thoughts a ship is a very crowded place moore said the sooner you start thinking like navy men the better youll fit in when you go to sea we have round holes gentlemen people who insist on being square pegs dont have an easy time of it he was looking at orson sharp as he said that when they got out of essentials of naval service they had to hustle to make it to introductory navigation joe liked that least of the three academic courses in the program it showed him he hadnt paid enough attention in geometry and trig but plenty of other cadets were struggling harder than he was i hope you didnt get moore mad at you he said to sharp as they hurried from one building to another so do i but i wont lose any sleep over it the cadet from utah replied i had a legitimate question i guess so joe said sharps eyes said joe had just flunked a test dont you care what happens to the civilians in hawaii theyve got a tough row to hoe well yeah joe admitted but isnt kicking the japs out the best thing we can do for them odds are whatever that freighter was carrying was going to the jap army or navy not to civilians maybe i suppose we have to hope so sharp sounded no more convinced than joe had a minute earlier they cant let everybody starve though who says they cant joe retorted look what the nazis are doing in russia sharp winced but didnt carry the argument any further from which joe concluded hed won the point any pride in his prowess disappeared in introduction to navigation he butchered a problemand he did it on the blackboard so everyone could see im afraid that answer is just exactly degrees off mr crosetti the instructor said in other words you couldnt be wronger if you tried take your seat ears blazing joe did the instructor looked around who sees where mr crosetti went astray here several people raised a hand the instructor pointed mr sharp orson sharp solved the problem with what looked like offhand ease he wasnt having any trouble in the class when he sat down he didnt act as if hed just shown joe up maybe he didnt even feel that way joe knew he would have were their positions reversed that made him resent his roomie even if sharp didnt resent him after the lecture the instructor gave out more problems these for pencil and paper joe thought he did pretty well on them you probably did but so what he jeered at himself everybody already watched you show what a jerk you could be he breathed the headyand chillyair of freedom again when he got out of class as far as he could tell hed never make it back to his carrier if he took off from one but when he said that out loud orson sharp shook his head i saw what you did you took the tangent instead of the sinejust a little goof you wont do it with your neck on the line i hope not joe said sharp perplexed him almost as much as his mangled navigation maybe the other cadet really wasnt mad at him after all did that mark almost inhuman restraint or a genuinely good person the cadets other academic class was identification and recognition how to tell bombers from fighters cruisers from battleships and allied planes and ships from the ones that belonged to the axis theyd already had to learn the silhouettes of some new german and japanese planes that hadnt been known when they started the course joe eyed blownup photos and drawings with something less than his usual attention he kept thinking about the question hed asked himself between classes how do you identify and recognize a genuinely good person it wasnt as if that were something he had to worry about every day he knew too well that he didnt fill the bill orson sharp might despite absentmindedness he got out of the class without embarrassing himself again along with the other cadets he trooped over to the cafeterianow styled the galley in deference to the influx of navy fliersfor lunch the choice was between chicken a la king which the cadets universally called chicken a la thing and creamed chipped beef on toast which had an older and earthier nickname joe chose the chicken sharp filled his plate with the beef at every table some wit tapped out dotdotdot dashdashdash dotdotdot the morse for sos people snorted orson sharp looked puzzled whats going on he asked pointing to sharps plate joe said you know what they call that stuff no what the kid from utah seemed more confused than ever as the pseudodistress calls went on and on joe fought not to roll his eyes sharp really had led a sheltered life patiently joe spelled it out for him shit on a shingle sos oh a light went on in sharps eyes no i didnt know that well at least it makes sense now he dug in i dont care what they call it i think its good as usual he didnt let being different from the other cadets faze him he had his own standards they suited him and he stuck to them after lunch came athletics orson sharp knocked people into next week on the football field joe played offensive end and defensive back bigger guys tried to run over him he tried not to let them along with everybody else they both got knocked around by the dirtyfighting instructors swimming felt strange to joe he already had a pretty good crawl but they wanted him to use a modified breaststroke because it kept his head out of the water better he did his best to learn it hed gained five pounds since coming to chapel hill all of it muscle and when the lights went out at half past nine he fell asleep as if hed been clubbed ix acceleration pressed lieutenant saburo shindo back into his seat as he roared off the akagi s flight deck hed had the mechanics install steel plates in the back and bottom of the seat a lot of japanese pilots disdained the extra weight it made their zeros slower and less maneuverable the americans had carried much more armor than he did it had saved a lot of pilots or at least let them bail out it hadnt saved hawaii but he still thought it was a good idea surrounded by a screen of destroyers akagi patrolled northeast of oahu the japanese had also commandeered some big fishing sampans mounted radios on them and posted them in a picket arc close to a thousand kilometers out from the hawaiian islands no carrierbased bomber could fly that far and return to the ship that had launched it the united states wasnt going to catch japan napping the way japan had caught the usa just in case the boats in that picket arc had missed something shindo watched the sky like a hawk some people slacked off when they didnt expect to run into trouble shindo wasnt one of those routine meant routinely capable routinely excellent to him he also glanced down at the ocean every now and again losing the bordeaux maru was a wakeup call for the japanese navy that had happened more than three weeks ago now the submarine that got the freighter was bound to be long gone that didnt mean others hadnt come to take its place though shindo couldnt sink one if he spotted it on the surface the zero didnt carry bombs but he could shoot it up if his machine guns and cannons filled it full of holes it couldnt submerge then it would be easy meat for bombers or destroyers here though nothing marred the pacific but the ships of the japanese flotilla and their wakes the rest of the ocean seemed glassy smooth there was hardly any chop the wind was the next thing to a dead calm no big swells were rolling down out of the north either as they had been when the task force moved on hawaii had those been much worse the barges would have had trouble landing and the invasion might have turned into a fiasco admiral yamamoto had bet against the kami of wind and wave and hed won shindo called the other fighter pilots flying combat air patrol anything a chorus of nos resounded in his earphones some pilots were even tempted to take the radio out of a plane to save weight shindo had issued stern orders against that as far as he was concerned staying in touch counted for more than the tiny bit of extra speed and liveliness you might gain from saving the kilos the radio weighed some people had grumbled about it but hed stood firm a sudden spurt of steam down below foam and spray everywhere as a great bulk heaved itself out of the water excitement coursed through shindo was that a broaching submarine a few seconds later the japanese flier started to laugh that was no submarineit was a breaching whale the war between japan and the usa meant nothing to it to it the ocean mattered only for krill men had other ideas though one of those ideas had put shindo in a fighter plane and taken him far from home he listened to excited radio calls from the other pilots whod seen the whale i was going to dive on it and shoot it up somebody said shame to waste all that meat without a factory ship close by someone else replied that made people laugh shindo smiled a thin smile inside his cockpit better when the men were happy and laughing they paid closer attention to what was going on around them right here right now that probably didnt matter no yankees were likely to be within hundreds of kilometers but you never could tell throttled back a zero could stay in the air for more than two hours shindo and his comrades buzzed along in great spirals around the akagi and the destroyers that covered her the whale was the most interesting thing any of them saw shindo didnt yawn as he flewhe was far too professional to let down on the jobbut it was a long way from the most exciting patrol hed ever led he took the flight back to the carrier after its replacements had risen into the air nobody felt like yawning landing on a rolling pitching flight deck shindo made himself into a machine automatically obeying the signals of the landing officer at akagi s stern the man on the ship could judge his course better than he could he knew that however little he cared to admit it even to himself when the landing officers wigwag flags went down shindo dove for the deck he bounced when he hit so that the zeros hook missed the first arrester wire but it snagged the second one the fighter jerked to a stop shindo pushed back the canopy and scrambled out the deck crew took charge of the zero shoving it to one side away from the path of the incoming planes behind it shindo sprinted for the island the motion of the deck under his feet seemed as natural as the motion of air in his lungs commander genda greeted him just inside anything unusual he asked no sir shindo shook his head about the most interesting thing we saw was a whale we wondered if it was a yankee sub but it was only a whale all right genda said the splash the big ones make when they come to the surface can confuse you at first but the americans dont build subs with fins and flukes he chuckled shindo managed another thin smile fins and flukes where did genda come up with such nonsense the smile didnt last long shindos smiles seldom did he said forgive me for saying so sir but im afraid this patrol is costing us more fuel than its worth how likely are we to encounter the enemy genda only shrugged i dont know lieutenant as a matter of fact you dont know either thats why were here to help find out how likely we are to run into the americans sticking their long noses where they dont belong we learn something if we meet them and we learn something if we dont yes sir shindo said an answer a subordinate could never go wrong in giving to his superior his own opinion he kept to himself if genda wanted it he would ask for it he didnt he just said prepare your report well put it together with all the others and see what kind of picture it makes yes sir saburo shindo said again and gave genda a salute as mechanically perfect as his landing a few minutes before as he had then he followed someone elses will rather than his own he shrugged if only to himself a lot of military life involved following someone elses will the sun sank toward the pacific jim peterson took a nail out of his mouth and used it to fasten a plank to a twobyfour he wished he were using his hammer to smash in a japs skull instead the guards though were on the other side of the barbed wire as the pow camp rose near opanaabout as far north as anyone could go on oahu from there it was nothing but ocean all the way up to alaska peterson could look up and see waves rolling onto the beach he drove another nail to make sure the plank stayed securely fastened he might have to stay in the barracks he was building he wanted to make sure the building kept off the rain he didnt have to worry about making sure the place was warm the way he would have on the mainland a good thing too because the japs couldnt have cared less if their prisoners froze he fastened another plank and another and another he worked till a jap outside the wire blew a horn the bastard must have thought he was satchmo armstrong he put some dixieland into the call that let the pows knock off for the day and wasnt that a kick in the nutsa jap who liked jazz peterson had run into some crazy things in his time but that might have taken the cake the prisoners lined up to return their tools the guards kept track of every hammer and saw and chisel and axe and screwdriver and pliers they issued each morning if the count didnt add up when the tools came back there was hell to pay theyd beaten the crap out of a guy who tried to stick a chisel in his pocket and walk off with it you had to be nuts to think youd get away with something like that but young einstein had taken a shot at it hed paid for his stupidity too he was still laid up in the infirmary peterson turned in the hammer without any fuss no matter what he wanted to do with it he couldnt not with armed japs ready to kill him if he got cute with the sergeant in charge of checking off the tools on a chart full of incomprehensible squiggles prez mckinley stood a couple of men behind peterson in line he gave the jap sergeant his saw then he and peterson got bowls and spoons from their tent and headed for the chow line the march up to opana had taught them sticking with a buddy was a good idea the japanese had hardly bothered to feed the pows on the trek across the island what the guards did give out the strong had tried to snatch from the weak two men together were stronger than any lone wolf could be nobody had robbed the two of them theyd got to opana in fair shape some of the weaker hungrier men had lain down by the kamehameha highway and too weary to go on let the japs do them in here at the camp having a buddy proved even more important than it had on the road a buddy could hold your place in line if nature called or if you were busy trying to make some scheme pay off a buddy might help you escape too prisoners were dutybound to try to get away nobody seemed hot to try it though even under the geneva convention the power holding prisoners could punish wouldbe escapees who failed since the japs hadnt signed the convention no one was eager to find out what theyd do i wonder what sort of gourmet treat well have tonight peterson said the pheasant under glass do you think or the filet mignon shut the fuck up said somebody behind him in line hey i can dream cant i peterson tried to stay pleasant not while i gotta listen to you goddammit the other prisoner didnt bother it could have turned into a brawl the main reason it didnt was that peterson was too worn and hungry to take it any further he told mckinley some people cant take a joke but he didnt say it loud enough for the angry pow in back of them to hear filet mignon hell i didnt know whether to laugh or to want to deck you myself mckinley answered your bellys empty you take food serious peterson decided he must have stepped over a line if that was the most backing his friend would give him joking about steak and pheasant here felt like joking about somebodys mother on the outside you were asking for trouble if you did but if you couldnt joke wouldnt you start going nuts such thoughts vanished from his mind when the chow line started snaking forward his belly growled like a wolf he had to clamp his lips together to keep drool from running down his chin the spit flooding into his mouth reminded him that he took food as seriously as prez mckinley as seriously as the son of a bitch whod resented what hed said as seriously as all the other sorry bastards cooped up here with him the most beautiful prisonerofwar camp in the worldbut who gave a damn he looked down at his bowl it was cheap heavy earthenware glazed white it had probably come from a chinese restaurant hed eaten chop suey out of bowls just like it plenty of times thinking about chop suey made him want to drool too i really was out of line with that crack he decided cooks slapped stuff into pows bowls peterson wondered how theyd landed the job had they been cooks before the surrender or had the japs just pointed and said you you and you either way he was jealous of them if anybody here came close to getting enough to eat it had to be the cooks plop a ladleful of supper went into a bowl plop another ladleful one man closer to peterson plop another plop another and then plop and it was his turn he stared avidly at the bowl as he carried it away from the chow line just behind him mckinley was doing the same thing rice some broth some green things he didnt think the green came from proper vegetables some of it looked like grass some like ferns some like tornup leaves boiled in with the rice he didnt care not one bit he drank every drop of the broth and made sure he ate every grain of rice and every bit of greenerywhatever the hell it wasthe cook doled out to him he was still hungry when he finishedhungry yes but not hungry even partial relief might have been a benediction from on high jesus he said that hit the spot hit part of the spot anyway mckinley answered his bowl was as perfectly empty and polished as petersons give me about three of those and some spare ribs to go with em before the surrender he wouldnt have talked so reverently about anything but women people had taken food for granted then fools that they were the two men carried their bowls over to what looked like a horse trough for all peterson knew it had been a horse trough once upon a time he sloshed his bowl in the water and his spoon too you did want to keep things as clean as you could otherwise you were asking for dysentery with so many men packed so close together you might come down with it anyhow but you were smart to try not to after supper came the evening lineup and count nobody got to sack out till the japs were happy with it some of the guards couldnt count to twentyone without undoing their fly which didnt make things any easier it started to rain while the americans stood in their rows nobody tried to get away from the rain that might have fouled up the count and left them out there longer yet at least it wasnt a cold nasty rain like so many on the mainland not even the japs could ruin the weather peterson stood there with rain dripping from his nose and ears and chin and the ends of his fingers he felt sorry for the guys who wore glasses they probably went blind after a few minutes finally the japs decided no one had escaped the sergeant in charge of the count gestured the men in the first couple of rows could see him when they peeled off the rest of the americans did too peterson and mckinley had been smart enough to pitch their tent on the highest ground they could find the rain wouldnt get the ground inside too muddy besides it would probably stop before too long a little on a little off a little on there was the tent home sweet home peterson said not altogether ironically right prez mckinley answered they dried off as best they could and rolled themselves in their blankets sleep slugged peterson over the head learning to handle the sails that had sprouted on the oshima maru kept kenzo takahashi busy he and hiroshi were both surprised to find their father a good teacher most of the time their old man lacked the patience to teach well not here he took everything one step at a time and didnt ask them for more than they knew how to do its his neck too kenzo said in english as they came in after a fair fishing run thats part of it hiroshi said also in english the other part is hes learning it at the same time as hes showing us he doesnt have it down pat himself if he did hed think we ought to know it just like that he snapped his fingers kenzo didnt need long to think it over well youre right he said what are you two going on about their father asked in japanese you talking about me again he knew they did that he wasnt a fool however much kenzo wanted to think of him as one he didnt have much education but that wasnt the same thing no not about youwe were talking about the sampan and sailing kenzo said the second part of which held some truth jiro takahashi let out one of the grunts he used to show he didnt believe a word of it you could do that in japanese we feel more at home in english hiroshi said and that held nothing but the truth it got another grunt from the senior takahashi foolishness he said foolishness any old time but especially now japanese is the language everybody needs to know he succeeded in getting his sons to stop speaking english for a while kenzo didnt want to say anything in any language was japanese going to drive english into second place in hawaii it would if japan won the war and kept the islands from all the news that looked to be the way to bet right now wake island and midway were gone the philippines were going singapore had just fallen finishing the british collapse in malaya and the japanese were rampaging through the dutch east indies the dutch the australians and the americans seemed able to do little to stop them wouldnt that be just our luck hiroshi saidin englishto break that long silence we spend our whole lives trying to turn into americans and just when we start to get good at it it turns out not to be worth anything funny kenzo said funny like a crutch you think i was kidding his brother asked no kenzo left it at that would he have to spend the rest of his life trying to make himself japanese the new york yankees meant more to him than the emperor did on the mainland spring training would be starting soon the closest that came to hawaii was the cubs springtime home on catalina island near los angeles he and hiroshi brought the oshima maru into kewalo basin their father watched everything they did but said not a word that had to mean theyd done it right if theyd messed up they would have heard about it as usual these days japanese soldiers took charge of the catch onto the scales it went and the takahashis got paid by weight also as usual nobody fussed when they took some fish for themselves and for eizo doi personal use a noncom asked kenzo hai personal use he answered the formula kept the soldiers happy kenzo saw speaking fluent japanese was especially useful just now he would sooner have slammed the sampan into a pier than admitted that to his father it was late in the afternoon but not too late theyd brought in as much fish as the oshima maru would hold people hurried here and there trying to get on with their lives as best they could more than a few of them sent jealous glances toward kenzo and his brother and father if they hadnt been three stalwart men walking together they might have had trouble a girl coming out of a side street waved and called ken hi elsie he answered not sorry to see her without her stuckup friends how are you doing the haole girl shrugged okay i guess im looking for a job nobody has enough these days but there isnt much out there she shrugged again everythings gone to pot since since the surrender what had she almost said since the japs took over something like that kenzo supposed well she hadnt said it he asked are you getting enough to eat nobodys getting enough to eat these days except people like you who catch your own elsie said its not too bad were not starving or anything not yet hung in the air but were hungry some of the time by the way she said it shed never gone hungry before neither had kenzo elsie was right about that a fishermans family might not have much money but the takahashis had always had food on the table impulsively kenzo held out a nice aku the striped tuna was as long as his forearm here take this back to your folks she didnt say oh you shouldnt or anything like that she reached out and took the fish by the tail what she did say was thank you very much ken this means a lot to me be careful with it dont let anybody get it he told her she nodded then hurried away with the prize what did you go and do that for his father said now we have to tell doi were short this time so we give him some extra next time kenzo answered he knows were good for it hed better everything weve brought him so far youre sweet on this girl neh his father said how am i supposed to answer that kenzo wondered if he said he wasnt his old man would know he was lying if he said he was his father might pitch a fit he might have pitched a fit any old time with japanese soldiers on the streets of honolulu with civilians of all colors scrambling out of their way and bowing as they went by maybe some kenzo said cautiously foolishness nothing but foolishness but his father left it there hiroshi was the one who spoke up and he did it in english dad may be right is this a smart time to show you like a haole girl jesus christ not you too kenzo said his brother flushed i didnt say it wasnt a smart time to like her i know you like elsie for crying out loud i said it wasnt a smart time to show you like herand you know why as well as i do as if to make his point for him four or five more japanese army men turned the corner and came up the street toward the takahashis kenzo had taken men in us uniforms for granted getting used to the new occupiers was harder bowing didnt grate on him the way it had to on haoles though hed grown up with it and took it for granted im not going to do anything stupid kenzo said good make sure you dont hiroshi told him since it was still daytime they went to eizo dois shop instead of his home the place was tiny if you werent looking for it you wouldnt find it a sign over the door said handyman in english in small letters the hiragana characters for the same thing were twice as tall doi was tinkering with a bicycles chain and sprocket when kenzo and his brother and father came in you have an icebox here jiro takahashi asked hai doi answered come on in back so you make me lug the fish home do you we didnt want to knock on your door when you werent homemight scare your wife kenzos father said the handyman nodded kenzo grimaced nobody would have said that before the japanese took hawaii times had changed and not for the better kenzo kept that to himself he didnt know who all of eizo dois friends were being wrong about such things could cost much more now than it had when the stars and stripes flew over iolani palace the handymans back room was even more crowded than the part of the shop where he worked a dark jumble of handmade shelves full of a ridiculous variety of spare parts and odd tools and stuff that looked like junk to kenzo but presumably was or might prove useful to doi kenzo knew a couple of other handymen they accumulated odds and ends the same way if you werent part pack rat you were in the wrong line of work hiroshi pointed to the iceboxno it was a refrigerator for a plug snaked out of it did you make that yourself doisan he asked kenzo couldnt tell whether his tone was meant to be admiring or appalled hai the handyman said again looking pleased its not that hard i got the motor from a drill press the compressor from i dont remember where i got the compressor but i put everything together and it works thats what counts kenzos father said when doi opened the refrigerator door kenzo saw a couple of bottles of beer and other things he had more trouble identifying by the way some of those looked he didnt want to know what theyd been once upon a time theyd been in there much too long doi happily piled fish on the shelves which might have started their careers as oven racks if he wasnt going to worry about it kenzo wouldnt either after the takahashis left the place kenzo said see he didnt care about that aku i bet he didnt even notice his father shook his head he noticed or if he didnt his wife will when he takes the fish home but you were rightthey know were good for it sooner or later sooner or later the phrase made kenzo look to the northeast toward the american mainland sooner or later the usa would try to take hawaii back he was sure of that when though and how and what were the odds the americans would succeed kenzo had no answers for any of those questions he was sure of one thing though it wouldnt be easy in back of iolani palace stood a barracks hall once upon a time when hawaii was an independent kingdom it had housed the royal guards commander minoru genda had seen a photograph of the guards in the palace big men in fancy uniforms with hats that made them look like british bobbies standing at attention beside and behind a battery of polished brass field pieces now the iolani barracks held only one man a prisoner walking slowly across the brilliant green lawn toward the buildingwith the crosses set into its square crenellated towers it looked more like a medieval european fortress than a barracksgenda turned to mitsuo fuchida and said this is a bad business hai the man whod commanded the air strikes against oahu nodded i dont know what else we can do though do you no im afraid not genda sighed but i wish i could think of something and i wish we hadnt been chosen as witnesses he sent a defiant stare up toward the taller fuchida go ahead call me soft not you gendasan never you fuchida walked along for a couple of paces before continuing i might say that of some other men i might also say you would do well not to say such things to officers who arent lucky enough to know you the way i do genda bowed domo arigato this is good advice they went in through the rounded entranceway the courtyard inside the barracks was a long narrow rectangle paved with flagstones several navy officers already stood inside it some of them looked grim others proud and righteous also waiting in the courtyard was a squad of special navy landing troops in square rig with infantry rifles and helmets though those bore the navy chrysanthemum not the army star and white canvas gaiters that reached their knees they were all impassive as so many statues two more witnesses came in after genda and fuchida genda was relieved not to have been the last captain hasegawa of the akagi the senior officer present spoke in a loud officialsounding voice let the prisoner be brought forth out of one of the rooms at the far end of the courtyard came four hardfaced guards leading a young japanese man such a pity genda thought a couple of the nearby officers let out soft sighs but only a couple captain hasegawa faced the young man kazuo sakamaki you know what you have done you know how you have disgraced your country and the emperor sakamaki bowed hai captainsan was all he said he washe had been before his summary courtmartialan ensign in the japanese navy hed commanded one of the five twoman midget submarines japan had launched against pearl harbor as part of the opening attack four were lost with all hands sakamakis crewmate had also perished but sakamaki himself had floundered up onto an oahu beachand been captured by the americans hasegawa nodded to the guards and the special navy landing troops in turn let the sentence be carried out captainsan sakamaki spoke once moreagain i request the privilege of atoning for my dishonor by taking my own life the skipper of the akagi shook his head you have been judged unworthy of that privilege guards tie him to the post with another bow sakamaki said sir it is not necessary i will show you i do know how to die for my country banzai for the emperor he came to stiff attention his back touching the post driven between two flagstones for that hasegawa gave him a nod if not a bow the senior officer turned to the special landing troops ready he said the guards hurried out of the line of fire aim hasegawa said up came the rifles all pointing at sakamakis chest fire as the rifles roared genda thought sakamaki shouted banzai one last time his mouth opened wide and he yelled something but the word was lost in the fusillade sakamaki staggered twisted and fell red had already spread over the front of his prison coveralls it soaked the back where the exit wounds were the young man jerked and twitched for a minute or two then lay still captain hasegawa nodded to the firing squad you did your duty men and did it well you are dismissed they saluted and marched away the skipper of the akagi held up a piece of paper for the officers whod witnessed sakamakis execution i will need your signatures gentlemen along with the others genda wrote his name under the brief report that described kazuo sakamakis failure to die in battle his humiliating capture it said hed asked the americans to kill him but theyd refused the courtmartial following the japanese victory the inevitable sentence and its completion there on the page everything seemed perfectly clearcut perfectly official genda didnt look at sakamakis body he couldnt help noticing the air smelled of blood thank you commander hasegawa said when genda returned the pen to him one more loose end cleared up hai as far as genda was concerned that was acknowledgment not agreement after the officers signed the report they left the barracks one by one genda waited on the grass till mitsuo fuchida came out a small bird with a gray back a white belly and a crested head of a red even brighter in the sun than kazuo sakamakis blood hopped along three or four meters away from him pausing every once in a while to peck at an insect when he took a step towards it it fluttered away he was probably more frightening than the thunderous volley of rifle fire had been a few minutes earlier here came fuchida the redheaded bird flew away genda and fuchida walked slowly back towards iolani palace after a while fuchida said i didnt know he tried to get the americans to finish him neither did i genda said heavily too bad they didntit would have saved him the disgrace fuchida said but you cant count on the enemy to take care of what you should have done yourself i suppose not genda said it wasnt that his friend was wrong it was only that he didnt know quite what it was only that it left him unhappy rather than satisfied too bad all the way around cant argue with you there fuchida said think of his poor family all the other men on the midget submarines died as heroes attacking the americans their son their brother was the only captive how can you live something like that down if the officials are kind theyll bury the report and just tell the family he died in hawaii genda said i hope they do that would be good fuchida agreed still though even reports that should be buried have ways of getting out he wasnt wrong though genda wished he were witnessing one of those will last me forever even if he did die bravely genda said i hope i dont get drawn for the same duty twice plenty of other work id rather be doing cant argue about that either fuchida said a man with a clean desk is a man who doesnt get enough thrown at him genda nodded they both headed back toward their desks which were anything but clean in japanese the name of hotel street came out as three syllables hoteru corporal takeo shimizu wasnt fussy about how he said it he just wanted the chance to get there as often as he could before the war came to oahu the street had been geared to making american soldiers and sailors happy it had taken some damage during the fighting but hadnt needed long to start doing the same job for the new masters of hawaii before letting the men from shimizus squad go on leave lieutenant horino the platoon commander whod replaced lieutenant yonehara lectured them i do not want any man here disgracing himself or his country do you understand me yes sir the men chorused you will be punished if you do do you understand that yes sir they said again all right then see that you remember it horino said salute shimizu called like him the other men made their salutes as crisp and perfect as they could some officers would forbid a soldier to go on leave if they didnt like the way he saluted shimizu didnt think lieutenant horino was that strict but why take chances horino returned those precise salutes with one that wasnt much more than a wave a sergeant would have slapped a common soldier till his ears fell off for a salute like that but officers lived by different rules dismissed horino said then he unbent enough to add enjoy yourselves yes sir the men said shimizu loud among them he wasnt sure that had been an orderhow could someone command you to have a good time but he wasnt sure it hadnt been either again why take chances lieutenant horino strode away sword swinging on his hip shimizu eyed the men hed led since before they got on the transport back in japan you have your passes the military police are bound to ask you to show them he had his in his tunic pocket yes corporal we have them the soldiers said shimizu waited one by one they dug them out and displayed them when hed seen all of them he nodded all right lets go you all know what the lieutenant meant about not disgracing yourselves he waited when no one said anything he spelled it out for them dont get the clap corporalsan senior private furusawa waited to be recognized only after shimizu nodded to him did he go on corporalsan the americans are supposed to have medicines that can really cure it since his father was a druggist maybe he knew what he was talking about or maybe he didnt shimizu only shrugged if you dont get a dose in the first place you wont have to worry about that will you unlike some of the men in the squad furusawa was smart enough to know a dangerous question when he heard one oh no corporal he said hastily good and remember to salute all your superiors too shimizu looked the men over one more time he didnt see anything wrong with anybodys uniform come on lets go they followed him like ducklings hurrying on after a mother duck that made him proud even if he was only a corporal he had a fine string of common soldiers in tow the civilians the men passed on the street didnt care that he was only a corporal they scrambled out of the squads way the japanese among them knew how to bow properly the chinese and whites didnt but orders were not to make a fuss about it as long as they tried to do it right here came a reeling sergeant whod had a good time somewhere salute shimizu said and the whole squad did in unison he hoped everyone did it well that might not matter of course if the sergeant felt like topping off his leave by slapping common soldiers around and maybe even a corporal too he could always find an excuse to do it but he only returned the salutes and kept on going he was singing a song about a geisha named hanako shimizu remembered singing that song when hed got drunken leave in china as soon as he and his squad got to hotel street military policemen rushed up to them like mean farmyard dogs lets see your passes they shouted their voices loud and angry shimizu produced his one by one his men did the same the military policemen scowled as they inspected each pass but there was nothing wrong with any of them all the information was there and in the proper form the military policemen had no choice but to give them back and nod grudgingly they did salute shimizu said again again the men obeyed you keep your noses clean you hear me one of the military policemen growled if you end up in trouble youll wish your mothers never weaned you do you understand me hai sergeantsan chorused shimizu and the men he led they must have been loud enough to satisfy the sergeant for he and his pal went off to harass some other soldiers shimizu pitied anyone they found without proper papers but that wasnt his worry a lot of places that had served food were closed there wasnt a lot of food to serve bars were open though some of them sported freshly painted signs in hiragana and also senior private furusawa said in roman letters boasting that they served sake shimizu was sure it wasnt sake imported from japan they grew rice here some of it had probably been taken out of the food store and turned into something more entertaining he wondered whose palm had been greased to make that happen and with how much cash more than ill see any time soon he thought mournfully almost all the bright blinking neon signs were in english one looked as good as another to shimizu im going in here he said pointing to one bigger and fancier than most whos coming with me only a couple of men from the squad hung back i want to start off with a woman one of them said the other nodded youll last longer if you do some drinking first shimizu said they shook their heads shimizu shrugged suit yourselves then but if you arent back at the barracks when youre supposed to be youll wish those military policemen were beating on you have you got that he tried to sound fierce and hoped he succeeded he really was too easygoing to make a good noncom the bar was dark and cool inside and already full of japanese soldiers and sailors the bartender was an asian man he spoke japanese but oddly after a little while shimizu decided he had to be a korean no no whiskey gomen nasai he said when the corporal asked have sake have sort of gin what do you mean sort of shimizu inquired made from fruit made from fruit here understand is very good ichiban the bartender said a drink was one yen or twentyfive cents us moneyoutrageously expensive like everything else in oahu give me some of this gin shimizu said i want something stronger than sake he dropped a us quarter on the bar the silver rang sweetly the bartender set a shot in front of him he knocked it back he had all he could do not to cough and lose face before his men the stuff tasted like sweet paint thinner and kicked like a wild horse it might have been a mortar bomb exploding in his stomach he liked the warmth that flowed out from his middle afterwards though his men followed his lead the bartender poured them shots too like shimizu they gulped them down they werent so good at hiding what the stuff did to them some of them coughed senior private furusawa said my insides are on fire private wakuzawa seemed on the edge of choking to death somebody pounded his back till he could breathe easily again by then shimizu had recovered his equilibriumand the use of his voice he hardly wheezed at all as he laid down a new quarter and said let me have another one the corporals a real man one of his soldiers said admiringly shimizu drank the second shot as fast as the first the stuff didnt taste good enough to savor it didnt hurt so much going down as the first shot had maybe hed got used to it or maybe the first assault had stunned his gullet he managed a smile that looked as if he meant it not so bad he said if he can do it so can we furusawa declared he put a yen on the bar give me a refill too the rest of the soldiers whod come in with shimizu followed suit they also did better the second time around most of them did anyway even in the gloom inside the bar it was easy to see how red shiro wakuzawa turned are you all right shimizu asked him he nodded hai corporalsan another question occurred to shimizu how much drinking have you done before this some corporalsan wakuzawa answered not much shimizu thought he didnt push any more though sooner or later the youngster had to get hardened why not now they all had another couple of drinks shimizu could feel the strong spirits mounting to his head he didnt want to get fallingdown drunk or gotosleep drunk not yet plenty of other things to do first he gathered up his men are you ready to stand in line now they nodded he pointed to the door then lets go under the americans prostitution had been officially illegal which didnt mean there hadnt been plenty of brothels on hotel street it only meant they had to be called hotels the japanese were less hypocritical they knew a young man needed to lie down with a woman every so often they thought nothing of importing comfort women to serve soldiers in places where there werent many local girls and they didnt wonder or even care what the comfort womenusually koreansthought here in honolulu they didnt have to worry about that senator hotel senior private furusawa spelled out the name of the place the line of men waiting to get in stretched around the block some of themmost of them in facthad been drinking too nobody got too unruly though ferociouslooking military policemen kept an eye on things you wouldnt want them landing on you not before you got what you were waiting for a soldier started singing everyone who knew the tune joined in shimizu hadnt drunk enough to make them sound good some of the soldiers from his squad added to the racket you sound like cats with their tails stepped on he told them they laughed but they didnt stop more men got in line behind shimizu and his soldiers the line moved forward one slow step at a time he wished hed had another drink or two by the time he went in hed be half sobered up more military policemen waited inside to make sure there was no trouble a sign said yen dollars minutes four dollars he sighed almost a months pay for him two months pay for the most junior privates no one walked out he gave his money to a grayhaired white woman who could have looked no more bored if she were dead she wrote a numberon a scrap of paper and shoved it at him is this the room i go to he asked she shruggedshe must not have spoken japanese one of the military policemen nodded shimizu sighed again as he went up the stairs hed hoped to pick a woman for himself no such luck when he found the cubicle with above it he knocked on the door hai a woman called from within the word was japanese he didnt think the voice was he opened the door and found he was right she was a brassy blonde somewhere a little past thirty who lay naked on a narrow bed isogi she told himhurry up five minutes he reminded himself not even time to get undressed part of him wondered why hed bothered to do this but the rest of him knew he dropped his pants poised himself between her legs the hair there was yellow too which he hadnt thought about till that moment and impaled her she didnt help much for all the expression on her face he might have been delivering a package not plundering her secret places because hed gone without he quickly spent himself anyway as soon as he did she pushed him off she pointed to a bar of soap and an enameled metal basin of water he washed himself dried with a small soggy towel and did up his pants again she jerked a thumb at the door sayonara sayonara he echoed and left a military policeman in the hallway pointed him towards another set of stairs at the far end down the hall he went trying to ignore the noises from the numbered cubicles on either side a minute earlier hed been making noises like that he felt a strange mixture of afterglow and disgust these stairs led out to an alley behind the senator hotel it smelled of piss and vomit a military policeman standing near the exit said move along soldier please sergeantsan i came here with friends and id like to wait for them shimizu said he was a corporal himself not a miserable common soldier and he spoke politely the military policeman grudged him a nod over the next five or ten minutes the soldiers from shimizus squad came out some of them came happy others revolted others both at once like shimizu himself i dont think ill do that again any time soon shiro wakuzawa said of course you wontyou wont be able to afford it somebody else told him adding the only thing worse than a lousy lay is no lay at all the whole squad laughed at that it explained why theyd stood in line better than anything else could have done move along the military policeman said again this time in a voice that brooked no argument salute shimizu told his men and they did some of them were clumsy but the military policeman didnt complain when they got to the end of the alley they turned left to go back up to hotel street you all still have money shimizu asked their heads bobbed up and down good he said in that case lets drink some more nobody said no when oscar van der kirk paused at the waters edge on waikiki beach to assemble his contraption the men fishing in the surf paused to stare at him one of them said thats the goddamnedest thing i ever set eyes on i never saw anything like it another agreed glad you like it oscar said because he was a happygolucky fellow he made them smile instead of getting them angry it did look as if his surfboards mother had been unfaithful with a small sailboat hed had to find a jap to do the work that made him queasy in a way it wouldnt have before the war started hed paid that doi character twentyfive buckswhich happened to be all the cash he hadplus a promise of fish when he went out to sea doi didnt speak a hell of a lot of english but he had no trouble at all with numbers what if i stiff him oscar wondered not for the first time as he fit the small mast and sail to the surfboard only a jap after all but a jap wasnt only a jap not these days if the handyman had any kind of connections with the occupiers well that might not be a whole lot of fun and besides doi had giggled like a thirdgrade girl when he finally figured out what the deuce oscar was driving at ichiban hed said oscar knew what that meant as any kamaaina would how could you stiff a guy who got so fired up about your brainstorm oh you could but how would you look at yourself in the mirror afterwards into the pacific went thewhatever the dickens it was oscar didnt know what to call it any more it wasnt exactly a surfboard not now but it wasnt quite a boat either neither fish nor fowl oscar thought it would be pretty foul though if he couldnt get any fish wincing to himself he went into the pacific till he got out past the breakers he lay on his belly and paddled as he would have with a wahine on the surfboard instead of a mast he didnthe wouldntthink about susie higgins but once he made it out to calm water everything changed then he stood up on the surfboard he could do that riding a wave as tall as a threestory building it would have been childs play for him here even without the mast but the tall pole did make it easier and then he unfurled the sail wow he said the breeze came off the mainland as it usually did in the morning the sail filled with wind oscar had had an argument with eizo doi about how big to make it hed wanted it bigger the handyman had kept shaking his head and flapping his hands no good no good hed said and hed pantomimed a capsizing hed been right too oscar tipped the hat he wasnt wearing to the jap even the small spread of canvas doi had put on the mast was plenty to make the surfboard scoot along like a live thing and the breeze was none too strong a real wind would have made the board buck like a bronco oscar wouldnt have wanted to try to control it this though this was as right as baby bears porridge an hour with the surfboardsailboard oscar wonderedtook him farther out to sea than he could have gone paddling half the day the northern horizon started to swallow diamond head and the hills behind honolulu fishing sampans rarely bothered putting out lines or nets where they could still see the shore but nobody without one could come even this far with luck that meant oscar had found a pretty good spot he furled the sail and glided to a stop the japs who went out in sampans used minnows for bait oscar didnt know where to get his hands on those next best choice would have been meat scraps but meat scraps were worth their weight in gold these days people were eating dog food and cat food theyd be eating dogs and cats pretty damn quick too for all oscar knew they already were he couldnt even cast bread upon the waters bread was as extinct as the mamo birds that had given hawaiian kings yellow feathers for their cloaks oscar had to make do with grains of rice with luck they would lure small fish and the small fish would lure bigger onesalthough nobody turned up his nose at even small fish these days come on fish oscar said scattering the grains pretend its a wedding eat it up you know you want to he had the net hed used when he went out with charlie kaapu and he had a length of line with a motley assortment of hooks on it that eizo doi had thrown in with the mast and sail what he didnt have was any bait for the hooks i should have swatted flies or dug up worms or something he thought next time im making it up as i go along glints of silver and blue in the water said the rice was luring fish of some sort anyhow he started swiping with the widemouthed net sure as hell he caught flying fish and other fish he had more trouble naming and some squid that stared reproachfully at him he wasnt wild for squid himselfit was like chewing on a tirebut he knew plenty of people werent so fussy when he drew in the line he felt like shouting it had four or five mackerel on it and a couple of dogfish too he wouldnt have eaten shark before he came to hawaii either but he knew better now besides flesh was flesh these days he wasnt about to throw anything back he hadnt seen any bigger sharks sliding through the sea these days their streamlined deadliness put him in mind of jap fighter planes a comparison that never would have crossed his mind before december any surfrider had to be alert for them a surfrider with a crate full of fish had to be a lot more than alert now he had to get the fish back to oahu that might also turn into an adventure the breeze was still blowing from the north if he kept on running before it the next stop was tahiti a hell of a long way away he felt like mickey mouse as the sorcerers apprentice in fantasia had he started something he didnt know how to finish making it up as i go along he said again this time out loud the sampans went out and came back he ought to be able to do the same but how he tried to dredge up memories of highschool trig and physics triangles of forces thats what they were called what to do with them though memory didnt help much maybe experiment would if he set the sail so he ran before the wind he was screwed that meant he had to set it at some different angle his first effort got him moving parallel to the shore that didnt hurt but it didnt help either if he swung the sail a little more bit by bit he figured out how to tack he didnt have the seafaring lingo to describe what he was doing even to himself that made things harder but his confidence grew as each successive reach brought him closer to land beginners luck carried him back almost exactly to the point from which hed set out there were the waves rolling up onto waikiki beach he started to take down the sail and mast and ride in on his belly he started tobut he didnt hed thought of surfsailing to let him get farther out to sea than he could with an ordinary surfboard a slow grin spread over his face that was why hed thought of it yeah but did anything in the rules say he couldnt have some fun with it too you dont want to lose the fish he reminded himself and lashed the crate to the mast with a length of his fishing line he stood by the mast too holding on to it with one hand adjusting the sail so it kept on pushing him shoreward people on the beach were pointing to him they had to wonder what the hell kind of contraption that was out there on the pacific and what he was doing with it ill show em he thought and rode in on the crest of a breaker skimming along as graceful as a fairy tern he didnt even think about what would happen if things went wrong and they didnt he came up onto the soft white sand feeling like jesushadnt he just walked on water the surf fishermen actually gave him a hand thats the goddamnedest thing i ever saw one of them said nothing but admiration in his voice oscar grinned again it is isnt it commander mitsuo fuchida muttered to himself as he walked up to iolani palace commander minoru genda sent him a quizzical look fuchidas muttersand his misgivingscoalesced into words i dont like getting dragged into politics im an airman not a diplomat in striped trousers i dont like it either genda said but would you rather leave the political choices to the army that question had only one possible answer no fuchida said the army had the political sense of a water buffalo the unending strife in china proved that half of japans resources manpower and manufacturing that could have been used against the united states were tied down in the quagmire on the asian mainland a quagmire of the armys making maybe japanese rule here wouldnt mean antagonizing everybody in sight maybe fuchida dared hope japanese soldiers had replaced the american honor guard at the palace they presented arms as fuchida and genda came up the stairs once inside the two navy officers climbed the magnificent inner staircasefuchida had learned it was of koa woodand into king kalakauas library which adjoined the kings bedroom the army officers waited for them there fuchida had trouble telling lieutenant colonel minami from lieutenant colonel murakami one of them had a mustache the other didnt he thought minami was the one with it but he wasnt sure maybe minami and murakami had trouble telling him and genda apart too he hoped so the library was another fine specimen of latevictorian splendor the chairs featured elaborately turned wood leather upholstery and brass tacks polished till they gleamed like gold there were book stands of walnut and of koa wood all full of leatherbound volumes along with those of officials from the kingdom of hawaii the walls boasted photographs of prime ministers gladstone and disraeli and the british house of commons busy was gendas oneword verdict i like it fuchida said it knows what it wants to be murakami and minami just sat at the heavy greentopped desk in the center of the room for all they had to say about the decor they might have been part of it themselves army boors fuchida thought as he sat down too two minutes later precisely at ten oclock a large impressivelooking woman of about sixty with heavy features and light brown skin strode into the room in a long floralprint dress and a big flowered hat she made a parade of onein fact of slightly more than one because izumi shirakawa the local japanese whod interpreted for the americans at the surrender ceremony skittered in behind her he might have been a skiff following a manofwar with all sails set fuchida and genda rose half a second slower than they should have so did minami and murakami all four japanese officers bowed in unison the impressivelooking woman regally inclined her head to them fuchida spoke to the interpreter please tell her highness we are pleased to greet her here shirakawa murmured in english princess abigail kawananakoa replied loudly and clearly in the same language shirakawa hesitated before turning it into japanese the woman spoke again even more sharply than before shirakawa licked his lips and said she ah thanks you for the generosity of welcoming her to the palace her family built she has her nerve lieutenant colonel murakami said indignantly yes she does fuchida said but he was smiling he found himself liking the hawaiian actually halfhawaiian as her father had been an american businessman princess she was the widow of prince david kawananakoa who was queen kapiolanis nephew fuchida looked back to the interpreter tell her we appreciate her very kind greeting through shirakawa the princess said i suppose you asked meno you told meto come here because you want something from me that made both minami and murakami splutter this time fuchida had all he could do not to laugh out loud he did like her she had a great sense of her own importance and wasnt about to let anyone get the better of her the army officers didnt know what to make of that they thought she should have been groveling at their feet and didnt see that her sturdy independence might make her all the more useful to japan minoru genda did he said tell me your highness do you remember the days when the americans put an end to the kingdom of hawaii and annexed these islands i do princess abigail kawananakoa replied at once i was only a girl but i remember those days very well how do you feel about them genda asked for the first time the princess hesitated things are not always simple she said at last look at me if you do not believe that i have both bloods in me that is what hawaii is like these days and what i thought then and what i think now looking back are two different things lieutenant colonel minami opened his mouth fuchida was sure what he would say and how he would say it he was also sure minami could not do worse if he tried for a week forestalling the army officer he said and yet you still have your disagreements with the american government with this american government certainly princess abigail kawananakoa let out a disdainful sniff how anyone could agree with that man in the white house has always been beyond me though many people seem to you were republican national committeewoman for hawaii fuchida said after checking his notes the title translated only awkwardly into japanese he had no idea what a committeewoman might do especially when hawaii was only an external territory of the usa not a provinceno a state thats why they call it the united states he reminded himself i was she agreed and i have stayed a republican even though my party is no longer in the majority i do not abandon causes once i undertake them there was the opening fuchida had hoped for and have you abandoned the cause of the hawaiians your highness again princess abigail kawananakoa hesitated at last she shook her head no i have not abandoned it how could i i am one of them after all now fuchida could ask the question lieutenant colonel minami would have tried too soon since things have changed here do you not think you could do most for them as queen of a restored kingdom of hawaii she looked at him she looked through himhe got the feeling she could see the wall behind him through the back of his head she said if i were to be queen of hawaii i would rule i would not just reign i am no ones figurehead sir not the americans and not yours either could i be anything more than a figurehead the only possible answer to that was no japan wanted pliable puppets like the emperor of manchukuo the japanese told him what to do and he told his people that caused less friction than if a japanese governor gave orders in his own name a queen of hawaii would serve the the same function even the whites would be happier about orders from her than from general yamashita a queen of hawaii yes but plainly not this queen of hawaii still fuchida did his best you would serve the interests of your people your highness and the interests of all the people of hawaii if you accepted when abigail kawananakoa shook her head her jowls wobbled oddly that made her seem more impressive not less she said if i accepted i would serve the interests of the empire of japan i do not doubt that you make the offer in a spirit of good will but i must decline good morning gentlemen she rose from her chair and sailed out of the kings library izumi shirakawa again drifting along in her wake she is a widow neh lieutenant colonel murakami said hai for many years fuchida answered i can see why the army man said with a shudder i would rather die than live with a woman like that too fuchida and genda both laughed fuchida wouldnt have guessed murakami had a joke in him lieutenant colonel minami said what do we do now weve got orders to start up the kingdom of hawaii again how can we do that if we have no royal backside to plop down on the throne well manage genda sounded confident this woman isnt the only person with connections to the old royal family just the one with the best connections sooner or later one of the others will say yes and well have the backside we need this princess would have been a nuisance even if she did say yes fuchida said were better off without her none of the other japanese officers told him he was wrong when jane armitage dug her first turnip out of the ground she was as proud as she had been when she first got her drivers license she might have been prouder now in fact the drivers license had given her the freedom of the open road that first turnip and the other whiteandpurple roots that came out of the ground with it gave the promise of freedom to keep on living if shed seen her turnips in a grocerystore bin before the war she wouldnt have spent a nickel on the lot of them they werent much for looks bugs had nibbled them and they were generally ratty jane didnt care not these days beggars couldnt be choosers tsuyoshi nakayama studied the pile with grave approval you have done well he said and wrote a note on a piece of paper in a clipboard he carried thank you jane had never imagined a jap gardeners opinion could matter to her but nakayama knew how to grow things even if he was the occupiers gobetween in wahiawa jane knew in her bellyquite literally knew in her bellyhow important that was because you have done so well take a dozen turnips back to your apartment nakayama said take greens too the rest will go to the community kitchen thank you jane exclaimed food of her own he could have given her no greater reward or could he doubt set in how am i supposed to cook them i dont even have hot water let alone a working stove you can make a fire you can boil water the local jap was imperturbable or you can leave them there and they will all go to the kitchen oh ill take them jane said quickly will you watch the pile till i get back yosh nakayama nodded like her he knew others would make turnips disappear if someone didnt keep an eye on them jane picked what looked like the biggest and best turnips then she discovered that carrying a dozen of them was no easier than carrying a dozen softballs she thought about making two trips but doubted whether nakayama would put up with such inefficiency instead she tucked her blouse into her dungarees and dumped the turnips down her front she looked ridiculously lumpy but so what when she got to the apartment she hid the turnips in as many different places as she could find even if someone broke in he might not steal them all and she locked the door behind her when she went out again she hadnt bothered lately but now she had valuables in there again valuables before the invasion she would have turned up her nose at turnips shed thought of turnip greens as nigger food if shed thought of them at all no more before the invasion shed been worried about the beginnings of a double chin where so many fears had grown that one had shriveled and blown away nowadays her jawline was as sharp as anyone could want her cheekbones stood out in sharp relief under her skin she didnt know anyone in wahiawa who wasnt skinnier than before the war began from what doctors said that would add years to peoples lives some of the days jane put in felt like years to give yosh nakayama his due he was skinnier than he had been before the war started too he wasnt living off the fat of the land for helping the japs in his weathered face the prominent cheekbones put jane in mind of the old man of the mountain in new hampshire nothing else in hawaii reminded her of new england thank you for keeping an eye on things she told him he nodded gravely youre welcome i do it for everybody you understand not just for you of course she was glad he wasnt interested in her in particular that could have got awkward if she said no and he didnt like it would he make sure she didnt eat would he get her in trouble with the occupiers the nasty possibilities were endless three men with wheelbarrows came up and started loading her turnips into them when the wheelbarrows were full they wheeled them off in the direction of the community kitchen a few turnips were left jane wondered what would become of them she neednt have one of the men a filipino came back and loaded in those last few sweat ran down his face as he said hard work away he went panting a little nakayama looked after him an odd expression on his faceso odd that jane asked what is it we say hard work in japanese too i wonder if carlos knows that with us it can mean the work really is hard or it can mean you complain about what you have to do or it can mean you are sorry about what someone else has to do jane hadnt expected a japanese lesson she also hadnt had the faintest idea what the filipinos name was to her he was only a face in the crowd and not a handsome face either but nakayama knew he knew who she was too he probably knew who everybody in and around wahiawa was that had to make him all the more valuable for major horikawa and the rest of the japs your potatoes i think do well too he said touching the broad brim of his straw hat he went off to talk with another cultivator how do i cook those turnips jane wondered over and over only two answers came to her she could build a fire in the openand risk having more company than she wanted or she could build one in the oven of her gas stove it might make a fair imitation of the coalburner her family had had when she was a little girl she tried that it worked though the kitchen got smoky and she wouldnt have wanted to do it every day boiled turnips even with salt were uninspiring but they were better than nothing and a welcome addition to the slop from the community kitchen when you got right down to it what counted for more than a belly that didnt rumble not much no not much x jiro takahashi wanted to spend as much time out on the ocean as he could when he was on the pacific he wasnt in that miserable tent in the botanical garden when he was out there he didnt quarrel so much with his sons either they talked about things that had to do with the oshima maru not so much about politics and what it meant to be a japanese or an american that was all to the good because he didnt see eye to eye with hiroshi and kenzo and he found he liked sailing the sampan hed put to sea with her with the diesel for so long hed come to take it for granted you pointed her bow in the direction you wanted to go started the engine and away you went it took about as much skill as drawing a straight line with a pencil knowing where you wanted to go was a different story that took skill when you sailed though every move you made depended on something outside the sampan if the breeze shifted and you wanted to keep going in the same direction you had to shift the sails to account for the change if the wind died you couldnt go anywhere if you were running against it you had to go like a drunken crab zigzagging now one way now the other traveling ever so much fartherand slowerthan you would in a straight line his sons had got the hang of handling the sails as fast as he could have wanted he remained better at it than they did though he knew it and so did they after one long tack closer to the wind than the beamy sampan had any business getting kenzo said that was very pretty father it was wasnt it jiro found himself smiling he called back to hiroshi at the rudder were going to come about are you ready his older son nodded hai father all right thennow jiro swung the sails from one side of the mast to the other he and his sons ducked as the boom slid by then quickly straightened again hiroshi shifted the rudder to help guide the oshima maru onto her new course the sails filled with wind they were off on the other tack jiros smile got broader you couldnt have done that better if you tried for a week kenzo said admiringly jiro bowed slightly at the praise it warmed and embarrassed him at the same time he knew hed done well too but a proper japanese would have said something more on the order of not bad kenzos extravagant compliment was much more american one bad thing about even the most perfect tack it brought the sampan closer to kewalo basin however crabwise she traveled the oshima maru neared land each passing minute jiro didnt want to come ashore but there wasnt much point to fishing if you didnt bring the catch home he cut another strip of dark pink meat from the fat belly of an ahi he and his sons ate better on the pacific than they did on landone more reason to want to stay at sea the tunas flesh was almost as rich as beef kenzo also cut himself some ahi as he chewed he said well have doi paid off before too long well yes jiro nodded the way things are now though it doesnt matter that much so we get a little more money so what what can we buy with money these days not much but kenzo couldnt help adding thats because were cut off from the mainlandthe mainland of the united states thats where we got everything we needed and thats why were in the mess were in before long the greater east asia coprosperity sphere will make up for the things we cant get from the usa jiro said stubbornly his younger son rolled his eyes dont hold your breath even on the pacific politics reared its ugly head well see was all jiro said he didnt feel like fighting for a wonder kenzo took it no further either but the silence as they glided into the basin had the charged quality of the air just before a thunderstorm when they tied up at one of the quays work kept them too busy to quarrel the japanese soldiers in charge of taking the fish weighed the catch and paid the takahashis as usual the sergeant in charge of the detail asked personal use when the fisherman took fish off the oshima maru hai jiro said and i have some for the honorable japanese consul too the sergeant bowed to him yes youve done that beforei remember it shows a true japanese spirit and feeling delighted jiro bowed back whatever his sons were thinking none of it showed on their faces the sergeant waved them all away from the sampan harbor their first stop as usual these days was eizo dois shop as they were going in a tall suntanned haole came out he saw the fish they were carrying and started to laugh he said something in english kenzo nodded and answered in the same language they went back and forth for a little while then the white man walked off with a smile and a wave what was that all about jiro asked he said hes paying doi off for putting a sail on his surfboard of all the crazy things kenzo answered that is peculiar jiro agreed but he could go out a lot farther with the sail than without it if he doesnt have a boat i suppose it would be the next best thing kenzo nodded thats what he said jiro talked about it with the handyman after they gave him his fish yeah i thought the haole was a baka yaro eizo doi said who besides a prime jerk would come up with something that weird but he says it works pretty well and he gave me some good mackerel these days you dont complain about any food you get hai honto jiro said and then youre getting so much fish from so many people you could do some dealing on your own its against occupation regulations doi said for a moment jiro thought that meant he wasnt doing it then the fisherman realized doi hadnt said any such thing if he was dealing on the side keeping quiet about it was a good idea after they left the handymans jiro and his sons went their separate ways they headed back to the tent while he went on up nuuanu avenue to the consulate hiroshi and kenzo wanted nothing to do with that jiro hadnt tried to persuade them to join him even if that might have looked good to the occupying authorities he knew he would have got nowhere by now the sentries outside the compound recognized him they nudged one another as he came up the street hey its the fisherman one of them said what have you got today fishermansama he and his pals laughed jiro smiled too lord fisherman sounded ridiculous with oahu so hungry these days though the fancy title was less absurd than it might have been see for yourselves jiro held up a goodsized fish with a long high dorsal fin and a body blue and green above and golden below the soldiers exclaimedits like hardly ever got up into japanese waters they call this a mahimahi here jiro said its very good eating as good as any tuna if it tastes as good as it looks itll be wonderful said the sentry whod called him lord fisherman but you cant tell by looks the fugu s the ugliest fish in the world near enough but its the best eatingif you live through it anyway jiro nodded thats the truth the fugu was a puffer fish that blew itself up into a huge spiny ball to keep other fish from eating it its flesh was uniquely deliciousand deadly dangerous for the puffer also produced a paralyzing poison skilled chefs knew how to cut away the dangerous entrails and leave only the safer meat behind dozens of japanese fishermen killed themselves every year trying to prove they knew how to do the same thing well im sure the consul will be glad to see you go on in the sentry said thanks jiro said and he did secretaries and clerks exclaimed at the mahimahi jiro wondered how much fish nagao kita shared with them that was something he couldnt ask it was the consuls business not his he didnt get to see kita either so sorry takahashisan a clerk told him hes in consultation with army officers right now hes come out before jiro said not this time im afraid theyre very serious these army men the clerk said jiro got the feeling he didnt care for the japanese officers at all the fellow continued morimurasan will take charge of the fish though ah jiro brightened that will do he liked the chancellor at the consulate tadashi morimura was young to hold such a responsible posthe couldnt have been more than thirty he had a long face handsome in a slightly horsey way and had lost the first joint of his left index finger in some accident thank you very much takahashisan he said that is a very thoughtful gift for the honorable consul i know he will be glad to have it he didnt say anything about whether kita would share either i am glad to be able to help i know times are hard jiro said they will get better morimura rose from behind his desk he was of slightly above medium height which made him several inches taller than jiro and wore a sharp westernstyle suit i am going to put themahimahi did you say in the icebox for now to keep it fresh for kitasan please dont goid like to talk for a little while of course jiro said it is a privilege to talk to such an important man you give me too much credit morimura said with becoming modesty please wait ill be right back he was almost as good as his word maybe he has to make room in the icebox jiro thought as he sat in front of the desk its a big fish when morimura came back he offered jiro a cigarette from a gold case thank you morimurasan jiro bowed in his seat he hadnt tasted tobacco in a couple of weeks he savored the first drag thats very good glad you like it its the least i can do the younger man lit a cigarette too after blowing out a long plume of smoke he asked where did you catch such an interesting fish it was southwest of here sir jiro answered we sailed for about half a daywe had a nice strong breeze to take us along how many other sampans did you see while you were on the fishing grounds all told let me think jiro puffed on the cigarette smoking as slowly as he could to stretch out the pleasure it did help him concentrate there were five or six those were just the ones i could see you understand bound to be plenty more out there yes i understand the consular official said were they all sailing boats did you see any that had motors no sir not one with a motor jiro didnt need to think about that where would a boat with a motor get fuel well you never can tell morimura repliedand what was that supposed to mean but i thank you very much for telling me what you saw and for the mahimahi too of course kitasan will also be very grateful for the fish ill be sure to tell him you were the one who brought it he let jiro finish the cigarette then eased him out the door jiro scratched his head unless he was crazy morimura cared more about the sampans that hed seen than about the lovely fish jiro wondered just what exactly the chancellor at the consulate did to earn his pay kapiolani park was a big place before the japs turned it into a pow camp it had had plenty of treesmostly pines a lot of them had already come down to give the americans firewood now as a pair of prisoners banged away with axes another pine swayed as if in a strong breeze fletch armitage stood in a goodsized crowd watching the amateur lumberjacks it gave him something a little out of the ordinary two squads of japanese soldiers also watched the treefellersand the other prisoners they were there to make sure the axes didnt disappear into the camp after the job was done none of the americans got close to them when other trees came down everyone had seen that they had short fuses no more shade a prisoner near fletch said sadly fletch nodded but his heart wasnt in it he liked shade as much as the next guy but you didnt have to have it in hawaii the way you would in a place where the sun could knock you dead he was as pale as anybody in the camp but even he could see that firewood counted for more he wondered what the pows would do when no more trees were left inside the barbedwire perimeter a crackle like distant machinegun fire snapped his attention back to the pine timberrrr yelled one of the woodcuttersa cry hed surely learned at the movies and not in the great north woods down came the tree and slammed into the grass fletch wished it would have fallen on the japs but no such luck they were too canny to let themselves get smashed the sergeant in charge of the guards collected the axes only after he had them both did he shout something in japanese to his men they chose volunteersthat was what it amounted toand handed out saws the pows theyd picked went to work turning the fallen pine which had to be sixty or seventy feet tall into chunks of wood convenient for cooking food and boiling water the guards watched these prisoners no less intently than they had the axemen as far as they were concerned saws were weapons too watching a fallen tree turned into firewood was less interesting than watching it fall in the first place along with most of the crowd fletch drifted away if he hung around there was always the chance that the japs would find work for him too the geneva convention said officer prisoners genuinely had to volunteer to work but the japs hadnt signed it and respected it only when they wanted to they didnt feed him well enough to make him feel like doing anything more than he had to hows it going lieutenant that was arnie the ersatz artilleryman whod surrendered along with fletch what could be better its the beachfront by waikiki right fletch said im just waiting for the waitress to bring me another gin and tonic arnie grinned he was skinnier than fletch remembered of course fletch was probably skinnier than he remembered too he just didnt get to see himself very often arnie said you got a good way of looking at things my ass fletch told him if i had a good way of looking at things i would have gone over the hill with clancy and dave wonder what the hell happened to em arnie said whatever it is could it be worse than staying in the royal hawaiian here fletch asked he got another smile out of arnie considering how things were in the camp that was no mean feat but nobody was laughing a couple of days later the guards started shouting for a lineup in the middle of the morning that was out of the ordinary by now fletch had learned to view anything out of the ordinary with suspicion the japs didnt break routine to hand out lollipops he hoped thered been an escape most of him hoped so anyhow people who left the perimeter on work details talked about shooting squads groups of ten where if one man ran all the others got it in the neck that was a brutally effective way to convince prisoners not to try to make a breakand to stop the ones who did want to try there were no shooting squads inside the camp though if somebodyd dug a tunnel and sneaked off more power to him fletchs hopes sank when the guards didnt count and recount the men lined up in neat rows they would have if they thought they were missing people wouldnt they the commandant scrambled up onto a table in front of the pows as soon as he got up there all the prisoners bowed there would have been hell to pay if they hadnt much less athletically a local japanese in a doublebreasted suit that didnt go with his tubby build clambered onto the table with the officer the jap commandant shouted in his own language he had one of those voices that could fill up as much space as it had to a whole regiment could have heard his orders on the battlefield the interpreter tried twice as hard and was half as loud we have captured four american soldiers they did not surrender at the proper time this makes them nothing but bandits we treat bandits the way they deserve let this be a lesson to all of you guards marched in the four americans poor bastards fletch thought theyd been stripped to the waist their faces and torsos showed cuts and bruises the japs must have worked them over after they were caught one of them staggered like a punchdrunk palooka how many times had they hit him in the head if he didnt know everything that was going on around him maybe he was luckier than his buddies none of them was dave or clancy fletch was glad of that and then in short order he wasnt glad of anything any more to him hung by the thumbs had always been a joke something people said but nobody would ever do the japs werent kidding they tied ropes to a horizontal length of wood that had to be twelve feet off the ground and to the americans thumbs they were viciously precise about it too making sure their captives had to stand on tiptoe to keep their thumbs from taking all their weight once theyd tied them they gagged them and then they walked away another shout from the camp commandant dismissed the interpreter said japanese soldiers stood guard around the four americans they made sure none of the ordinary pows drew near the men theyd captured just hung there without food without water without hope fletch didnt need long to realize the japs intended to let them die there every so often one of them would sag down off his toes as weariness overcame him only to be jerked up again by the agony in his hands the rags tied over their mouths didnt muffle all the noises they made it took six days before they hung limp and unmoving the guards cut them down with bayonets they crumpled to the ground even after that though one of them tried to roll himself up into a ball the japs stared at him gabbling in their own language one of them ran off to get an officer when the officer came back with him he took a look at the feebly wiggling american then snapped out a command in his own language hai the guards chorused three of them raised their rifles and aimed them at the man theyd made into an example the arisakas barked together too after that the american didnt move any more with gestures the guards ordered some of the pows to drag the dead bodies to the burying ground there already was one for men who came down sick and couldnt find the strength to get better on what the japs fed themand for men the japs killed one way or another fletch was the third man a guard pointed at he didnt try protesting that the japanese couldnt make him work if he had he figured two more pows would have dragged him to the burying ground the corpse whose ankle he had hold of didnt weigh much all the water was gone from it you damn sorry son of a bitch he said oh yeah the corporal who had the other leg shook his head hes liable to be the lucky one its over for him how long will it last for us fletch had no answer the dead mans head bumped along the ground will that be me one day fletch wondered he had no answer for that either where are you going hiroshi takahashi asked away from here any place at all away from here kenzo answered they were both speaking english to keep their father from knowing what they were saying i cant stand hanging around this miserable tent he didnt come right out and cuss his dad knew what swear words were all right you better be back before we go out again thats all ive got to tell you hiroshi warned yeah yeah kenzo ducked out of the tent before his brother could nag him any more the way his father kept taking fish to the japanese consulate and the way he kept coming back looking as if hed just had tea with hirohito some of the reverence for the emperor kenzo had learned as a little boy still lingered but knowing that hirohito reigned over a country at war with the usa carried more weight no matter what his old man thought kenzo remained determined to stay an american he had to bow though when a japanese patrol marched up the street toward him hed learned how to do that properly as a little boy too the noncom who headed up the patrol recognized him as a countryman and bowed back which he wouldnt have done for a haole that made kenzo angry not proud but he didnt show what he was thinking he bowed again several times as he walked through honolulu his route would have looked random to someone who didnt know the city welland who didnt know what had happened in it and to it since the rising sun went up over iolani palace since almost all food was supposed to go into community kitchens the markets that had sprung up here and there were highly unofficial sometimes the japs closed down one or another more often the people who ran them figured greased palms were part of the cost of doing business fish here sure as hell hed seen eizo doi selling some of what he got taro there rice somewhere else yet another place for fresh vegetables yeah you had to know your way around you had to know your way around when you were buying too or youd lose your shirt the way things were these days people with food they could sell had the whip hand but kenzo wasnt looking to buy going out on the oshima maru kept him fed it also gave him food to bargain with if he wanted a coconut he could trade a flying fish for it he didnt need to lay out a stack of greenbacks fat as his fist you could still buy almost anything if you had enough money but enough swelled every day people bargained frantically kenzo heard curses in half a dozen languages whenever he saw a blond girl about his own age he tensed was it whenever he got close enough to tell he added some curses of his own to the electric air because again and again it wasnt he began to wonder if he was wasting his time that only made him shrug how could he be wasting it if he was doing what he wanted to do and then when he was almost sure he wouldnt run into elsie sundberg he did she was carrying a cloth sack that looked heavy but that didnt show what it held smart kenzo thoughta lot smarter than carrying food out in the open the hungrier people got the likelier they were to steal he waved for a moment elsie didnt think that was aimed at her for another moment she looked alarmed that shed caught an orientals eye then she recognized him he almost laughed at the look of relief that passed over her face before she smiled and waved back he picked his way toward her past hardfaced sellers and excitable buyers hi he said how are you how are things hi yourself elsie answered not too bad i want to thank you again for that fish you gave me that really helped my whole family a lot no huhu kenzo did laugh then why not a jap tossing a hawaiian word to a haole girl if that wasnt funny what was hope people arent giving you a rough time hope the japanese arent treating you the way whites treated local japs before the war he wondered why he hoped that wasnt turnabout fair play but elsie had never treated him like a japnot till things got strange after the shooting started anyhow and then only for a little while she shrugged now sign of the times she said which neatly echoed what he was thinking you have any trouble getting that tuna home he asked elsie shrugged again a little but i was lucky there were cops around both times so things didnt get too messy if those soandsos had got any pushier i wouldve kicked em right where it hurts most i was ready to she did her best to look tough back in high school kenzo wouldnt have imagined her best could be that good but everybodyd had some painful lessons since then thats the way to do it he said uhyou want company taking your stuff home today she hesitated much the same way she had when he waved to her across the makeshift market then as she had that time she smiled again smiled and nodded sure ken thanks okay now he paused your folks gonna start pitching a fit when you come up to the front door with a jap she blushed he watched in fascination as the color spread up from her neckline all the way to the roots of her hair but yet again she didnt need more than a moment to gather herself not when its somebody i went to school with she said firmly she eyed him is that good enough for you yeah this time kenzo answered right away she would have got mad at him if he hadnt and she would have had a right to you ready to go or you need more stuff im ready as if to prove it elsie hefted the bag come on kenzo had hustled till he was almost breathless hoping to run into her now that hed succeeded he had trouble finding things to say honolulu wasnt a great big city every step brought him that much closer to goodbye which was the one thing he didnt want to tell her elsie did her best to help asking how are your brother and your father hanks okay kenzo used the name by which hiroshi was known to haoles my dad he didnt know how to go on with that at last he said dad was born in the old country and hes hes happier with the way things are now than we are oh she walked on for a little while that must make things exciting to talk about like him she was looking for safe ways to say inherently unsafe things exciting yeah he laughed not that it was funny things get so exciting that most of the time we dont talk about anything but fishing you dont want to whack somebody over the head with a brick on account of fishing i guess not elsie took another few steps he realized she had to feel as wary around him as he did around her youre lucky that youre able to go out there especially with so many people hungry some luck he said bitterly if i were really lucky id be in college now then i could be working on a degree instead of a line full of hooks of course afterwards id probably go out fishing with my old man anyway because whos gonna hire a jap with a degree was it really that bad elsie was white she hadnt had to worry about it she hadnt even had to know the problem was there it wasnt goodthats for darn sure kenzo answered lots more japanese with good educations than places for them to work you put somebody with a university degree in a shoe store or a grocery or out on a sampan and he starts wondering why the heck he bothered you let him watch somebody with green eyes and freckles get the office job hes better qualified for and he wont be real happy about it quietly elsie said its a wonder you arent happier about how things are now im an american kenzo said with a shrug thats what everybody told me even before i started going to school people told me that and i believed it heck i still believe it i believe it more than the big five do i bet the people who ran the big fivethe firms of alexander and baldwin american factors c brewer and company castle and cooke and the theo h davies companypretty much ran hawaii or they had till the war anyhow they ran the banks they ran the plantations they did the hiring and they did the firing and the higher in their ranks you looked the whiter they got another proof of whod been running things here for the past fifty years was the neighborhood they were walking through as they neared elsies house these large homesmostly of white clapboard with shingle roofson even larger lots were nothing like the crowded shacks and tenements west of nuuanu avenue the part of town where kenzo had grown up they didnt shout about money they werent so rude or vulgar but they admitted it was there even the ones that had been wrecked or damaged in the fighting and the people who lived in them were white somebody had neatly mowed the sundbergs front lawn kenzo wondered whether elsies father pushed the lawnmower every sunday morning or they had a gardener before the war he would have bet on a gardener now he admitted to himself that he wasnt sure the front door opened before he and elsie got to it mrs sundberg looked a lot like elsie like her daughter she also looked alarmed for a momentwhat was this jap doing here then even without elsie telling her she realized which jap he was likely to be and her face cleared mr takahashi isnt it she said politely thats right mrs sundberg kenzo was polite too thank you for the fish you gave us it was very generous of you she said he nodded hed expected something like that but she went on in a way he hadnt expected its good to see you here now we can give you something too huh he said which was not the most brilliant thing that could have come out of his mouth but shed caught him by surprise she smiled a slightly superior smilea very haole smile elsie who hadnt got that trick down pat yet giggled instead and then said come on in ken mrs sundbergs smile slipped a little but only a little and she put it back fast yes do she said we have lemonade if youd like some elsie you get it for him and ill go out back and do the honors inside the house was pure new england overstuffed furniture with nubbly upholstery lots of turned wood stained a color close to dark cherry and more pictures on the wall and knickknacks on tables and shelves than you could shake a stick at thanks kenzo said when elsie did bring him some lemonade that didnt surprise him lots of people had lemon trees you couldnt do much with lemons but squeeze them and hawaii did still have plenty of sugarif not much else she carried a glass for herself too he sipped it was good mrs sundberg came back inside with half a dozen alligator pears the rough skin on some dark green on others almost black here you are she said proudly thank you very much kenzo meant it alligator pearssome people called them avocadoswere a lot harder to come by than lemons he couldnt remember the last time hed had any youre welcome she said the darker ones are ripe now the others will be in a few days feel them when they start to get soft theyll be ready to eat okay thats great thanks again kenzo was glad shed given him a number he could share evenly with his brother and his father had she done it on purpose probably she wouldnt miss a trick like that hed told elsie what his living arrangements were and that his mother hadnt made it if elsied mentioned it even once mrs sundberg wasnt the sort whod forget he thought she would hover over him and her daughter but she didnt she went off into the back of the house somewhere somehow that left him more on his best behavior than if she had hovered he and elsie talked about people from high school while they drank their lemonade when he finished his he said i better go elsie didnt say no she did say thanks for walking me home that was nice of you which was almost as good its okay it was good to see you that was about a tenth of what kenzo meant gathering his courage he tried again could we maybe uh see each other some more one of these times hed already seen she wasnt as good as her mother at masking what she thought he didnt need to be a private eye or somebody like that to read what she was thinking shed known him a long time but he was japanese he was japanese but shed known him a long timenot quite the same as the other being japanese meant something different now from what it had before december whatever it meant he wasnt a collaborator or no more than you had to be to survive when the place where you lived was occupied and so yes we can do that she said swell he grinned like a fool so long he didnt think his feet touched the ground at all as he went down the walk and out to the street the train chugged to a stop pensacola the conductor shouted all out for pensacola joe crosetti leaped up from his seat he grabbed his duffel bag from the overhead rack and slung it over his shoulder all his worldly goods in a canvas sackhe felt proud not impoverished and he was so excited he could hardly stand still pensacola naval air station he said wings wings at last orson sharp shouldered his duffel too keep your shirt on joe he said mildly theyre not going to let us fly this afternoon yeah but soon joe said we can fly here were gonna fly here its not like chapel hill where we couldnt okay his roommate said joe had the feeling he was hiding a laugh and wondered if he ought to get mad himself but then as the swarm of cadets surged toward the door he forgot all about it the last time hed got off a train it was in the middle of a north carolina winter he liked spring in florida a hell of a lot better he got a glimpse of the gulf of mexico just that glimpse told him he didnt know as much about the ocean as he thought he did the pacific off san francisco could be green it could be gray it could even be greenish blue or grayish blue hed never seen it never imagined it a blue between turquoise and sapphire a blue that was really blue the color made you want to go swimming in it people went swimming off of san francisco too but they came out of the water with their teeth chattering when they did beside him orson sharp said ive never seen the ocean before that made joe blink to him this was a variation on a theme to the kid from utah it was a whole new song you wanted to be a navy flier before you even knew what all that wet stuff was like joe said sharp didnt get angry or embarrassed i figured id find out what i needed to know he was hard to faze buses buses to the air station this way somebody shouted cadets started heading this way in the middle of the crowd and short joe didnt even see which way the shouter pointed he just went along one more sheep in the flock if everybody else was wrong hed be wrong too but hed have a lot of company they couldnt land on him too hard unless he goofed all by his lonesome the buses were where they were supposed to be a placard in front of the first one said to pensacola naval air station this time the flock had done it right cadets lined up to get aboard the navy was even bigger on lining up than grade school had been joe got a little look at pensacola as the bus rolled south and west toward the naval air station a lot of the streets had spanish names he remembered from an american history course that florida had belonged to spain once upon a time the same as california had he shook his head in wonder hed never expected that to matter to himwhen would he get to florida but here he was by god oaks and palms and magnolias all grew here the air was mild and moist although this extreme northwestern part of florida wasnt a place winter forgot altogether the way say miami was frame and brick buildings some with big wroughtiron balconies on the upper stories lined the streets reminds me a little of new orleans said somebody behind joe the comparison would have meant more to him if hed ever been to new orleans whites and negroes walked along the sidewalks and went in and out of shops and homes they seemed not far from equal in numbers as it had been in north carolina that was plenty to tell joe he was a long way from home colored people in san francisco were few and far between because of the name hed figured the naval air station would lie right next to the town but it didnt it was half a dozen miles away on the way there joes bus passed a massive fort of brickwork and granite this here is fort barrancas the driver said playing tour guide the confederates held it for a while during the war between the states but the federals ran em out joe had heard people talk about the war between the states in north carolina too in san francisco it had always been just the civil war cadets from the south seemed a lot more serious about it than those from other parts of the country of course their side had lost which doubtless made a difference over there across the channel on santa rosa island is fort pickens the driver went on it couldve touched off the war if fort sumter didnt the confederates never did take it even though the fellow who attacked it was the same man whod built it before the war they kept geronimo the apache there for a while after they caught him too leaning out past orson sharp joe got a glimpse of fort pickens it had five sides with a bastion at each corner even now it looked like a tough nut to crack he imagined gunfire sweeping the sand of santa rosa island and shivered a little no trying to take a place like that wouldnt have been any fun at all and then he forgot all about the civil war or the war between the states or whatever you were supposed to call it along with the gulls and pelicans fluttering over fort pickens he spotted an airplane painted bright yellow a trainer the buzz that filled the bus said he wasnt the only one whod seen it either excitement blazed through him before long hed go up in one of those slow ungainly machinesexcept it seemed as swift and sleek as a wildcat to him pensacola naval air station itself was a study in contrasts the old buildings were old brickwork that looked as if it dated from somewhere close to the civil war and the new ones were new some of the plywood that had gone into hangars and administrative buildings hadnt been painted yet and hadnt started weathering yet either and out beyond the buildings sprouted a forest of tents the driver might have been reading joes mind you gentlemen will be staying in those for a while im afraid he said were putting up real housing as fast as we can but theres a lot going on and weve had to get big in just a bit of a hurry you know that got laughs all through the bus a couple of years earlier nobodyd wanted to hear about national defense much less talk about it now nobody wanted to pay attention to anything else but making up for lost time was no easier no more possible than it ever was brakes groaning the bus stopped the cadets shouldered their duffels again as they descended a lieutenant commander came out of the closest old brick building and greeted them with welcome to pensacola naval air station gentlemen you will have no mothers here we assume youre old enough to take care of yourselves till you show us otherwiseat which point were liable to throw you out on your ear now if youll line up for processing processing here was for the cadets about what it was for a cow going through the swift meatpacking plant in chicago joe didnt end up with usda choice stamped on his backside but that was almost all he escaped the paperwork he filled out made what hed done at chapel hill seem like the kindergarten course we ought to drop this stuff on the japs he grumbled to orson sharp itd smash em flatter than a tenton bomb it cant be helped sharp took everything even bureaucratic nonsense in stride joe didnt know whether to admire him or to want to clobber him they shared a twoman tent a good deal more spacious than their fourman dorm room joe looked at a mimeographed handout a bored petty officer had given him he rolled his eyes up to the heavens and let out a theatrical groan for heavens sake what is it sharp asked any other cadet in the group would have said something more pungent than for heavens sake listen to this joe read from the handout flight training and academic preparation will continue in the ratio of three parts to two academic subjects to be covered will include the following navigation ordnance and gunnery indoctrination recognition communications and airplane engines were stuck with more classes for cryin out loud he would have been more pungent himself with anybody but his roommate he refused to admit that orson sharp was a good influence on him well we need to know all those things sharp was so reasonable he could drive anybody nuts i thought we were done with notebooks and desks and tests lord knows i hoped we were joe refused to cheer up even though he already knew a lot about engines im not thrilled either but we cant quit now we just have to go through with it sharp wasnt wrong joe didnt clobber him he couldnt have said why not to save his life commander minoru genda was working in a honolulu office that had once housed a us navy officer the space was larger and better appointed than anyone below flag rank would have had in japan but nothing out of the ordinary here his work was nothing out of the ordinary either that left him slightly discontented he wouldnt have minded leaving oahu and going on to fight in the philippines or the dutch east indies things were too quiet here he wanted new problems to sink his teeth into he hadnt had that thought more than ten minutes before an excited radioman ran into his office and exclaimed sir one of our picket boats has sighted two american carriers heading toward these islands well well genda said that was a surprise he hadnt expected the yankees to try to raid hawaii give me more details sir there are no more details the radioman answered the picket boats signal cut off in the middle of the message ah so desu i understand genda nodded no he wouldnt be able to get more details from the picket boats crew no one this side of the yasukuni shrine for the spirits of the war dead would now he had to think about what to do to make sure the americans paid for their folly akagi and soryu have been notified oh yes sir the radioman said captain hasegawa says he wants to let the american ships come closer before he launches his attack against them the americans will have to come closer if theyre going to strike at oahu hai honto genda said that was why the picket boats were out there some more than a thousand kilometers north and east of the island no carrierbased bombers could fly that far and return to the ships that had launched them genda looked at his watch it was almost three he wouldnt have been surprised if the americans intended to run in towards oahu all through the night as the japanese strike force had done back in december thinking out loud he went on we caught them by surprise though they wont play the same trick on us well be ready and waiting tomorrow morning yes sir the radioman said do you need me to pass anything on to either of our carriers just one thinggood hunting the airstrip by haleiwa had to be one of the most beautiful in the world out beyond the grass and the palm trees and the beach was the vast turquoise expanse of the pacific neither the beauty nor the perfect climate did anything to salve lieutenant saburo shindos temper when he looked north to the pacific he saw only an opportunity he would not have the americans stuck their head in the tigers mouth when he happened to be ashore others aboard the akagi and the soryu would hunt them at sea as for him feeling like a caged tiger himself he paced back and forth at the edge of the runway the pilots drawn up at attention there followed him with their eyes he glared at them then deliberately stopped so they had to look west into the sinking sun to see him i hope we will be unlucky he said i hope the men on our carriers will find the americans and sink them before they can make their night run towards oahu but if the carrier pilots fail we will see american planes overhead early tomorrow morning do you understand hai the fliers chorused you had better shindo snarled because you will be up and waiting for them when they arrive you will be waiting for them and you will make them sorry they dared come anywhere near this island do you understand that hai they chorused again shindo scowled all right then i will be up there with you and i will be watching anyone who lets an american escapeeven one american do you hear will answer to me i am more dangerous to you than any stinking yankee pilot ever born do you understand that hai the pilots said once more good youd better shindo turned his back dismissed he heard the men muttering but he didnt look at them again let them mutter as long as they were worrying about him they wouldnt worry about the enemy that was what he had in mind jane armitage broke a nail weeding her potato patch she hardly bothered to swear that wasnt because she didnt want to seem unladylike she couldnt have cared less these days though a broken nail was nothing to get excited about she looked down at her hands before the war started the only mark theyd had was a small callus on the side of her right middle finger a writers callus now hard yellow calluses banded her palms her fingers were battered and scarred her nails didnt bear thinking about theyd been a disaster even before she broke the latest one she bit it off short and reasonably straightwhy wait to go back to the apartment and dig out a manicure scissors then she got back to work pretty soon shed be able to knock off for the day the sun was sliding down toward the waianae range a shower would benot quite heavenly not without hot water but welcome even so then she could go have supper she was amazed how important food had become in her life now that she didnt have enough of it just thinking of supper was enough to make her stomach rumble it would go on rumbling after she ate too never enough everyone in wahiawa got thinner by the day that had to be true of everyone on oahu everyone in the territory of hawaii but jane hadnt gone outside of wahiawa since the fighting started she felt as if shed fallen back through time like someone in an h g wells story what was she but a peasant from the middle ages tied to her little plot of land she paused again in her weeding this time it wasnt a broken fingernail but a distant droning in the sky she frowned the japs didnt fly all that much certainly not so much as the army air corps had before hawaii changed hands maybe they didnt have as much fuel as they would have liked or maybe they just didnt think they had anything to worry about whatever the reason they didnt and the swelling drone didnt sound as if it came from japanese planes jane had heard enough of them to know what they sounded like she looked up coming out of the northeast over the koolau range was a v of big twoengine twintailfinned airplanes she stared at them hardly daring to hope that they flew right over wahiawa low enough to let her make out the stars on their wings they were they were american planes jane wanted to yell and scream and dance all at the same time she heard cheers here and there she heard them but she didnt do anything except go on staring up at the sky too many people were out and about someone might see her and report her to the japs if she celebrated too hard you never could tell and you didnt want to take a chance how had they got here they looked too big to be carrier planes had they flown all the way from the pacific coast if they had they surely couldnt carry enough gas to get back what were they going to do what they were going to do now was attack wheeler field not far southwest of wahiawa a few antiaircraft guns started shooting at them but only a few the japs must have been as taken aback as the americans were when the war started would some japanese politician stand up in whatever they used for a parliament and make a speech about april the way fdr had about december by god i hope so jane thought savagely crump crump crump yes that was the noise of bursting bombs jane had become altogether too well acquainted with it to harbor any doubts give it to em give it to the lousy sons of bitches she didnt say a thing she thought her head would burst with the effort of holding those loud loud thoughts inside not everybody bothered she heard an unmistakable rebel yell and somebody shouted take that you fucking slanteyed bastards she didnt recognize the voice she hoped nobody else did either a column of greasy black smoke rose into the sky and then two more in quick succession they werent anything like the massive pall that had marked pearl harbors funeral pyre but they were there the bombers had hit something worth hitting the dinner bell rang summoning people all over wahiawa to the community kitchen janes amazement grew by leaps and bounds for a few wonderful minutes she hadnt even realized she was hungry commander minoru genda snatched up the jangling telephone in his office moshimoshi he said impatiently an excited voice gabbled in his ear gendas impatience gave way to astonishment but thats impossible he exclaimed more gabbling assured him that it wasnt how the he broke off he heard bombs going off in the distance not at wheeler fieldthat was too far away for the sound to carrybut off to the west hickam he thought in dismay so sorry but ive got to go he told the officer on the other end of the line and hung up before the man could squawk any more he rushed downstairs and out onto the sidewalk in front of his office building the sun was dropping down toward the pacific genda caught glints of light off airplane wings he knew the silhouette of every plane japan made those werent japanese aircraft they were they could only be american he watched them drone east past the southern edge of honolulu he knew every carrierbased us warplane by sight too he had to the planes he saw werent any of those either other people also realized they belonged to the usa the whoops and cheers that rang out all over honolulu told him as much if hed had any doubts that hawaii wasnt fully reconciled to japanese occupation those whoops would have cured them those werent carrierbased aircraft they were zakennayo genda exclaimed he seldom swore but here he made an exception those were us army bs a million questions boiled in his head how did they get here came first and foremost they didnt have the range to fly from california the answer to that one formed almost as fast as the question did the americans must have flown them off one of the carriers the picket boat had spotted genda bowed slightly toward the us bombers in token of respect that had taken imagination and nerve but the next question was how do they aim to recover their planes and theirair crews he couldnt imagine that the united states would send men off on a suicide mission he also couldnt see how the usa planned to get them back he scratched his head it was a puzzlement yet another good question was what are we doing about this the japanese didnt seem to be doing very much a few antiaircraft guns started firing a few puffs of black smoke stained the sky around the bs genda saw no signs that any of them was hit he also saw no fighters going after them had the yankees blasted all the runways on oahu genda couldnt believe it there werent nearly enough american bombers to do anything of the sort more likely theyd just caught the japanese with their pants down nobody had expected the raiders till tomorrow morning the americans had pulled a fast onethe bs with their greater range could launch far sooner than the usual carrierbased planes would have the akagi and the soryu would be rushing north to meet the american carriers which probably wouldnt be anywhere near so far south as the japanese thought they were and japanese fighters based here on oahu didnt seem to be reacting very well at all the yankees may have done us a favor genda thought this wasthis could only bea raid a pinprick an annoyance a stunt it wouldnt and couldnt settle anything he imagined us newspapers with headlines like we strike back at hawaii people on the american mainland would cheerand would have the right to but what would happen if and when the americans seriously attacked oahu genda didnt know whether they could but now he was sure as sure could be that they wanted to they werent going to accept what had happened in the central pacific as a fait accompli we werent ready here genda thought we werent ready and theyve embarrassed us theyve made us lose face that wouldnt happen again though genda intended to be one of the men who made sure it wouldnt happen again if the yankees returned they wouldnt find oahu too flustered to fight back the island would be ready to repel them meanwhile still without much harassment from the ground or from the air the bs buzzed off in the direction of diamond head no matter what genda might plan for the future today belonged to them genda went back up to the office as fast as hed hurried down to the street yes today belonged to the americans he got on the telephone to do his best to ensure that tomorrow wouldnt chow time horrible glop not enough of itnowhere near enough of it fletch armitage didnt care he looked forward to every meal he got in the kapiolani park pow camp with greater anticipation than he ever had when he was going to some pretty fancy restaurants back on the mainland he didnt need to be albert einstein to figure out why these days he had an insiders understanding of relativity when you were already well fed even the finest supper could be only so nice and when you were hungry any food at all even food you would have turned your nose up at when times were better couldnt be anything less than wonderful in those days more good food had been just a surfeit fletch had wondered when he would start to get a potbelly here and now every grain of rice kept him breathing for anotherhow long a minute five minutes who could say but he would rather have had a tbone with all the trimmings than jane wearing nothing but a smile he wondered how she was had she stayed in wahiawa or fled in front of the oncoming japanese fletch had no way to know of course he had no way to know which would have been better either the japs had gleefully strafed refugees and in the end thered been no way to stay in front of them had there been he wouldnt have been standing in line in a pow camp a fly landed on his arm he slapped at it it buzzed away then his ear caught another buzz this one up in the sky he wasnt the only one who heard it either somebody pointed west toward downtown honolulu somebody else said what the hell are those since the planes were coming out of the sun what they were wasnt obvious for a little while but then somebody else said fuck me if they aint bs as soon as the soldier said it fletch knew he was right those sleek lines and twin tail booms couldnt have belonged to any other aircraft fletch wished hawaii would have had a few squadrons of them instead of the lumbering douglas bs that werent fast enough to run or well enough armored to fight then he wondered what difference it would have made the japs would have shot up the bs on the ground too and thenand only thenfletch wondered what the hell bs were doing flying over japaneseoccupied oahu he wasnt the only one slow on the uptakefar from it the cheering in the camp had hardly started before he was yelling his head off everybody was yelling a few seconds later yelling and shaking hands and pounding buddies on the back not more than ten seconds later the machine guns on the guard towers around the camp cut loose the prisoners inside hit the dirt with the unanimity of conditioned reflex only after fletch lay flat did he poke his head up for a split second to see what the hell was going on the japs in the towers werent shooting at their captives they were blazing away at the bombers dumb assholes said a sergeant lying next to fletch those planes are too high up for small arms to hit let em waste ammo fletch said at least its not coming in on us the sergeant nodded the bs flew on by east of diamond head they swung up toward the north that was when fletch started trying to figure out not only what they were doing but how theyd got here they couldnt have taken off from san francisco they wouldnt have made it to oahu in the first place let alone had a prayer of getting back could the big hulking brutes have flown off a carrier he wasnt sure he was no navy man but he would have bet the farm the stork hadnt brought them quite a few of the pows were navy men some of them swore up and down that no army bombers could have got airborne off a carriers short flight deck they couldnt come close to explaining how else the bombers had arrived over oahu though as that sank in their protests faded the cheering didnt last long a captainarmy variety not navysaid you wait and seethe japsll make us pay for yelling for our own goddamn side of course they will theyve lost face another officer said fletch found that horribly likely what could be more embarrassing than enemy bombers showing up over an island you thought you owned surprise guys fletch thought the japs cared more about prestige than americans did too slowly the chow line started snaking forward again here and there men had dropped mess kits when they dove for cover as the guardtower machine guns opened up they squabbled over which one was whose and over whod been a clumsy idiot and stepped on one all serious business because it centered on food no juicy tbone for fletch or anybody else at the kapiolani campjust rice and leaves that might have been vegetables or might have been weeds and not enough of either he hated it and he wanted more both at the same time but however unsatisfactory a supper it made he felt better afterwards than before for a little while his body was only yelling at him that it was hungry it wasnt screaming the way it usually did here and there prisoners whistled or hummed the starspangled banner and america the beautiful and god bless america and other patriotic songs nobody sang the words out loud that would have been asking for trouble some of the guards knew english and some of the local japanese had thrown in with the occupiers even the tunes were dangerous fletch admired the pows who showed what they were feeling without wanting to irritate the occupiers he didnt doubt that everybody felt the same way why stick your neck out to show it and one flight of bombers couldnt be anything more than a nuisance to the japs they might remind hawaiiand tokyothat the usa was still in the fight but they werent about to bundle the empire of japan back across the pacific too bad fletch thought eyeing the barbed wire surrounding him too goddamn bad lieutenant saburo shindo wasnt usually a man to show what he felt right now though he was furious and making only the barest effort to hide it the officers set over him had talked about an american attack at first light tomorrow morning hed been ready to meet that hed had his fellow fighter pilots at haleiwa ready to meet it too they hadnt been ready for the single us bomber that swooped low over the airstrip here now as afternoon passed into evening dropped a stick of bombs and roared off to the south had there been three bombers instead of one they could have wrecked the whole field bombs from the one were bad enough no zeros could take off till those holes got filled in isogi shindo shouted at the bulldozer operator the army noncom tipped his hat to show that he was hurrying blue stinking diesel smoke belched from the bulldozers exhaust pipe the lowered blade shoved dirt into one of the last holes in the ground the big snorting machine tamped the dirt down flat with the blade and with its caterpillar treads pickandshovel men would have taken a couple of days to repair the damage shindo knew that here the sun still stood in the sky though it sank toward the western horizon with each passing minute and each passing minute meant one minute fewer in which he could hope to gain revenge as if moving in slow motion the bulldozer cleared the runway lets go shindo shouted to his men they ran for their fighters as soon as shindo slammed his canopy shut a groundcrew man spun his prop the zeros engine roared to life obeying another groundcrew mans signals shindo taxied out of the revetment that had saved the plane from damage and out to the runway he gave the zero the gun it bounced a couple of times as it ran over the hasty repairs the bulldozer had made but he had no trouble getting into the air he grudged the time he had to wait for his comrades to join him as soon as theyd all taken off they streaked away to the northeast after the nowvanished american bombers where shindo didnt know not exactly he was going on dead reckoning and gut instinct and the sketchy reports hed got from other parts of oahu any of those might have been wrong all of them might have been wrong and he knew it only too well if they were if they were hed see nothing but sky and ocean till he ran low on fuel or ran out of light he admired the yankees nerve theyd got everybody on oahu jumping like fleas on a hot plate including me he thought sourly he still hadnt figured out how they intended to get picked up he couldnt believe theyd be able to land on a carrier even if theyd left from one would they ditch in the ocean and trust to luck that seemed to stretch trust further than it ought to go there lieutenant an excited voice in his earphones made him stop puzzling over it isnt that them about ten oclock low hai shindo by contrast sounded perfectly calm he estimated the american bombers course and radioed it back to oahu it might help the japanese carriers and their planes find the ships that had launched the bs that done he said now we make them pay it wouldnt be easy they had scant daylight left and the bombers had seen them too the bs dove for the deck they had a very fair turn of speed they werent as fast or as maneuverable as the zeros nothing was as maneuverable as a zero except the japanese armys hayabusa fighter which was much more lightly armed but they didnt dawdle they also showed they had teeth the machine gunners in their dorsal turrets blazed away at shindo and his comrades and those were heavy machine guns a zero must have got in the way of a few rounds for it tumbled into the pacific trailing smoke and flame one reason zeros were so fast and maneuverable was that they were lightly built when they got hit they paid the price shindo chose a b he gave it a burst from his own machine guns those were just riflecaliber weapons he made hits he was sure of that but the bomber kept flying as if nothing had happened to it sturdy construction and armor plate might make a plane slow and sluggish but they too had their advantages another zero cometed into the sea shindo swore who was supposed to be shooting down whom he brought another bomber into his sights this time he opened up with his twin mm cannon a couple of hits from them would knock anything out of the sky getting the hits was the problem they fired none too fast and carried only a limited store of ammunition get in close he thought that was the fighter pilots numberone rule get in close enough and you couldnt miss shooting at long range was the most common and worst mistake novices and bad pilots made once the enemy filled your windshield you didnt scare him when you opened up you killed him the americans knew that as well as shindo did tracers streaked past his zero but they had to aim guns in turrets which wasnt easy he pointed his fighters nose at the b and started shooting chunks flew from the bomber for a long dreadful moment he thought it would keep going all the same but it heeled over and smashed down into the ocean even then though it left only an oil slick not a floating patch of fire like a zero another place the yankees added weight was in selfsealing fuel tanks that really worked three more bsand another zerowent into the pacific before shindo broke off the attack if he and his comrades were going to get back to oahu with any light in the sky they had to turn south now the bombers kept on heading northeast as if they intended to fly to california they couldnt get there though shindo wondered again what they did intend to do as he made for oahu he also wondered if hed pursued too long and then he saw that the groundcrew at haleiwa had lit up the airstrip with parked cars and trucks and a searchlight that had stood in front of a movie theater his landing was a long way from elegant but he made it a groundcrew man with a flashlight guided him to a revetment he killed the motor leaped out of his zero and ran for the radio in the headquarters tent he wanted to find out whether carrierbased aircraft could catch the enemys ships other pilots came to listen with him a couple of hours later they got a nasty jolt instead of the japanese finding the american carriers a us sub found the soryu the yankees must have hoped the japanese would charge after them hoped and had submarines lying in wait now shindo listened anxiously fearing the carrier would sink not till after midnight was it plain the ship would survive two torpedoes had struck her but only one exploded had they both but they hadnt and the soryu limped back toward safer waters with her came the akagi there would be no pursuit of the us raiders after all however they intended to recover their planes and crews they could go ahead and do it xi doolittle raids hawaii the newspaper headlines screamed takes japs by surprise only when you got to the fourth paragraph of the story did you discover that six of his sixteen bs had been shot down the rest of what was in the paper was a paean to the heroism of the crews that had been rescued after they ditched in the pacificand in slightly smaller measure to the heroism of the destroyer crews that had done the rescuing joe crosetti understood that like every cadet at the pensacola naval air station he wished hed been along with jimmy doolittle and his intrepid flyboys he was sickjealous of the fliers as a matter of fact how horribly unfair that theyd got to go and he hadnt just because theyd been flying for years while he was only now beginning to get up in the air that theyd lost more than one plane in three and about one man in two for several crewmen had been shot even on bs that kept flying to the ditching point fazed him not at all it hadnt fazed them either they were all volunteers the papers made that very plain he couldnt imagine anybody in the country who wouldnt have stepped up to the plate there he burbled about the attack standing on the runway next to the boeing stearman hed soon be taking up like all navy trainers the tough little biplane was painted bright yellow so nobody could mistake it for anything but what it was people not training in stearmans called them yellow perils not altogether in jest they were dangerous to their pilots and dangerous to those around them if you will bring yourself back from the hawaiian islands to the business at hand mr crosetti said the instructor a lieutenant from pittsburgh named ralph goodwin uh yes sir sorry sir joe wasnt the least bit sorry can you imagine the look on the japs faces when we buzzed em goodwin had cool blue eyes and a manner that spoke of money can you imagine the look on your face when i give you a downcheck for wasting your timeand mine no sir joe said quickly all right then why dont you hop on in well run through the checks aye aye sir joe scrambled up into the stearmans rear seat it went up and down like a barber chair to adjust to trainees of different heights the man whod taken the plane out last must have been big because joe had to raise it three or four inches he clipped the parachute pack to the flying harness lieutenant goodwin meanwhile had taken his place in the front seat you squared away there he asked uh just about sir crosetti reached up and adjusted the mirror attached to the upper wing he might have been fooling with the rearview mirror on a car somebody else had been driving when he got it fixed the way he wanted it he said all ready now okay lets run through the checklist then goodwin said right joe hoped he hid his lack of enthusiasm by the way the instructor snorted he didnt hide it well enough you do this every time you plop your fanny down in an airplane misterevery single time the one time you forget the one thing you forget will always be the one you wish you hadnt a stearmans a very forgiving planeyou can do a lot of things thatd send you home in a box if you tried em in a hotter machine but no airplane ever made will forgive outandout stupidity and even if you dont feel like running through the checks i docause its my neck too ears burning joe mumbled yes sir okay goodwin sounded amused not angry seems about two cadets out of three are like that they get the hang of it though lets go through the list through it they went everything from the attachment of joes safety belt to pedals and stick to throttle and magneto with the motor running everything checked out the way it was supposed to all green sir joe said above the roar of the sevencylinder radial looks that way to me too goodwin agreed take her over to runway threewest and let the tower know youll be going into the air threewest aye aye sir slowly and carefully joe taxied to the end of the required runway a plane was meant to fly not to waddle along on the ground taxiing was nothing like driving a car the way hed thought it would be he exchanged formalities with the control tower he also looked down the runway to make sure nobody else was landing on it or taxiing across it that was like automobile traffic charging out from a stop sign without looking was liable to get you creamed seems all clear sir he said to goodwin he wasnt far enough along to take off without the instructors permission so it does get us airborne mr crosetti joe advanced the throttle the engines roar got louder and deeper the stearman shot down the runway actually the little biplane was one of the most sedate airplanes ever manufactured but it didnt seem that way to him even though he was still on the ground he kept one eye glued to the airspeed indicator when it showed he was going fast enough he pulled back on the stick the yellow peril lurched into the air smoothly mr crosetti smoothly goodwin said youre not bulldogging a steer yes sir joe thought hed made a great takeoff he was flying wasnt he its like learning to drive a car goodwin told him after you get enough hours you wont need to tell your hands and feet what to do theyll know by themselves and theyll do everything together itll seem like second natureif you dont kill yourself before then of course that comparison made sense to joe it also told him he wasnt as far along as hed thought he remembered how ragged hed been the first few times he got behind the wheel a few less than perfect turns hereand the instructors sardonic comments accompanying each onewent a long way toward cutting him down to size but he was flying even if he wasnt such hot stuff yet he was up in the air and learning what he needed to learn so he could go out and shoot down japs one of these days there was the naval air station and the woods and swamps behind it and the blue bay in front and the even bluer gulf of mexico out beyond the bay birds got a view like this all the time the stearman could outperform any bird ever hatched even had it carried machine guns it would have been helpless against anything this side of a sopwith camel but joe didnt dwell on that much sooner than he wanted to he was coming in for a landing gently goodwin urged smoothly youre juggling eggs cadets make ninety percent of their mistakes in the last twenty feet if you only knew where the hell the ground is youd be charles lindbergh i dont want to be charles lindbergh joe snapped lindbergh had done everything he could to keep the usa out of the war till the japs jumped hawaii hed been the nazis teachers pet and hed been mighty quiet since december okay youd be jimmy doolittle lieutenant goodwin said equably thats more like it jimmy doolittle joe wasnt or not yet anyhow the stearman bounced hard when he put it down his teeth clicked together the instructor said something joe hoped didnt go out to the control tower he brought the recalcitrant beast to a stop and killed the engine well sir he asked unhappily into the sudden silence that seemed so loud but goodwin had recovered his sangfroid in a hurry well mr crosetti youre learning thats all he said ive seen men at your stage of training do better but ive seen plenty do worse youve got plenty of work ahead of you but you can get where you want to go joe knew where he wanted to go where jimmy doolittle had gone before him doolittle had raided joe wanted to take hawaii back all by his lonesome he wouldnt he couldnt he knew that but it was what he wanted colonel mitsuo fujikawa had been promoted for bravery after the conquest of hawaii but even though corporal takeo shimizus regimental commander now wore three stars on his collar tabs instead of two he looked anything but happy like the rest of the men in the regiment shimizu stood at stiff attention on the grass of a park doing duty for a parade ground his face held no expression he stared straight ahead he might have been carved from wood it wasnt going to help him he could feel that in his bones nothing would help the soldiers not after what had happened a few days before colonel fujikawa prowled back and forth once upon a time shimizu had seen a picture of a daimyo hunting a tiger with a spear in korea three and a half centuries earlier the great noble wore fancy armor and a tall headgear with a floppy tip shimizu remembered that but what he really remembered was the ferocity that blazed from the tiger hed never seen anything like it sincenot till now even when fujikawa stopped pacing he still looked ready to roar and to spring instead of roaring though he spoke softly and somehow made that more wounding than the loudest shouts could have been you are in disgrace he hissed disgrace do you hear me do you hear me hai we hear you colonel the men spoke as if they were part of a perfectly trained chorus in an abstract way shimizu was proud of thembut only in an abstract way because no matter how perfect they were that wouldnt do them any good either disgrace colonel fujikawa said once more you are disgraced i am disgraced the whole japanese army in hawaii is disgraced and the japanese navy in and around hawaii is disgraced too and do you know why everyone knew why of course shimizu knew why all too well this time though no one said a word it was as if if no one admitted what had happened somehow it wouldnt have happened after all but colonel fujikawa was intent on plumbing the depths of their iniquity the americansthe americans made us lose face they bombed oahu they torpedoed one of our carriers and most of their bombers escaped it is an embarrassment it is a humiliation it is a disgrace truly a disgrace as one man the soldiers of the regiment hung their heads in shame shimizu lowered his at the same time as everybody else even as he did though he wondered why this was his fault what could an infantry noncom do about bombers overhead except jump for cover and hope he didnt get killed nothing he could see the regimental commander went on the captain of the picket boat that spotted the american carriers was fished out of the water after the enemy sank it he has committed suicide to atone for his failure to see that they had longrange bombers aboard the commander of the antiaircraft defenses on this island has also committed suicide to atone for his failure to shoot down even a single enemy airplane now real fear ran through the regiment honorable seppuku was always a way out after failure saying goodbye to everything was not only honorable it was also easier than living on as an object of scorn to everyone around you but how far would that particular form of atonement reach colonel fujikawa said common soldiers form two ranks facing each other move you worthless wretches they moved now they knew what was coming it would be bad but it could have been worse after a while fujikawa would decide it was over sergeants and corporals face one another fujikawa added shimizu didnt let the dismay he felt show on his face hed been through this mill before too who hadnt officers hadnt that was who unlike enlisted men officers were presumed to be gentlemen here now they stayed at their stiff brace when shimizu turned to face corporal kiyoshi aiso who led another squad in his platoon aisos face was as expressionless as his the other noncom was a longservice soldier he had to be close to forty but his weathered skin and the broad shoulders that bulged under his tunic said hed grown strong with the years not soft now at last fujikawa shouted each man slap the face of the man in front of you take turns corporal aiso was senior which meant he got to go first shimizu braced himself aiso let him have it right across the cheek in spite of being braced shimizu staggered his head rang he shook it trying to clear his wits aiso hadnt held back not even a little bit then the other corporal stood at attention and waited shimizu slapped him hard aisos head flew to one side he shook his head too shimizu came to attention in turn the same cheek or the other one aiso asked politely whichever you please it doesnt matter one way or the other shimizu answered aiso hit him lefthanded which meant his head snapped to the right this time the older soldier was just as strong with his off hand as with his good one shimizu asked whether he had a preference aiso just shrugged shimizu a thoroughly righthanded man struck his left cheek again usually the noncoms would have kept the common soldiers at it making sure they didnt slow down and making sure they didnt pull their blows the noncoms were also caught in the web of humiliation today the regimental officers stalked through the ranks harder they shouted keep at it who told you you could slack off what kind of soldier do you think you are unless shimizu concentrated he saw two of corporal aiso he hoped he was just as blurry to the older man his whole face felt on fire he tasted blood in his mouth and he wasnt sure whether that was blood or snot dribbling from his nose probably both aiso wasnt trying to box his ears any more than he was trying to box those of the other corporal that didnt mean they didnt get walloped now and again even shimizus palm started to sting from giving too many blows he couldnt have told how long it went on privates started falling over cursing officers kicked them nobody was trying to get away with faking not this time only when a polished boot in the belly or the spine failed to prod them to their feet were they suffered to stay on the ground at last contemptuously colonel fujikawa yelled enough corporal aiso had his arm drawn back for another blow shimizu hardly cared whether it landed or not after so many what difference did one more make but aiso stayed his hand shimizu swayed stubbornly he kept on his feet he didnt care to crumple where his squad could see him do it since most of them were still upright he would have lost face by falling he felt as if hed lost his face anyway at the same time he wished he could lose it then he wouldnt have to feel it any more go clean yourselves up colonel fujikawa commanded you are disgusting the way you look is a disgrace to the japanese army too and whose fault is that shimizu wondered blearily but he would never have said such a thing not even if the yankees were disemboweling him with a dull rusty bayonet discipline ran deep after bowing to corporal aisowho returned the courtesyshimizu gave his attention or as much of it as he had to give back to his squad all of them were on their feet now he didnt know who had fallen and then got up again he didnt intend to ask either that would make whoever might have gone down lose face the whole regiment had lost face the whole hawaii garrison had lost face what point to singling out one or two common soldiers after that heads up backs straight they marched off to the barracks once there they lined up at the sinks to wash their bloody faces rinse out their bloody mouths and soak their tunics in cold water to get the bloodstains out of them i thought my head was going to fall off shiro wakuzawa spoke with more pride than anything else we all did shimizu said the men he led nodded one by one his rank usually exempted him from such spasms of brutality not this time though he was as bruised and battered as any of them no one could say he hadnt been through it no one could say he hadnt come through it either for now he was one of them senior private furusawa said if the americans come again well be ready for them of course we will whod want to go through this more than once even after the abuse wakuzawa had taken he could still joke how could the americans come again somebody else said shimizu was splashing his face with cold waterwhich hurt and felt good at the same timeand couldnt tell who it was the soldier went on they cant try another raid like that furusawas right wed smash them flat shimizu pulled away from the faucet blowing like a whale he shook his head which made drops of water fly everywhereand which also reminded him how sore he was if the americans come again they wont just raid he said theyll run in a pack like wild dogs and theyll try to take hawaii away from us some of the soldiers in his squad nodded again others men who hurt too much for that softly said hai writing the report on how the americans had caught the japanese garrison on oahu flatfooted fell to commander mitsuo fuchida he felt more as if the duty had fallen on him before sitting down in front of a blank sheet of paper he went to pick minoru gendas brain genda was one of the few men on the island with whom he could speak frankly its not very complicated genda said they did something we didnt expect thats all you cant get ready for what you dont anticipate easy enough to say fuchida answered what do i do for the other fortynine and threequarters pages of the report though as it usually did gendas smile made him look very young you can tell general yamashita and captain hasegawa that we wont get fooled again fuchida bowed in his seat there in gendas office domo arigato he said spicing the thanks with all the sarcasm he could wed better not if we do well all have to open our bellies he wasnt joking or not very much the garrison had put itself through a painful orgy of selfreproach if it was humiliated again much more blood would flow than had this time they are going to come sniffing around these islands they havent given up the way we hoped they would genda said carrier raids submarines maybe even flying boats too we need better ways to detect them fuchida said the picket boats did their job neh genda said the skipper of that one was too hard on himself i think why blame him for not looking out for bs when nobody else did either picket boats can only do so much fuchida insisted things can sneak past them or their skippers can make mistakes yes i know we all made the mistake but we should have known what the yankees were up to before they got here how genda asked reasonably i dont know fuchida said or maybe i do have the engineers ever figured out what that installation up at opana was supposed to do before the americans wrecked it whatever it was supposed to do it didnt do it genda pointed out we caught them napping they had no idea we were there till the bombs started falling you were the one who signaled tora tora tora to show wed taken them by surprise no it was mizuki my radioman fuchida said and here i thought you were a navy man not a damn lawyer genda said i am a navy man fuchida said as a navy man i want to know about that installation i dont have a whole lot to tell you i dont think the engineers have a whole lot to tell you either genda said commander fuchida started to get angry they damn well ought to by now gendasan theyve had months to unravel it have they found documents talking about what it does genda only shrugged i dont think so they should have fuchida exclaimed if they havent the americans must have destroyed them and why would the americans destroy them because they must show the opana installation was important what other possible reason could they have youd better be careful genda said next thing you know youll hear little men who arent there talking behind your back so you think im crazy do you fuchida growled ill tell you what i want to hear i want to hear the americans who worked at that thing whatever it was theyll know and we can squeeze it out of them some of thema lot of them probablywill just be enlisted men they wont much care what they blab go ahead then find them interrogate them youre not going to be happy till you do genda said get it out of your system youll feel better then he might have been recommending a laxative i will fuchida said and youll seesomething important will come from this with another shrug genda said it could be im not convinced but it could be i hope youre right i intend to find out mitsuo fuchida said jim peterson was in a funk so were a lot of the pows up at opana theyd got less of a look at the american bombers that had raided oahu than just about anybody else on the island peterson knew why opana was nowhere it wasnt even worth flying over nothing he could do about it nothing anybody could do about it all the prisoners could do was sit behind barbed wire look out at the green countryside all around them and the blue pacific to the north and slowly starve to death he almost wished the japs would stop feeding them altogether then it would be over the way things were he felt himself losing ground a quarter of an inch at a time everything he did everything he thought about centered on the miserable breakfast and lousy supper hed got you know he said to prez mckinley one afternoon a few days after the raid i dont hardly think about women at all any more the sergeant let out a grunt peterson thought it was surprise me neither mckinley said i like pussy as well as the next guybet your ass i do but i dont think i could get it up with a crane right now same here peterson said pussys the best thing in the world when your bellys full when its not you forget about women he fooled with his belt day by day his waistline shrank he closed the belt several holes tighter than he had when he got here pretty soon even the last hole would be too loose and hed have to trade the belt for whatever he could get and use rope to hold up his pants and after a while ill have enough rope to hang myself with too he thought surprisingly few men here had killed themselves maybe they wouldnt give the japs the satisfaction mckinley looked northeast the direction from which the bs had come the direction in which the mainland lay i wonder if theyre really gonna try and take hawaii away from the japs again dont wonder if wonder when peterson said they havent forgotten about us thats one thing those bombers showed wonder if they can do it too mckinley said it was petersons turn to grunt the japs shouldnt have surprised the defenders here they had but they shouldnt have he couldnt imagine an american armada catching the new occupiers asleep at the switch how much damage could the japs do before a landing party hit the beach even if americans did land the japanese would fight like rabid weasels to hold on to what theyd taken at lineup the next morning the japanese didnt release the pows to breakfast once they had the count straight the way they usually did standing there at attention in his row peterson eyed the guards with suspicion what the devil were they up to now a nervouslooking oriental in western clothesplainly a jap from hawaiicame into the camp along with more guards and the commandant the japanese officer spoke in his own language the local turned it into english the following prisoners will make themselves known immediately the commandant handed him a piece of paper he read off half a dozen names looking confused a lieutenant and several privates stepped out of ranks peterson wondered what the hell theyd done and whether the japs were about to make a horrible example of them hed already seen enough examples to last him the rest of his life and several lifetimes yet to come but to his surprise and relief nothing dreadful happened guards came up to the men and hustled them away but that was all they didnt beat them or kick them or anything of the sort they werent gentle but peterson had a hard time imagining gentle japs they were businesslike which in itself was out of the ordinary after the handful of prisoners were taken away things went back to normal the rest of the swarm of pows queued up for breakfast they had something new to buzz about somebody not far from peterson said those guys hadnt even hardly left home before whats that supposed to mean somebody else asked they were stationed at some kind of installation right around here and this is where they ended up too the first man said small world aint it well ill be a son of a bitch peterson said as a light went on inside his head whats up sergeant mckinley asked what hed heard didnt mean thing one to him in a low voice peterson said ever hear of radar prez i dunno maybe mckinley screwed up his face in concentration some kind of fancy rangefinding gear right yeah that was as much as mckinley a born groundpounder needed to know as somebody whod got paid from flying off a carrier deck jim peterson knew a good deal more among the things he knew was they had a radar station up here at opana yeah mckinley thought about that for a little while you think the japs are gonna squeeze those guys about it wouldnt be surprised said peterson who would have bet the mortgage on it they dont know much about that stuff as far as hed heard the japanese hadnt known anything about radar it looked as if theyd figured out there was stuff they didnt know well shit mckinley said i thought those suckers were lucky on account of the guards didnt work em over right then and there shows what i know theyre gonna get the third degree from professionals arent they cant tell you for sure peterson said grimly but thats how it looks to me too he looked around you probably dont want to talk about it a whole hell of a lot you dont want to say that name either otherwise the japs may decide to find out how much you know about it well shit mckinley said again in a different tone of voice he looked around as if expecting a guard to be listening over his shoulder peterson would have worried even more about other pows knowing who could be trusted wasnt always easy mckinley nodded at least half to himself gotcha attaboy prez the chow line crawled forward as usual there wasnt enough to eat and it was lousy also as usual everybody emptiedindeed polishedhis mess kit the only thing worse than not enough food was no food at all camp rations came altogether too close to that but they werent quite there fighters on patrol buzzed overhead the japs were bound to be taking that much more seriously since the american raid peterson glanced up at the warplanes then all at once eyed them seriously goddamn he exclaimed now what prez mckinley asked peterson pointed to the fighters those arent zeros he spoke with complete authority hed earned the right by god not just through study but because a zero had knocked his wildcat out of the sky theyve got to be planes from the japanese army instead yeah and so prez didnt see the point he was shrewd no doubt about that but he really did have a noncoms narrow view of the world he was also an infantryman what happened in the air and on the water didnt mean so much to him peterson spelled things out no way in hell those couldve flown here all by themselves stinking slantyeyed bastards had to ship em in this place is like a great big old aircraft carrier right out in the middle of the pacific and the japs are sure as hell making the most of it theyll ship in planes theyll ship in gas and ammo for em theyll ship in enough chow for their own guys mckinley pointed to one of the guards sure enough the man hadnt missed any meals what does everybody else get hind tit thats what yeah peterson wondered how much more weight he could drop and still keep going he didnt know but he had little doubt hed find out by now oscar van der kirk got more envious comments than astonished ones when he assembled his sailboard on waikiki beach he wasnt the only one whod made the conversion any more several others charlie kaapu among them had imitated him he didnt mind there seemed to be enough fish to go around some of the others were using the boards more for sport than for fishing hed seen people do some pretty spectacular things the more he watched them the more he felt like doing spectacular things himself hed already tried one the first day he came in but they were outdoing him now beside oscar charlie planted his newly converted sailboards mast in its socket you were one sly haole to come up with this scheme charlie said admiringly i didnt think it would work when you started talking about it but i was wrong oscar shrugged whats being a haole got to do with it hawaiians were the ones who started this whole surfriding business in the first place that was a long time ago charlie said which seemed to make sense to him even if it didnt make a whole lot to oscar he added we were okay as long as we were just in the game against us you know what i mean but then haoles came along and you knew how to do all this stuff we couldnt and so we pretty much stopped trying to figure out new stuff on our own was that why hawaiians and hapa hawaiians were the way they were oscar had no idea a lot of them just seemed to drift without trying to make much of their lives though since oscar had spent most of the time since coming to hawaii drifting through life he couldnt very well blame them he made sure his mast was firmly seated then said lets go on out fishermen stepped aside to let them go into the surf oscar wondered if there was any beach on oahu that didnt have its complement of fishermen these days unless he missed his guess there wasnt fishing wasnt just a sport any more it was a vital part of feeding the island just like the gardens that had sprung up everywhere if you didnt have access to fish or to garden vegetables what did you get rice and not very much of it into the water he slid as usual the pacific was not too hot not too cold just right he murmured not for the first time he thought of goldilocks and the three bears he and charlie paddled out to sea guiding their surfboards over the waves till they could stand up and unfurl their sails instead this is really something you smart son of a bitch charlie called you could make sailboards for everybody in the world make yourself a million dollars he might even have been righthad oscar had the idea at another time as things were theres this little thing called the war oh yeah i remember that by the way charlie said it he hadnt remembered till oscar reminded him oscar laughed wishing that could be true he would never be able to forget those horrible moments off waimea stuck in the crossfire between the japanese invasion force and the american defenders on the shore hed never forget pissing himself in terror either not even charlie kaapu knew about that a sudden thought occurred to oscar he glanced over at his friend could charlie have done the same thing maybe wondering about it was just misery loving companybut if charlie hadnt been scared to death out there too he wasnt human ill never know for sure oscar thought i cant ask him and if he did he cant ask me either just one of those things charlie took to sailboarding as if it were his idea and not oscars that was no great surprise any surfrider could adapt to the addition of the sail pretty fast but charlie also seemed to enjoy skimming along over the waves under wind power as if hed thought of it of course charlie enjoyed everything he did if he didnt enjoy it he didnt do it you ever see that blond wahine any more after she move out he asked susie nope not lately oscar shook his head and shrugged she was fun in bed but she was kind of rugged any other way yeah well dames are like that sometimes charlie took everything in stride enjoy em while you can then kiss em goodbye hed kissed a lot of women goodbye so had oscar but charlie never let it bother him no huhu he said now it might have been his motto oscar looked back over his shoulder oahu receded behind himmuch faster than it would have before hed had his surfboard altered we ought to split up he said its not that i dont love youcharlie boomed laughter and blew him a kissbut we both ought to bring in as many fish as we can oh yeah charlie didnt argue about that hunger was something even he took seriously see you later alligator he slanted off toward the west as slick as vaseline on the sailboard am i that good oscar wondered he shrugged again he probably wasnt quite that stylish but he got the job done even so he swung a little toward the east to put as much room between himself and charlie kaapu as he could he had a pretty good day fishingnot a great day but a pretty good one he got plenty of fish for himself some for eizo doi and some to sell the japs hadnt got around to regulating sailboarders the way they did with the men who fished from sampans he could take what he didnt give to the handyman and sell it in one of the unofficial markets a little cash was always nice food that wasnt fish or rigidly rationed rice was even nicer doi bowed to him when he brought fish to the handymans cramped little shop you good fella you keep make pay the japanese man said in what was intended for english sure i do oscar said i always pay my bills that was pretty much true too sometimes he took a little longer than he might havehed had plenty of spells of living handtomouth even before the warbut he never forgot when he had money or here fish he got out of hock good good doi told him some fella even some japanese fellanot all japanese fella but some japanese fellaget sails forget make pay his face twisted as if he were smelling his fish a week from now after leaving dois oscar headed for one of the openair outfits that had been replacing grocery stores and supermarkets since the war started most of them were in the oriental part of town west of nuuanu avenue haoles came here to buy and sometimes like oscar to sell but few markets sprang up in their neighborhoods it was as if they were saying such things were good enough for japs and chinamen but not for them or maybe the asians just took to huckstering more naturally than whites did fish always went fast oscar got some cash and some fruit dietitians would probably tell him he wasnt eating a balanced diet but he didnt care he would have murdered for a big greasy hamburger and french fries but nobody except a few millionaires could get beef any more greenbacks in his pocket fruit in a cloth bag he started back toward waikiki no buses ran they had no fuel some enterprising orientals propelled pedicabs and pulled rickshaws but oscar couldnt stomach riding in something like that using a man like a draft horseeven paying a man to use himself as a draft horsestuck in his craw it didnt stop a lot of prosperous haoles it didnt stop a lot of japanese officers either of course from what oscar had seen the spca would have landed on them like an avalanche if theyd treated draft animals the way they treated their own troops and that said nothing about what happened to the american pows oscar hey oscar across the street susie higgins waved to him she was wearing an electricblue silk sun dress she sure hadnt had when she was living in his apartment speak of the devil he said and then louder hi susie he didnt know what to do or say after that most of the time he didnt need to worry about running into exgirlfriends after a fling had had its day they got on an ocean liner or a pan am clipper flying boat and that was that susie would have done the same thing but for the small detail of the japanese invasion he trotted over to the other side of the street dodging a horsedrawn wagon full of greens was a hell of a lot easier than jaywalking when a truck would just as soon knock you flat as let you cross how are you he asked adding you look good shed always looked good she looked better now shed acquired a proper hawaiian suntan which the bright blue silk only played up she cocked her head to one side and gave him a saucy smile so do yougood enough to eat in fact promises promises he said susie laughed out loud oscar knew he had to play it light if he didnt he might want to haul off and belt her and people would talk how are you doing these days he asked and then what are you doing these days im taking dictationand the accent isnt on the first syllable either you nasty man she wrinkled her nose and winked at him happens im an anumberone secretary even if all my references are back on the mainland i showed mr underhill what i could do ill bet you did oscar said again lightly she made as if to hit him he made as if to duck they both laughed this time oscar wouldnt have been surprised if she was a firstclass secretary shed be good at anything she set her mind to she sure as hell screwed as if they were going to outlaw it day after tomorrow what are you up to she asked some surfboarding lessons some sailboarding lessons you know about sailboards he waited till she nodded then struck a pose and went on with what he hoped was pardonable pride i invented em and i do some fishing and i trade the fish for other stuff you thought of sailboards susie said now oscar nodded she grinned at him thats swell ive seen some guys using them maybe ive even seen you out there on the waterwho knows like youd care oscar did his best to sound as if he was still teasing it wasnt so easy now i might susie said how do you know unless you try to find out and get slapped down for my trouble fat chance hey we had fun susie might have been challenging him to deny it and he couldnt she continued maybe we could have some more wed just start fighting again now oscar dared her to tell him he was wrong maybe we wouldnt she saidif that meant she thought he was wrong it didnt mean she thought he was very wrong hed thought he would gloat but he didnt all he said was whats wrong with the fellow youre taking dictation from even as he said it he wondered if it would make her mad it didnt she answered matteroffactly underhill hes got a chinese wife hes crazy about and three little kids it happens her shrug held all sorts of knowledge they had had funin bed anything else as hed said to charlie anything else had been trouble so did the one make up for the other maybe it did she hadnt stolen from him anyway and shed had plenty of chances he thought it over heck come along if you want to he said knowing hed probably regret it but not right away you still have that apartment in waikiki susie asked when he nodded she said why dont you come to my place instead its a lot closer okay oscar was nothing if not agreeable he was so agreeable susie made another face at him listen buster she said do you know how many guys would give their left one for an invite like that do you she sounded half joking half belligerent probably a bunch oscar answered if they start beating down the door can i go out the window youre a terrible man susie higgins scowled come on before i change my mind like you deserve her apartment was roomier than his and likely more expensive too he wondered in what coin she was paying for it but then shook his head whatever she was she wasnt a pro and she was getting by where plenty of people whod been here a lot longer were having all sorts of trouble as soon as she closed the door behind her she pulled the sun dress off over her head we had fun didnt we she repeated oscar caught her to him sure he said agreeably captain kiichi hasegawa glowered at commander minoru genda the army is being very difficult complained the senior naval officer in hawaii yes sir genda saidusually a safe answer when a superior was fuming here in my own quarters on akagi i can tell you what i really think of those people hasegawa said you wont run off at the mouth no sir genda said that was also safe when it turned out to be agreement hasegawa reached into a desk drawer and pulled out a bottle of whiskey he rummaged a little more and came up with two glasses he poured a knock for himself and another for genda sliding the second across the desk kampai he said genda echoed the toast the whiskey glided smoothly down his throat and started a small fire in his belly what can you do sir he asked i cant do a damned thing hasegawa answered general yamashita outranks me hes stubborn as an ox and not much smarter sirnow genda spoke with considerable urgencythe army and the navy have to get along here we need both services to defend the island and each needs to know what it must do and what the other will do yes yes hasegawa said it but he didnt mean it sensing as much genda spoke more urgently still the americans divided responsibility here too they didnt do a very good job of it thats one reason these islands are ours now do you want to imitate them with that he did get captain hasegawas attention hasegawa took a meditative sip from his drink and then said at least the americans had the sense to make a navy man the senior officer in the islands so thats whats eating you genda thought aloud he said nobody here can do anything about that sir the only people who can change the command setup are in tokyo dont i know it hasegawa said bitterly they dont want to listen to me they especially dont want to listen to me after the yankee bombers raided us all they want to do is bring in more soldiers and more army airplanes as if we didnt have to drag the army to hawaii kicking and screaming he gulped down the whiskey and poured himself another healthy dose trying to put the best face he could on it genda said now the army understands how important it was to seize these islands maybe hasegawa said then again maybe not too the army just has to say take this and that from japan to honolulu the army just has to say it the navy has to do it and once the men and the airplanes get here does the army worry about the food and fuel we have to haul in to keep everything the way its supposed to be not likely the army seemed to think we can bring in everything easy as you please ive been keeping track of the food situation sir genda said its not quite as bad as it was right after the surrender yes i know that hasegawa agreed things can hardly help growing here that will take care of itself once we clear the land that was planted with sugarcane and pineapple and turn it over to rice and other real crops crops people can eat but you cant plant gasoline bushes dammit genda had been keeping track of that too genda kept track of everything he could it was part of his nature when he said we have enough he put things in the best light he could we have enough to go from one routine day to the next yes hasegawa said do we have enough if we really have to fight i dont have much good to say about the yankees we licked them just the way we should have but they will never lose because they run short of things can we say the same genda wished japan could he knew she couldnt that was what this war was about getting the japanese empire the oil and the rubber and the tinthe things it needed to stay a great power he said once we win we will be able to say that it will be true then then yes now hasegawa rolled his eyes the prime minister can afford to worry about then i have to worry about now i know i am only an ignorant sea captain but the way it looks to me is if now isnt the way we want it then wont be either it looked the same way to genda he said so adding if we didnt have to keep bringing in more soldiers and more army airplanes we could bring in more supplies for whats already here instead that would serve us better in the long run we should be able to do both neh hasegawa said yes we should genda let it go at that he knewas hasegawa undoubtedly did toothe japanese didnt have enough shipping capacity to let them bring in reinforcements and fully supply them too if we could make sure american submarines didnt trouble us hasegawa looked as unhappy as genda felt the first time a us sub sank a japanese freighter it had been news a chance to complain about americas inhumanity it had happened several times since then and japan hadnt said a word acknowledging each sinking would have been the same as admitting the shoe was starting to pinch american bombers from the mainland couldnt bother hawaii american submarines setting out from the west coast had no trouble at all the army has complained that we dont stop all submarines before they make trouble for us hasegawa said let the army try it good luck to them genda burst out we do what we can we use convoys we zigzag we escort with destroyers we use all the tricks we learned in the mediterranean and the indian ocean in the last war yes i know hasegawa said unhappily they arent always enough thats because were finding out what kind of tricks the americans learned thenand since genda added captain hasegawa sent him a sour stare commander this operation is more your brainchild than anyone elsesand that includes admiral yamamoto we did everything we had to do to take these islands frankly we did more than i thought we could do why cant you be contented now two reasons sir genda answered the first is i hoped losing hawaii would knock all the spirit out of the americans and knock them clean out of the war before it really got started we can see that hasnt happened theyre still fighting they havent figured out what they want to do and how they want to do it yet and we have to hope they will take a long time before they do that leads me to the second worry taking these islands was one sort of problem holding them is a very different one oh yes hasegawa said in a voice like iron oh yes holding hawaii is the reason we have to put up with these army bumpkins genda managed a thin smile they would say taking hawaii is the reason we have to put up with these navy snobs i dont give a shit what the army says hasegawa sounded more like a bumpkin than a snob i want to be replaced ive already told tokyo as much they need to send a navy man out here who has the rank to deal with yamashita until they do that i have no faith that these islands can be held because the army will make a hash of it genda couldnt say what he was thinking not to a superior officer he would have spoken his mind with mitsuo fuchida and was pretty sure fuchida would have done the same with him but not with captain hasegawa especially since genda thought the senior navy man in hawaii had made a frightful mistake genda was sure hasegawa would be relieved of his post here hed just done his best to make himself impossible but genda didnt think the navy would send out an admiral to counterbalance the army commandant that would have to go through the cabinet and hideki tojo the prime minister was a general himself when genda didnt say anything hasegawa had to know what was in his mind the akagi s skipper didnt push him on it he just said that will be all commander yes sir genda rose saluted and left the captains cabin like any ships compartment the cabin had a heavy steel waterproof door genda closed it as gently as he could it thudded into place even so the sound of metal meeting metal seemed much more final than he would have wanted whenever major hirabayashi summoned the people of wahiawa at an unusual time jane armitage started worrying after watching mr murphy get it in the neckliterallyshe feared the jap in charge of this part of the island would offer up another object lesson one of those had been a thousand too many yosh nakayama stood up on a table to translate for hirabayashi the gardeners face was impassive as he turned the majors excited japanese into far more stolidseeming english the japanese empire announces that the island of corregidor has surrendered to imperial forces under general homma the empire also announces the fall of port moresby in new guinea he had to go back and forth with hirabayashi several times before he got that one straight jane knew where new guinea was but couldnt have said where on the island port moresby lay to save herself from hirabayashis sword she knew new guinea wasnt far from australia if the japs were taking towns there were they looking to go after the land down under next could anybody stop them up until the day she threw fletch out hed insisted that the usa could kick japan around the block shed thought he knew what he was talking about on the evidence so far hed been as misguided a soldier as he had been a husband banzai for the japanese empire nakayama said banzai the people of wahiawa said jane hated herself for joining the cheer you couldnt get out of it though bad things happened to people who tried it wasnt even safe to mouth the word without saying it out loud somebody would be watching you somebody would be listening to you you couldnt show your thoughts anywhere not if they werent the sort of thoughts the japs wanted you to have she looked around the crowd more than a few people in wahiawa had cheered when the american bombers flew over the town on their way to plaster the japanese planes at wheeler field there were missing faces these days what had happened to the men and women whod disappeared the people who knew werent talking not knowing only made their fate more frightening to everyone else and who had betrayed them obviously you were a fool to trust any of the local japanese that didnt mean none of them was trustworthy some of the younger ones really were patriotic americans but others pretended and were good at pretending finding out who belonged to which group could cost you your neck much less dangerous to think of all of them as menaces much as jane wished it did that didnt mean all whites were reliable some of them didnt even bother to hide their collaboration they at least were honestly disgusting the snakes hiding in the grass were the ones that killed when they bit though as for chinese and filipinos they barely entered into janes calculations shed had little to do with them before the war started and she still had little to do with them to her they were more nearly part of the landscape than people in their own right major hirabayashi spoke in japanese once more you can go now yosh nakayama said laconically the local commandant had probably said something like you are dismissed that was how people who ran things talked the only thing nakayama had ever run was his nursery he didnt talk fancy jane despised him less than she had when he first became hirabayashis righthand man he did what he could for wahiawa he passed on the japs orders without glorying in them and without seeming to imagine they came from him she would have thought more of him if hed chosen to have nothing to do with the major but he could have been worse she wanted to go back to her apartment put her feet up and do nothing for a while what she wanted to do and what she had to do were two different things it was back to the potato plot to weed and to pick bugs off the plants and to smash them once she had picked them off every time she looked at her hands she wanted to cry those calluses those short ragged blackrimmed nails things would have been even worse if everybody elses hands werent about the same as jane worked she watched tendons jut and muscles surge under her skin shed lost weight she didnt think she had an ounce of fat anywhere on her body but she was stronger than shed ever been in her life of course she was also working harder than she ever had in her life teaching third grade was nothing next to keeping a garden plot going somewhere not far down her family tree were farmers that was true of almost everyone now she understood why theyd gone to town and found other lines of work what she didnt understand was why anybody who didnt have to grow crops did you had to be starving or nuts to break your back like this every day didnt you on her way to the plot two japanese soldiers came up the sidewalk toward her she stepped aside and bowed as they tramped past they walked by as if she didnt exist that was better than when they leered when they leered she had all she could do not to run away there hadnt been a lot of rapes in wahiawa but there had been some one of the women had had the courage to protest to major hirabayashi afterwards it hadnt done her any good nobody was going to punish the japs for anything they did to locals once jane was weeding with her head down she felt a little safer not only was she less visible but other locals were around her they would squawk if japanese soldiers tried to drag her away how much those squawks would help she tried not to think about that in fact she tried not to think about anything if she didnt think she could get through a minute at a time an hour at a time a day at a time whatever happened it would simply be gone and with most of what happened these days it was better that way as usual jiro takahashi was by himself when he took fish up to the japanese consulate he wished hiroshi or kenzo would come with him but he didnt try to talk them into it hed given up on trying to talk them into anything that had anything to do with politics or with the war their ideas were as fixed as his that wasnt precisely how he looked at it of course to him they were a pair of stubborn young fools he bowed to the guards outside the building they returned the courtesy its the fisherman one of them said what have you got today fisherman anything especially good he licked his lips laughing jiro shook his head just some ahi it was a pretty slow run out there on the ocean ahi is good the guard said not that we ever get more than a mouthfuland not even that very often eh boys the other japanese soldiers mournfully nodded agreement ah too bad jiro sounded sympathetic but he wasnt much surprised no doubt consul kita and chancellor morimura kept what they wanted from the presents he brought only when they were satisfied would any go to the people who made them safer and more comfortable that wasnt very nice but it was the way the world worked it always had been and it probably always would be well its not your fault the guard said and bowed again go on in he stepped aside one of the other soldiers opened the door for takahashi inside the consulate a secretary smiled to see him good day takahashi san the man said would you like to say hello to the consul yes please if hes not too busy jiro answered if he is i can leave the fish with the chancellor he wouldnt entrust them to an underling like this fellow with food in hawaii so tight these days that was asking to have some of his gift disappear before the people for whom it was intended ever saw it well hes talking with a reporter from the nippon jiji the secretary answered let me ask him what he wants to do please excuse me for a moment he got up and went into a back room when he returned he was smiling kitasan says please join him come with me ah takahashisan the japanese consul said when the fisherman walked into his office he turned to the reporter who wore a westernstyle sport jacket with a gaudy print morisan you ought to be talking to this fellow not to me hed have some interesting stories to tell you i can guarantee that would he the reporter turned in his chair and looked takahashi over hello there im ichiro mori i write for the nippon jiji oh yes very pleased to meet you morisan jiro dipped his head ive seen your name in the paper many times you flatter me mori had an easygoing voice and a ready grin he was the sort of man you couldnt help liking at first sight so youre a takahashi eh whats your first name jiro takahashi answered and the other manwho was a few years younger than hewrote it down how long have you been in hawaii takahashisan mori asked more than thirty years now ah so desu thats a long time where were you born somewhere not far from hiroshima by the way you talk hai jiro nodded yamaguchi prefecture i call my sampan the oshima maru after the county i come from i learned to be a fisherman there my father took a boat out onto the inland sea have you been fishing ever since you got here then oh no i worked in the sugar fields thats what they brought us over to do i had to save my money for a long time before i could buy a boat and get away jiro laughed reminiscently they werent very happy about itthey didnt want cane pickers leaving but id met my contract so they couldnt keep me you settled down here you have family im a widower jiro said and no more about that after a brief pause he added i have two sons do they speak japanese i hope the reporter asked some of the people born here cant say a word in what should be their own language not my boys pride rang in takahashis voice i made sure they learned it good thats very good mori scribbled notes and youre happy the way things have turned out here are your sons happy too jiro glanced over to nagao kita the consul was from japan would he want to hear that hiroshi and kenzo thought of themselves as americans not likely jiro didnt want to hear it himself he spoke of his own views first would i bring fish here if i werent happy that let him think about what he would say next my sons work too hard to worry much about politics hard work is always good mori agreed what did you think when the rising sun came to hawaii i was proud jiro answered his boys hadnt been proud he didnt think the gulf between them would ever close he added i waved a flag in the victory parade the soldiers made a brave show so you were there for the parade what did you think of all the yankee prisoners werent you happy to see that their day in the sun was over what did i think jiro wondered mostly hed been amazed hed never imagined filthy ragged beaten american pows shambling through honolulu the japanese soldiers who were guarding them certainly were a lot sharper he said i told you i was proud of all they had done they were heroes for the emperor heroes for the emperor ichiro mori echoed beaming he turned to consul kita thats a good phrase isnt it hai very good kita agreed takahashisan has a way with words oh no not really the fishermans modesty was altogether unfeigned can you stay for a little while please mori asked him id like to call a photographer over here and get your picture a photographer my picture for the newspaper jiro said and the reporter nodded in a daze takahashi nodded back hed never imagined such a thing hed never thought of himself as important enough to land in a newspaper he read the nippon jiji reading about himself in it he felt himself swelling up with pride this would show his boys the photographer got there in about twenty minutes he was a wisecracking fellow named yukiro yamaguchi he took photos of jiro by himself with the fish hed brought with consul kita and with the consul and the fish by the time he got done popping flashbulbs green and purple spots danced in front of jiros eyes blinking to try to clear his sight he bowed to yamaguchi thank you very much no huhu buddy the photographer answered casually dropping a hawaiian word into his japanese no huhu at all kenzo takahashi had never paid a whole lot of attention to honolulus japanese papers like most people his age he preferred the starbulletin and the advertiser to nippon jiji and hawaii hochi all papers had shrunk since the war the englishlanguage ones much more than their japanese counterparts not surprisingly the occupiers gave what woodpulp there was to papers that would back their line a hundred percent but when kenzo saw his father staring out at him from the front page of the nippon jiji he spent a dime to get a copythe paper had gone up since the fighting started too sure as hell there was dad holding an ahi and clasping the japanese consuls hand kenzo didnt tell the newsboy he was related to the man in the paper the kid a few years younger than he was might have hated him or he might have congratulated him and that would have been worse what the devil had dad said kenzo had no trouble reading the japanese as he walked along he hadnt much wanted to learn ithe would rather have had fun after american school let outbut hed conscientiously gone and done it as hiroshi had before him and hed lived in a neighborhood where there were so many japanese signs and posters and ads that he couldnt very well forget it once he had learned now he wished he had there was his father praising the emperor praising the courage of the japanese soldiers whod conquered hawaii saying hed been proud of the victory parade and telling the world the american soldiers theyd paraded with them were a bunch of decrepit wrecks he also had good things to say about the way japan was running hawaii and about the greater east asia coprosperity sphere oh dad kenzo said wishing hed never seen the picture never bought the paper oh dad maybe it wasnt treason maybe but if it wasnt it sure came close kenzo wondered how many words the reporter had put in his old mans mouth would his father recognize the greater east asia coprosperity sphere if it trotted over and bit him in the leg maybe he would at that hed talked about it once the greater east asia coprosperity sphere damn well had bitten all of hawaii in the leg and wouldnt let go and here was dad a smiling propaganda tool for the occupiers he couldnt have known what he was doing he must have said the first things that popped into his head when the reportermori that was the lousy snakes nameasked him questions but how it had happened didnt much matter now that it had happened did kenzo started to crumple up the nippon jiji and throw it in the trash he started to but he didnt instead he carefully folded the paper and put it in the back pocket of his dungarees one of the things that no longer came into honolulu harbor was toilet tissue he could put that miserable story to good use not the picturehed tear that out first but the story hell yes and the soft pulp paper would be an improvement on the scratchy coated stuff they put in the outhouses by the botanical garden oh jesus christ kenzo muttered deliberately ignoring how much he sounded like his father when he said it to think hed been reduced to worrying about how he could comfortably wipe his ass before december he would have taken the answer for granted before december hed taken all kinds of answers for granted what did that prove it proved hed been pretty goddamn dumb that was what here came a squad of japanese soldiers kenzo got out of their way and bowed by now he did that automatically but he couldnt help noticing that one of them was reading a copy of the nippon jiji how could he when the soldier held it open to read an inside page so dads picture was right there looking out at him what did the soldiers think when they read a piece like the one ichiro mori had written did it make them think all the people who lived on hawaii were glad theyd come or did they just go oh more crap had they seen so much of this garbage that they recognized it for what it was kenzo didnt know he hoped all the people who saw the story wiped their asses with it then they would forget about it if the usa got hawaii back people who said stuff like this would be remembered dumb as dad was kenzo didnt want that xii fletch armitage looked longingly past the barbed wire surrounding kapiolani park waikiki was almost close enough to reach out and touch honolulu wasnt much farther if i could get past the wire escape was a pows duty hed had that drilled into him but even the geneva convention let garrisons that recaptured escaped prisoners punish them and the japs cared as much about the geneva conventions rules as a bunch of drunks in a barroom brawl cared about the marquis of queensberrys theyd already made that very very clear and so fletch looked a mynah flew over the barbed wire the scrounging was bound to be better on the other side fletch had never dreamt he could be so jealous of a stupid noisy bird after a little while he turned away contemplating freedom just hurt too much he laughed not that there was much to laugh about in one sense of the word there was no such thing as freedom anywhere in the territory of hawaii and there hadnt been since the surrender in another sense fletch would gladly have traded places with anybody outside the camp he didnt think anybody out beyond the wire would gladly have traded with him he mooched back toward his tent a slow brownian motion was always on display in the camp some prisoners who had nothing else to do would drift toward the wire to get a glimpse of what things were like out beyond it others having seen as much as they could stand sadly drifted into the interior once more you never could tell where any one man would be but the traffic pattern hardly ever changed here and there pows bent over a card game or a makeshift checkerboard or a race between two or three crawling bugsanything to make the time go by most of the captives though just sat around letting it go by as it would a lot of them were too hungry to have the energy for anything unessential they came fully alive twice a day at breakfast and supper and banked their fires the rest of the time im not far from that myself fletch contemplated his own hand he ignored the filth nobody here could get as clean as he wanted what he noticed were the bones and tendons thrusting up against the skin the flesh that had softened his outlines melted off him day by day leaving only the basics behind he saw the same thing on other mens faces which displayed more and more of the hard uplands of nose and cheekbones and chin as time went by no doubt the same was true of his own mug but he didnt get to see that very often not seeing himself was a small mercy in a place singularly lacking larger ones something to cherish ducking into the tent was another small mercy if he stayed outside for very long he burned oahu never got too hot but sunlight here was fiercer than it was anywhere on the mainland because it was more nearly vertical back before the fighting started hed gone through a lot of zincoxide ointment it hadnt helped much but nothing else had helped at all since then he hadnt had much choice some guys tanned almost nativehawaiian brown fletch just scorched over and over again he didnt have to wait till after sundown to emerge though thoughts of bela lugosi crossed his mind every now and then the sun was sinking toward waikiki as he came out to line up for supper that was funny if you looked at it the right way people in honolulu often used waikiki as a synonym for east the same as they used ewa for west but now hed moved far enough waikiki of honolulu that waikiki was ewa of him pows gossiped in the chow line almost as they would have back at schofield barracks what energy they had came out now they were hungry but they knew theyd soon be less hungry for a little while anyway somebody behind fletch said do the japs really feed you better if you go out on a work detail fletch pricked up his ears hed heard the japs did that too theyd damn near have to they couldnt expect to get much work out of people who ate only the horrible slop they dished out here another prisoner answered yeah they do but only if you meet their work norms and they set those fuckers so high you do more shit to meet em than they give you extra food sounds like the japs the first man said fletch found himself nodding it sure as hell did the russians had a name for workers who went over their norms some of the leftwingers at schofield barracks had used it now and again what the hell was it fletch scowled trying to remember stasomething he snapped his fingers stakhanovites that was it feeling smart was almost as good as feeling full after supper fletch shook his head feeling full would have been better but feeling smart was almost as good as feeling not quite so empty which was the most camp rations could achieve after the morning count a local japanese came into camp and speaking good english did indeed call for volunteers for work details he got them more than he could use lots of men figured things were so bad here they had to be better somewhere else fletch wasnt convinced here he ate next to nothing but he also did next to nothing if he ate a little more but did a lot more wouldnt he just waste away all the faster that was how it looked to him the japs had boasted about their victories in the philippines and new guinea taking hawaii had let them run wild farther west and had kept the united states from doing one damn thing about it fletch could see that very clearly but the usa hadnt given up the bs that had visited honolulu were proof of that sooner or later he was convinced the americans would try to retake hawaii he wanted to be around when they did if that meant sitting around on his can doing very little and eating very little then it did that was all hed been in more than enough poker games to know that bucking the odds was the fastest way to lose from where he sat going out on a work detail looked to be bucking the odds how many of those who went would come back ma armitage hadnt raised her boy to be a fool fletch hoped she hadnt anyway corporal aiso wagged a finger in takeo shimizus face be careful when you go out on patrol the veteran warned somethings in the air dont trust any of the locals dont even trust the local japanese some of them are like bananas bananas shimizu scratched his head kiyoshi aiso nodded hai bananas yellow on the outside white on the inside they may look like us but they think like americans ah so desu now i understand bananas shimizu wondered whod come up with that it was pretty funny aiso might have been reading his mind you may laugh now but you wont if you run into trouble and dont go wandering off by yourself or let your men do anything dumb like that somebody knocked a soldier over the head and stole his rifle the other day my men and i will be careful shimizu promised why did the americans want a japanese rifle even after all the sweeps weve done i think this little island has more small arms on it than all of japan put together i wouldnt be surprised aiso said whoever slugged the soldier was probably after him first and took the rifle as an afterthought shimizu nodded that made sense he warned his squad the same way the older corporal had warned him the men all looked attentive he looked like that whenever a superior addressed him too he knew it didnt necessarily mean anything half the time hed been thinking about something else no matter what his face said half the squad was likely to be thinking about something else now lets go shimizu barked and off they went they made a fine martial spectacle backs straight helmets all just so bayonets gleaming in the sun locals scrambled to get out of their way and bowed as they tramped past people of japanese blood did it right the others they obeyed the requirement but they still didnt really understand what they were doing back and forth went shimizus gaze trouble might come from anywhere aiso had said if somebodyd been braveor foolhardyenough to take on a fully armed japanese soldier the other noncom was right too shimizu wondered whether the attacker had killed the soldier shimizu hoped so as much for the mans sake as for any other reason anyone who suffered a disgrace like that was better off dead a policeman escorted a fisherman with a string of silvery fish along the street otherwise he would have been a real candidate for getting clobbered the policeman was white the fisherman japanese because of his job the policeman retained the pistol hed worn before honolulu changed hands but like anyone else here he bowed when the japanese soldiers marched by senior private furusawa said i still dont like seeing americans walking around with guns policemen dont worry me too much shimizu said theyre watchdogs not wolves theyll do what the people in charge of them tell them to doand were the people in charge of them now hai furusawa said that wasnt agreement it was only acknowledgment that he heard the corporal shimizu knew as much he shrugged ever so slightly furusawa didnt have to agree with him the senior private did have to stay polite and he had cars sat next to the curb quite a few of them on flat tires hardly any rolled down the street these days fuel was too short for that even seeing them immobilized though reminded shimizu of how different hawaii was from japan honolulu wasnt anywhere near as big as hiroshima but it boasted far more automobiles they were perhaps the most prominent mark of american wealth the corporal shrugged again who cares how rich the yankees were we beat them anyway they were easier to beat because they were rich it made them soft men set above shimizu had said that a great many times theyd said it so often they undoubtedly believed it he wasnt so sure the americans hed fought hadnt shown any signs of softness theyd lost but nobody could say they hadnt fought hard everything seemed quiet this morning that was the idea behind patrolling marching through honolulu making the japanese presence felt was the best way to stop trouble before it started remind the locals that the army was keeping an eye on them and they wouldnt get gay leave them alone and who could say what might happen a pretty woman with yellow hair bowed as the soldiers went by the light cotton dress she wore covered much less of her than would have been proper back in japan several of shimizus men gave her a thorough inspection he looked her over himself if they decided to drag her into a building and enjoy her one after another who could stop them nobody the fright on her face as she bowed said she knew it too keep going you lugs shimizu said maybe another time a couple of the soldiers sighed but they obeyed honolulu hadnt been treated as roughly as chinese towns were when they fell and shimizu a goodnatured man preferred his women willing it was midafternoon when they headed back toward the barracks nothing much had happened on patrol which didnt break shimizus heart he approved of routine while he was prowling the streets anything that wasnt routine was too likely to be messy and dangerous getting back in the company of lots of japanese soldiers felt good it meant he didnt have to look over his shoulder and wonder whether all hell would break loose when he rounded the next corner so he thought anyway till a freighttrain noise in the air made him throw himself flat his body recognized that sound before his mind didand before the incoming shell burst less than a hundred meters away most of his men hit the dirt too few whod met artillery forgot it in a hurry another shell crashed down by the barracks and another and another only after the third or fourth burst did shimizu wonder where they were coming from out of the south by the sound but what lay south of honolulu the pacific nothing else submarine someone shouted his voice half heard through the crashing impacts and the screams of wounded men submarine shimizu swore i should have thought of that myself a sub could sneak close to shore surface use its deck gun against whatever it felt like shooting up and then disappear under the sea again that had hardly crossed shimizus mind before the shelling stopped he cautiously raised his head ready to flatten out again in a hurry if more rounds roared in but the bombardment did seem to be over he looked around the men in his own squad were scrambling to their feet none of them seemed more than scratched not all the japanese by the barracks were so lucky injured soldiers went on shrieking their pain up to the uncaring tropical sky and others werent men at all any more but disjointed chunks of meat someones foot lay only a couple of meters from shimizu the body from which the foot had come was nowhere to be seen men who hadnt been hurt started bandaging their comrades and tying off bleeding wounds with tourniquets to try to keep people alive till doctors could see to them the barracks had taken a beating too windows were shattered walls had holes in them the building didnt seem to be burning shimizu wondered why dumb luck was the only thing that occurred to him he looked out toward the ocean he saw no submarine but it wouldnt have surfaced for a second longer than it had to it was bound to be underwater now crawling away after striking its blow a few minutes later airplanes started buzzing over the ocean south of honolulu one of them dropped a stick of bombsor would they be depth charges even distant explosions set shimizus nerves on edge he wondered whether that pilot had really seen something or was blowing things up just to be blowing them up either way hed never know shiro wakuzawa came up to him sounding surprisingly cheerful the youngster said one good thing corporalsan what shimizu asked what could be good about a mess like this simple corporal its not our fault wakuzawa answered whatever they do they cant blame this on us poor soldiers the navy hai us iye he shook his head if they cant blame it on us they cant make us wallop each other on account of it you hope they cant anyway if they want to bad enough they can do whatever they please shimizu said private wakuzawa looked alarmedand had reason to shimizu went on but i think youre right this ones the navys fault im glad im in khaki right now when general yamashita summoned captain tomeo kaku to iolani palace to confer with him captain hasegawas replacement askedordered reallyminoru genda to accompany him genda understood that he sympathized with it his superior was brandnew here and naturally wanted someone along who sympathized with his side of things to say nothing of someone famous for having facts at his fingertips all the same commander genda could have done without the honor had the navy sunk the american submarine things wouldnt have been so bad the enemy would have paid for his daring but there was no sign that the yankees had paid even a sen that one flier had bombed what he thought was a sub afterwards though thered been no oil slick and no floating debris odds were hed attacked a figment of his excited imagination up the stairs to the palace entrance trudged captain kaku he was a stumpy man with bulldog features less friendly and casual than hasegawa one pace to the rear one pace to the left commander genda followed him the guardsarmy menat the top of the stairs gave grudging halfhearted salutes they werent quite insolent enough to be called on it but their attitude still stung they might as well have shouted that navy men deserved no better kaku affected not to notice because he chose to do that genda had to match his selfcontrol it wasnt easy despite his slight stature genda was a fiercely proud man what can we do kaku murmured as they walked into the entry hall we deserve to be mocked first those bombers and now this he let out a long sad sigh hed taken over for captain hasegawa only the day before the submarine raid but plainly saw it as his fault they went up the koawood staircase to king kauakalas library the last time genda was in the room he and mitsuo and fuchida and a couple of army officers had asked princess abigail kawananakoa if she wanted to become queen of hawaii as far as genda knew plans for reviving the monarchy hadnt gone any further after she said no someone needed to keep working on that other potential sovereigns were out there but the monarchy could wait now major general tomoyuki yamashita sat behind king kauakalas ponderous desk yamashita was a ponderous man himself and only looked more massive looming over that formidable piece of furniture he had set one chair in front of the desk intending to leave captain kaku out there alone and vulnerable to take whatever he felt like dishing out the general shot genda a baleful glance genda wondered whether yamashita would order him out or make him stand by yamashitas scowl he was thinking about one or the other but he must have decided either would have been too raw grudgingly he pointed to another of the leatherbacked chairs against the wall genda set it beside the one meant for captain kaku the two navy officers sat down together well yamashita growled what do you bunglers have to say for yourselves if it werent for our bungling sir you wouldnt be sitting where you are right now genda said now yamashita looked at him as if he were a bug in the rice bowl if that submarine had decided to aim for this building i could have been killed sitting where i am right now i am very sorry about that general captain kaku said submarines are hard to detect and hard to hunt that makes them good for nuisance raids like the one the other day i am glad the boat did not turn its gun this way genda wouldnt have missed general yamashita he didnt think kaku would have either the forms had to be observed though too much truth was destructive of discipline how do you propose to make sure this sort of outrage doesnt happen again yamashita demanded aside from the damage it does look at the propaganda it hands the americans so sorry general kaku repeated the americans had handed yamashita a stick and he was using it to beat the navy we are increasing patrols sir genda put in the new kawanishi hk flying boats will help they have much longer range and greater endurance than the hks theyre replacing were flying them out of the pearl city base that the yankees set up for their pan american clipper planes there are no guarantees sir kaku added but they do have a better chance than anything else weve got theyre heavily armed too genda said if they spot a sub they also have a good chance of sinking it he paused for some quick mental calculations then nodded to himself they might even be able to reach the us mainland from here that would pay the yankees back for what they did to us if we could drop bombs on san francisco say hed captured yamashitas imagination hed hoped he could could they get there and back the general asked it would be right on the edge of their range if they took off from here genda answered they could do it more easily if we had a submarine out in the pacific to refuel them could you arrange that with tokyo yamashita asked suddenly eager genda and kaku looked at each other neither one smiled possibly kaku said it might take some persuading but possibly if you would add your voice yamashitasan that would be bound to help genda still didnt smile though how he didnt he couldnt have said after what the americans had done here tokyo would leap at the chance to strike back he was sure of that regaining lost face would appeal to the navy and army both major general yamashita nodded you may be sure that i will once captain kaku and genda were out on the lawn outside the palace the new skipper of the akagi did smile in relief that went better than i hoped it would he said thank you very much commander my pleasure sir genda answered with a polite bow jim peterson didnt need long after volunteering for an outside work detail to realize hed made a mistake hed thought nothing could be worse than the pow camp by opana that only proved hed been sadly lacking in imagination he and his fellow suckers were set to work repairing a stretch of the kamehameha highway the japs had graders and bulldozers if they hadnt brought their own they had the ones theyd captured here they didnt want to use them maybe they were short on fuel maybe they just wanted to find a new way to give their prisoners hell the whys didnt really matter the what did the pows had picks and shovels and hods and mattocks and other hand tools they broke rock they carried rock they flattened chunks of rock till they had a roadway at first theyd all been eager to show the japs what they could do that hadnt lasted long soon sense prevailed and they started doing as little as they could get away with that didnt mean they didnt work oh nofar from it the jap guards were harder on them than the whipcracking overseers in gone with the wind were on the slaves peterson had no trouble figuring out why either if a slave died his owner was out a considerable investment if a pow died here well so what plenty more where he came from there was more food at the start and end of each day nobody could have done hard physical labor on what the japs fed pows in camp trouble was there wasnt enough more food to make up for the labor the men on the work detail did every day petersons ribs seemed to stand out more distinctly and he had to keep an eye on everybody else in his shooting squad the jap whod come up with that scheme had to be a devil who got up and sharpened his horns every morning the way ordinary men shaved if anybody took off for the tall timber the whole squad bought the farm you couldnt believe the japs were kidding either theyd shoot nine guys because one had run hell theyd laugh while they were doing it too peterson particularly worried about a fellow named walter london london had been skinny the first time peterson set eyes on him back in the camp unlike most pows he hadnt got any skinnier he was an operator a guy who could come up with things like cigarettes or aspirins for a price always for a price he looked out for number oneand there was no number two in his book that made him dangerous he wouldnt care what happened to the rest of the shooting squad not if hed disappeared over the horizon before anybody knew he was gone everybody watched him everybody watched everybody else but everybody especially watched him he noticed of course only a fool wouldnt have walt london might have beenprobably wasa slimy son of a bitch but he was nobodys fool one morning he asked how come i cant even take a dump by myself without somebody handing me some leaves to wipe my ass the other members of the shooting squad looked at one another for a few seconds nobody seemed to want to take the bull by the horns then peterson did that way we know well have the pleasure of your company after you pull up your pants walter london donned a look of injured innocence he might have practiced in front of a mirror i dont know what youre talking about he said now petersons voice went cold and flat you lie like a wet rag anybody with two brain cells to rub together would know what im talking about you may be a bastard but youre not a jerk if you start pretending you are is it any wonder nobody trusts you im not gonna bail out on you guys london protested see you did know what i was talking about after all how about that petersons sarcasm flayed walter london turned red peterson didnt care he drove his point home but youre right youre not gonna bail out because were not gonna let you if you get away you kill all nine of us but if you try and get away and we catch you you dont need to worry about the japs well goddamn well kill you ourselves isnt that right boys he got nods from the rest of the shooting squad he wore only the corporals stripes hed earned not long before the american defense on oahu collapsed but he still talked like an officer he knew how to lead the others responded to that even if they didnt quite know what they were responding to hate blazed from walter londons eyes peterson looked back at him with nothing at all in his own london wiltedunder the hate lay fear honest to god im not going anywhere he said push him too hard now peterson judged and he might bolt for the sake of getting everybody else shot with a broad insincere smile of his own peterson said okay sure thing later one of the other men in the shooting squad a pfc named gordy braddon sidled up to him and said that asshole still wants to cut out on us yeah i know peterson said well watch him if he does try and disappear well nab him too im not about to let a punk like that put me in my grave braddon had tawny hair a longjawed face and an accent that said he came from kentucky or tennessee his chuckle sounded distinctly cadaverous you bet you wont on account of the japs wont bother throwin you in one if they shoot you cause london goes south all the more reason not to let him then peterson said braddon chuckled again and slipped away nights were bad the rest of the shooting squad had to keep watch on walter london that meant giving up part of their own sleep when they were desperately weary london proved how shrewd he was if hed kept complaining and kicking up a fuss the other men would have been sure they were doing the right thing he didnt he didnt say boo in fact he just slept like a baby himself he might have been saying if you want to waste your time fine go ahead i dont intend to waste mine that was a damned effective way to take revenge fighting to keep his own eyes open watching the other pows snoring away in the middle of the night peterson hated him right back if london were square he wouldnt have needed to waste his time like this yeah and if ifs and buts were candied nuts wed all have a hell of a christmas he felt the exhaustion less in the nighttime than he did the next day one morning when he was particularly frazzled braddon handed him three or four small greenish fruitsthey couldnt have been much above the size of his thumbnailand said here chew on these peterson did they were bitter enough to make his face pucker up what the hell are they he asked wondering if the other man was playing a nasty practical joke on him coffee beans braddon answered stuff grows wild here oh yeah peterson let the juice run down his throat sure as hell his heart started beating faster and his eyes opened up admiringly he asked how the devil did you recognize em my ma kept tryin to grow em in memphis braddon said didnt work winters are mild but they arent that mild every time we got a hard frost itd kill em off but she kept after it ma did hell for all i know shes still tryin damn peterson said reverently he couldnt remember the last time hed had coffee not too long after december he was sure of that since hed gone so long without the stuff kicked him hard now almost like benzedrine he felt like a new man and the new man felt ready to go out there and bust his ass it wouldnt lasthe was sure of thatbut hed make the most of it while it was there flying aboard one of the three kawanishi hks that droned east and north through the darkness awed commander mitsuo fuchida part of his excitement was over the mission the americans had dared to strike at hawaii from the air now japan would pay the same kind of visit to the us mainland some good kami must have taken hold of minoru gendas tongue when he proposed the raid to general yamashita it was the perfect way to pay the yankees back for their insolence as soon as fuchida heard about it he knew he had to come along and here he was heading straight for north america the rest of the awe was devoted to the plane in whose copilots seat he flew the hk was quite simply the best flying boat in the world and nothing else came close the airplane was about threequarters the size of one of the china clippers that had traveled from the us west coast to hong kong and macao but it was half again as fast as they were it cruised at better than kilometers an hour and could get up over at top speed it packed a wallop too along with the bombs waiting in the bomb bay it carried five mm cannon and five more machine guns any us fighter that jumped an hk was liable to get a very nasty surprise not only that the flying boat unlike a lot of japanese planes was well protected with selfsealing fuel tanks in the hull and a good fireextinguishing system as far as fuchida could see the designers had thought of everything he said as much to the pilot who sat to his left lieutenant kinsuke muto grinned a crooked grin oh they did fuchidasan muto said the only trouble was it took them a while or the plane would have been in service a long time ago i heard something about this last year but not too much fuchida said i was busy training for the hawaii operation tell me more please busy ill bet you were sirjust a little muto laughed out loud then went on well you know we wanted something better than the hk faster with longer range and a plane that wouldnt catch fire the first time a bullet came anywhere near it he laughed again not that it was funny attacks against the dutch east indies and new guinea had shown that the hk turned into a torch when the enemy started shooting at it fuchida leaned forward in his seat to lay a gentle hand on the instrument panel in front of him we have what we wanted too hai we donow lieutenant muto stressed the last word but it wasnt easy the first flight tests showed the beast was unstable at takeoff and a disaster on the water generally they had to do a total redesign on the lower hull and it set them back for months ah is that what the trouble was fuchida said i knew there was a delay but i dont think i ever heard why it was worth waiting for thoughthe plane handles beautifully on the water now i saw that when we took off from pearl city muto snorted hardly a tough test sir the water inside pearl harbor is going to be calm no matter what but wait till you see this baby out on the open ocean its just as good there you know best fuchida said he had a hasty familiarization with the hk hed been bound and determined to come on this mission but he hadnt wanted to be dead weight while he was along the radioman brought tea to fuchida and muto he hesitated for a moment wondering which man to serve first fuchida had the higher rank but muto sat in the pilots chair the two of them pointed to each other they both laughed give it to mutosan fuchida said hes the captain of this ship im just excess baggage muto took a cup of tea a moment later fuchida had one too he looked out the window there was nothing much to see only black ocean below and dark blue sky above he couldnt spot the other two flying boats he was in the leader while they trailed his plane to either side after sipping fuchida asked how long till we reach the mainland another couple of hours lieutenant muto answered long before then though well use the yankees radio stations to home in on our target oh yes of course fuchida nodded i did the same thing with the honolulu stations when we hit pearl harbor they even told me the weather was good that must have been handy you speak english then muto said i speak some yes fuchida told him and it was very handy id been wondering how to find out what sort of cloud cover they had down there it would have made a difference in how high we flew id been wonderingand the americans went and told me i hope they do it again san francisco can be a foggy town i hear muto said i dont want to have to drop my bombs any old place i want to hit something worthwhile in the harbor there dont worry the americans will be chattering away fuchida promised they dont have anything that can reach hawaii from the mainland and get back so of course they wont think we have anything that can reach the mainland from hawaii lieutenant muto grinned at him surprise hai mitsuo fuchida grinned back on they went the throbbing of the four mitsubishi fourteencylinder radial engines seemed to penetrate fuchidas bones he flew the plane for a couple of minutes when muto got up to answer a call of nature he knew hed be doing more on the way back even in a speedy hk san francisco was ten hours from honolulu he held course and altitude that he could do and do well enough he wouldnt have wanted to be at the controls if american fighters attacked the flying boat or if he had to put it down at sea muto returned and took over again fuchida leaned back in his chair he could doze if he wanted to he did for a while to stay fresh for the return flight then the radioman hurried up with something written on a scrap of paper the number had to be the new course for san francisco muto glanced down at it nodded murmured arigato and swung the planes nose a little to the north our navigation was pretty good fuchida said seeing how small a correction he made not bad muto agreed he pointed out through the forward window demons take me if thats not the california coast sleepiness fell from fuchida like a discarded cloak he leaned out and peered into darkness sure enough those lights ahead marked the edge of landthe edge of a continent dreaming it was immune from war he laughed softly this is what the americans call blackout theyll get better at it once weve been here and gone i expect muto laughed too of course that will be a little too late fuchida had heard that german submarines were having a field day sinking freighters silhouetted against the bright lights of the us east coast he hadnt known whether to believe it he did now a few minutes later the flying boats approached san francisco from the south an english phrase occurred to fuchida lit up like a christmas tree the city probably wasnt so bright as it would have been in peacetime but it was plenty bright enough fuchida said the harbor is on the eastern side of the city on the bay not here by the ocean yes i know muto answered and then spoke over the intercom to the bombardier are you ready we are going into the bombing run ready yes sir the reply sounded in fuchidas earphones as well as mutos nobody on the ground paid any attention to the three flying boats no searchlights tried to spear them no antiaircraft fire came up at them if anyone had any idea at all that they were there he had to assume they belonged to the usa a street that ran diagonally through the heart of san francisco guided them straight to the harbor not even the piers with warships tied up alongside them were properly blacked out fuchida grinned weve caught them napping again he thought but then the grin slipped two could play at this gamethe yankee bs and the us submarine had surprised the japanese in hawaii bombs free the bombardier exclaimed the hk grew livelier as it got lighter but to a much smaller degree than fuchidas bn had over pearl harbor the flying boat was a far heavier plane fuchida hoped the other two japanese aircraft were also bombing he couldnt tell he had a good forward view but not to the side or behind lieutenant muto swung the flying boat in a sharp turn back toward hawaii i think fuchidasan weve just worn out our welcome he said hai honto fuchida agreed gravely hits we have hits that wasnt the bombardierit was the rear gunner who manned the mm cannon in the tail turret of all the crew he had the best view of what was going on behind the hk a moment later he added the other two planes still have bombs left theyre unloading them on the city good very good muto said the americans think theyre immune from war they need to learn theyre not after the flying boats dropped their bombs a few antiaircraft guns did start shooting none of the bursts came anywhere near the japanese planes lieutenant muto whooped exultantly so did the radioman as the california coast vanished behind the hks he said the yankees will never catch us now mitsuo fuchida was less sure of that than his comrades they didnt know about the interrogations of the us soldiers from the strange installation near opana the usa had a way to track planes through the air electronically fuchida gathered his own country was also working on such devices but japan didnt have them up and running yet if one was operating anywhere near san francisco it might guide fighters after the flying boats he shrugged if that happened it happened even if it did fighters wouldnt have an easy time finding the hks in the darkness and the japanese planes though slower and less maneuverable than us fighters were armed well enough to give a good account of themselves the danger of pursuit shrank with each passing minute fighters had only limited range if they wanted to get home again they couldnt go too far out to sea the flying boats on the other hand muto leaned back in his seat copilot would you like to hold this course for a few hours and let me grab a little sleep of course my pleasure fuchida admired the smooth way muto gave orders to a superior officer good domo arigato muto said wake me at once if theres any trouble of course or when the radioman picks up the signal from the i ill do that fuchida promised most sincerely yes indeed trying to land the flying boat on the pacific was the last thing he wanted to do muto closed his eyes he started snoring inside a few minutes fuchida admired him again this time for his coolness fuchida kept an eye on the compass and the airspeed indicator and the altimeter he held the course muto had given him every minute put san francisco five and a half kilometers farther behind the flying boat honolulu five and a half kilometers closer too bad so many kilometers lay between them he was proud that their navigation to the us mainland had worked out so well the flight wouldnt have been easy by daylight let alone with most of it at night fuchida laughed three japanese flying boats would have got a rather warmer reception if theyd appeared over san francisco with the sun still in the sky in any case the round trip between honolulu and san francisco was about twenty hours without a layoveragain unlikely much of it had to be by night after about three and a half hours lieutenant muto yawned and stretched and opened his eyes he looked over at fuchida and asked how is everything fine fuchida answered we were going on to the panama canal from san francisco werent we the panama canal mutos eyes flashed to the compass only after he made sure of the course did he laugh you know how to wake a fellow up in a hurry dont you commander i try fuchida said lieutenant muto clucked in mock reproach and shook his head though fuchida had been joking he couldnt help looking back toward the southeast the panama canal lay in that direction if japan could put it out of action that would be a tremendous blow to the usa if the americans had to ship everything around south america regretfully he shook his head the panama canal was more than twice as far from honolulu as san francisco was out of range even for an hk the canal would be well defended too and the americans would move heaven and earth to repair whatever damage it suffered attacking it was nice to think about so was making love to a beautiful movie actress in real life neither was likely to be practical little by little the sky began to grow light they were flying away from the sunrise which slowed it but it came anyway even when dawn did arrive though there was nothing to see but sky above and an endless expanse of ocean below fuchida checked the fuel gauge theyd filled every tank to overflowing before takeoff even so they didnt have enough left to get back to honolulu half an hour later the radiomans voice sounded in mutos earphones and in fuchidas i have the signal from the i ichiban muto exclaimed the relief in his voice said he must have been watching the needle drop toward empty too what is the bearing sir were going to need to swing south about five degrees the radioman replied well all keep our eyes peeled after that by the strength of the signal i dont think were very far away pass the word to the other planes on the lowpower circuit muto said no ones likely to pick it up here and no ones likely to be able to do anything about it even if he does hai the radioman said a crewman on one of the other flying boats first spotted the surfaced submarine his radioman passed the word to fuchidas hk and the third one then fuchida and muto both pointed out the window at the same time muto brought the flying boat down to the water spray kicked up from the hull as it landed suddenly its motion took on a new character for a plane it had an excellent hull for a boat fuchida gulped i am a good sailor he told himself sternly muto taxied up alongside the i sailors on the subs deck waved to the flying boat how did it go somebody shouted muto and fuchida waved and grinned the sailors clapped their hands they yelled banzai then they got down to business the i carried fuel for the last leg of the flying boats return to honolulu two sailors in a boat ran a hose from the submarine to the hk fuchida listened to fuel flowing into the tanks when the plane had enough to get back to honolulu the sailors disconnected the hose muto taxied out of the way the other two flying boats refueled in turn when all three had got what they needed the submarine sailed away fuchida breathed a silent sigh of relief when the hks got airborne once more after long takeoff runs that put him in mind of geese sprinting along the surface of a lake before they could get airborne the flying boats had been hideously vulnerable as they bobbed on the surface of the pacific now they were in their proper element again and could take care of themselves they came back to the pan american clipper base about four in the afternoon japanese officers waited for them as if they really were tourists coming to hawaii from the west coast of the usa applause and shouts of banzai greeted them as they got out of the planes radio in the united states is going mad a signals officer yelled the yankees are saying this was as big an embarrassment as pearl harbor fuchida and muto bowed to each other then they both yawned together they started to laugh compassionate leave was the last thing joe crosetti wanted but here he was tearing across the country on the fastest trains he could get most of the bombs the japs had dropped on san francisco came down on the harbor or near it as they were leaving though theyd emptied their racksand one of those afterthoughts had landed on the house where uncle tony and aunt maria and their four kids lived one of the kids was still alive though hed lost a leg hed been blown into a tree across the street which doubtless saved his life the rest of the family gone in the harbor the japs had damaged a cruiser a destroyer and two freighters and theyd sent another freighter to the bottom nobodyd laid a glove on them not so far as anyone could tell theyd come out of the night done their dirty work and then disappeared again to joe the ships mattered much less than his family had his aunt and uncles house not been hit he might have given the enemy grudging credit for a nice piece of work not now now the war was personal he did want to string up the san francisco civildefense authorities who must have been asleep at the switch when the japs came in had they had their radar on had they watched it if they had not likely not by what had happened no one paid any special attention to him as he rolled west across the country men in uniform were a dime a dozen more were soldiers than sailors and more sailors were ratings than officers but joe wasnt unusual enough to draw notice that suited him fine he preferred being alone with his thoughts his own family lived only a few blocks from what had been uncle tonys house the bomb could have blown up his mom and dad as easily as his aunt and uncle he couldnt see anything but dumb luck that had kept it from doing just thatand there was a thought he would rather not have had his train got into the southern pacific station at first and broadway in oakland at two in the morning on the day of the funeral his father waited on the platform for him dad was in his usual fishermans dungarees he wouldnt change to a suit till later they embraced dad hadnt shrunk exactly but he seemed frailer than he had before joe started flight training joe didnt stop and think how much more muscle hed added since then he wasnt built like a middle infielder any more his father kissed him on the cheek saying good to see you boy i wish it wasnt for something like this jesus so do i joe said those dirty stinking bastards i you go pay em back thats all his father said those other pilots they can yell remember pearl harbor when they give the japs whatfor you you yell remember tony and maria and lou and tina and ginaand paul too dammit i will joe said ive got a picture of em in my wallet whenever i go up it goes up with me he wished he were flying planes hotter than the sedate trainers at pensacola you had to crawl before you could walk and walk before you could run but he wanted to run like jesse owensrun right at the japs and run right over them okay joey his father set a hand on his shoulder come on then ill take you back to the house that all your stuff yeah joe slung the duffel bag over his shoulder they teach us to travel light he yawned id like to sleep for about a week when i get home funerals at ten dad warned i know ill want to take a bath too after so long on the train joe felt grubby all over be nice to get in the tub for a change i havent had anything but showers since i went back east at that hour the parking lot was almost empty next to no traffic was on the roads they went back to san francisco on the bay bridge joe remembered the hoopla with which it had opened in it was a hell of a lot more convenient than the ferry that had linked san francisco and the east bay it would have been anyhow if they could have gone faster than the crawl the new strict blackout regulations imposed something else occurred to joe you all right for gas dad he hadnt paid much attention to gas rationing since becoming a cadet he didnt have a car so it wasnt his worry his father shrugged itll be okay and thisthis is more important than crap like that joe bit his lip and nodded he was damned if he could figure out how his old man navigated in the pitch blackness masking tape covered all but the narrowest strip of headlights what was left didnt let you see far enough to spit dad managed though he didnt clip any of the other cars groping their way through the night and he got back to the house with no wrong turns anywhere after months of bunks and cots joes bed seemed ridiculously soft lying down on it made him feel like a kid as if hed shed years he wondered if the ticking of the alarm clock on the nightstand would bother him it didfor ninety seconds maybe even two minutes after that he heard nothing when the alarm clock went off he had to figure out what it was and how to turn it off reveille had been rousting him since he joined the navy he realized he didnt have to change out of his pajamas before he went to breakfast now there was luxury his mother burst into tears when she saw him his brother carl was sixteen and stared at him in awe his sister angie was twelve she just seemed glad to have him back he shoveled down breakfast with the singleminded determination he would have shown back in pensacola carl gaped dad grinned his mother brought him seconds in pensacola he would have overloaded his plate the first time around with all the talk at the breakfast table he didnt have time for a bath after all he zipped through the shower and put on his dress uniform when he came downstairs again his mother started crying for a second time carls eyes damn near bugged out of his head his brother and father wore almost identical black suits joe ignored the faint smell of mothballs they all piled into the car to go to church when they got there they found reporters waiting outside joe hadnt expected that goddamn vultures he thought along with the rest of his family he pushed past them without a word relatives and friends and neighbors packed the church joe solemnly shook hands again and again dominic scalzi set a hand on his shoulder garage aint the same without you kid the mechanic said guy whos filling your slot aint half as good but what youre doing its important you make all of us proud his suit gave off that chemical tang too thanks mr scalzi joes mind was only half on what his exboss was saying excuse me please he went over and sat down with his folks there were the coffins looking dreadfully finaland all the more so because they were closed he knew what that meant the mortician hadnt been able to clean up the bodies enough to let anybody look at them even in the wool dress uniform he shivered hed seen more than one yellow peril crash and hed seen what happened afterwards the first time hed thrown up right on his shoes to imagine something like that happening to his aunt and uncle and his cousins his hands slammed shut into fists he felt as if hed let them down that was ridiculous the logical part of his mind knew as much a funeral though wasnt made for the logical part of the mind the mass helped steady him the genuflections and the sonorous latin were made not to drive grief away but to put it in channels made for its flow the dry tastelessness of the communion wafer on his tongue brought the ritual to a close when the priest intoned ite missa est at the end he did feel better but then came the funeral procession and the burial itself he was a pallbearer of course he was young and strong and healthy and hed been twentyfive hundred miles away from where he could do anybody any good watching and hearing dirt thud down on the coffins made him bury his face in his hands its okay his father whispered in a ravaged voice this once its okay joe shook his head it wasnt okay it wasnt going to be okay if it were okay he would still have been back at pensacola and his relatives would have been going on about their business instead he was here five of them lay in holes in the ground and the sixth wouldnt get out of the hospital for at least another two weeks tears dripped out between his fingers and fell on the green graveyard grass after the burial everybody went back to his folks house people packed it to overflowing the war was supposed to have made things hard to come by the food his mother set out and the booze his father set out made a mockery of that he wondered how big a hole theyd dug for themselves with such a big spread and with the cost of five funerals as soon as he did he shrugged the thought away at a time like this you didnt stint everybody kept pressing drinks on him if hed drunk all of them they would have had to carry him aboard the eastbound train on a stretcher he poured down enough to put a thick glass canopylike that of a fighter planebetween himself and the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune then he walked around with a halffilled glass in his hand which kept most people from offering him a new full one they kept telling himsometimes in alarmingly explicit detailwhat to do to the japs when he got the chance he would nod and try to move on he wanted to do all those things to them but nobody here seemed to have the slightest idea that the japs were liable to shoot back with everything from hawaii to burma lost with japanese troops and planes at port moresby looking across the coral sea towards australia joe didnt see how people could be so blind but they were civilians he thought he hadnt had much to do with civilians the past five months he had been one of them no more he wasnt a naval officer yethe wasnt what he was going to bebut he sure wasnt what he had been either late that night his father drove him back across the bay to oakland dad had put away a lot of booze too but not even the craziest drunkwhich he wasntcould do anything too drastic at the speeds blackout permitted take care of yourself joey dad said on the platform take care of yourself but pay those bastards back i will joe said i hope i will he had no trouble sleeping sitting up not that night he didnt when he woke the sun was hitting him in the face his head felt as if someone were dancing on it with a jackhammer he dryswallowed three aspirins slowly the ache receded coffee helped too after so much time cooped up in a seat joe felt like an arthritic orangutan when the train pulled into the pensacola station again he had trouble straightening up to grab his duffel bag from the rack above the seat all his joints creaked and popped when he got out he found orson sharp waiting for him on the platform hey you didnt have to do that joe said touched i was gonna flag a cab sharp looked at him as if hed suddenly started speaking japanese were on the same team he might have been talking to a moron i borrowed mike williams de soto big deal if you dont help the guys on your team why should they help you joe didnt see anything he could say to that so he just nodded by the time theyd left the station and gone out into the potent pensacola sun he found a couple of words thanks buddy hed left family behind in san francisco now he realized hed come back to family too platoon sergeant lester dillon had been a marine for twentyfive years hed seen a hell of a lot in that span hed gone over the top half a dozen times in france in in the desperate fight that hurled the kaisers men back from their final drive on paris and toward their own border once more the last time a german machine gun took a bite out of his left leg hed celebrated the armistice flat on his back in a military hospital since then hed been in haiti and in nicaragua and at the american legation in peking hed served aboard two destroyers and two cruisers if he hadnt joined the corps he didnt know what he would have done with his life ended up in trouble probably he was a big sandyhaired guy with cold blue eyes in a long sunweathered face and hed never been inclined to take guff from anybody if hed stayed a civilian he might have knocked somebodys block off and done a stretchor maybe more than one stretchin the pokey now he sat in san diego twiddling his thumbs and waiting for the rest of the country to get off the dime he was ready to hit the beach on oahu tomorrow the navy wasnt ready to get him there yet though or to make sure that the japs didnt strafe him or drop bombs on his head or otherwise make life difficult for him but things were starting to move camp elliott held so many marines it was bursting at the seams the navy had bought an enormous rancho up the coast from san diego what would be camp pendleton would have enough room to train troops even on the scale this war would require but pendleton wasnt ready yet the contractors swore up and down that it would be come september which did nobody any good right this minute he sat in the enlisted mens club nursing a burgie and smoking a camel across the table from him sat dutch wenzel the other platoon sergeant had almost as much fruit salad on his chest as dillon did he was three or four years younger than les a little too young to have seen france but hed done plenty of bouncing around since he took a pull at his bourbon and soda a white owl sent a thin plume of fragrant smoke up from the ashtray in front of him its a bastard dillon said we could tear the japs a new asshole if we could just get at em benny goodman lilted out of the radio wenzel paused to savor the clarinet solo and to blow a smoke ring army didnt he observed yeah well thats the army for you like any marine worth his salt les dillon looked down his nose at the larger service little yellow bastards arent bad wenzel liked playing devils advocate fuck em you were in china too right dillon didnt need to wait for the other man to nod the yangtze service ribbon was blue in the center with red yellow and blue stripes on either side okay you saw the japs in action didnt you theyre brave yeah okay but no way in hell they can stand up to us besides their tanks are a bunch of junk six months ago people said the same thing about their planes wenzel remarked thats different dillon said with their tanks its really true theyre liable to have better ones by the time we can get over there wenzel said dillon grimaced that was a cheery thought he sipped at his beer after a moment he brightened well so will we the army just had stuarts in hawaii and they didnt have very many of em a leell make a stuart say uncle any day and a sherman with reasonable armor and a mm gun in a proper turret a sherman was a very impressive piece of machinery dutch wenzel nodded okay ill give you that one he said but the japs wont be sound asleep when we hit the beach the way the army was when they landed now he admitted the army hadnt done everything it might have to defend oahu the navy hadnt either if dillon could have got his hands on general short and admiral kimmel he would have given them worse whatfor than the japs were and scuttlebutt said the japs were hard as hell on prisoners for that matter the marines at ewa and kaneohe hadnt done enough to stop the enemy either you get caught with your pants down thats what happens to you dillon thought unhappily i just wish we could get at them he said and finished the burgermeister sucking foam off his upper lip he went on sooner or later we will and when we do i want to be the first guy off the boat first guy to get his ass shot off you mean wenzel said dillon lazily flipped the other noncom the bird he knew wenzel was as eager to get within rifle range of the japs as he was two days later his company commander summoned him to his office captain braxton bradford was as southern as his name he had a georgia drawl thick enough to slice how would you like to make gunnery sergeant dillon he asked stretching les surname out into three syllables what do i have to do sir dillon asked eagerly he couldnt think of anything he wanted more than a second stripe on the rocker under the sergeants three hoped that might get your attention captain bradford pointed north were gonna need us a hell of a lot of new marines all of those boots are gonna need somebody to show em how to be marines that theres one of the things a gunny is for oh les thought for a moment but only for a moment thank you very much sir but ill pass bradfords eyebrows came down and together his nostrils pinched his lips narrowed he would have scared a boot out of ten years growth dillon already had all his growth after machinegun fire nothing a captain did or said could be more than mildly annoying bradford kept on trying his level best to intimidate suppose you tell me why sergeant yes sir dillon said stolidly theyre going to throw the old breed at the japs in hawaii if im up there at that camp pendleton place i wont get to go if i stay where im at i will he threw away the promotion without the least regret he wanted some things more than that second stripe on the rocker after all it was captain bradfords turn to say oh he did his best to hold on to his glower but his best wasnt good enough goddammit i cant even get angry at an answer like that sorry sir said dillon who wasnt sorry one bit bradfords sour smile showed a gold front tooth now tell me one i havent heard you think of anybody whod take a promotion to go on up to this new place or maybe to parris island or quantico nobody i know sir dillon answered you can always ask though officers all over camp elliott are askingother places too for all i know bradford said lots of good people turning em down you arent the only one in a way thats good we want our first team on the field against the japs but we want firstraters showing the boots the ropes too if mediocre people show em what being a marines all about theyre liable to make mediocre marines yes sir dillon said no more with officers the less you said the better off you were he didnt disagree with captain bradford he knew what was important to him thoughknew very plainly if hed turned down a promotion to keep it and he had bradford studied him nothing i can do to make you change your mind sergeant no sir les almost added another sorry sir but that would have been laying it on too thick the company commander made a disgruntled noise down deep in his throat all right go on get the hell out of here dillon thought about asking bradford if he felt like going to camp pendleton he didnt do that either though he just saluted with machinelike precision did an aboutface and left the captains office as usual the sun was shining as usual it wasnt all that warm even so it would get up into the low seventies today and that was it san diego had a milder climate than los angeles did even if it was more than a hundred miles down the coast from the bigger city mission bay and the ocean currents and the prevailing winds all had something to do with it les didnt know the wherefores or worry about them he just knew it stayed mild almost the whole year around he was stripping a bar that afternoon when dutch wenzel came up to him so wenzel said you a gunny fuck no les answered you nah wenzel shook his head somebody else is gonna have to whip them boots into shape thats what i told bradford too les set down the oily rag he was using and wiped his hands on a cleaner one were the ones whore gonna have to take those islands away from the nips this is what i signed up for and ill be damned if im gonna miss it im with you wenzel turned and looked southwest matter of fact i figure i will be with you you hit the beach ill either be in the same landing craft or the next one over gluttons for punishment thats us dillon said the other platoon sergeant laughed for all the world as if hed been joking dillon went on hell you havent even got shot up you really want a purple heart that bad look whos talking wenzel retorted you got it once and youre dumb enough to come back for more damn straight i am dillon told him wenzel nodded in perfect understanding they were both marines xiii jane armitage was beginning to think oahu would make it there had been times when she wondered if everybody on the island would starve to death shed lost at least twenty pounds herself and she hadnt carried any extra weight to begin with everybody she knew had lost at least that muchexcept major hirabayashi and the rest of the jap soldiers in and around wahiawa they hadnt changed a bit that didnt surprise her but it did infuriate her she knew better than to let the occupiers see what she thought almost everybody in wahiawa knew better than that not being noticed was the best thing you could hope for these days a lot of what had been pineapple fields before the invasion were rice paddies now the japs seemed convinced the islands could grow enough rice to feed themselves they talked about two crops a year yosh nakayama didnt sound too dubious jane put more faith in that what the big five had to say what the big five had to say for the first time since before hawaii belonged to the united states didnt matter one damn bit and if the families whod run the islands for so long had any brains they didnt want the japs noticing them either as for jane she had a new crop of turnips and a new crop of potatoes coming in eating what shed raised with her own hands with her own sweat gave her pride of a sort shed never known before if only thered been more shed also discovered that zebra doves were as tasty as they looked mynahs on the other hand were nothing to write home about she wouldnt have eaten them by choice roast mynah beat the hell out of going hungry though nobody was fussy any more one of the kids whod been in her class before the war started came by on a scooter the school had stayed closed since the japanese occupied wahiawa and especially since mr murphys untimely demise mitsuru kojima was skinnier than he had been too but it didnt seem to matter so much on a little kidand he hadnt been fat to begin with hello mitch jane said that was what shed always called him most of the japanese kids in her class had had american names that they used alongside the ones their folks had given them he stared at her out of black button eyes when he said my names mitsuru he sounded more arrogant than an eightyearold kid had any business doing he added something in japanese jane didnt know exactly what it meant but shed heard soldiers say it one thing she had no doubt of it wasnt a compliment away mitchmitsuru kojima went he was just a little kid but hed put her in her place hed put everything that had been going on in hawaii before december in its place he didnt even know it all he knew was that he wanted to use his japanese name not his american one and that he was entitled to say rude things to a white woman even if she had been his teacher that was plenty wasnt it jane used the hoe to get rid of a few weeds no matter how many she murdered new ones kept popping up she wasnt much of a farmer and never would be but shed already discovered how hard it was to keep crops alive and stay ahead of pests she looked down at her blue jeans the fabric over the knees was getting very very thin it would split pretty soon none of her other pairs was in any better shape some already had patches on the knees or at the seat had these been normal times she would have needed to buy more she did need to buy more but there were none to buy make do or do without was the rule these days she suspected she would end up using one pair for fabric to keep the others going as long as she could then another pair would have to be cannibalized then another until finally shed have one pair left made of bits and pieces from all the rest and what would happen when that pair bit the dust jane used a savage slash to decapitate another weed she might almost have been major hirabayashi cutting off mr murphys stop that she told herself fiercely just stop it right this minute but the thought wouldnt go away neither would the memory of the meaty thunk the sword had made biting intobiting throughthe principals neck somehow that memory joined with the way mitch kojima didnt want to be mitch any more to drive home to her that the japanese were liable to hold hawaii for a long time what would people do as things from the states wore out and broke down could japan supply replacements on the evidence so far japan didnt give a damn about supplying anything beyond a minimum amount of foodand the japs grudged even that sudden tears stung janes eyes she stood there in the middle of her plot clutching the hoe handle till her knuckles whitened she didnt usually let things get to her she went on from day to day doing what she had to do to get by in this horribly changed world doing that kept her too busy and too tired to worry about anything more but she didnt want to be out here tending turnips and digging weeds and killing bugs when she was thirtyfive or fortyfive or sixtyfive and she was damned if she could see what to do about it damned was the word all right if this wasnt hell it would do till she made the acquaintance of the genuine article two japanese soldiers strode by jane bowed and lowered her eyes to the ground she didnt want them noticing she was upset she didnt want them noticing her at all every once in a while they would drag somebody into the bushes and do whatever they wanted with herto her several women in wahiawa went around with dead eyes and started to shiver whenever they saw a jap if they came for her if they came for her she had to run she would have liked nothing better than splitting their skulls with the hoe but bayonets sparkled on their rifles if she hurt them they wouldnt just rape her and they wouldnt just shoot her dead theyd kill her slowly and theyd laugh while they did it they might kill some other people too so nobody got any ideas above her station they kept walking she breathed again she always felt as if she couldnt get enough air into her lungs when the japs were close by a man worked in the next plot he also bowed to the soldiers but he didnt seem on the edge of panic as long as he followed the rules they set he wasprobablysafe no female between ten and sixty could say even that much the woman beyond him tensed the same as jane had having felt the tension in her own bones jane recognized it when she saw it again the soldiers went right on past the woman as if she didnt exist as soon as she saw their backs life returned to the way she stood jane looked to the northeast she wished a hundred a thousand american bombers were roaring toward her at supper a few days before somebody had whispered that the british had attacked a german town with a thousand bombers maybe somebody had access to a secret radio maybe the rumor was just wishful thinking either way the sky over wahiawa stayed clear bare of clouds bare of bombers bare of hope jane muttered something shed learned from fletch something she never would have said even when she was all alone while she was married to him well circumstances altered cases by god these days she despised him much more for being part of the army that hadnt defended oahu than she ever had for not being much of a husband a fly lit on her arm she smashed it wiped her hand on her dungarees and went back to weeding lieutenant saburo shindo was not a happy man yes bulldozers had repaired the airstrip at haleiwa with commendable speed yes more antiaircraft guns poked their camouflaged snouts into the sky around it now as far as shindo was concerned the bs never should have got to oahu in the first place he drove down to honolulu to make his feelings known parts of the kamehameha highway were in excellent shape set to rights not by bulldozers but by gangs of pows shindo thoroughly approved of that since theyd surrendered how were they better than any other draft animals why shouldnt japan use themor use them upas necessary commander genda and commander fuchida waited for him in gendas office he saluted both of them then came straight to the point as was his way we should have done a much better job against the americans the warning we got was inaccurate and lulled us into a false sense of security we would have been better off with no warning at all had his superiors tried to deny that he would have been very angry he would have tried not to show it a man without selfcontrol would never progress in the japanese navyor anywhere in japan come to that but the feeling would have been there he probably would have taken it out on his subordinates as mothersinlaw got their own back for what theyd had to put up with when they were daughtersinlaw but mitsuo fuchida only gave him a wry smile and said hai honto i think we can expect more trouble from the americans too now that weve poked them in the snout as they poked us minoru genda added i believe that bombing the mainland was well done shindo didnt have to disguise his envy as he eyed fuchida the commander had all the luck not only first over pearl harbor but first over san francisco either one of those could make a mans career both to have both seemed downright unfair fuchida was modest too it was gendas idea he said that didnt matter so much to shindo a lot of the pearl harbor plan had also been gendas so what fuchida was the one whod made it real with an effort shindo brought his thoughts back to the purpose for which hed come down to honolulu we need more air cover here he said i dont just mean landbased i mean carriers akagi by herself isnt enough thats all the more true if you really do expect the americans to pay us another call i dont want them to surprise us again i want to be the one who goes hunting and finds them first that may not be as easy as you hope lieutenant genda said they have something they call radar we have the name from prisoners we have taken he went on to explain what the word meant the more shindo listened the less happy he got thats terrible he exclaimed they can see us coming and guide their planes straight to us it seems so when everything goes right genda answered they detected us coming in when we attacked pearl harbor fuchida added zakennayo shindo said they are idiots then why didnt they scramble their planes they could have hurt us badly for one thing they were expecting a flight of bs along almost the same course the bombers came in just a little later and we shot them up on the ground genda answered he was the man with the facts at his fingertips he went on and for another they didnt really believe we would attack them in future operations neither of these factors will hold true commander fuchidas voice was dry i should say not no matter how phlegmatic shindo was he had to fight to keep dismay from his voice he gathered himself and did his best to think about tactical implications after a moment he nodded this only makes it more urgent that we reinforce the akagi if they have a technical edge well need the advantage in numbers all the more our engineers in japan were already working on radar genda said weve flown some of the prisoners to tokyo so they can give our people more information as that becomes necessary the principles seem clear we should be able to deploy sets of our own before longin fact we have some trial installations in place now will we have working models before the americans try hitting us again shindo asked genda and fuchida looked at each other their elaborately casual shrugs said it was unlikely shindo hadnt expected anything else he went on im just a flying officer nobody pays any particular attention to me here or back in tokyo but the two of you you have the ears of important people nobody was more important than admiral yamamoto for instance you can persuade them we really need more carriers here the two commanders looked at each other again they gave shindo another matched set of slightly overacted shrugs once more he had to fight not to show the anger he felt minoru genda said please believe me shindosan you arent the only one who has seen this problem coming the carriers had other things to do but now that admiral nagumos force has returned to home waters from its sortie into the indian ocean ah so desu shindo breathed the japanese strike force had sunk a british carrier and smashed up ports and shipping along the east coast of india and in ceylon that would help japan tighten its grip on burma and perhaps clear the way for an invasion of india shindo gave back a shrug of his own the western fringe of the japanese empire wasnt his special worry the eastern edge was how many carriers will we get he asked eagerly two genda answered shindo had hoped for three but feared the answer would be only one not bad he said tell him the rest fuchida put in genda did theyre shokaku and zuikaku those were the biggest best and newest carriers the imperial navy boasted shindo wanted to jump up and down and whoop but showing delight would have been as uncalledfor as american as showing anger well he said that is good news hai fuchida said if the yankees want to make a big fight of it let them well deal with whatever carriers they send the same way as we dealt with the ones we caught off hawaii when the pacific war started oh yes oh my yes i cant wait to start flying off a carrier deck again shindo said after youve got used to doing them at sea takeoffs and landings from an ordinary airstrip just arent the same he made as if to yawn fuchida also a carrier pilot of great experience laughed out loud at that shindo went on and as we said the americans wont take us by surprise again we will make very sure of that commander genda said along with the picket boats now well have the new hks flying longrange patrols to the north and east theyre really remarkable machines having flown in one fuchida could hardly contain his enthusiasm wonderful endurance good protection lots of guns and they arent even all that slow lieutenant muto said he wasnt afraid of taking on american fighters not even a little bit no eh shindo let it go at that pilots were supposed to be happy about the planes they flew all the same he thought this muto whom he didnt know not just an optimist but a fool no matter how fast a flying boat was it couldnt outrun or outmaneuver a fighter the fighter could pick an attack angle where most of the victims guns didnt bear and then shindos thumb twitched as if on the firing button american warplanes didnt measure up to zeros but they were plenty to deal with the likes of an hk he hoped muto didnt discover the truth of that the hard way still shokaku and zuikaku coming to join the akagi he went back to haleiwa a happy man oscar van der kirk met charlie kaapu on the beach at waikiki they both had their sailboards and everything else they needed for a fishing run oscar was proud of himself for his invention not for the first time he thought he might have made a mint off it in ordinary days the trouble with that was in ordinary days he wouldnt have thought of it amazing how hunger concentrated the mind and hed found a real niche no one else was exploiting the fishing was pretty good out in that area beyond the beach but closer than sampans usually came he hoped it would stay that way now that more and more people were putting sails on their surfboards he didnt begrudge charlie his sailboard the two of them had been through too much together for that the hapa hawaiian grinned at him saying here comes the smart haole where oscar looked back over his own shoulder charlie thought that was funnier than oscar did himself he made a hell of a good audience the two of them walked down to the pacific as usual now the men fishing at the edge of the surf made way for them as they paddled out past the breakers charlie said you really that smart what do you mean oscar asked though he had a good idea sure enough his buddy said you so smart why you take up with that blond wahine from the mainland again that had several possible answers from the crudely anatomical to none of your business oscar chose a mild middle ground susies not so bad a lot of people wouldve flipped getting stuck in all this heck a lot of people did flip susies come through pretty well yeah but you fought like cats and dogs last time she was at your place charlie said which was true why bang heads with a broad when its so easy to find one that doesnt want to yell and throw stuff waste time were getting along pretty good now oscar wasnt about to claim any more than that more would have let charlie give him the horse laugh if things blew up in his face day after tomorrow they put up their sails and let the offshore breeze waft them out into the pacific lousy name for this ocean oscar thought remembering that the word meant peaceful the brief taste of oceanic war hed got up by waimea was plenty to sour him on it forever after a while the two of them separated charlie swung east toward diamond head while oscar went west toward pearl harbor he thought the fishing outside the navy base was better than it was farther east that stretch of ocean had been restricted before the war sampans hadnt gone through it as they had everywhere else near honolulu the japs werent enforcing the restricted zone maybe nobodyd told them about it if they did decide to crack down oscar had every intention of staying away from then on out falling foul of us authorities would have meant a fine and maybe a little time in the cooler if a jap patrol caught somebody where he wasnt supposed to be theyd shoot first and wouldnt bother asking questions but as long as there was no rule against being here oscar intended to make the most of it he was well out to sea as he scattered grains of rice and dropped his line in the water he wanted a good catch enough to keep him and susie eating for a while enough to let him trade some so they wouldnt have to eat nothing but fish till they wondered if theyd grow fins whether what he wanted was anything like what hed get was another question hed find out pretty soon it was going to be a good day he had ahi and aku and even a small mahimahi on the line as he drew it back onto the sailboard he gutted the fish as fast as he could some of the offal would make more bait the rest he kicked back into the pacific hed put some distance between this spot and his next one he hadnt had any trouble from big sharks yet and he didnt want to start now something splashed behind him he turned careful not to upset the sailboard his jaw dropped his eyes bugged out of his head that was no shark no pod of dolphins no breaching whale that was a goddamn submarine its deck almost awash its conning tower painted an oceanic blue ive had it was the first thought that went through his head he almost jumped into the water and tried to swim for it only the sure knowledge that that was hopeless kept him where he was if they were japs maybe they were just intrigued with his contraption maybe they wouldnt do him in for the fun of it a grubby sailor stuck his head and shoulders out of the top of the conning tower in purest brooklynese he asked hey mac you speak english better than you do buddy somehow oscar didnt burst into hysterical laughter that proved he owned more strength of character than hed suspected he made himself nod yes he said adding i grew up in california oh yeah says you the sailor sounded deeply skeptical oscar knew why he was almost naked and very very brown plenty of tourists figured him for at least hapa hawaiian too they were too dumb to know a blond hawaiian was a lot less likely than a swarthy swede this guy was evidently somewhere on the same level of dumbness dont go away he said and disappeared a minute later another man took his place this fellow looked just as unkempt but wore an officers cap with a large grease spot on it im woodrow kelley he said they call me woody this is the amberjack and they were rash enough to put me in charge of her who are you pal vinnie says you say youre from california he didnt sound as if he believed it either my name is oscar van der kirk and yeah im from california i graduated from stanford matter of fact what are you doing here then kelley asked i like it here oscar answered simply i liked it a hell of a lot better before the japs came but i still like it he pointed at the subthe amberjack kelley had called it what are you doing here who me im not here at all youre talking to a waddayacallita figment of your imagination the submarines skipper had a wryly engaging grin if i were here id just be looking around seeing what i can find out what the hells that thing youre riding on for instance i call it a sailboard oscar said it lets me fish farther from shore than a regular surfboard would your idea woodrow kelley asked oscar nodded kelley eyed the hybrid craft pretty neat id say how far could you go on it beats me oscar answered i never tried anything really fancy all i wanted to do was get out where the fishing was better than it is by the beach could you sail to another island kelley persisted i suppose so if the wind didnt let me down oscar said molokai was only about forty miles away lanai not much farther and maui a short hop from either one even so he went on id sure rather do it in a real boat though not much margin for error in this thing how come just thinking out loud the subs skipper said oscar knew bullshit when he heard it but he was in no position to call the other man kelley went on how are things in honolulu you dont have spies to tell you stuff like that oscar asked how do things look to you kelley said another answer that wasnt an answer that was probably fair enough a navy officer wouldnt talk about spies with a guy on a sailboard oscar thought people are hungry but they arent quite starving you try and keep your head down so the japs dont notice you okay kelly nodded how about the local japs the ones who were living here before the invasion i mean some of emusually older ones id saylike it with japan in charge the ones my age and younger are mostly as american as anybody else but an awful lot of them just want to go on about their business same as most folks as long as they get left alone theyre happy uhhuh woody kelley nodded again this time as if telling himself not to forget that how much of the rest of the island have you seen not much not since the war started theres no gas for ordinary peoples cars oscar pointed up toward the conning tower hey can you do something for me i dunno try me let my folks know im okay please bill and enid van der kirk in visalia california and my brother roger oscar paused in for a penny in for a pound he decided and a gal named susie higgins has family in pittsburgh they ought to know shes all right visalia pittsburgh kelley looked down oscar hoped that meant he was taking notes when he looked up again he said theyll get the word it may take a while well have to clean it up so they cant tell how it came from hawaii to the mainland gotcha oscar said thanks pal any time kelley said you want some real chowcanned stuffto go along with your fish there spit flooded into oscars mouth canned stuff was precious not least because so much of it had already been eaten but regretfully he shook his head i better not anybody sees me coming off the beach with it hes gonna know damn well i didnt catch it on a hook woody kelley chuckled okay van der kirk makes sense youre nobodys dummy are you except for charlie kaapu he was the first person whod said anything like that in years most folks figured oscar was a jerk for preferring surfriding to making something of himself in his occasional gloomy moments hed had the same thought himself so when he said thanks he really sounded as if he meant it sure thing kelley said listen one more time youve never seen me youve never heard of the amberjack right who what oscar said and the officerwho couldnt have been any older than he waslaughed again he touched his index finger to the brim of his grimy cap in something halfway between a wave and a salute then he vanished into the conning tower a hatch clanged shut behind him the submarine slipped below the surface oscar guffawed hed watched subs go underwater in the movies one thing the movies didnt tell you though was that the bubbling submergence sounded like the worlds biggest fart in a bathtub he gave his attention back to the fishing line whether american subs were prowling around oahu or not he still had to eat keeping a full belly was everybodys numberone worry these days when he got back to shore he wondered if hed hear that the amberjack had surfaced and plastered a japanese barracks or gun position nobody said a word about anything like that though he supposed the sub was just on a snooping run too bad he thought how did it go susie asked when he got back to the apartment pretty well he answered and displayed a mahimahi he hadnt traded it would be tasty tonight he wanted to tell her hed passed the word that she was safe he wanted to but he didnt if he couldnt keep from running his own mouth how could he expect her to manage it even if he couldnt talk hed done a good deed some people said the best good deeds were the ones you didnt talk about oscar wasnt convinced as far as he could see this one was just the most frustrating jiro takahashi let his sons sail the oshima maru back toward kewalo basin by now hiroshi and kenzo handled the sampans rig nearly as well as he did when they were working they didnt have time to grumble that hed be taking fish to the japanese consulate once they came ashore actually theyd almost given up nagging him about going to the consulate he was after all a japanese citizen and he was at least as stubborn as his two blockheaded sons they werent about to make him change his mind the more they tried the harder he dug in his heels by now even they seemed to have figured that out as kenzo swung the sail about to change tacks on the way back to honolulu hiroshi changed tacks on the argument fathersan you really shouldnt let the occupiers use you for propaganda he said propaganda to jiro it was nothing but a fancy word a reporter asked me questions i answered them so what if the united states comes back to hawaii people will remember things like that they wont like them hiroshi said if thats all youre worrying about jiro snorted the united states isnt coming back these islands are japanese now theyre going to stay that way are you sure hiroshi asked what about the american bombers what about that submarine what about them jiro said we bombed san francisco our submarines have shelled the mainland it evens out we wont put soldiers over there and i dont think they can put soldiers over here we but hiroshi let it go theyd quarreled over that ever since the day the war started jiros we focused on his homeland and the emperor hiroshi and kenzos on the country where they were born kewalo basin was getting close kenzo made a short tack then a longer one and slid into the basin as smoothly as jiro could have done it the sampan glided up to a quay hiroshi hopped up onto the planking and made the boat fast the takahashis weighed the bulk of the catch on the scales now supervised by japanese soldiers the soldiers paid them by weight as usual with all food so scarce on oahu the finest ahi was worth no moreofficiallythan trash fish jiro would have thrown back into the sea before the war officially but jiro and hiroshi and kenzo didnt carry trash fish away from kewalo basin oh no what they carried away for personal use was the best of what theyd taken that day ahi and mahimahi theyd eat some sell or trade some and jiro would take some to the japanese consulate as hed got into the habit of doing waste of fish kenzo said as jiro headed up nuuanu avenue waste of money too jiro stopped and scowled at his younger son you mind your business he said angrily you mind it you hear me you go sniffing round after that haole girl and then you go telling me what to do ichiban baka he spat on the sidewalk in scorn he wondered whether kenzo would come back at him as hotly as he sometimes did if that happened hiroshi would pitch in on his brothers side and jiro would have to start screaming at both of them back in japan he told himself such a thing would never happen back in japan youngsters respected their elders he conveniently forgot that one of the reasons hed been eager to come to hawaii was so he wouldnt have to bang heads with his father any more but this argument collapsed instead of going on to the screaming stage kenzo wasnt fairskinned to begin with all his time on the oshima maru had browned him further even so he turned red he muttered something unintelligible under his breath and turned away from jiro ha jiro thought my shot went home like a torpedo hitting an american battleship he went his way while his sons went theirs he wanted to do some more yelling at kenzo for sniffing after a haole girl now of all the idiotic times just as he wouldnt listen to kenzo though his son was unlikely to heed him reiko and i should have arranged marriages for both of them it would have happened like that in japan here well it might have but the american nonsense about falling in love and living happily ever after had a grip on a lot of young japanese in hawaii who could guess whether hiroshi and kenzo would have gone along no one would ever know now that seemed plain enough up the street jiro went the rising sun fluttered above and in front of the consulate as usual the soldiers standing guard outside both teased jiro about the fish hed brought and admired them before they went into the army theyd mostly been farmers or fishermen themselvesmen of his own class he laughed at their gibes and sassed them back the same way they understood one another after they got done with those friendly rituals the soldiers passed him on to the men inside that was a different business those people wore westernstyle suits and had fancy educationsyou could tell by the way they talked jiro spoke to them with careful politeness he didnt want to seem like some backwoods buffoon consul kita was in a meeting a secretary took jiro to meet chancellor morimura with his long face his large eyes and especially with his missing finger joint morimura always put jiro in mind of a samurai of old his sharp suit somehow strengthened the impression instead of detracting from it as always the young chancellor admired jiros catch his good manners seemed natural effortlesss not the product of care and a constant struggle against saying the wrong thing he asked where jiro had taken the oshima maru today and how the fishing had gone and then he asked and did you notice anything out of the ordinary while you were at sea takahashisan out of the ordinary jiro frowned i dont think so sir can you tell me what youve got in mind well morimura steepled his fingers with that missing joint one pair didnt meet so the steeple would have a leak when it rained there are reports that another american submarine has been sniffing aroundrumors really more than reports did you see one today no sir i didnt jiro answered without hesitation i would have said so right away if i had all right i thought you would morimura pulled a map from one of the desk drawers and you were here more or less he used a pencil for a pointer to show just where the sampan had gone jiro was so impressed he had to remind himself to nod the consular official went on what time would that have been do you remember we got there late in the morning and we fished till early afternoon then we sailed back to kewalo basin jiro said we made a short trip to keep the fish freshnot so easy now that ice is hard to getand we didnt want to spend a night on the sea why sir if you dont mind my asking negative information isnt as good as positive but its better than nothing morimura replied now at least i know one place where this submarine if there was a submarine wasnt it didnt shoot at the island herei would have heard about that jiro said from what you tell me it didnt torpedo any ships why would a submarine come at all if it didnt do any of those things to spy the young man from japan told him submarines and flying boatsthose are what the americans can use and they do they keep sneaking around i dont know if there really was a submarine this time but there could have been i see jiro wasnt altogether comfortable with what he saw why would the united states spy on hawaii if it wasnt thinking about taking back the islands and if it was that meant his sons were right few fathers faced a more depressing prospect than that some of what he thought must have shown on his face tadashi morimura smiled at him dont worry takahashisan if the americans try to stick their long snouts back here again well bloody those snouts for them and send them home good the word was an exhalation of relief jiro hadnt done badly under the americanshed done better here than he would have in japan but not only did he remain loyal to the country that had given him birth an american triumph and a japanese defeat would be his sons triumph and his defeat he didnt care to think about that morimura smiled again you are a true japanese he said one of those times when you visit us you must record your feelings about your mother country whatever you say sir replied jiro who wasnt quite sure what he meant by that tadashi morimura smiled once more whenever the jap commandant strutted into the pow camp that had swallowed kapiolani park trouble followed fletch armitage had seen that was an unbreakable rule the local jap who scurried along in the commandants wake and did his translating for him reminded fletch of nothing so much as a lapdog at the heel of some plump matron the prisoners assembled in neat rows fletch thought about how easy mobbing that arrogant jap and tearing him to pieces would be the pows could do it but the price it wouldnt be just the soldiers with submachine guns who extracted it or even the guards with machine guns in the towers out beyond the barbed wire that slaughter would be bad enough afterwards though if the japs didnt massacre everybody in the camp afterwards to avenge the miserable son of a bitch who ran it fletch would have been amazed the rest of the pows must have thought the way he did no one charged the commandant as he got up onto a table so he could look down on the sea of tall american prisoners he barked something in japanese of necessity fletch had started picking up a few words of the conquerors language he couldnt follow the commandants harangue though you prisoners have benefited too long from the mercy and leniency of the empire of japan the interpreter said even among the cowed throng of pows that produced a stir and a murmur if this was mercy fletch didnt want the japs getting mad at him he was filthy he stank to high heaven he didnt know how much weight hed lost but guessed it was somewhere between thirty and forty pounds his shirt hung on him like a tent he could tie a fancy bow in the rope that held up his pants the only reason he wished he had his belt back was so he might try to eat the leather this mercy and leniency will end the interpreter went on many of youtoo many of youdo not do a lick of work and yet you still expect to be fed you want to live off the fat of the land and after that the interpreter had to stop the murmurs grew to raucous jeers fletch gleefully joined in with so many men mouthing off the japs couldnt shoot all of them he hoped they couldnt anyway those jeers were enough to make even the commandant pause he spoke in a low voice to the local jap no doubt demanding to know what the obstreperous americans were saying he didnt like what the translator told him he shouted angrily and put a hand on the hilt of his samurai sword then he spoke again this time with harsh purpose in his voice you prisoners will be silent you will be punished for this outrageous outburst how dare you behave so you who have forfeited all honor this whole camp will go without food for three days because of your intolerable action the interpreter said at the end of that time the commandant will return to see whether you have come to your senses out strode the commandant the local jap again in his wake he was as goodor as badas his word three days with nothing to eat would have been no fun for men in good condition for those already on the edge of starvation they were the worst three days of fletchs life he didnt go quite without food on the last day he caught a gecko about as long as his thumb skewered it on a stick roasted it over a tiny fire in his tent and ate it scales claws guts and all it should have been disgusting he remembered it as one of the most delicious things hed ever tasted several men quietly died during the enforced fast odds were they would have died soon anyhow so fletch told himself watching two prisoners drag an emaciated corpse toward the burying ground he half envied the dead man who at least wasnt suffering any more and the poor sorry son of a bitch didnt look a whole hell of a lot skinnier than he was the commandant spoke again to the assembled pows before the kitchens reopened the warning was clear as a kick in the teeth if the men gave him a hard time maybe the kitchens wouldnt reopen by then fletch was almost beyond lessons standing at attention took not only all his strength but also all his concentration he didnt have much concentration left he felt dizzy and lightheaded yammer yammer yammer after the commandant spoke the interpreter said have you learned your lesson fuck you you sadistic bastard fletch thought it but he didnt shout it by that standard he supposed he had learned his lesson instead he chorused hai with the rest of the soldiers and managed to bow without falling on his face it wasnt easy more yammering in japanese perhaps now you will understand that as men who have surrendered you have no rights only the privileges the imperial japanese army graciously pleases to grant you the translator paused after saying that if some hotheaded fool told him and the commandant where to head in the whole camp would pay for it nobody said a word only the winds soft sighing broke the silence that stretched and stretched fletch wasnt the only one whod learned the commandants lesson as you were told before when your rudeness began you eat only by the grace of the imperial japanese army the interpreter said supplies are short all over these islands the army can no longer support idle mouths if you do not work you will not eat it is as simple as that do you understand hai the prisoners chorused again yes theyd learned the lessons the japs wanted to teach them all right you will be assigned your duties the interpreter told them there is much damage to repair on oahu damage caused by your useless vain and senseless resistance you will now have the chance to set it right work diligently at all times so the commandant blamed the united states for the damage to oahu did he japan had nothing to do with it eh thats a hot one fletch thought no matter what he thought his face showed none of it the commandants idiotic opinions werent immediately relevant to him the way anything that had to do with food was the dumb jap could think whatever he pleased three or four more men keeled over waiting in the chow line once the commandant finally got done blathering all but one came around when the men in line chafed their wrists and slapped their faces that one though wouldnt get up again till the last trump blew he looked absurdly peaceful lying there on the ground nothing bothered him any more fletch wished he could say the same when he did get fed it was the same inadequate ration of rice and greens the cooks had been dishing out all along it seemed like a sixcourse dinner at the royal hawaiian having anything in his stomach felt almost unnatural and then after hed all but inhaled it he realized he was just about as hungry as he had been before he got it it was better and more filling than a seared gecko that he was reduced to such comparisons told him more plainly than anything else how degraded hed become since the surrender and what did he have to look forward to slave labor on starvation rations he wondered how clancy and dave had done since theyd bailed out instead of giving up one thing seemed obvious it couldnt have been a whole hell of a lot worse of course the japs might have caught them and killed them too from where fletch sat now that didnt look a whole hell of a lot worse either kenzo takahashi splashed vitalis on his hands and then ran them through his freshly washed hair the spicy smell of the hair tonic took him back to the days before the war the bottle had cost him two nice aku once hed rubbed in the lotion he combed vigorously his brother clucked watching him spruce up you sure this is a good idea ken hiroshi asked dubiously not you too hank kenzo exclaimed he looked down at himself he wished he had something fancier than dungarees and a work shirt to wear at least they were clean thanks to a chinaman whose laundry had survived the fighting he wouldnt have the stink of stale fish fighting the vitalis hiroshi seemed embarrassed but he was also stubborn yeah me too taking out a haole girl right now isnt the smartest thing you ever did oh jesus christ kenzo stuck the comb in his hip pocket and threw his hands in the air im not going to marry her im not going to molest her either he had the small satisfaction of watching his brother turn red as he went on all im going to do is take her to a movie so what are you jumping up and down for you can say that to me i dont have any trouble with it hiroshi persisted what if you have to say it in japanese to a bunch of soldiers youre asking for trouble is what youre doing oh yeah kenzo said ill tell em my dads in tight with the japanese consul theyll leave me alone so fast itll make your head swim the scary thing was he was probably right connections never hurt anybody that had always been true and it seemed all the more so now kenzo wished his father had nothing to do with consul kita and the rest of the japanese at the consulate the more often dad went over there and talked with those people the more selfimportant he seemed to get he just wouldnt see they were using him as a collaborator the idea of using his trips over there against the occupiers struck kenzo as delicious turnabout is fair play whod said that he couldnt remember his english teachers would have frowned at least he remembered the phrase that was what really mattered wasnt it hiroshi said the haoles wont like it either hey butt out okay kenzos temper started fraying let me worry about it its my business not yours youre as pigheaded as dad is that probablyno certainlyheld more truth than kenzo wished it did he could either fight with hiroshi or go get elsie sundberg he chose the latter without hesitation and without a backwards glance just getting out of the tent getting out of the refugee camp seemed wonderful sunday afternoon felt almost as good as it would have before the war try as he would though he couldnt pretend december and its aftermath hadnt happened too much reminded him of the changes honolulu and all of hawaii had seen the ruins left from the fighting oddly often seemed the least of those changes the gangs of scrawny pows clearing rubble with picks and shovels under the guns of japanese soldiers were much more alien to what kenzo was used to than the rubble itself seeing all those hungry haoles made him feel guilty for being well fed before honolulu changed hands it had had as much traffic as any other american city of about people now moving cars and buses had disappeared from the streets though many were parked at the curb more often than not sitting on one or more flat tires gasoline and diesel fuel for civilian use had simply dried up if the japanese couldnt spare fuel for fishing sampansand they couldntthey couldnt spare it for anything shanks mare bicycles a few horsedrawn carriages exhumed from god only knew where rickshaws and pedicabs did their best to take up the slack kenzo hated the idea of one man hauling anotherby which he proved how american he was some of the haulers were haoles which also would have been unimaginable before december the smug look on a japanese officers face as a big blond man pulled him along vineyard boulevard stuck in kenzos memory forever the stars and stripes was gone hawaiis flag still flew here and there and looked much like that of the usa at a distance but old glory was as extinct as moving motorcars the rising sun had replaced it japans flag flew over post offices and other public buildings and also over or in front of houses and businesses owned by people who wanted to get in good with the new occupiers not everyone who flew the rising sun was japanesenot even close plenty of people of all bloods judged the japanese empire was here to stay also gone or nearly so were the pigeons and the once even more numerous zebra doves kenzo knew what had happened to them lots of people were hungry these days and zebra doves werent hard to catch the foolish little birds did everything but carry eat me signs mynahs by contrast persisted they were less appetizing than pigeons and doves and also had the brains to fly away when people started sneaking up on them kenzo saw plenty of soldiers and sailors heading down toward the redlight district centered on hotel street the uniforms and the faces had changed the look of greedy expectation on those faces hadnt when kenzo got farther east into the haole part of town the absence of moving motorcars was the main thing that told him how times had changed lawns remained neatly mowed trees were still neatly trimmed a majority of the houses wrecked by bombs and shellfire had been pulled down by now so their lots looked as if they were just vacant elsie had always liked him fine before the war her folks wouldnt have been so happy if hed shown up to take her out they werent so stuffy about that kind of thing as some haoles but they wouldnt have been dancing in the streets either now when he knocked on the door now elsies mother opened the door and smiled and said hello ken come in elsie will be ready in just a minute the smile seemed genuine if it wasnt she could have gone on stage with it she used his first name now too he noticed which she hadnt the first time hed come over thank you mrs sundberg kenzo answered and did so much room inside hed had that thought before the apartment where hed grown up couldnt have had a quarter as much space he refused to think about the tent where he was living now would you like some lemonade mrs sundberg asked sure if its not too much trouble he said he didnt suppose it would be factories had gone right on making sugar even after anybody with a brain in his head could see they werent going to be able to ship it to the mainland and while you could cook with lemons and use their juice eating them as fruit took real determination the lemonade was perfect sweet and tart and cold kenzo had taken only a couple of sips before elsie walked into the front room hi he said hi ken she smiled you look nice kenzo said she was wearing a sun dress but not one that was too revealing part of him was sorry the rest the sensible part wasnt why borrow trouble with leering soldiers or worse with soldiers who wanted to do more than leer he sniffed you smell nice too shed put on some kind of cologne he could smell it in spite of the vitalis hed used on his own hair elsie wrinkled her nose at him as long as i dont smell like old fish id smell nice to you since she was right he grinned back at her shall we go he said elsie nodded he drained the glass of lemonade and set it down on a doily to make sure it didnt leave a ring on the furniture thanks very much he told mrs sundberg youre welcome ken she answered i hope you have a nice time if her voice held the thinnest edge of worry he could pretend he didnt notice little spatters of rain were coming down when he and elsie stepped outside they both ignored it confident it would let up in a few minutesand it did some adman had no doubt got a bonus for coining the phrase liquid sunshine advertising for tourists or not though it held a lot of truth the sun hadnt stopped shining while the rain fell and it was warm and more refreshing than annoying elsie looked up at the sky as the clouds drifted away if id just had a permanent id be mad she said and laughed i dont think you can get a permanent here any more so i dont have to worry about that i hadnt even thought about it kenzo confessed men elsie condemned half the human race she laughed again while she did it hey kenzo played at being more wounded than he really was most of what ive been worrying about lately is fish they dont care about permanents the rest is trying to keep dad from you know he didnt want to say turning into a quisling even if that was what it amounted to nothing you can do about that you cant live his life for him elsie said im just glad you dont think that way yourself nope im an american but kenzo looked around to make sure nobody overheard him before he said it he trusted elsieand he was sure she was on the same side as he was some stranger a stranger japanese or advantageseeking haole was liable to report him to the occupiers he didnt like having to be careful that way but he didnt see that he had any choice either i should hope so elsie spoke in a low voice and she looked around too she made an unhappy face its like living in france or russia or something and worrying about the nazis listening all the time its just like that kenzo said his fathers homeland was on the same side as adolf hitler if that wasnt enough to give dad a hint but hitler had got a much better press in the japanese papers his father read than he did in the englishlanguage press what can you do he thought the closest theater was showing a gary cooper western what can you do kenzo thought again he gave the ticketseller two quarters the theater had long since run out of tickets kenzo and elsie extended their hands the fellow stamped paid on the backs of them they showed the stamps to the man who would have taken tickets if theyd had any he stood aside and let them through gone from the snack bar were the familiar odors of hot dogs and popcorn all it sold were lemonade and salted macadamia nutsanother local specialty kenzo got some for elsie and him they cost more than admission had japanese sailors had taken a lot of the best seats kenzo and elsie sat down near the back of the theater they wanted to draw as little notice as they could when they started to eat their snacks they discovered that macadamia nuts were a lot noisier to chew than popcorn crunching they grinned at each other no coming attractions filled the screen when the house lights went down theaters on oahu swapped films back and forth among themselves but even they didnt think their audiences would get too excited about it instead the projectionist went straight into the newsreel that was a japanese production it seemed to have american models but watching it was like looking in a mirror everything was backwards the allies were the bad guys the armed forces of the axis the heroes to blaring triumphal music japanese soldiers advanced in china and burma japanese bombers knocked the stuffing out of towns in australia and ceylon they also pounded a british aircraft carrier in the indian ocean banzai the sailors shouted as flames and smoke swallowed the carrier somehowby submarine the jap newsreel makers had also got hold of some german footage men in coalscuttle helmets dashed forward with artillery support on the russian front more german soldiers led bedraggled englishmen into captivity in north africa and uboats sent ship after ship to the bottom off the east coast of the usa those sinking freighters drew more banzai s from the japanese sailors who no doubt had a professional appreciation of their allies murderous competence by the time the newsreel got done only a pollyanna would have given a nickel for the allies chances its all propaganda kenzo whispered to elsie she nodded but she was blinking rapidly trying to hold back tears then the western came on that was a merciful relief you knew gary cooper would drive off the indians save the pretty girl and live happily ever after the movie had no subtitles but the japanese sailors didnt need any help figuring out what was going on they made a noisy audience before the war ushers would have thrown anybody that raucous right out of the theater obviously nobody was going to try throwing the sailors out kenzo expected them to root for the apaches or comanches or whatever the indians were supposed to be but they didntthey were all for tall fair whiteskinned gary cooper shoot the savages they called kill them all cooper earned as many banzai s as the german uboat captains had elsie couldnt understand the sailors she did frown when they made an especially loud racket but that was all after a while kenzo reached out and took her hand she squeezed his and squeezed it again whenever the japanese sailors got uproarious lets leave before the lights come up he said as the sixshooter epic drew to a close when they went out into the lobby kenzo wasnt so sure it was a good idea half a dozen soldiers with the japanese armys star on their caps were buying lemonade and macadamia nuts there but he managed to get elsie outside before their eyes lit on her both of them blinked against the bright sunshine thank you ken elsie said it was nice to get out of the house for something besides trying to find enough to eat can we do it again kenzo asked and he felt like jumping in the air when she nodded he steered her away from the theater away from trouble as they started back toward her house he asked is it really so bad she looked at him youre a fisherman you dont know how lucky you are believe me you dont nobody we know who keeps chickens lets them go outside any more they disappear kenzo suspected she didnt know anybody whod kept chickens before december he admitted to himself that he might have been wrong though some haole families couldnt seem to forget theyd come off the farm in iowa he said its not an easy time for anybody elsie drew in a breath she was going to scorch him he could tellsomething like what do you know about it with your dad licking kitas boots but her anger died before it was born all she said quietly was i forgot about your mother for a second im sorry back at the theater shed been the one who kept squeezing his hand now he squeezed hers thanks for remembering he said when they got back to her house they stood on the front porch she spoke the ritual words thank you for a very nice time he gave her a kiss with the sun still in the sky it was a decorous kiss if her folks were watchingand they probably werehe didnt want them saying she couldnt go out with him any more but a kiss it definitely was and he wore a big silly grin on his face all the way back to the tent in the botanical garden commander minoru genda and commander mitsuo fuchida met in front of iolani palace they bowed politely to each other genda grinned wryly here we are again he said hai fuchida spoke with amused resignation maybe well have better luck this time well it couldnt be much worse genda said the hawaiian and japanese flags fluttered over the palace as the two navy officers climbed the stairs japanese guards at the top of the stairs saluted and stepped aside to let genda and fuchida in they climbed the koawood interior stairway and went into the library their army counterparts lieutenant colonels minami and murakami were waiting for them behind that victorian battleship of a desk the army men looked no more hopeful about the coming interview than genda felt well try it again thats all murakami said izumi shirakawa scurried into the library next as usual the local man looked nervous and unhappy about translating for the occupiers odds were he sympathized with the other side if he did his job and otherwise kept his mouth shut no one would have to ask him any questions about that he was a good interpreter genda knew enough english to be sure of that a soldier stuck his head into the room saluting he said the prince is here send him up genda replied with another salute the soldier disappeared as soon as minoru genda saw the man who called himself prince stanley owana laanui his hopes began to rise the swag belly the double chin the shrewd eyes with dark patches beneath themall spoke of a man who thought of himself first and everyone and everything else later if at all that was exactly the sort of man japan needed right now genda spoke to the interpreter tell his highness we are glad to see him and pleased to make his acquaintance after shirakawa turned his words into english the hawaiian princeling muttered took you long enough to get around to me shirakawa politely shaded his translation of that genda followed it even so and stanley owana laanui wasnt wrong even if he also wasnt particularly polite it had taken the japanese a while to get around to him the reason was simple he had a much more tenuous connection to the old hawaiian royal family than did abigail kawananakoa and several other men and women but theyd all declined to be involved in reviving the monarchy he was the best candidate left we are sure you are a man who thinks first of your country and only afterwards of yourself lieutenant colonel murakami said genda was sure of exactly the opposite but hypocrisy was an essential part of this game yes of course the hawaiian nobleman said preening a little in fact he had more anglosaxon blood than native hawaiian that was not necessarily an impediment it was true of quite a few in the hawaiian community some socalled americans prominent ones included were also part hawaiian intermarriage had run rampant here a bigger problem was laanuis personality if he were rendered for oil he could go a long way toward replacing what the japanese had destroyed in the third wave of attacks on december people here spoke of it as december but genda and the strike force had stayed on tokyo time throughout genda glanced at the photographic portraits of distinguished nineteenthcentury hawaiians on the walls of the library judging by stanley laanui interbreeding hadnt been altogether for the best but inadequate as he was he was what the empire of japan had to work with at the moment genda said you must be sorry your highness that the united states has occupied these islands for so long and robbed them of their independence yes that is very unfortunate agreed laanui whod probably still been making messes in his drawers when the americans put an end to the hawaiian monarchy and who no doubt hadnt lost a minute of sleep over what had happened from that day to this you can help us set a historic injustice to rights lieutenant colonel murakami said he was smoother and more polished than his army colleague lieutenant colonel minami proved as much by adding you can give the americans a good boot in the ass izumi shirakawa looked pained how am i supposed to translate that he asked plaintively just the way i said it minami snapped sighing the interpreter obeyed and a broad smile spread over stanley owana laanuis greasy face by god thats just what i want to do he said genda and fuchida exchanged faintly disgusted glances until the japanese came the useless nobles main goal in life had surely been to suck up to the big five in every way he could you could give the islands a powerful symbol of their restored freedom genda said what he was thinking was i hope i can get through this without being sick its worse than the north atlantic in january that would be good the greater east asia coprosperity sphere sounds like a real smart idea to me laanui said now genda eyed him in some surprise that the nobleman knew the greater east asia coprosperity sphere existed proved he wasnt as dumb as he looked but if he spoke well of it hawaii will have its proper role to play i assure you lieutenant murakami said a promise that promised nothing hawaiis proper place would be whatever japan said it was would stanley laanui see that if he did he didnt show it he said the americans have had their boot heels on us for too long its time for a change if that meant its high time to put a crown on my head well what was the point of this exercise if not putting a crown on his head commander fuchida said you do understand your highness that the restored kingdom of hawaii would still find it advisable to cooperate closely with the empire of japan that meant you do understand youll be a puppet genda wanted to applaud he couldnt have put it so delicately himself stanley owana laanui nodded oh yes he said he might have been talking about the weather after all you came all this way just to liberate us was he an idiot after all or only an extravagant hypocrite genda would have bet on the latter but how much did it really matter either way he was a tool and japan needed a tool right now genda said well your highness before long your subjects will start calling you your majesty yes it was a whisper laanui talking to himself but genda heard the harsh hunger in it idiot or hypocrite this man would definitely do lieutenant colonel murakami must have thought the same thing for he said we will arrange your coronation at a time convenient to you and to the japanese empire i hope this is agreeable oh yes laanui repeated and nodded once more then he seemed to take courage adding it could have happened a while ago if only youd decided to talk to me before you had anything to do with those other people those people with better claims he meant though he probably didnt think of it in those terms no he was bound to be the hero in his own storyas who was not minoru genda was sad for him even with a crown on his head he was most unlikely to be a hero in anyone elses that didnt matter though not to anyone but laanui japan would do what it needed to do with himand would do what it needed to do to him he might have done better to decline the honor as other hawaiian nobles had before him he might have except he could no more help rising to it than a trout could help rising to a fly what did a trout know of hooks nothing nothing at all i think we have an agreement hereyour majesty genda said he gave stanley owana laanui a seated bow fuchida murakami and minami followed suit maybe the hawaiian thought that was the ceremony they would have shown the emperor if so he only proved himself an ignorant trout indeed the emperor was hedged round with degrees of ceremony no other mortal even approached let laanui think what he wanted though as long as he sat on the throne and did as he was told he served his purpose admirably xiv with hawaii in their hands with hk seaplanes and with submarines to refuel them the japanese could keep an eye on the west coast of the united states the big flying boats didnt have to carry bombs every time getting a look at what the yankees were up to counted for just as much maybe more commander mitsuo fuchida wished he could go on more hk missions but he had a swarm of other duties and that one flight had to suffice for him he did attend every briefing by pilots coming back to the pan am clipper berth in pearl city the americans are more alert than they were the first time we visited them lieutenant kinsuke muto reported he paused to yawn then said so sorry please excuse me none of the officers whod gathered to hear him could possibly have been offended even for an hk the round trip to the mainland took a long time a pilot who did most of the flying had earned the right to be tired go on mutosan fuchida urged you can sleep soon hai muto said yes they are more alert the blackout is better than it wasnot as good as it ought to be but better than it was they had fighters out looking for us night interceptions arent easy but they found one of the planes in the flight the officers listening to the briefing exchanged glances but no one said anything like fuchida some of the others had to know about the usas electronic detection gear until someone figured out countermeasures muto didnt need to there was an exchange of fire muto continued the hk has a couple of bullet holes in the tail but nothing serious the pilot broke off contact and escaped after that all the antiaircraft guns around los angeles harbor started going off the tracers helped us more than they hurt they showed exactly where the harbor was and lit it for us what did you see three officers asked the same question at the same time more freighters and more navy ships than we did two weeks ago lieutenant muto answered they are building strength what else can they be building it for but a strike against hawaii did you see any carriers fuchida asked ahead of anyone else no sir muto paused to yawn again im sure i didnt carriers stand out because of their size and their flight deck warships yes freightersmaybe troopshipsyes but no carriers if they arent in los angeles they will be in san diego or san francisco or seattle fuchida spoke with complete assurance the question is how many will the americans bring against us that will tell a large part of the story of how the fight goes hai honto our alliance with the germans serves us well here minoru genda sounded as precise as usual fuchida admired the way his friend saw not only the big picture but also how pieces of it applied to a particular situation genda went on if germany and the usa were not at war the americans could move more carriers from the atlantic and attack us with overwhelming strength were better than they are fuchida said weve had the advantage when we met them genda responded we were lucky to get away from the fighting at the invasion with as little damage as we did if that one torpedo hadnt been a dud they would have sunk akagi or hurt her badly i heard the thud and thennothing i was very glad gaining the advantage before going into the fight is part of being better fuchida said stubbornly our pilots are better than theirs zeros are better than their wildcats we saw that wildcats are good enough to be dangerous with a good pilot genda said fuchida snorted if the pilot is good enough what he flies hardly matters but our fliers are better all in all as for wildcats they can take damage and theyre very fast in a dive otherwise the zero outdoes them in every way major kuro horikawa was an army pilot he said you will have army fighters and bombers to help you against the americans neither fuchida nor genda spoke right away major horikawa meant well telling him straight out that his planes werent as important as he thought would make him lose face commander genda chose his words with obvious care so far neither side has had much luck striking ships with landbased aircraft your planes will be very useful if the enemy lands on oahu fuchida added we will certainly be fighting out of the range of landbased fighters though and probably out of the range of most landbased bombers as well our goal is to defend hawaii as far forward as possible your gm bombers are likely to be in the fight horikawa couldnt quite hide his resentment theyre landbased even if theyre navy aircraft they were specially designed for long range fuchida said even so it is not yet decided whether they will go into the fight the gms got their extremely long range by carrying lots of fuel they sacrificed crew armor selfsealing gas tanks and structural strength for that range and raids on australia burma and india had shown them to be extremely inflammable fuchida didnt want to talk about that the navy didnt air its dirty little secrets in front of the army any more than the army told the navy about its we need to find out about the american carriers genda told lieutenant muto that was the most important order of business for him too any navy man with a gram of sense knew carriers were what really mattered yamato and musashi were the biggest most powerful battleships ever built but if american bombers or torpedo planes flying off carriers sank them before they came within gun range of enemy battlewagons what good were they as far as fuchida was concerned the navy would have done better to build carriers with the steel and labor that went into the superdreadnoughts other opinions had prevailed though he couldnt do anything about that but regret it well try our best to locate them sir lieutenant muto promised good fuchida said we caught the americans by surprise here they had better not do the same to us they wont we wont let them genda said if they want to take these islands back theyll have to go through everything we can throw at themand we can throw a lot the buzz of the stearmans engine grew thinner as joe crosetti eased back on the throttle the runway swelled beneath and ahead of him he checked his airspeed and angle of descent still a trifle steep he pulled back on the stick just a little and the yellow perils nose rose a bit airspeed was okay but he checked again to make sure his flaps were down they were they had been the last three times he checked too here came the runway no time for second thoughts now he just wanted to do things right ninety percent of the trouble in the last twenty feet that wasnt a second thought his flight instructor had drilled it into him till it never left his mind down the stearman bounced joes teeth clicked together it wasnt so smooth as he would have liked but he was down if he bounced once he didnt bounce twice the little biplane taxied to a stop joe let out a long sigh and killed the engine he unfastened his chute and his safety belt lieutenant ralph goodwin strode across the tarmac to him not bad mr crosetti he said pretty smooth in fact up until the very last moment there thank you sir joe said im sorry about that ive seen people walk away from plenty worse after their first solo goodwin answered how does it feel realization of what hed done washed through crosetti swell sir he wasnt the first in his training squadron to solo but he was ahead of more cadets than he was behind all right then goodwin said lets see you walk away from it joe got out of the yellow peril he gave the wing an affectionate pat when can i go up again oh it wont be long the flight instructor said but youll be moving into a new squadron soon they may transfer you to another basetheyll have to check the openings here as chapel hill had before it pensacola was starting to feel like home i hope they dont joe said wouldnt hurt you if they did goodwin told him youve got to be able to fly anywhere not just at a place you know well but youll take a step up any which way youve done what you can do on this baby time to see how you handle a texan yeah joe knew he sounded less excited than he should have he didnt want to climb into another trainer even a more advanced one he wanted to get into a wildcat and start shooting down japs longing must have been naked on his face goodwin laughed and clapped him on the back dont look down your nose at a texan the aussies use the ones they make for groundattack planes and light bomberswirraways they call em and theres even talk that theyll build a version with a cleaner airframe and a bigger engine and use it for a fighter that struck joe as a desperation measure of course australia was in pretty desperate shape these days with hawaii lost the usa had a devil of a time getting supplies over there and the japs ruled the skies above the northern part of the country everybody wondered when they were going to invade though it hadnt happened yet come on goodwin said let me buy you a beer youve earned one by god just remember youve got to walk before you can run now that youve soloed youre not taking baby steps any more yes sir every word of that was true and joe knew it even so he ached to be where the action was he ached for there to be action sir when are we going to try and take hawaii back from the japs your guess is as good as mine goodwin replied ive got no ideaand if i did i probably couldnt tell you anyway you want to be along for that dont you you bet i domore than anything joe said thats why i signed up for this and after what those bastards did to my uncle and his family you still have a chance id say lieutenant goodwin told him come onlets see about that beer okay unlike some of his buddies joe didnt do a whole lot of drinking for one thing he was still underage for another he didnt like the taste of the stuff all that much but this was a ceremonial occasion goodwin sat him down at the bar in the officers club and bought him a budweiser a couple of stools over two lieutenant commanders were still going on about the alligator hunt of a few days past a pair of officers had poured down more than might have been good for them and gone out into the swamp not far from the base vowing to come back with an alligator some time later theyd proudly returned with a deceased snapping turtle tied to a broomstick theyd taken it to market in pensacola and got eleven cents a pound for itplus ribbing that wouldnt quit heres to you joe goodwin said hoisting his own bottle of bud and heres to giving the japs whatfor thanks joe sipped cautiously once when he was a little kid his old man had let him take a swig from a bottle of beer it had tasted nasty then am i poisoned hed squeaked his father had laughed like hell he still wasnt crazy about the stuff but it didnt make him want to get his stomach pumped any more the colored man behind the bar asked this here the gentlemans first solo thats right goodwin told him he slid a dime back across the bar on the house thanks the flying instructor stuck the little silver coin in his pocket see mr crosetti you dont just save the country when you learn to fly you save me money too so youre really a hero right joe felt silly part of him recognized that this was a piece of the celebration too the rest was embarrassed all the same he worked conscientiously at the beer he supposed one was okay if he had more than one he didnt think hed be able to see straight for his afternoon classes he had enough trouble keeping up in navigation the way things were when he went to the mess hall for lunch orson sharp all but waylaid him how did it go his roomie demanded i got up joe answered i got down im still here i bounced the landing a little but im still here all right sharp grabbed his hand and squeezed it and pumped it up and down like everything else about the mormon his enthusiasm was perfectly genuine hed soloed the week before his competence was perfectly genuine too he seemed delighted to have company even though joe was competition for a precious slot on a carrier we may be the first room where both guys have soloed yeah joe hadnt thought about that i guess maybe we are pretty neat maybe well stay together when we switch squadrons too i think were stuck with each other sharp said well probably make ace the same day yeah this time the word burst from joes throat with savage enthusiasm and then something else occurred to him when you soloed did your instructor try to buy you a beer sure orson sharp was anything but selfconscious what did you do joe asked i had a glass of apple juice instead sharp answered calmly he said it looked like beer from a little ways away but that isnt why i did it why did you then joe inquired fascinated by the way his roommate did what he thought he ought to do without worrying in the least about anybody elses opinion he wondered if he could have matched such selfassurance he doubted it sharp looked at him i like apple juice joe laughed out loud you break me up buddy i swear to god thats nice no nothing bothered sharp before too long well both be breaking up the japs yeah joe said again the landing craft bobbed in the waves as it waddled through the pacific toward the beach shells flew overhead lester dillon remembered those freighttrain noises only too well from the first world war along with the rest of the men in the clumsy landing craft he bent down a little as if that would help if one of those shells came down here instead of on the beach booms up ahead said the cruisers and destroyers doing the firing were rearranging the landscape pretty drastically suddenly the landing crafts bottom grated on sand the swabbies who were in charge of the ship as long as it was on the water unhooked the landing ramp at the bow it thudded down kicking up quite a splash as it did captain bradford was hitting the beach in this landing craft too come on yall he yelled swarming forward lets go move move move dillon added even louder the longer you hang around with your thumbs up your asses the better the chance the japs have of dropping one on a whole bunch of you marines raced out of the boat their boots thudded on the steel ramp clutching his rifle dillon ran for the beach too as soon as he got off the ramp he went into the water more than halfway up to his knees it was cold water too he swore as he splashed shoreward as soon as he got up onto the beach he threw himself flat and aimed his springfield looking for targets keep moving men braxton bradford shouted cant let em pin us down here landing craft by the dozen were vomiting marines onto the beach all the officers and noncoms were screaming the same kinds of things as platoon sergeant dillon ran inland he looked back over his shoulder the destroyers and cruisers had ceased fire but they were still out there ready to drop shells on anybody who gave the leathernecks trouble dillon caught up with the company commander how are we doing sir bradford sprawled behind a bush going brown from lack of rain well he drawled its a hell of a lot easier when they dont shoot back aint that the truth dillon agreed this doesnt look a hell of a lot like a hawaii beach either oceans sorta green sorta gray not blue like its supposed to be damn near froze my feet when i went in too bradford said i remember the first time i went into the pacific in california hell it was a hot day and there i was at the goddamn beach so i charged right on into the water a minute later i charged right on out again too damn neardamn nearfroze my nuts off i believe it dillon said like you say the weather can get hot but the ocean never warms up bradford looked up to the sky other thing is we dont have any of those goddamn zeros strafing our asses here if we cant get air superiority sir if we cant get air superiority well never make it to the beach let alone off it dillon said uhhuh the company commander nodded dillon had seen more optimistic nods hell hed felt more optimism himself zeros had proved much more effective than anything anybody had dreamt the japs owned from pearl harbor to australia to ceylon theyd chewed up wildcats and buffaloes and warhawks and spitfires allied planes hadnt done a whole hell of a lot of chewing back either up to the flyboys dillon said yeah captain bradford nodded again they reckon they can do itand we get to go along for the ride and find out if theyre right thats the sixtyfourdollar question all right dillon agreed if the japs kept control of the air over hawaii well pearl harbor had shown what air superiority was worth and if it hadnt the sinking of the prince of wales and the repulse and the disaster in the philippines would have it wasnt a battleship world not any morecarriers had more clout the marines continued their advance inland dillon kept shouting to his men to be careful he kept warning them that it wouldnt be so easy when the real thing started he kept reminding them that the japs would shoot back and nobody was doing any of that here and he kept seeing that all his warnings were going in one ear and out the other more than half the marines he led hadnt been born when that machinegun bullet took a bite out of his leg in they didnt know what being under fire was like livefire exercises made them think they did but those werent the real thing nobody shot to kill in livefire exercises the japs on the other hand would be playing for keeps dillon wasnt worried that his marines would turn tail when they came under fire he wasnt even worried that they would freeze up and not shoot back he had absolute confidence in their courage he did fear that too many of them would stop bullets because they leaped before they looked or because they didnt know what to look for before they leaped a few hourssometimes a few minutesof real combat would teach a lot of those lessons sadly he didnt know anything else that would some of his marines would get killed before they could learn and that pained him unlike a real amphibious assault this one ended with a bus ride back down to camp elliott some of the men pointed to camp pendleton where bulldozers and steam shovels and carpenters and masons swarmed the big new base was going up licketysplit les dillon remained glad he had nothing to do with it the men on this bus with himthey were the ones whod go into action first and that was what he wanted to do himself some of them were looking out across the pacific instead of at the construction on land his own eyes kept sliding west and south too a little more than two thousand miles away that was where he wanted to be in a low voice he asked captain bradford we really gonna ship out soon sir is that the mccoy or is it just the usual bullshit well you never can tell for sure bradford answered just as quietly but id sure as hell be ready to sling a duffel over my shoulder and haul ass in a hurry if i was you right excitement flared through dillon he sometimes wondered why he did know what combat was likeand he wanted to go back to it but crazy or not he did ill have the men ready too he promised reckoned you would the company commander said and not another word after those three dillon was proud he let his marines know what was what without making a big fuss about it he didnt want them too excited in case the rumor turned out to be just a rumor after all the next day dutch wenzel tipped him a wink the other platoon sergeant thought it would happen too then and it did happen four days later they were ordered onto buses again this time to the port of san diego they climbed aboard the b f irvine a converted freighter by everything dillon could see the conversion was hasty and incomplete the accommodations he and his men got were better than the railroad cars hed used in france of course those had been marked men or horses these werent a hell of a lot better either seeing the narrow gloomy airless space in which hed make the journey to hawaii a marine said i ought to complain to the red cross fuck that his buddy answered theyre treating us like dogs so complain to the goddamn spca they had their first abandonship drill a little more than an hour after leaving port part of les approved they were doing what they needed to do in case of disaster the rest of him worried did they have so little confidence that they could evade japanese subs if they did how much trouble was the invasion fleet liable to be in he shrugged down there in the bowels of the troopship he couldnt do anything about it one way or the other corporal takeo shimizu felt every gram in the pack on his back he and his men had spent too long in honolulu and hadnt done enough while they were there now they were marching again and he could feel that they hadnt done it for too long he could also feel that it was summertime oahu didnt get cold in the winter or hot in the summer but it was warmer now than it had been when he fought his way south across the island as the sweat streamed down his face he felt every degree too come on keep it up he called to his men youve got soft youve got fat youve got lazy hed got soft and fat and lazy himself but he wasnt about to admit it to the soldiers in his squad he would march till he fell over dead before he showed weakness noncoms had to act that way if they didnt if they let their men get the edge on them they couldnt hope to do their job the very landscape had changed since he last came this way it wasnt that he was heading north instead of south either what had been fields full of sugarcane and pineapple were now rice paddies that gave the countryside a much more familiar feel the men who had grown the other crops were now hard at work to feed the island some of them looked up from the fields as the regiment marched by others just kept on with what they were doing i wonder if theyd rather be doing this or the work they had before senior private furusawa said hed always had an inquiring turn of mind theyd rather eat shimizu said you cant live on that other stuff even if its nice once in a while rice now he didnt go on or need to to him to all of them rice was food everything else added variety all the blown bridges on the northsouth highway had been repaired all the damage from mines and shells had been fixed too cars and trucks and tanks could travel without any trouble so could soldiers shiro wakuzawa asked are the americans really going to attack us didnt we teach them enough of a lesson when we took hawaii away from them who knows for sure shimizu answered thats not for us to worry about if they try to land on oahu what weve got to worry about is throwing them back we can do itif were in the right place when they try to land if were there and they dont have the nerve to try anything thats all right but if we arent and they do then weve got a problem mynah birds scolded the japanese soldiers as the men marched north corporal shimizu did his best to ignore them they were noisy and pushy and had no manners they might as well be americans he thought when he said that out loud the men in his squad laughed of course any joke a noncom made was automatically funny to the men he commanded corporals and sergeants had too many ways to avenge themselves on soldiers who didnt think soor more to the point who acted as if they didnt think so shimizu remembered the other birds hed seen when he first came to oahu the pigeons and the little bluefaced doves theyd got thin on the ground in honolulu and there werent many of them left in the countryside either he had no trouble figuring out why they were good to eat and food had got scarce when supplies came regularly from the us mainland nobodyd bothered the birds nowadays though they were nothing but meat more slowly than they should have the japanese soldiers reached the cross road that led west to schofield barracks a gang of american prisoners was repairing it as the pows had already done on the northsouth road the prisoners were a sorrylooking lot skinny and dirty and dressed in the tattered remnants of the uniforms theyd worn before giving up see what happens when you surrender shimizu said pointing their way thats what you get thats what you deserve better to die fighting better to hug a grenade to your chest and get everything over with at once then at least you dont disgrace your family honto honto his squad chorused no hesitation no disagreement surrender was the ultimate disgrace how could you hope to go back to your home village after falling into the enemys hands you couldnt youd bring dishonor with you and all your kin would lose face yes better by far to tap a grenade against your helmet and then hold it tight everything would be over in a hurry and your spirit would go to the yasukuni shrine after the turnoff for schofield barracks came the town of wahiawa more of it to the east of the road than to the west locals on the street bowed but didnt pay much attention to the regiment passing through by now they were bound to be used to japanese soldiers coming and going they were thin too though not so scrawny as the american prisoners shimizu thought most of them were skinnier than the civilians in honolulu he wondered how much of the fish the sampans caught came this far inland not much unless he missed his guess no matter how skinny they were some of the white women wore scandalously little nothing but shorts that came more than halfway up their thighs and tops that covered their breasts but not much else a yellowhaired woman perhaps a few years older than shimizu walked along the sidewalk with her back very straight doing her best to pretend the japanese soldiers in the street didnt exist they look like whores somebody behind shimizu said soldiers nodded though he wondered why no whore in japan would show herself in public wearing so little it would shame her from what hed seen in the brothels in honolulu the same held true here none of the women in wahiawa seemed the least bit ashamed the women did seem cool and comfortable in the warm weather shimizus feet were sore sweat dampened his uniform he could smell the men he marched with they didnt have the sour beefy reek a like number of americans would have but he knew they were there he sighed wishing he were marching with almostnaked women instead of his squadmates that would sure liven up the day not far beyond wahiawa the regiment took a tenminute break leave your boots on shimizu warned his men if you take them off your feet will swell up and you wont be able to get them back on again you wouldnt like that anyone who couldnt get his boots back on would have to finish the march barefoot no the men wouldnt like that a bit when the sun went down the regiment was short of haleiwa and had to camp by the side of the road the officers muttered and fumed at that which meant shimizu and the other noncoms were obliged to mutter and fume too he didnt know about anybody else but he growled at his squad more for forms sake than from conviction if hed had to march another hundred meters he was sure he would have fallen over dead cooks whod brought their field kitchens on horsedrawn carts fixed rice for the men some of the soldiers had fallen asleep and couldnt be shaken awake even to eat more for the rest of us senior private furusawa said yes why not shimizu agreed for them sleep is more important as for me i wouldnt be sorry if the cooks slaughtered the horses and fed them to us too hashi flashing in the firelight he emptied his bowl amazingly fastbut he wasnt the first man done the soldiers who were hungrier than they were sleepy were hungry shimizu told off soldiers to stand watches through the night one of the benefits of his none too exalted rank was that he got to assign such duties instead of enduring them he cocooned himself in his blanket and fell asleep though hed been able to eat exhaustion made the ground seem softer than the mattress on his cot back in the honolulu barracks he wasnt so happy when he woke up a little before dawn the next morning he felt stiff and sore grunting he stretched and twisted trying to work out the kinks then he undid his fly and pissed into a rice paddy men lined up along the paddys muddy edge to do the same after more rice for breakfast the regiment set out again for the first little while shimizu felt like his own grandfatherexcept that his grandfather had fought in the sinojapanese war and always went on about how soft the modern generation was then his muscles loosened up and he just felt tired tired wasnt so bad after yesterdays march hed earned the right to be tired the sea the sea someone pointed north toward the pacific its the same sea that washes up against japan yasuo furusawa said he was right of course corporal shimizu knew that like everyone else in the regiment hed sailed across every centimeter of it in the nagata maru there hadnt been any place where hed had to get out and walk but it didnt always feel like the same sea it was so much warmer so much bluer andexcept on northfacing beaches in wintertimeso much calmer remember the waves we rode going up onto the beach shimizu said didnt that make your bottom pucker up and it could have been worse it could have been too nasty to let us land at all i dont know what we would have done then he had a pretty good idea though ready or not they would have tried to land they hadnt come all that way to sit in the troopships if the yankees try to land now the waves wont throw them around corporal aiso said its calm and peaceful during the summer so itll be up to us to shoot them on the beaches if they get that far if the navys doing its job they wont shimizu said if the navy was doing its job the americans wouldnt have bombed us here aiso said if the navy was doing its job american subs wouldnt be shelling us and sinking our ships and spying on us well thats the navy shimizu said and everyone who caught his tone of voice nodded what can you do about such people he might have asked of course a sailor would have said well thats the army and sounded exactly the samehalf exasperated half amused neither service thought the other had the faintest idea what it was doing when the regiment got up to haleiwa near the north coast of oahu shimizu expected to turn right and march east hed come ashore near waimea and the march up from honolulu had felt a little like running the film of the invasion in reverse he was taken aback when the column turned left instead but the beaches past which the soldiers marched were broad and friendly the country behind them flat and inviting for an invaderflatter and more inviting than where hed landed mountains rose to the south and west yes but behind a good stretch of plain now converted to rice paddies fighters with the rising sun on flanks and wings rose from an airstrip not far inland shimizu smiled to see them as they roared overhead the handful of planes the americans managed to put in the air had done damage out of proportion to their numbers till zeros dealt with them unlike the americans japan wouldnt be caught sleeping the planes zooming out helped guarantee that grass and ferns had grown over the works the yankees had dug near the beaches to try to hold back the japanese army the plants and the rain had softened their outlines as well as those of the bomb craters and shell holes from the japanese bombardment that had forced the enemy soldiers away from their hastily dug holes lieutenant horino led his platoon to some of the battered abandoned american works we are going to restore these men he said by which he meant you are going to restore these he wasnt about to pick up a shovel himself we are going to restore these and meet the enemy on the beach if the navy screws up and lets him land if he does his bones will bleach on the sand honto hai the soldiers shouted takeo shimizu loud among them not one american will set foot on the grass honto hai then get to work a corporal wasnt above digging in with an entrenching tool even if a lieutenant was as shimizu cleared trenches and built breastworks he looked out to sea the americans had sited this position well if not for destruction rained on them by airplanes and warships they might have held it we will hold it shimizu thought and added more dirt to the breastwork commander minoru genda stood by the edge of the wheeler field runway right on schedule two mitsubishi gm bombers flew in from the northwest and landed on the runway the gm had proved very useful it was almost as fast as a fighter and it had extraordinary range which meant the japanese navy sometimes as now ferried important passengers across long stretches of ocean in gms but the bomber wasnt perfect everything came with a price the mitsubishi plane burned like a torch if it got hit no danger here though there were no hostile aircraft within fifteen hundred kilometers of hawaii the gms taxied to a stop one behind the other vice admiral matome ugaki got out of the first plane a short man with a face so round it was almost wider than it was long from the second gm descended the officer for whom ugaki served as chief of staff admiral isoroku yamamoto yamamoto had a firm rule that he and his chief aide should not travel in the same aircraft lest one disaster overwhelm them both yamamoto looked around as genda hurried across the tarmac toward him and ugaki so this is oahu said the commander of the combined fleet yes sir genda said saluting have you never been here before ive seen honolulu on my way to and from the united states yamamoto answered i never got back into the countryside though how about you ugakisan this is my first time here sir ugaki said pretty the weathers nice neh hai genda said if the weather were all we had to worry about we wouldnt have anything to worry about if you know what i mean yamamoto smiled as always genda was struck by the sheer physical presence of the man yamamoto was shortthough not quite so short as either genda or ugakibut energy blazed from him he said well we didnt come here to take on the weather no sir genda agreed we are honored that you have come to take personal charge of the defenses of hawaii he bowed thinking and you and ugaki both outrank general yamashita about time the navy was in charge of things again shrugging broad shoulders yamamoto answered the highestranking officer should be in charge at the most important point neh nothing is more important for the empire than holding hawaii you were the one who first pointed that out here we have the great shield behind which the rest of our conquests have proceeded the americans are not blind to this in their hands hawaii is a shield no more but a dagger aimed at our heart commander genda bowed you are too generous sir i dont think so yamamoto said ill want to get out to sea as fast as i can the yankees are on their way eh so it seems sir genda replied they appear to have slipped by our submarines at night but flying boats report that large numbers of navy ships and transports are no longer in west coast harbors why havent the famous flying boats found the enemy fleet at sea then vice admiral ugaki asked irritably my guess is the americans are trying something sneaky yamamoto said before genda could reply theyll come down on us out of the north or maybe even from the northwest instead of making a straight run from their pacific coast and the straight route is the one the flying boats and the subs will be patrolling most what do you think gendasan thats how it looks to me too sir genda said theyll assemble somewhere up in the north hope they can defeat our carrier force and try to land if they do good enough yamamoto said well the sooner we get out to akagi and go after them the better off well be we have better planes and better pilots and i aim to take advantage of it yes sir genda said and then youll want to spend the night here on oahu wont you and fly out in the morning youve been traveling for a long time by the look on vice admiral ugakis face he would have liked nothing better but yamamoto shook his head ill rest when i get there he said i want to make sure im in place when the fighting starts if i wait it may start without me you do have aircraft here that can land on a carrier his bulldog expression said somebodyprobably gendawould catch it if he had to wait while planes came back to oahu from the akagi but genda pointed to a pair of aichi dive bombers they are at your service sir good there was never anything halfway about yamamoto if he was unhappy he was very unhappy if he wasnt everything was rosy he walked over to the edge of the runway undid his fly and eased himself on the grass when he came back he was smiling thats a lot better than trying to piss in a tin can while an airplanes bouncing all over the sky go on ugakisan while youve got the chance you wont make a mess here i didnt make a mess ugaki said with dignity but he walked off the runway and turned his back too admiral yamamoto threw back his head and laughed now that he saw hed got what he wanted he was in a good mood he cocked his head to one side and studied genda are you feeling well commander you look a little peaked genda bit down on his lower lip in embarrassment he hadnt realized it showed im all right sir he gave himself the lie for he started coughing and wheezing and had trouble stopping ive had a little trouble with my lungs lately nothing too bad though you ought to see a physician yamamoto said i intend to sirafter we beat the americans all right as long as youre well enough to help us fight them you wont do the empire any good if youre flat on your back yes sir i understand that ill get through the fight genda knew he was trying to convince himself as well as admiral yamamoto thered been a couple of times when he almost did go to the doctor in spite of the action looming ahead but whatever was troubling his chest had eased back and here he was here came the officer in charge of wheeler field a lieutenant colonel he bowed to yamamoto and ugaki in turn honored to have you here sir he told the commander of the combined fleet i trust youll do me the honor of dining with me tonight im afraid not yamamoto said and the army officers face fell yamamoto did take the time to make sure the man understood it was nothing personal my chief of staff and i are going straight out to our flagship as soon as you can put pilots into those aichis the americans wont wait in the face of such formidable devotion to duty the lieutenant colonel said the only thing he could yes sir genda knew a certain amount of relief at least yamamoto didnt propose flying out to the akagi himself he had his wings yes but genda didnt think hed ever made a landing on the deck of a flattop yamamoto caught his eye and raised one eyebrow slightly genda gave back an almost imperceptible nod yamamoto said and make sure you have a plane for commander genda as well his assistance is bound to prove invaluable ill take care of it sir the army man promised his eyes raked genda who the devil are you he might have asked genda didnt enlighten him inside half an hour admiral yamamoto and vice admiral ugaki were winging their way north a little later the lieutenant colonel scraped up another aichi da and a pilot to ferry genda out to the akagi he still didnt know who genda was or what hed done to deserve singling out by name by the most famous officer in all the japanese armed forces that suited gendawho cared for results much more than for renownjust fine the flight didnt suit him so well the longer it went on the less happy his chest got he tried willing the congestion away as he had before but didnt have much luck he huddled in the dive bombers rear seat doing his best not to move when the plane came down in the controlled crash that was a carrier landing he had to bite back a groan getting out of the aichi after the pilot opened the canopy took all his strength he dragged himself down to the flight deck and stood there swaying captain kaku whod come out of the island onto the deck to greet him took one look at him and snapped go to the dispensary im all right sir genda protested feebly go to the dispensary thats an order commander kakus voice had not a gram of give in it genda gave back a miserable salute and obeyed a doctor with roundlensed spectacles like prime minister tojos listened to his heart and lungs with a stethoscope im very sorry commander but you have pneumonia he announced its a good thing you came to see me you need a spell of bed rest but i cant genda said you have to the doctor said firmly dying gloriously for the emperor is one thing dying because you dont pay attention to what germs are doing to you is something else again youll be fine if you take it easy now if you dont you wontand you wont do your country any good either but commander genda felt too rotten to work up a good argument he supposed that went a long way toward proving the doctors point they put him in sick bay he lay on an ironframed cot staring up at the graypainted steel ceiling not far enough overhead for this he had come out to akagi jim peterson looked down at his hands by now the blisters hed got when he started road work had healed into hard yellow calluses no his hands didnt bother him any more a steady diet of pickandshovel work had cured that trouble was was the work was the only steady diet he had no matter what the japs promised they didnt feed road gangs much better than they had the prisoners back at the camp near opana if the american pows starvedso what that was their attitude and getting enough to eat wasnt even petersons chief worry if that wasnt a son of a bitch he didnt know what would be making sure nobody in his shooting squadand most especially not walter londonheaded for the tall timber took pride of place if that was the right name for it the man didnt give a damn about anything or anybody but himself everybody knew it hes gonna get us all killed you know that gordy braddon said as they dumped dirt and gravel into a hole in the road near schofield barracks hes gonna get us all killed and that aint the worst of it you know what the worst of it is depends peterson said judiciously maybe you mean hell do something stupid and get himself caught and shot too or maybe you mean he wont just get us killedhell laugh about it too the pfc stared at him shit corporalyou readin my mind or what hell anybody with eyes can see what that london item is like peterson said hed take money out of a blind mans cupand then if he thought somebody was watching hed toss back a nickel so hed look good quietly out of the side of his mouth he added careful hes liable to be listening gordy braddon looked around sorry dont reckon he heard me though okay peterson checked too a lot more subtly yeah i guess youre right cant blame me for being jumpy though only thing you can blame anybody for these days is letting his pals down you dont do that by jesus braddon said two dive bombers blazoned with rising suns flew north over their heads not too high braddon watched them till they were out of sight i think the japs are jumpy too theyve been doing a lot more flying lately than they had for quite a while wonder what the hell it means just one thing i can think of peterson had watched the dive bombers too watched them with hatred in his eyes planes like that had done horrible things at pearl harborand he gathered against the enterprise too scowling still he went on they must figure were going to try to take the islands back christ braddon said reverently hope to god youre right you think we can do it before peterson could answer the japanese sergeant who did duty as straw boss for the work gang pointed at the two of them and said isogi that meant something like make it snappy as slave drivers went he was a fair man he warned you before he turned the goons loose on you if you didnt get the message it was your own damn fault peterson found it a good idea to busy himself with his shovel for a while braddon worked beside him after a while the jap found someone else to yell at it never took real long for one thing the american pows were doing work they hated work any idiot could see would help japan against their own countrymen no wonder they didnt give it their finest effort and even if theyd shown the best will in the world they were still too weak and too hungry to work as hard as the japs wanted them to im with you i hope we can do it peterson said when he judged the coast was clear the japanese sergeant didnt come down on him neither did any of the other guards he kept busy filling in shell holes and potholes just the same im afraid of what happens if we dont send enough out to do what needs doing yeah thats what scares me back on the mainland have they figured out how tough the goddamn japs really are if they havent they sure aint been paying attention gordy braddon said like peterson he went on talking while he worked now they beat the shit out of us here they did the same thing in the philippines they bombed san francisco for cryin out loud what more does the mainland need maybe theyve got the message over there i hope so but i dont know i remember how things were before the shooting started peterson said hardly anybody thought theyd have the nerve to pick a fight with us and everybody thought theyd get their heads handed to them if they tried after all they were just using a bunch of junk made out of our old tin cans right his laugh had a bitter edge the japs had used a lot of us scrap metal till fdr stopped selling it to them but they hadnt built junk out of it hed never got a nastier surprise in his life than when he tried dogfighting a zero with his wildcat the jap in that fighter had taken him to school chewed him up and spit out the pieces from what hed heard since hed been damn lucky not to get shot while he was parachuting down to the ground too plenty of pilots had been the japanese didnt respect the chivalry of the air as far as he could see they didnt respect anything but strength if they had it and you didnt they walked all over you if you had it and they didnt maybe theyd kowtow maybe how could anybody know for sure nobodyd managed to make em say uncle yet walter london laid down his pick in the middle of the road ive got to take a whizz he announced as if the bulletin were as important as one from the russian front to peterson and the other men in the shooting squad it was a lot more important than that he looked at his comrades in mistrust was it his turn he thought it was he let his shovel fall me too he said london scowled at him i cant even piss without somebody looking over my shoulder its not while you piss that really scares me peterson answered but if you take off afterwards i get shot i wont do that london whined not while im watching you you wont peterson said london went off behind a bush peterson stood behind another one no more than ten feet away he didnt need to piss he was sweating so hard most of his water leaked out that way london did a fine job of watering the grass see he said to peterson as he set his clothes to rights hot damn peterson said he almost added only goes to show what a pissant you are almost but not quite if he came down on london too hard hed give the sob reason to run and hope everybody else in the shooting squad or at least one jim peterson got an arisaka round right between the eyes peterson sighed as they both headed back to the roadway maybe having to make calculations like that was the worst part of being a pow he went back to work while another northbound dive bomber roared by overhead as soon as he got another hole halfway filled he was forcibly reminded that exhaustion and starvation came in a long way ahead of calculation after all when mitsuo fuchida went down to the akagi s sick bay to see how his friend genda was doing a pharmacists mate wearing a gauze mask over mouth and nosea masuku they called it in japanesechased him away gomen nasai commandersan the petty officer said not sounding sorry at all but commander genda is contagious we dont want anyone else coming down with his sickness i just wanted to say hello and ask how hes doing fuchida protested i will pass on your greetings sir the pharmacists mate stood in the doorway like a dragon commander genda is doing as well as can be expected that could mean anything or nothing about how long do you think hell be laid up fuchida asked until he is well enough and strong enough to resume his duties the pharmacists mate said fuchida wanted to hit him petty officers slapped seamen around all the time the same way army noncoms did with common soldiers officers needed good reasons for belting noncoms though and a refusalor maybe just an inabilityto communicate wasnt enough not when the pharmacists mate was oddson to be obeying the doctors orders by keeping genda isolated thwarted fuchida turned away and went up to the officers wardroom the food there was better than what hed been eating in honolulu captain kaku was also there eating a bowl of pickled plums and sipping tea any sign of the americans sir fuchida asked the skipper shook his head not yet commander believe me youll be the first to know his voice was dry fuchida looked down at his own snack so kaku wouldnt see him flush when the yankees were spotted he would lead the strike against them as hed led the first strike against pearl harbor and then the attack on the lexington of course he would know as soon as anyone else did he found another question how are our engineers doing on electronic ranging gear like the americans have id hoped zuikaku and shokaku would have it captain kaku answered no such luck though i think we understand the principles now the problem is getting it into production installing it aboard ship and training men to use it he shrugged we have our picket sampans out there and we have hks patrolling beyond them and we have the cruisers float planes for closein reconnaissance wherever the enemy comes from he wont take us by surprise thats what counts sir fuchida agreed as long as we meet the americans on anything like equal terms well beat them i see it the same way kaku said admiral yamamoto is less hopeful he fears the united states will outproduce us no matter what we do let the americans try fuchida said if we keep sinking their ships it doesnt matter how many they build and well be building too hai the captain of the akagi nodded this is also how it seems to me fuchidasan youre a sound man very sound what kaku no doubt meant was that he and fuchida held the same opinion he went on the admiral has a different view he says we have no idea of how much materiel the united states can produce once all its factories start going full tilt and the americans who have so much begrudge us the chance of getting our fair share fuchida said angrily they think they should be the only big power in the pacific weve taught them a thing or two and if they want another lesson here id say were ready to give them one as if his words were the cue in a play a yeoman from the radio shack stuck his head into the wardroom ah here you are captainsan excitement crackled in his voice he waved a sheet of flimsy paper we have a report from one of the flying boats theyve spotted the american ships sir the pilot reports three enemy carriers sir with the usual supporting ships range about eight hundred kilometers bearing three against three fuchida thought equal termsjust what i asked for now to make the most of it domo arigato kaku breathed after thanking the yeoman he went on any sign of transportsof an invasion fleet sir i have no report of them the radioman answered if they are there sir they may be hanging back waiting for their carriers to dispose of ours fuchida said i wouldnt want to expose troopships to air strikes hai honto neither would i captain kaku turned back to the yeoman youve informed admiral yamamoto oh yes sir the man said he nodded to me and he said now it begins he spoke to me sir he seemed immensely proud of himself a christian to whom jesus had spoken might have sounded the same way kaku got to his feet im going to sound general quarters he said to fuchida theyre still out of range but now we know where they are to the yeoman again do the americans know that flying boat has spotted them sir if they do the message didnt say the yeoman told him fuchida nodded to himself liking the response the man wasnt trying to read anything into what hed got from the hk many radiomen might have lets tend to business commander kaku said youll want to get your men ready for whats ahead of them im sure and were all going to be busy before very long yes sir fuchida said he and kaku both hurried out of the wardroom the skipper of the akagi headed for the bridge fuchida made for the pilots briefing room on the hangar deck right under the flight deck hardly knowing he was doing it he rubbed at his belly as he hurried along if he had a bellyache he would just have to ignore it more important things were going on general quarters sounded before he was even halfway to the briefing room he nodded to himself this was why hed gone to the naval academy at eta jima to the naval aircraft training center at kasumigaura to war against the united states in the first place one more strong blow sailors and officers ran every which way hurrying to their battle stations fuchida ducked into the briefing room as the mechanics and other members of the maintenance crew began making sure the level bombers torpedo planes dive bombers and fighters were as ready for action as they could be one of the divebomber pilots made it to the briefing room less than fifteen seconds behind fuchida the man grinned and said i might have known youd be here first commandersan im not that fast fuchida said i happened to be in the wardroom with the captain when the news came in i was on my way over here before the alert sounded news what sort of news the pilot asked eagerly the sort weve been waiting for patience patience fuchida answered with a smile of his own that way ill only have to tell the story once yes sir the divebomber pilot didnt sound patient he sounded like a small boy reluctantly awaiting permission to open a present sitting there on a mat in front of him more pilots swarmed into the briefing room along with radiomen and bombardiers for the nakajimas and aichis they were all chattering excitedly they knew what the call to general quarters was likely to mean they kept flinging questions at fuchida too as he stood there in front of the map when the room was full he held up his hand the fliers were in such a state they needed a little while to realize he was calling for quiet slowly a centimeter at a time they gave it to him thank you gentlemen he said when he could make himself heard through the din thank you the news i have is the news weve all been waiting for we have found the americans that started everyone talking at once again hed known it would where are they when do we take off the questions rained down on him we dont take off yetthey arent in range fuchida answered theyre abouthere he pointed on the map one of our hks picked them up way out there banzai for the flying boats somebody shouted and a cheer filled the briefing room how can we lose with men like these fuchida thought proudly another pilot called what are we going to do about them sir i dont know yet not officially fuchida replied admiral yamamoto and captain kaku havent given the orders but ill tell you thiswe didnt come out here to invite the yankees to a chanoyu the officers and ratings laughed as if the roundeyed barbarians could appreciate a tea ceremony anyway well make them drink salty tea a pilot yelled thats the spirit fuchida said be ready i expect well close with the enemy and attack banzai for the emperor banzai banzai the shout filled the briefing room out on the pacific platoon sergeant les dillon was playing poker with four other noncoms when the b f irvine s engine fell silent leaving the troopship bobbing in the water what the fuck he and two other sergeants said the same thing at the same time its your bet les dutch wenzel said dillon shoved money into the pot ill bump it up a couple of bucks he said he had two pair and nobodyd shown much strength but the change in the background noise worried him what the hell are they doing they break down were sitting ducks for a goddamn jap sub if we just park here thank you admiral nimitz said vince monahan who sat to les left he tossed in folding money of his own call im out wenzel threw in his hand so did the last two sergeants heres mine dillon laid down his queens and nines monahan said something unpleasant hed had jacks and fives dillon raked in the pot whose deal is it he asked maybe we ought to find out whats going on monahan said we were steaming around in the north pacific marking time and then we started heading south like we were really going somewhere yeah somewhere dillon said drily the other men in the poker game grunted a couple of them chuckled theyd been heading for oahu and whatever happened when they hit the beach now now they werent going anywhere a few minutes later the engines started up again so did the poker game which had stalled the troopship swung through a turn dillons inner ear told him they were heading east now more or less not south the game went on the b f irvine went through what felt like a oneeighty half an hour later and then another one half an hour after that jesus christ wenzel said why the fuck dont they make up their minds they send us all the way out here to march in place for crying out loud i know what it could be dillon said yeah wenzel and monahan and the other two men in the game all spoke together yeah he replied the navys got to be up ahead of us somewhere if they dont clear the japs out of this part of the pacific we arent gonna make it to oahu to land if theyve bumped into em after some thought dutch wenzel nodded makes sense he allowed they wouldnt want us bumping into carrier air he made a horrible face that could ruin your whole day matter of fact one more brief pause whose deal is it lieutenant saburo shindo prided himself on never getting too excited about anything tomorrow morning battle would come japans most important fight since the opening blows of the war against the usa some people were jumping up and down about thatand making a devil of a racket doing it shindo ignored them he sprawled dozing in a chair in the briefing room he wore his flying togs he could be inside his zero and airborne in a matter of minutes every so often the noise around him got too loud to stand and hed wake up for a little while when he did he thought about what he would have to do this would be no surprise attack the americans knew theyd been spotted theyd sent up fighters to chase off or shoot down the first hk that found their fleet theyd done it too though the flying boat had taken out a wildcat before going into the pacific by the time it went down others were in the neighborhood the yankees might try to get away under cover of darknesstry to scurry back to the west coast of the united states some of the japanese pilots thought they would saburo shindo didnt believe it running now would be cowardly the americans hadnt fought very well on oahu but theyd fought bravely they wouldnt run away if they werent running what would they be doing shindo fell asleep again after he asked himself the question and before he answered it he realized as much only when his eyes came open some time later and he noticed half the people who had been around him were gone replaced by others he started chewing on things once more just as if he hadnt stopped what would the americans do stay where they were and wait to be attacked he wouldnt do anything that foolish he would storm forward launch his own search planes as soon as it got light and strike with everything he had the instant he found the japanese fleet if he could see that wouldnt the yankees be able to see it too he expected they would they had three carriers the japanese also had three including two of the newest largest and fastest in the navy the americans had who knows what for pilots the japanese had men whod smashed everything they came up against from hawaii to ceylon the americans used wildcats for fighters the japanese used zeros shindo yawned and smiled at the same time a wildcat could take more punishment than a zero it could yesand it needed to he dozed off one more time laughing a little as he did when he woke again it was with someones hand on his shoulder full alertness returned instantly is it time he asked not quite yet sir the man standing beside him was one of the wardroom stewards were serving out a combat meal before the fliers go up he held out a bowl full of nigirimeshi rice balls wrapped in bamboo shoots with plums at their centers arigato shindo took one and bit into it the stewards had served the same meal before the fliers set off for pearl harbor another man carried a tray with cups of green tea shindo washed down his breakfast with it akagi s three elevators were lifting planes from the hangar deck to the flight deck getting them ready to go into action flightcrew men wrestled the bombers and fighters into position one after another as soon as each elevator went up and came down another plane went on up above more men from the flight crew would be fueling the planes and making sure their engines and control surfaces and instruments were in good working order armorers would be loading bombs and torpedoes machinegun bullets and cannon shells when the time came before it came though shindo gathered up the fighter pilots he would be leading some of you were stuck on oahu with me when the american bombers raided us he said they fooled us and they hit us and they made us lose face now is our chance to get revenge are we going to let it slip through our fingers iye the fliers answered loudly not all of them had been stuck on the island but every one had been embarrassed of course they would say no good shindo told them very good they want a lesson its up to us to give them one by the time were through with them they wont want to come anywhere near hawaii for the next hundred years lets give the emperor a banzai and then go out there and serve him banzai the fighter pilots shouted they hurried up to the flight deck shindo climbed into his zero morning twilight stained the eastern sky with gray somewhere out there the enemy waited as shindo went through his checks he was pretty sure he knew where any which way he would get a signal from the bombers whose radios were more fully hooked into the reconnaissance network planes began roaring off the flight deck he fired up his engine it roared to smooth powerful life his turn came soon the air officer swung his green lantern in a circle shindos zero sped along dipped as it went off the end of the deck and soared into the sky xv in his nakajima bn commander mitsuo fuchida listened to the reports coming in from the flying boats and from the float planes the fleet had launched to search for the american carriers and their surrounding vessels he didnt think he would have long to wait the japanese knew about where the enemy would be and he proved right he hadnt been airborne long before a floatplane pilot found the foe range approximately kilometers the pilot shouted bearing is he paused then shouted again they are launching planes repeatthey are launching planes were up first fuchida thought good ignoring the growing ache in his belly he spoke to his radioman relay the position to our aircraft hai commandersan first flying petty officer tokunobu mizuki said he took care of that with his usual unflustered competence fuchida worried that the americans would intercept the float planes signal and learn where the fleet was he shrugged with their electronics they would see from which direction the japanese strike was coming and trace it back anyhow maybe we should have thrown them a curve thought fuchida a baseball fan probably too late to worry about it now shindo here commander the fighter pilots voice calm as usual sounded in fuchidas earphones go ahead fuchida said question sir saburo shindo said if we spot the american airplanes on their way to our fleet do we peel off and attack them or do we continue with you come with us fuchida answered without hesitation well need your help to keep the wildcats off us and the zeros up over our ships will tend to the americans all right sir thats the way well do it then out lieutenant shindo broke the connection fuchida smiled to himself shindo no doubt would be telling the fighter pilots of the decision just as surely he wouldnt raise his voice while he did it with his machinelike competence shindo might have come out of the mitsubishi aircraft plant himself somewhere not too far awayand drawing closer by several kilometers every minutean american officer was likely listening to the same question from one of his subordinates how would he answer it how would his answer change the building battle well see fuchida thought as when planes from the japanese carriers attacked the enterprise and then the lexington and as when aircraft from the lexington delivered their alarming counterstrokethe two fleets here would not draw close enough to see each other and turn their guns on each other this war was overturning centuries of naval tradition sudden excited gabble filled fuchidas earphones dryly petty officer mizuki said some of our men have spotted the americans airplanes sir really fuchida matched dry for dry i never would have guessed mizuki chuckled a moment later fuchida saw the americans himself they were flying a little lower than the japanese and noticeably slower their torpedo planes were lumbering pigs obsolete when compared to the sleek nakajima bns in fuchidas strike force american torpedoes werent all they might have been either several duds had proved a hit from them wasnt necessarily fatal or even damaging would the wildcats climb up and try to strike the japanese fuchida hoped so they were slower than zeros in everything but an emergency dive and gaining altitude would cost them still more speed shindo and the rest of the japanese fighter pilots had to be licking their chops but the wildcats pressed on to the south not leaving the attack aircraft they were assigned to shepherd fuchida nodded to himself he would have made the same choice he had made the same choice for his side he ordered mizuki to radio word of the sighting back to the fleet aye aye sir the radioman answered i would have done it without orders in a minute if you hadnt spoken up from a lot of ratings that would have been a shocking breach of discipline mizuki and fuchida had been together for a long time the petty officer knew what needed doing in his small sphere as well as fuchida did in the larger one each strike force slightly adjusted its course based on the direction in which the other had been flying if the americans had thrown a curve fuchida refused to worry about it he already had the approximate bearing from the japanese reconnaissance aircraft he had the bearing he knew how far hed come where were the americans then all he saw was the vast blue expanse of the pacific he didnt want the men he led spotting the fleet ahead of him he was their leader didnt that mean he ought to be first at everything no matter what he wanted he wasnt quite first but he spied the enemy warships just after the first radio calls rang out like the japanese the americans used cruisers and destroyers to surround the allimportant carriers the smaller vessels started throwing up antiaircraft fire puffs of black smoke marred the smooth blue of the sky a couple of shells burst not far from fuchidas bomber blast made the nakajima shake and jerk in the air a chunk of shrapnel clattered off a wingtip it seemed to do no harm the bn kept flying torpedo planes dive bomberswork together fuchida called dont let the enemy fighters concentrate on one group fighters protect the attack planes banzai for the emperor answering banzai s filled all strikeforce frequencies here came the wildcats that had been orbiting above the american fleet muzzle flashes showed theyd started shooting the four heavy machine guns they carried were not to be despised if they hit they hit hard as if to prove as much a burning zero spun toward the pacific far below a wildcat followed it was out of control the pilot surely dead but it didnt show nearly so many flames as the zero wildcats could take more damage than their japanese counterparts they couldand they needed to for the japanese had an easier time hitting than they did level bombers line up behind your guide aircraft fuchida called out over the radio the tactic had worked extremely well above pearl harbor the level bombers scored a surprising number of hits there back in december though their targets lay at anchor in a crowded harbor now they were twisting and dodging all over the sea hits wouldnt come easy we can only do our best fuchida thought down below antiaircraft fire caught an aichi dive bomber as it was about to heel over and swoop on a carrier instead of diving the aichi fell out of the sky rolling over and over and breaking up before it hit the water two more brave men gone two more spirits in yasukuni shrine fuchida switched places with the second plane in his group of five first flying petty officer akira watanabe was the best pilot in the japanese navy and his bombardier first flying petty officer yanosuke aso was also the best they needed to pass right over the center of the enemy fleet as always hitting carriers came first be ready watanbe called to the pilots behind him his plane bounced upward as the bombardier released the load fuchidas bn also lurched in the air as its bombs fell free more bombs tumbled down from the planes that followed him suddenly the aircraft was lighter more maneuverable and it needed to be mizuki who handled the rearfacing machine gun as well as the radio opened up on somethingpresumably a wildcatbehind the bomber now that fuchida didnt have to fly slow and straight for the bombardiers sake he threw his nakajima into aerobatics as violent as its engine and frame could stand the rest of the planes in his group were doing the same thingall but one that one flames shooting from the wing root and the engine cowling plummeted down toward the sea petty officer mizuki let out a wordless shout fuchida corkscrewed away to the left planes usually broke to the right to take advantage of the torque from their props he hoped his maneuver would catch the yankee on his tail by surprise and it didthe wildcat shot past him close enough for him to see the americans startled face if only he had a forwardfacing machine gun but he didnt and the wildcat got away nowwhat had the bombs done lieutenant saburo shindo was not a happy man his zero was still a better plane than the wildcats he faced but the yankees had come up with something new something that made them harder to shoot down they flew in groups of four two pairs of two separated by the radius of a tight turn whenever he drew a bead on one plane the enemy pilots in the more distant pair would turn sharply toward him that move warned the man hed targeted to turn away sharply spoiling his aim and if he pursued too far trying to get it back he came right into the line of fire of the more distant pair the first time the americans tried that weave on him he almost shot himself down walking right into it he thought theyd got lucky then when they did it twice more in quick succession he realized it wasnt luck theyd worked out a tactic to take advantage of the wildcats powerful guns and give it a chance to survive against the otherwise superior zero be careful he shouted to the pilots he led and warned them what to look for he hoped they would listen in the heat of battle who could tell not all the japanese had the chance to listen several zeros had already gone down the americans weave no doubt had done to them what it almost did to shindo but wildcats were also falling out of the sky and the ones that mixed it up with shindos zeros werent attacking the aichis and nakajimas that accompanied them those were the shipkillers the planes that had to get through at any cost bombs burst around the american carriers shindo saw no hits but even near misses would cause damage from casing fragments and from the effects of blast on enemy hulls a nakajima bn raced towards a carrier its torpedo splashed into the sea a heartbeat later the torpedo bomber turned into a fireball the torpedo was away though the carrier started to slew to starboard too late too slow the torpedo struck home just aft of amidships nothing wrong with japanese ordnanceshindo watched the explosion the enemy ship staggered like a prizefighter whod just taken a right to the chin banzai shindo yelled there in the cockpit banzai he lost sight of the carrier for a little while after that he was dealing with a wildcat that had somehow got separated from its comrades the pilot tried to dogfight him instead of diving away from trouble the yankee discovered what a lot of his countrymen had before him that didnt work a zero could turn inside a wildcat a zero could and shindo did he shot up the american plane till at last it nosed down and crashed into the ocean by then the americans on the carrier had got her moving again even if not at top speed saburo shindo gave american engineers and damagecontrol parties reluctant respect they knew their business here knowing it didnt help an aichi dive bomber swooped down out of the sky releasing its bomb at what seemed just above the height of the bridge as the aichi screamed away its prop and fixed landing gear almost skimming the waves the bomb hit dead center where the ship had staggered before she shuddered now she lost power and lay there dead in the water as flames leaped up from her that of course was an invitation to the japanese pilots another torpedo and what shindo thought was a bomb from a level bomber slammed home the carrier began to list heavily to port one down shindo thought two to go when minoru genda heard american planes were on the way he climbed out of the sickbay cot where hed been lying weak as he was it felt like a long climb too he found a box of gauze masks like the ones the pharmacists mates wore and fastened the ties around his ears masuku was the japanese name borrowed from the english here what are you doing you shouldnt be up and about kinjiru one of those pharmacists mates caught him in the act of leaving get back where you belong right this minute he was just a rating but thought his station gave him the right to boss officers around he was usually right too not here not now slowly but firmly genda shook his head no were going into battle they need me up there he had to stop and cough halfway through that but he spoke with great determination in your pajamas the pharmacists mate said genda looked down at himself then he spied his uniform jacket hanging on a hook welded to the sickbay door he threw it on over the thin cotton pajamas this will do now get out of my way if the pharmacists mate tried to stop him by force the man could genda didnt have the physical strength to oppose him but he had a blazing strength of will and the bigger healthier man gave way before him i might as well be japan against the united states he thought and headed for his battle station when he reached the bridge captain tomeo kaku took one look at him and snapped go below an order was an order dejectedly genda turned to go wait admiral yamamoto told him to kaku yamamoto went on gendasan is not as well as i wish he were but the illness affects only his body his mind remains what it always was and it is keen enough that i think he will be valuable here as you wish sir kaku answered most japanese officers would have left it there especially when a godlike man like yamamoto had spoken but akagi s new skipper showed he had nerve for he continued i was concerned for the commanders wellbeing sir he would be safer down in sick bay yamamoto laughed raucously if we are hit captain nothing and no one on this ship is safe or will you tell me im wrong he waited with a small sheepish smile kaku shook his head all right then yamamoto said lets get down to business shall we he moved aside half a pace to make room for genda beside him genda bowed and took his place yamamoto barked a question at a signals officer zuikaku and shokaku are properly dispersed from us and from each other oh yes sir the young lieutenant replied they are following your orders just as you gave them good yamamoto turned the word into a satisfied grunt we wont leave all our eggs in one basket for the yankees for gendas benefit he added theyve grouped their carriers very close together we have them all under attack and weve struck a hard blow against at least one im glad to hear it sir genda said wishing he could have had more to do with the operation under way before he could say anything else the thunder of antiaircraft guns from the screening ships and a moment later from akagi herself penetrated the steel and bulletproof glass armoring the carriers bridge all ahead full captain kaku called down the speaking tube to the engine rooms he stepped to the wheel i have the conn genda didnt like kaku as much as hed liked captain hasegawa whose outspokenness had got him sent back to japan no denying kaku could handle a ship though akagi was a converted battlecruiser but he handled her as if she were a destroyer sending her twisting this way and that across the broad expanse of the pacific none of which might matter even a sens worth no matter how swift she was no matter what kind of evasive action she took akagi was a tortoise when measured against the airplanes attacking her antiaircraft guns and most of all the zeros overhead would have the biggest say in whether she lived or died admiral yamamoto folded his arms across his broad chest weve done our part he said we have put this force in a position where it can achieve victory now we rely on the brave young men we have trained to give it to us yes sir genda said maybe i should have stayed below he thought what can i do up here the fight will go as it goes with me or without me a plane smashed into the pacific two or three hundred meters ahead of the akagi genda couldnt be sure whether it was american or japanese american he thought for after the column of seawater it kicked up subsided there was no flame floating on the ocean as if to show the contrast a zero went into the sea a moment later the stricken japanese fighter lit its own brief funeral pyre a second yankee carrier under attack sir the signals officer reported heavy american resistance they need to make a coordinated attack genda said torpedo planes and dive bombers together that way the enemy wont be able to concentrate on any one group send the message yamamoto told the signals officer send it in gendas name sir the lieutenant said in surprise im sure its not necessary admiral genda said quickly commander fuchida will have given the same orderhe knows all there is to know about these attacks send it yamamoto repeated the americans already know where akagi istheyve proved that and fuchida and everyone to whom he relays the message will be glad to hear gendasan is on his feet domo arigato genda whispered and punctuated the words with a couple of coughs torpedo in the water on the port side captain kaku was swinging the helm hard to port even before that alarmed cry rang out genda didnt know whether he would have swung the carrier into the torpedos track or away from it his specialties were air power and attack planning hed never been anything more than an ordinary shiphandler tomeo kaku was definitely out of the ordinary he hesitated not even for an instant wrenching akagi around so she offered the torpedo the smallest possible target now genda could see the wake drawing closer with hideous inevitability the track looked very straightbut the torpedo slid past missing by no more than five or ten meters not bad captain for all the excitement in yamamotos voice he might have been talking about the soup course at a fancy dinner two american torpedo planes went into the drink in quick succession both before they could launch the yankees were still flying the hopelessly slow douglas devastators theyd used when the war broke out the pilots in them were brave men they had to be because they attacked in flying death traps the devastator was far slower and less agile than the nakajima bn like most american planes it could take a lot of battle damagebut not as much as the zeros and the ships antiaircraft guns were dishing out another torpedo plane crashed and then another i hope they havent drawn all the fighters down to the deck with them genda said well need some up high for top cover against dive bombers send that too yamamoto told the signals officer he gave genda a smile you see you are earning your keep thank you for coming up thank you sir genda said im sure someone else would have thought of it if i hadnt admiral yamamoto shook his head im not too much going on in the heat of battle people get excited pursuing the enemy and make mistakes they get so caught up in the now they forget what may happen five minutes further down the line torpedo the cry rang out again in spite of everything the japanese could do another devastator had got a fish in the water ill tend to it captain kaku said then he laughed it was gallows humor as he proved a moment later and if i dont you can tie me to the wheel and ill go down with the ship that is not a good tradition yamamoto said severely not at all the empire loses brave able men who could still serve it well kaku only shrugged you may be right sir but its a way for officers to atone for failure better than living in disgrace neh he didnt wait for an answer but spun the wheel hard akagi answered the helm more slowly than a destroyer would have but still turned into the path of the oncoming torpedo as she swung that way her new skipper let out a sigh of relief track on this ones not as straight as the last one was shell miss us by plenty plenty was about a hundred meters or less than half the carriers length maybe captain kaku was trying to impress yamamoto with his coolness or maybe he really did have more than his fair share so far so good genda thought then in almost the same instant he heard the shout he really dreaded helldivers mitsuo fuchidas bb still had bombs left in the bomb bay that kept him loitering over the battle above the american fleet in the hope of doing more harm actually he wasnt sure he or any of the other level bombers had done the yankees any harm yet he knew theyd scored near misses hits he shrugged in the cockpit moving targets were much tougher than ships tied up in a harbor next time itll be all torpedo planes and dive bombers he thought with a twinge of regret well save the level bombers for shore installations see anything behind us mizuki he called through the intercom he checked six whenever he could but mizuki faced that way all the time no sir the radioman answered pretty quiet up here not a lot of wildcats left he was right most of the fighters that had flown over the american fleet had gone into the pacific too many zeros and japanese attack aircraft had gone down with them thoughtoo many skilled pilots too no one could say the americans hadnt fought hard no one could say they werent brave either theyd done everything with their wildcats anyone could imagine and a little more besides and it hadnt been enough one of their aircraft carriers smashed by torpedoes and bombs had already sunk another lay dead in the water burning from stem to stern they were abandoning ship there and the last enemy carrier had taken at least two bomb hits damagecontrol parties on that ship must have worked like fiends for she wasnt burning but she wouldnt be operating aircraft for quite a while either not with those holes in her flight deck she wouldnt two us destroyers and a bigger shipa cruiser or a battlewagonhad also taken damage fuchida was inclined to shrug them off they were small change in a modern naval battle an aichi dove on the surviving carrier it got shot down before it could drop its bomb fuchida cursed he spoke to his bombardier im going to make one last run at that ship myself give it what we have left hai commander the bombardier answered i am ashamed not to have served my country and the emperor better dont be fuchida said youve done everything as best you could war is a hard business and were going to have to revise some of our doctrine no shame no blame if there is blame it goes to me for not flying the plane straighter thank you sir thank you very much the bombardier said youre kinder than i deserve fuchida concentrated on going straight over the surviving us carrier he had no more bombers following him formations had broken down during the past wild he looked at his wristwatch could this fight have lasted only fortyfive minutes so the watch insisted he couldnt say it was wrong but he felt as if hed aged years ready there he called to the bombardier coming up on the target yes sir bombs free the nakajima rose as the bombs fell with the whole bomb load and a lot of its fuel gone it was as light and lively as it would ever be weve done everything we can do here fuchida said time to go home now yes sir the bombardier said again and then in sudden excitement hit thats a hit was it fuchida had thought theyd made hits before only to watch us warships steam on apparently undamaged why should it be any different here another look at his fuel gauge told him he didnt really want to linger to find out he swung the bn south japanese warplanes were leaving the battle by ones and twos and forming into larger groups as they flew aichis and nakajimas protected by zeros too many japanese planes and pilots werent leaving the battle at all but theyd done what they set out to do without air cover the yankees couldnt possibly hope to invade hawaii and their air cover was smashed to smithereens then another question occurred to him how were his sides carriers faring the first dive bombers called helldivers had been biplanes a movie about them was one of the things that interested the japanese in the technique not least because of the film japanese navy men still often called any dive bomber a helldiver only in nightmares had minoru genda ever imagined helldivers screaming down on a ship in which he served a bomb burst just off to port the great gout of water it threw up drenched everyone on the bridge it soaked gendas masuku too he took the worthless cloth thing off and threw it away an ensign was rubbing at admiral yamamotos dress uniform with a towel yamamoto shoved the youngster away saying never mind i dont have to be pretty to fight a war engine roaring the dive bomber streaked away just above wavetop height two zeros pursued it they quickly shot it down but it had already done what it set out to do captain kaku swung akagi hard to port someone on the bridge made a questioning noise kaku said they will expect me to turn away from the bomb burst so i will turn towards it maybe i will throw off their aim no one else said a word not even yamamoto kaku was akagi s skipper how she was handled rested on his shoulders and when a bomb burst to starboard even closer than the first one had to port everybody cheered an explosion so close was liable to damage the hull but the carriers crew could repair wounds like that at their leisure sir zuikaku is hit the signals officer reported to yamamoto two bombs through the flight deckmajor damage before yamamoto could answer another american dive bomber stooped on akagi captain kaku was already swinging the carrier toward the last burst maybe the american pilot guessed with him this time maybe his luck just ran out either way the bomb hit the carrier a few meters ahead of the forwardmost elevator deck planking jagged chunks of the steel beneath it and flightcrew men all flew through the air genda braced for yet another bomb but no more came a plane crashed into the sea not far from the wounded akagi genda thought it was a dive bomber but he couldnt be sure flightcrew men dragged hoses across the deck toward the hole in the ship down below damagecontrol parties would be doing what they could to restore and repair can we land planes the signals officer asked our strike force is coming home we can land them genda said i wouldnt want to try to launch but we can landif we dont get hit again that is he cast a wary eye up to the heavens but it seemed as if no more dive bombers would come roaring down on the akagi he dared hope not anyhow and then word came from the flight deck the surviving american planes were flying north genda wondered where they would land with two of their carriers destroyed and the third crippled maybe they would ditch in the pacific as the crews from the bs had done that would save some of the fliers even if the planes were lost he looked out at the flightcrew men and damagecontrol parties working on akagi he thought of the pounding zuikaku had taken and he thought of what the japanese strike force had done to the american carriers turning to admiral yamamoto he said sir this fight reminds me too much of a duel of submachine guns at three paces somber pride in his voice captain kaku said maybe so but we had the better gunners today today yes yamamoto said but it wasnt quite agreement for he went on what will the americans throw at us the next time what will we have to answer saburo shindo wasnt sure how many wildcats hed shot down three he thought but it might have been two or four or maybe if he was very lucky even five all knew was his zero still flew and some americans didnt quite a few japanese didnt either nothing had come cheap today the americans had fought ferociously theyd fought ferociouslyand theyd lost what japan had paid was worth the price the invasion fleet behind the carriers wherever it was would come no farther shindo was sure of that without air superiority trying a landing on oahu was an invitation to suicide attention attention a radio alert blared in his earphones planes from zuikaku divert to shokaku or akagi attention attention planes from zuikaku divert to shokaku or akagi zakennayo he muttered so the yankees strike force had done damage too that was unfortunate the americans might bewereclumsy and none too skillful but theyd given it everything they had not enough though they had no carriers left that could land planes while japan still had two if all the japanese planes from the strike force had come home safely akagi and shokaku wouldnt have been able to accommodate them as things were that wouldnt be a problem and here came the survivors from the us attack heading north toward who could say what they were scattered all over the sky shindo saw enemy fighters and dive bombersno torpedo planes had the defenders knocked down all of them he wouldnt have been surprised the devastator couldnt get out of its own way shindo dove on a dive bomber he didnt think the douglas dauntless pilot saw him till he opened fire and maybe not even then the american plane never tried to take evasive action it heeled to the right and arced down into the sea one more small victory shindo flew on towards akagi while mitsuo fuchida was in combat hedmostlyforgotten about the ache in the right side of his belly he couldnt ignore it any more it felt as if an angry dragon had sunk its teeth in there and didnt want to let go i have one thing left to do he told himself i have to get this plane down my radioman and my bombardier are depending on me after that after that he intended to head for sick bay as fast as he could go genda and me he thought were two of a kind he wondered how his friend was doing his first glimpse of akagi came as a shock because she was landing planes hed assumed shed come through the american attack unscathed now he found out what such assumptions were worth had that bomb struck near the stern instead of at the bow the whole strike force would have been trying to come down on shokaku and wouldnt that have been a lovely mess a zero landed on akagi fuchida circled waiting his turn and watching the fuel gauge he was low but not too low he could last long enoughhe hoped an aichi dive bomber followed the fighter down men from the flight crew hustled to get each new arrival off to one side and clear the flight deck for the next another zero landed was that lieutenant shindos plane fuchida thought so but he couldnt be sure he couldnt be sure of anything except how much he hurtand that his turn came next he lined up on akagi s stern with extrafussy care he always hated to get waved off and have to go around again feeling the way he did right now he hated the idea ten times as much the landing officer signaled that he was a little high obediently he brought the bns nose down no arguments today whatever the landing officer wanted the landing officer would get down came the bomber straight and true fuchida checked once moreyes hed lowered his wheels the landing officer signaled for him to land he dove for the deck a carrier landing was always a controlled crash most of the time controlled was the key word here for fuchida crash counted for more the impact made him groan the world turned gray for a moment the nakajimas tailhook caught an arrester wire the bomber jerked to a stop as color returned to things fuchida remembered to kill the engine he was proud of himself for that he slid back the canopy and moving like an old man got down from the plane one of the flight crew whod come to push the bomber out of the landing path looked at him and exclaimed are you all right commander so sorry but no fuchida answered as his crewmen also left the bn are you wounded no sick belly every word took effort dont worry sir well get you to sick bay the man from the flight crew said and the sailors did helping him down to the compartment usually it was almost empty wounded men crowded it now had akagi caught fire the place would have been a death trap damage control must have done a good job a doctor in surgical whites eyed fuchida from over a masuku whats the trouble he asked fuchida explained his symptoms in a few words the doctor said ah so desu could be your appendix lie down where fuchida askedthe beds were all full on the deck the doctor sounded impatient fuchida obeyed the doctor peeled him out of his flight suit and jabbed a thumb into his belly between his navel and his right hipbone does that hurt fuchida didnt bounce off the steel ceiling though why he didnt he couldnt have said he didnt scream eitheranother marvel in lieu of that shriek he gasped hai well its got to come out cant leave it in thereliable to kill you if we do the doctor sounded perfectly cheerful why not it wasnt his appendix fuchida lay on the deck till the doctors got another surgical case off one of the operating tables they helped him onto it the fellow whod poked him in the belly stuck an ether cone over his face the stuff made him think he was being asphyxiated he feebly tried to fight back the struggle was the last thing he remembered as blackness swept over him the b f irvine s engine started thudding away again for all it was worth lester dillon had served aboard warships he didnt think much of freighters he doubted this one could make better than fifteen knots unless you threw her off a cliff by the racket and the vibration she was sure as hell trying now hed gone to the head a couple of times otherwise hed stayed in the poker game he would have been a fool to bail out he was up close to two hundred bucks you could have a hell of a good time in honolulu for a couple of hundred bucks when he said as much though dutch wenzel looked up from his cards and asked who says were still heading for hawaii well fuck dillon said that was a damn good question he waited till the hand was done he dropped out early dutch ended up taking it with three queens then les stood and stretched im going up on deck see what i can find out ill come with you wenzel said which effectively broke up the poker game everybody pocketed his cash the cards belonged to dillon he stuck them in his hip pocket and headed for the narrow steel stairway up to the b f irvine s deck sailors in tin hats manned hastily mounted antiaircraft guns les didnt laugh out loud even if he felt like it the swabbies didnt look as if theyd ever drawn that duty before marines could have done it a hell of a lot better but dillon hadnt come up there to scoff at the sailors he glanced at his watch half past three he looked at the sun astern and a little to starboard he swore in disgust were heading east he said spitting out the words as if they tasted badand they did fucking east goddammit were running away like sons of bitches a petty officer hurrying by paused he might have been thinking about chewing dillon out but either a look at the platoon sergeants stripes or a look at the other marine with him changed the ratings mind all he said was you aint got the word down there dillon jerked a thumb toward the passageway from which hed just emerged shit no navy they dont even give us the time of day down there what is the skinny two carriers sunktwo of ours i meanand the third one smashed to hell and gone god only knows how many pilots lost the petty officer spoke with the somber relish contemplating a really large disaster can bring he went on we hurt the japs somedont know just how much it doesnt look like theyre chasing us why the hell should they when we aint got any air support left sure as hell cant go on without it so were heading back to port fast as we can go oughta be zigzagging then said dillon remembering his trip over there as a young man otherwise were liable to make some jap sub drivers day the navy man pointed to the bridge you wanna go talk to the skipper hes just dying to hear from you i bet were all liable to be dying dillon said but he took not one step in the direction the petty officer had indicated would a navy officer listen to a jarhead sergeant fat chance anyhow all the troopships should have been zigzagging not just the b f irvine he took another look down the deck along with the men at the antiaircraft guns the ship did have sailors at the rail some with binoculars looking for periscopes that was better than nothing how much better time would tell behind him dutch wenzel started swearing with a sudden impassioned fury whats eating you les asked if id known we were gonna get our butts kicked here i wouldve let em make me a gunny wenzel answered we wont be coming back this way for a whilebetter believe we wont when we do well have some of the new fish with us too i couldve got that new rocker and still had a chance to hit hawaii oh dillon said yeah hadnt even thought of that he too contemplated rank gone glimmering too late to worry about it now and it aint the biggest worry weve got right now either maybe well get another crack at it once we make it back to base if we make it back to base he added to himself vince monahan came up on deck lets pick up the game again you guys have got a chunk of my money and i aim to get it back again les said just dont shoot at the japs with aim like that they went below reclaimed their spotno mere privates had presumed to occupy itand got down to business dillon took out the cards my deal this time i think joe crosetti and orson sharp listened to the bad news coming out of the radio in their room the saratoga and the yorktown are definitely known to be lost lowell thomas said in mournful even sepulchral tones the hornet has suffered severe damage at the hands of the japanese while two cruisers and a destroyer were also hit by jap aircraft our own gallant fliers inflicted heavy blows on the enemy fleet they struck at least two and maybe three jap carriers as well as several other enemy warships that was all good but nowhere near good enough the american carriers should have knocked out their japanese rivals then gone on to gain dominance over whatever landbased planes the japs had in hawaii the plan must have looked good when the american fleet set out from the west coast unfortunately the japs had had plans of their own thomas continued admiral chester w nimitz who commanded the american task force has issued the following statement our movement toward the hawaiian islands has failed to gain a satisfactory position and i have withdrawn our ships my decision to attack at this time and in this way was based on the best information available the navy and the air did all that bravery and devotion to duty could do if any blame or fault attaches to the attempt it is mine alone a singing commercial extolling the virtues of shaving cream came on orson sharp said well you cant stand up and take the heat any better than that yeah joe said glumly i only wish he didnt have to what the hell went wrong he often felt funny about cussing around his roommate because sharp so scrupulously didnt he couldnt help himself today god damn it we were supposed to whip them i think we sold them short again sharp said we didnt figure theyd have the nerve to attack hawaii at all and then they did and they licked us there and in the philippines and down in the south seas but they had numbers and surprise on their side wed lick em if we ever got em evensteven well sure joe said but it hadnt turned out to be well sure the american carrier force and the japanese had met on equal terms and the japs had come out on top that wasnt just shocking it was mortifying patiently sharp said looks to me like we sent a boy to do a mans job we wanted to do something fast pay the japs back for what they did to us and we tried it and it didnt work well try againwe have to try again i just hope we do it right next time instead of fast joe eyed his roomie when the next war comes you want thomas or h v kaltenborn or whoevers in back of the microphone to go admiral sharp has issued the following statement dont you not if its a statement explaining why what we tried didnt work sharp replied he didnt make a big fuss about things he hardly ever did but he had his eye on one of the top prizes sure as the devil joe owned no ambition higher than roaring off the deck of a carrier and mowing down zeros one after another the way sharp thought about the bigger picture and how things fit together made him want to do the same lowell thomas returned he talked about big german advances in southern russia and about the afrika korps push to alamein the next stop after that was alexandria and the nile the upcoming fourth of july holiday he went on promises to be the most anxious for this great nation since that of when meades army met robert e lees at a little pennsylvania town called gettysburg gettysburg joe echoed to all but a dying handful of graybeards it was only a name from a history book none of his family had been on this side of the atlantic when men in blue and men in gray tried to kill one another with muzzleloading muskets and cannon the weapons by modern standards were laughable the fury with which the soldiers on both sides had wielded them was anything but well do what we need to do sharp said if it takes a little longer than we figured at firstthen it does thats all when the federals marched down to bull run they thought theyd win in a hurry too it didnt work like that but they didnt lose either not in the end youve got a good way of looking at things you know joe said his roomie shrugged hey i wish wed done it the easy way believe me if we have to do it the hard way then we do thats all joe eyed him anybody ever tell you youre too sensible for your own good besides you you mean sharp asked laughing joe nodded the other cadet said oh ive heard it a few times but my guess is the people who say it arent sensible enough he sounded dead serious that only made joe laugh harder he said god help the japs when we turn you loose on them now orson sharp was the one who laughed and joe had been joking but while hed been joking he probably hadnt been kidding how many pilots had the navy lost in the failed attack on hawaii too damn manyjoe was sure of that a lot of what had been the first team wasnt there any more if the united states tried againno when the united states tried again for he too was sure the country woulda lot of the guys who flew off the flattops would be rookies like him yeah he thought just like me for the first time in kenzo takahashis life the fourth of july wasnt a holiday it was a little slower than usual because it was a saturday but no firecrackers spit and snarled no fireworks displays were scheduled for the evening no admirals and generals made pompous boring speeches about the land of the free and the home of the brave instead both the advertiser and the starbulletin ran banner headlines great japanese victory and japan saves hawaii respectively both got more paper than the occupying authorities normally doled out to them the japanese wanted them to make a big fuss about this japaneselanguage newspapers shouted even louder kenzo wanted to believe all the shouts were a pack of lies he wanted to but he couldnt it wasnt just that no american planes appeared over oahu and no american fighting men splashed ashore word always got around when the japanese were telling tall tales kenzo wasnt sure how he supposed some people still had shortwave sets and listened to news from the mainland even if they took their lives in their hands when they did it he kept hoping he would hear that japan was inventing a battle that hadnt happened or exaggerating about one that hadnt gone so well he kept hoping but nobody said anything like that it looked as if those gloating headlines were nothing but the truth his father had no doubts jiro takahashi rubbed it in you see he said as he and kenzo and hiroshi lined up for their rice that evening you see this is what happens when the united states fights japan twice now big battlesand who won who won eh japan won thats who banzai kenzo said sourly that only made his old man mad hed known it would which was why he did it you should always say that with respect with spirit jiro growled you dont joke around with it kenzo hadnt been joking before he could say so hiroshi stuck an elbow in his ribs he gave his brother an et tu brute look but hiroshi only shook his head ever so slightly and kenzo realized his brother was right if he sounded too american somebody in earshot was liable to report him to the occupying authorities his father wouldntthey might disagree they might quarrel but he knew his old man would never betray him some stranger who might get some cash or some extra food though yeah kenzo said in english thanks dont worry about it hiroshi told him what are you two going on about their father asked neither one of them answered he sniffed youre so proud of your english how much good does english do you now they didnt answer that sally either the line snaked forward kenzo held out his bowl for rice and vegetables some people had to live on this and nothing else kenzo would have been happy out on the pacific now not just for the sake of food but because he and his father didnt fight so much when they had bait and hooks and ahi and aku and lines and sails to talk about everything came back to politics on dry land and everything that had to do with politics was going his old mans way once he got fed he took the bowl off by himself to eat in peace he even waved hiroshi away when his brother started to follow him hiroshi just shrugged and found somewhere else to go to kenzos relief his father didnt come after him a lot of the trees that had been proud parts of the botanical garden were long since gone to firewood shrubs and bushes and ferns persisted why not they werent worth pulling up and burning he sat down on the grass close by a jungly clump and started eating with automatic ease he scooped up rice with his hashi and brought it to his mouth he started to laugh not that it was funny he told anybody whod listen that he was an american no matter what he told people what was he doing sitting on the ground and eating rice with chopsticks circumstances seemed to be conspiring to turn him into a jap no matter what he wanted he told himself elsie sundberg wouldnt think so no matter what he told himself he had a hard time believing it after what had happened out in the pacific shed probably figure him for a jap now no matter what hed told her and if she didnt her folks would at just short of twenty gloom came easily getting rid of it was harder kenzo washed his bowl after he finished eating the chopsticks were cheap bamboo even here even now they werent in short supply he threw them in a corrugatedmetal trash can then he looked west toward pearl harbor no no fireworks tonight the us navy was gone from these parts everything else that had to do with the united states seemed gone too so where was there a place for a person of japanese blood who thought he had the right to be an american anywhere at all minoru genda coughed behind his masuku admiral yamamoto looked around akagi s wardroom with affectionate amusement is this an afteraction conference or a sickbay gathering he asked sorry sir genda said if not for the conference he would have been back in sick bay commander fuchida sprawled across three chairs at the doctors orders he was a long way from being over his appendectomy captain ichibei yokokawa of zuikaku had a bandaged left shoulder a ricocheting bullet from a wildcat had wounded him he was lucky it had lost most of its momentum before striking acaliber round could kill from shock without penetrating anything vital of course if he were really lucky he wouldnt have been wounded at all we did what we set out to do when we sought this battle yamamoto said the americans will not come forward they will not invade hawaii the islands will remain our bastion not theirs well done captain tomeo kaku said and i say well done to the crews of shokaku and zuikaku in particular however fine the ships are they are new and their crews do not have so much experience working as a team as akagi s does but no one will say they are not veterans now arigato said captain jojima takatsugu of shokaku captain yokokawa started to nod his thanks then grimaced and thought better of it eyeing that thick pad of bandages on his shoulder genda couldnt blame him we are not finished though yamamoto said sternly this is a victory but not one that will end the war the americans paid a high price but they will be back when they feel strong enough we have to see what we paid what we can do to make good our losses and how best to face the yankees when they returnfor they will are you sure sir captain kaku asked how many times must we crush them before they know we are their masters how many times yamamoto shrugged i dont know i do know that what weve done so far isnt enough we have awakened a sleeping giant and we have yet to see everything he can do what is our best course then sir genda asked to make these islands strong to make the fleet that protects them strong yamamoto replied american arms factories and shipyards are just now getting up to full war production what we have seen is not a patch on what we will see fuchidasan yes sir fuchida still sounded fuzzyfrom painkillers genda suspectedbut yamamotos voice could and would galvanize anybody what were our aircraft losses asked the commander of the combined fleet just over a hundred planes admiral fuzzy or not fuchida had the numbers he needed at his fingertips anyone who came to a meeting with yamamoto unprepared deserved whatever happened to him the admiral grunted could have been worse i suppose but these were highly trained men some of the best we had how soon can we replace them and how good will the replacements be as for numbers sir we can replace them as soon as the new pilots and radiomen and bombardiers arrive from japan fuchida replied quality quality is harder to gauge nothing but experience can make a man a veteran the fliers from shokaku and zuikaku know this now hai yamamoto said noncommittally he rounded on captain yokokawa how long before zuikaku is back in service sir shell have to return to japan for repairs yokokawa answered theres no help for it were lucky we kept her afloat after the pounding she took the americans pressed their attacks with all their strength another grunt from yamamoto he hadnt been aboard zuikaku or seen for himself how she was fought all he could know was that shed taken much more damage than either of the other japanese carriers he said a pity the americans did such a good job of wrecking the navy yard here before they surrendered they were thorough genda agreed have the engineers looked at what wed need to do to get the yard operational gendas specialty was air operations but he was also the man with the answers yamamotos wasnt the only head to turn his way he said sir im told its not practical since we would have to bring all our fuel from japan you might want to talk with the engineers though to see if things have changed since the last time i checked with them ill do that yamamoto said having to take a ship back more than five thousand kilometers to get it repaired is inefficient to say the least the americans had no trouble maintaining a yard here captain takatsugu said what they can do we should be able to do too just for a moment admiral yamamoto looked angry genda knew what to watch for and when to look the eyebrows that came together the lips that thinned the expression vanished almost as fast as it appeared but yamamoto did not care for officers who failed to think things through before they spoke the americans are only a little more than half as far from hawaii as we are and they have more fuel than they know what to do with they had no trouble shipping some of it here we on the other hand he didnt go on or need to had the usa not cut off oil shipments to japan the war never would have started if everything went well from here on out japan wouldnt have to depend on a rival for the oil she desperately needed the formerly dutch east indies would see to that yamamoto let captain takatsugu down easy we fought well he said as long as we do that all will be well for us hai several officers agreed with that some of them sounded relieved too turning to captain kaku yamamoto said i am pleased at how well the damagecontrol parties have worked here on akagi that she can launch planes again is a credit to her officers and men thank you very much sir kaku modestly looked down at his hands we were lucky that only one bomb hit us and the repairs of course are emergency makeshifts she needs much more work that was an understatement genda had seen the gaping hole in the hangar deck the bomb would have done even more damage had it struck while planes were stored there and not in combat i understand yamamoto said but youve done whats essential if the ship has to fight she can i dont expect the americans to come back to these waters for some time but i might be wrong in case i am well need every carrier and every plane we can get our hands on genda looked north and east he didnt expect the americans back any time soon either theyd just had a lesson now they knew how much they didnt know about conducting carrier operations with luck that would be enough to keep them thoughtful for some time in the meanwhile japan would grow stronger and so would her grip on hawaii admiral yamamoto dismissed the meeting shokaku s skipper and zuikaku s went over the side and down to the boats waiting to carry them back to their carriers genda stood with fuchida on the akagi s battered flight deck because of the stitches in his belly fuchida listed to starboard the deck put genda in mind of a man whod had a head injury and went around forever afterwards with a steel plate in his skull the repairs here were ugly but they were functional even through the masuku genda tasted the sweetness of the tropical air he asked fuchida how are you doing not so well his friend answered but im getting better how about you the same more or less genda said we made it through the fight thats the most important thing now we take our time recovering fuchida nodded thats right he looked back toward some of the planes parked on the flight deck near akagi s stern from now on i think wed better equip all the nakajimas with torpedoes in a sea fight they have a much better chance of scoring a hit than level bombers do put it in your action report fuchidasan genda said it makes good sense to me as long as we dont dither between one and the other well be all right that would be bad wouldnt it fuchida said suppose the enemy caught us while we were switching from bombs to torpedoes in combat can you imagine what a helldiver hit would do then he shuddered at the idea so did genda a carrier caught betwixt and between like that would go up like an ammunition dumpwhich in effect she would be no damagecontrol party in the world could hope to save her with a deliberate effort of will he made himself dismiss the frightening possibility it didnt happen he said firmly it wont happen either being able to walk straight felt wonderful to mitsuo fuchida the three weeks since his appendectomy felt like forever but the doctors had finally taken the stitches out of his abdomen the one who did the work said if people look at you when you go to the public baths you can tell them you started to commit seppuku but changed your mind hed chortled loudly fuchida didnt think it was so funny for one thing the scar wasnt quite in the right place for that for another the feel of the sutures sliding through his flesh as the doctor snipped them and pulled them out one by one wasnot painful but distinctly unpleasant now he strode across the lawn to one side of iolani palace toward the folding chairs set up there genda and the two lieutenant colonels minami and murakami rose to greet him they bowed so did he it made his belly twinge but only a little the coronation pavilion hadnt been used for its original function for most of a lifetime it hadnt gone altogether unused since then though king david kalakaua had built it directly in front of the palace connecting it to the veranda there with a bridge after he held his coronation ceremony in the pavilion was moved to the side and became the home of the royal hawaiian band now it would again see the crowning of a monarch of sorts fuchida wasnt sorry to sink into a chair by gendawho still wore his masuku and the two army officers other japanese military men including admiral yamamoto whod stayed in honolulu for the ceremony and general yamashita filled most of the seats on the left side of the aisle others were taken by representatives from the foreign ministry and by allied diplomats men from germany and italy from romania and hungary and bulgaria from croatia and vichy france from manchukuo and siam from the japanese puppet government of china in nanking and from the even less powerful authorities japan had set up with the aid of nationalists in burma malaya and the philippines on the right side of the aisle sat local dignitaries some hawaiian noblemen and women some members of the former territorial legislature most but not all of them of japanese blood a couple of justices from the former territorial supreme court judges from lesser courts some of them were japanese too and one an immense hawaiian and various other prominent people fuchida was a little surprised at how many haoles had chosen to attend the men in formalwear often even including top hats the woman in fancy gowns most of them of glowing silk some people were conspicuous by their absence fuchida leaned toward genda and murmured i see abigail kawananakoa decided not to come genda nodded none of the other candidates we interviewed is here either did you expect anything different no not really fuchida admitted im glad this many of the hawaiian alii did show up he chuckled now the ones who did and the ones who didnt can start cutting each other dead at parties his friend laughed at that till he started to cough he sent fuchida a reproachful stare once the spasm passed see what you made me do so sorry fuchida said they grinned at each other under the ribbed copper dome of the coronation paviliondecorated with hawaiian coats of arms and supported by eight concrete columnsstood the anglican bishop of honolulu in full ecclesiastical regalia fuchida wondered how the haole had been persuaded to officiate maybe stanley owana laanui had taken care of that fuchida suspected the bishop would have been more likely to listen to him than to the japanese occupying authorities or maybe the occupiers had just held a gun to his head and told him that doing what he needed to do would improve his chances of living to get a little grayer he was here that was what counted the royal hawaiian band was here too though displaced from its usual venue the bandmaster raised his baton the band struck up a tune fuchida would not have recognized it but he knew what it was hawaii ponoi the hawaiian national anthem was particularly appropriate to the occasion with words by king david kalakaua and music by henry berger the forkbearded prussian whod created the royal hawaiian band on the right side of the aisle people sang in both hawaiian and english fuchida caught some of the latter hawaiis own true sons be loyal to your chief the countrys liege and lord the chief he nodded to himself yes that fit the spirit of the day very well and here came the coronation procession first were the bearers of the royal insignia both imported and native one man carried the dovetopped royal scepter another on a velvet cushion the golden ring of state two more bore puloulous tabu staffs ornamented by crowns of black and white cloth that showed the world the kings sacrosanctity behind them walked a hawaiian noblewoman carrying the royal cloak made entirely of yellow mamo feathers the mamo had been hunted into extinction for those feathers of which each bird had only tiny patches under the wings the feather cloak was almost extinct too it had been taken out of the bishop museumover the curators loud objectionsfor the occasion more hawaiian nobles followed they had attendants bearing kahili which reminded fuchida of nothing so much as the sponges on sticks used to swab out cannon here though the sponge part was replaced by red and yellow feathers which produced a much more pleasing effect two of the nobles carried the royal crowns which were made on the european pattern though decorated with golden taro leaves and studded with diamonds opals emeralds rubies pearlsand kukui nuts and behind them marched stanley owana laanui himself in white tie and tails with him came the prospective queen of the restored kingdom of hawaii cynthia laanui was a smiling busty redhead only a little more than half her husbands age fuchida had no trouble figuring out what he saw in her what she saw in him might be a different question altogether the new royal couple went up the halfdozen steps that led into the coronation pavilion the noblewoman who bore the royal cloak carefully draped it over stanley owana laanuis shoulders the cloak fell to his ankles it was without a doubt an impressive garment and one no sovereign anywhere in the world could match stanley laanui took the ring of state and set it on his right index finger he grasped the scepter in his right hand let us pray the bishop of honolulu said raising his hands in benediction he went on may the lord bless us and keep us may he make his face shine upon us and give us peace and may he find good what we do here today this we ask in the holy name of our savior his son jesus christ amen amen the response came from the right side of the audience from some of the diplomats on the left side and from the new royal couple fuchida nodded once more the prayer said enough to satisfy the occupying authorities yet not so much as to make a mockery of the bishops conscience if as was likely he didnt favor the japanese cause wearing no expression whatever the bishop set one crown on stanley owana laanuis head the other on cynthia laanuis flaming locks god bless the king and queen of hawaii he said in a voice also empty of everything flashbulbs popped newsreel cameras had been grinding away all along the audience applauded perhaps more politely than enthusiastically fuchida and genda minami and murakami looked at one another and smiled as they clapped theyd got the job done i thank you king stanley said looking out over his subjectsand his masters the american annexation and occupation of hawaii were not only illegal and immoral but also disastrous for the hawaiian people there are less than half as many hawaiians alive today as there were fifty years ago is that why you have a redheaded queen fuchida wondered stanley owana laanui went on now that these islands are free again i intend to make them into a kingdom that can feed itself and support itself instead of being caught like a fly in a spiderweb of ties to the mainland cooperation with the greater east asia coprosperity sphere will help hawaii to achieve this goal that was nicely done he admitted being a puppet without ever naming japan now we do not have to pretend to be americans any more he saidin english did he notice the irony or did it slide past him fuchida couldnt be sure the new king was shrewd but whether he was really clever was much less obvious he finished we may choose our own friends once more with the help of those friends we will continue to live untroubled lives here in the heart of the pacific thank you the kingdom of hawaiis friends had sunk two us carriers and smashed up a third as long as they could keep that up hawaii would remain untroubledby the americans anyhow as fuchida applauded once more he caught gendas eye now they had to make sure the newly revived kingdom stayed as independent as japan wanted it to beand not a bit more
