kings command if haply the sea subdued some renown could arise from so great a task argonautica book i valerius flaccus chapter dearest lewrie whispered into her sweetsmelling hair oh dearest god alan caroline responded in a like whisper though they could have shouted for all the clamor of a sloop of war readying to set sail my only love a few more minutes lewrie squirmed in rising impatience just a few minutes more and im safei think mostly anyway there were limits on how even the fondest captain and his wife could behave in public quite unlike the open bawling of wivesthe real helpmates or the feigned for profithad made when hms jester had at last lowered the easy pendant and put herself back into discipline and the men of the lower deck had bade farewell to their loved ones perhaps forever squealing mewling brats snuffly seamen and howling harridans appearing far older and weathered than their years cursed by fate theyd wed with sailors saying their own goodbyesalso perhaps forever left with a new babetobe a dubious pay certificate that would go for a quarter of its value with some agateeyed jobber a portion of their mans pay signed over with the councillor of the cheque and always and purposely six months in arrears a handful of solid coin perhaps since jester had been formally commissioned in a home port paid just before sailing so theyd not desert and of course the drunken shrieks of those harpies whod come aboard as wives as they would every vessel out of discipline that they could reach too drunk to know their tour of duty was over and shoveled back into the bumboats complaining loudly that theyd been shorted their due fee from their temporary husbands yesterday had been the hands turn for partings today it was the gunrooms unseemly weepings wailings and gnashing of teeth was not their way not in public at least tis been so good to have you home even for a few scant caroline shuddered i thought twould have been longer i wished i know dearest alan sighed shuddering himself as he used the wide brims of her stylish bonnet to screen them from the men in the waistto kiss her soft sweet lips just one more time though theyd sworn to settle for lastminute affection in his greatcabins but things went so hellish good so quickly i from the corner of his eye lewrie espied their new charge young sophie vicomtesse de maubeuge that unfortunate frail orphan of the terror and the evacuation of toulon wan pale well not that wan any longer in fact she was eyeing him with a suspiciousyet sadwell call it a leer damme if he couldnt he gulped down his terror of her should she ever reveal to caroline his carousing in the mediterranean with phoebe quick turn hugging caroline harder turning her so her back was to sophie and her almostmocking brow and to escape that lifted brow as well a few more minutes pray god he thought fervently off and away then and if it comes out im a thousand miles alee id hoped to be in port longer as well love get back to anglesgreen let you show me off hmm lewrie said essaying his most fetching grin to tease and dandle his way free and leave his lovely wife laughing get everything settled before damme sir down get down this instant what the bloody hell you think youre playing at young sir mon dieu merde alorsv sophie gasped hugh caroline shrieked baby dont movel lewries youngest son had gotten away from his watchers once more and had scaled the starboard mizzenmast ratlines again this time he was halfway to the fighting top alan sprang to the bulwarks getting a foot up on a carronade slidecarriage then the blunt iron barrel to swing into the shrouds and go aloft hang on lad dont go an inch higher hear me taut as the mizzen stays were set up as tensioned as they were through the deadeye blocks the shrouds thrummed and juddered as alan fearfully climbed ratlines quivering with each rushed step but daddy hugh protested aye he did have a good grip on stays and ratlines leaning into them his pudgy little fists were a pink pair of vises on the tarred ropes yet lewrie reached him came eye level with his son i told you he panted fuming i told you you will never do this its for seamen grown men but daddy tother boys hugh whined gesturing briefly to the clutch of snotnosed ships boys the usual mob of beaunasties carried on ships books as servants some of whom were only double the total of hugh lewries precocious and terrifying four years down i say lewrie barked now and carefully aww hugh grumbled casting one more wistful glance aloft to the topmast truck which had been his intent well at least the crosstrees if truth be told on deck at last smudged with tar and slushes caroline knelt at his side in a twinkling to coo and fret wondering whether hugh needed cosseting or another sound thrashing for foolishness and for smutting his best suit of clothing if nothing else msieur pardon sophie reddened ah tak ma eye off eem jus une moment et forgeev plais hmm i could use this lewrie thought though wishing to tear a strip off her hide as he would the merest menial no he decided jape his way out tug at her heartstrings and her remorse a thousand pardons captain lt ralph knolles said doffing his hat in concern that he might be found remiss i should have assigned a hand to shepherd the lads a topman it appears a topman indeed mister knolles lewrie grinned damme hes a little terror isnt he now we know where the next sailor in the familys to come from hey indeed sir knolles smiled in return with infinite relief mademoiselle sophie lewrie said turning to the girl of course youre forgiven nothing to forgive really as you become more familiar with us youll learn that hugh will ever be our mischievous little imp and a prankster you must watch out for that so he doesnt use you ill as boys are wont to dowith sisters from sewallis well hes the quiet sort im hoping youll be a civilizing influence upon hugh and an edifying one pon sewallis as one more beloved member of our house dear as an elder sister merci msieur sophie replied meekly all but chewing her lip in contriteness well then lewrie concluded heartily my dear perhaps we should bundle everyone into the buoytender before hugh discovers the powder room and erects a sand castle out of cartridges it was the perfect note to strike lewrie thought if he did say so himself dear as he loved his wife and childrenand he did in spite of his dalliancessweet as it had been to have them down from the country to portsmouth while jester had recruited and manned and as tender and passionate as alan and carolines reunion had beenwell damme if im not glad to see the back of em he thought a touch rueful hugh he called picking up the lad to bring him eye level again you be as good a boy as you can be considrin and i promise you when youre older next time im home hey therell be all the climbing aloft you want but not before i say hear me i promise daddy hugh replied and thank god hed finally learned how to pronounce his rs an then ill be a sea officer just like you the boy cried wriggling with delight that you will he agreed setting him down gods teeth whatd the boy expect anyway second son and all it was naval or military service for him and sewallis yes father his eldest replied ignored in all the confusion and almost shrugging into himself as the hands of the afterguard trudged by to stations as sailors and marines prepared to breast to the capstan bars to hoist anchor eyes darting constantly not out of boyish curiosity lewrie was certain but to see if he would be in the way thered been moments of folderol of high cockalorum between thembut only a fewsince hed been breeched such a grave lil man lewrie thought with a trace of sadness as he knelt by his side you make us proud at your school now hear me mind your mother i will sir sewallis gulped tearing up help make sophie feel welcome and one of us i will sir and keep an eye on hugh god knows it takes more than one pair now dont it alan joshed goodbye father sewallis suddenly wailed tears flowing for real and his solemn little face screwed up in pain he flung himself at lewrie who hugged him close wish you didnt have to go growl you may but go ye must sewallis lewrie told him as he patted his back hush now young gentlemen dont cry not in public at any rate talk to your puppies mayhap when things are dreadful theyll always cock an ear to you thats why i have that damned toulon hes a good listener in the main sewallis perhaps with good reason had an abiding fear of cats old william pitt sensing his shy nature had taken a perverse delight in tormenting him before hed passed over sewalliss happiest words all during lewries tooshort spell in harbor had been about dogs specifically the litter of setter pups a stray bitch had whelped in their barn toulon not to be outdone by his noble predecessor aft in the greatcabins had spent half of sewalliss times aboard playing pantherabouttopounce from any convenient high place or edging in close to stare at him when the family had dined aboard daddy sewallis shivered trying to form a thought that simmered in his little head some last meaningful declaration there there little lad alan said without listening as he let him go and stood up mind your way down the battens into the tender youre big enough now not to need a bosuns sling ill see to em sir maggie cony suggested with a knowing wink will an me cn cosset em inta th boat aye thankee kindly ma mistress cony lewrie amended her and conys own git birthed and back on her pins nigh on a

on em sir maggie promised as will is wont tsay and i on your man mistress lewrie promised in turn get him back to you a warranted bosun someday safe and sound that had been a proud and happy moment to stand up for cony in a dockside chapel as he took his bride at last foursquare in his best rig as boatswains mate a petty officer now though his swaddled son born during their last cruise aboard cockerel had not taken well to the festivities and had wailed through half of it adieu msieur sophie said wan and weepy once again her green eyes brimming bonne chance adieu mademoiselle adieu sophie alan replied giving her a hug too i trust youll fall in love with little anglesgreen and find peace and contentment there fall in love with our family too as they already have with you he stressed hoping to get one last hint driven home bonne chance she said again stepping back and dropping him an aristocratic curtsy in congй an merci beaucoup for aw you do pour moi msieur she rose and fixed him with a curious hard stare for a trice her fine reddishauburn hair flickering about her face and the shroud of her traveling cloaks hood her green eyes intent in her slim and gamin face poonish ze rйpublicains zat tuer zat keel ma charles msieur lewrie ah pray fo you success merci he nodded merci beaucoup caroline he gave her his arm to walk her to the starboard entry port and a waiting bosuns chair slung from aloft on the maincourse yard alan should the wind not serve she hinted desperately beat down to saint helens road my dear a few miles and layto till one comes fair he said a touch of severity in his voice admiral howe was lucky he had a favorable slant tother day and then off for gibraltar quick as dammit out of long habit he cast his eyes aloft to the impossibly long and curling coach whip of a commissioning pendant atop the mainmast truck then aft to the red ensign that flew over the taffrail on the flagstaff red for an independent ship one sailing free of fleet or squadron under admiralty orders a few days before portsmouth harbor had teemed with warships stately lstrate gunners nd rates rdrate s and frigates from the mouth of southampton water down into spithead west into the solent as far as bucklers hard now it yawned vast and empty the french were out and so was the channel fleet under elderly admiral howe but if admiralty orders dearest he sighed with dispatches aboard make the best of my way with all dispatch should the wind come useful wed cut cables instanter and scud out under jibs and spanker and no oned mind us losing our anchors long as the dispatches were on their way im sorry i truly am didnt mean tsound harsh he told himself mean evry word of it swear i do but there it is im sorry alan caroline replied weakly her lips atremble tis just that im selfish for one more hour half a day tis just as hard for me caroline he said with some heat meaning that too god help women who marry sailors even in time o peace were an undependable lot god help sailors six months from home too lewrie told himself ruefully them that cant keep their breeches flap buttoned or their hearts content with what waits for em at home hed played up bluff hearty and cheerful from his first sight of her praying he wouldnt give the game away some night in his sleep by muttering the wrong name in a moment of ecstasy or those first few muzzy moments pon waking why a mand be a fool who right then im a fool he thought always have been probably always will be a proper wife the mother of three fine children and thank god for small mercies that little charlotte was left ashore today at their lodgingsthe squally squawly chub he took carolines hands in his looked deep into her beautiful hazel eyes those merry loving eyes with the riant laughfolds beneath which reflected her warmth her caring giving cheerfulness in a face as slim and patrician as anyone at court for a year over the dreaded thirty caroline was as graceful as lithe and lovely as a swan sweet as swansdown to touch no this was no frumpy matron hed married not one to surrender easily to hearty country cooking and stoutness caroline ran the farm better than most men presented him with a clean orderly wellrun household as gracious as stylish as any greathouse in england though there had not been time to see it she swore that the gardens the new furnishings the finally finished salon and bedchambers for guests were marvels everything caroline turned her hand to was marvelous everyone said so since their first tumbledown gatehouse home on new providence shed been a wonder when it came to housewifery at hostinga spectacular blend of practical frugality when called for a commonsensical north carolina plantation domesticity allied with a rich planters a rich squires easy and noble airs a sensible woman wellread and so easy to talk to about silly things about matters of import beyond the stillroom nursery and bloody fashion tongueincheek waggish she could be too a grown womans wry and witty waggishness not the prattlings of some girlish chit fresh in her first season in society still redolent of milkpap and primerlevel humor light brown sandyblond hair still distressed into stylish witches ringlets for а la victime was still all the go a style that bared a graceful but strong neck and shoulders and ive cheated on her he wondered to himself of course why a mand be a total its time i fear beloved he sighed heavily else wed never and i know caroline whispered patting the broad dark blue lapels of his new uniform coat one last stroke of her gloved hand on his cheek one last proper public buss soft and fleeting on the lips at a proper distance at the entryport gate an incline of her head for a departing bow a doff of his new goldlaced hat with the wide gold tape about the brim so new it hadnt gone verdigris in salt air yet she accepted his help into the bosuns chair one last squeeze of adoring fingers as they had together once before so long ago at charleston after hed evacuated her family from the impending rebel takeover of wilmington twelve bloody years ago and a bit alan marveled in reverie winter o and fated tbe husband an wife een then damned if we didnt both know it too straightaway then up and away to a falsetto squeal of the staytackles blocks the creak of the maincourse yard as it swung her outboard oн jester s hull to dangle over the buoytender that was below the mainmast chain platform down there hugh was squirming against mrs cony to crane and see everything about a ship getting underway sewallis poor sad sewallis lewrie thought still doffing his hat to them all finding something new to be rueful about as he attempted to recall how much attention hed really given the lad prim as a parson face reddened by wind and emotion and about as screwed up as a hanged spanielslooking just about that happy too slim little scholars hands clasped tight below his waistcoat as if in supplication sophie de maubeuge dabbing at her eyes with a handkerchief too tearful thank bloody christ to recall her earthly saviorsahemfall from grace and pray god it dont suddenly come to her either lewrie asked his maker most earnestly poor chit not a relative left alive either guillotinedor killed in that last sea battle that got me this ship as prize fates been slamming her doors on sophies fingers everywhere she turns titled aristocratslam marryin charles de crillart slam he was killed when we took jester now shes off the ship for a strange house in a strange new country catholic convent girl slam slam slam have to pretend to beor learn to pretend to bethe same as any countryraised english girl go for church of england in a yearr two if she has any sense at all god save her in my house part o my family he shuddered suddenly poor little mort nigh a daughter to the likes o me goodbye he called down once caroline was safely settled on a thwart amidships of the sturdy buoytender write often as will i all of you you mind what i say sewallis he cried meaning to offer the lad a crumb at the last to atone i wish to hear all about your progress and your puppies they should be good hunters by the time im back hey uhm excuse me sir but lieutenant knolles interrupted with a sorrowful cough into his fist theres a veer to the wind and i saw mister knolles lewrie replied from the corner of his mouth still posed at the bulwarks with a gay grin plastered on his phyz for his family hands to stations then heave us in to short stays a marine drummer began a roll a fiddle screeched as one of the idlers tried his tuning and sought the proper key spithead nightingales began to peep as newly warranted boatswain porter and his bosuns mate will cony both off that illstarred cockerel frigate piped the commands for stations for leaving harbor and upanchor a precious breathless moment more as the buoytenders oarsmen stroked the boat away clear of jesters side give way together her midshipman called from the stern sheets and tillerbar one moment more to lift his cocked hat in salute to kith and kin then put it firmly back upon his head and turn dismissing them as he must and stride purposefully to the center of the quarterdeck his quarterdeck he let out a heavy lippuffing sigh that bespoke both his impatience and his relief swung his arms and clapped his hands before him unconsciously to release a scintilla of how tautly hed forced himself to pose this last day in harbor relief that hed not blown the gaff relief that no matter how dear he cherished them all he was off to sea and they were no longer the center of his universe not when a greater wider world awaited impatience of a certainty to be off and doing in that greater world which was now filled with strife and the stink of gunpowder in a proper ship wellarmed and able a ship hed already proved on the passage home which could take the worst of the bay of biscay gales and swim as proud as any thrate frigate fast sleek with a clean entry and forefoot not so fine as to bury under opposing waves but cleave them and ride up and over deep enough in draught to grip the seas resist slippage to leeward long enough on her waterline to tear across the seas like a racehorse wide enough in beam to carry her artillery and stores safely to be seakindly as well as fast and for himselffor the first time in his career he would command a real warship not a gun ketch converted from a bomb vessel nor a hostilitiesonly hired armed brig or dispatch schooner this marvelous sloop of war was tons eighteengunned a french corvettea swanlike and lovely threemasted miniature frigate and he was a step closer to postcaptains rank when he could be eligible for command of a true frigate a rated ship crews called the commander appointed over them in any warship their captain now as an admiraltyconfirmed commander he was uniformed almost like a true postcaptain and was a postcaptain in all but name white breeches and hose white waistcoat and shirt legs now encased from the knees down in a spankingnew pair of hessian boots he could not resist the temptation of having the london shop sew on tiny goldfringed tassels a dark blue coat with a darkblue standup collar and broad blue lapels instead of a lieutenants white ones there were two bands of gold lace encircling his cuffs set with three gilt fouledanchor buttons the collar front top and bottom bore a wide band of gold lace as did the two outside pocket flaps along with even more setinthree gilt buttons the lapels outer edges and tops and bottom seams were goldlaced and nine gilt buttons to either lapel allowed it to be worn open or closed in foul weather another thing to rue he thought suddenly going to london to assure his confirmation and smarm his way through the junior clerks belowstairs the basement moles who had pored over all his records of service tsktsking over every undotted i or slovenly crossed t then off to couttss bank with prizemoney certificates off to see his solicitor matthew mountjoy who handled his affairs ashore both the farm and his dealings with the financial side of the admiraltyand his creditors feeling relief and guilt that he was called by duty from the bosom of his family after only one night with them in hired lodgings in portsmouth and before any trace of his affair with phoebe showed on his face the pleasures of shopping like a wealthy gentleman free of a demand upon his time of course he needed new hats from locks new fulldress and undress coats pristine white breeches and waistcoats shoes and bootsthat was required pistols too from mantуn his had gone down with zйlй a new sea chest in which to store all his new finery and a new sword hed have a gills no other wilkinson was all right he thought but a gills hed had before and it had never failed him until hed been forced to surrender it to that puffed up pissproud young frog col napoleone bonaparte oh there was the slim straight rapierlike smallsword hed taken from the french captain when hed taken jesterback when she was named sans culottes but it was much too ornate a bit too slim and elegant a blade fit for fulldress occasions not a real bareknuckle brawl he wanted a fighting sword and that was what hed found it was a gillsat thirtyone he sensed he had already developed a conservative streak and some positively rigid prejudicesless elegant than his lost one but more fit for the melee his old hanger had been slimmer a true gentlemans hunting sword slightly curved his new blade the cutler had told him was patterned upon a french grenadiers hanger the blade was wider along its entire length a tad thicker in crosssection and only slightly curved much less like a light cavalry saber than most with all but the first two inches before the guard honed razorsharp and the first eight inches of the top behind the wicked point as well it fit his hand felt solid and durable yet nowhere near as heavy as a humbler cutlass like all hunting swords or hangers it was shorter than a smallswordonly twentysix inches of bladebut he preferred that in the confusion of a shouldertoshoulder nosetonose melee and it was reassuringly heavy close to the guard but wickedly light and quick as it tapered to the point black leather grip wrapped in gilt wire a slim giltsteel swept hilt with a large oval guard to protect his fingers there were no seashells this time but a fairly plain pattern of stylized oak leaves the scabbard was black leather with gilt furnishings they had soldered a coinsilver plaque to the outer face of the upper furnishing with a pair of crossed cannon over a fouled anchor engraved wreathed in oak leaf almost like the design of his old watch fob which was now the prize of some garlicbreathed french sergeant of lancers too unfortunately new watch and fob new grogram boat cloak shaggy watch coat dressing robes for warm or cold weather it had turned into such an orgy of spending and getting and guilt over his pleasures had driven him to purchase even more for caroline the children sophie even a pair of bosuns pipes for porter and cony to mark the warrants hed gotten porter and bittfield and the admiraltys recognition of his own prerogative to promote will cony to bosuns mate then recruiting drove him from their arms setting up his own rendezvous printing fliers to summon calfheaded cullys who wished to go to sea dealing with the local regulating captain of the impress service the dockyard officials the port admiral to find the rope and timber to restock jester with spare topmasts and yards stunsl booms miles of cable and rope fresh paint gunners tools and the reams of correspondence necessary to beg for permission to justify any slight alteration that might cost the crown tuppence why it was so odious so allencompassing an endeavor that hed been lucky to get a meal ashore with caroline and anchors hove short sir up and down knolles called lewrie from his reverie very well mister knolles brace for the heavy heave topmen aloft free topsls only spanker jibs and topsls inner outer flying and fore topmast staysl from the focsle main topmast staysl and mizzen tgallant staysl should this perverse wind head us i dont wish us fighting the squaresls all the way aground on the isle of wight rough on the quickwork and the career hmm aye sir knolles grinned in agreement wait to ring up or fish the anchors to the catheads mister knolles should we get headed we may have to anchor again quickly at the southern end of saint helens road for certain if a clear wind cant be found in the channel aye aye sir mister porter mister cony wont be elegant but lewrie shrugged to his sailing master mister edward buchanon a swart and laconiclooking soul come down from the medway to be appointed into jester fresh from years aboard other ships as a masters mate and fresh from his trinity house examination at tower hill so far lewrie had found him slow in speech dull as dishwater in conversation but that he suspected was the mans innate caution as an experienced seaman first and as a newly with his first senior warrant in a strange ship second aye capum buchanon nodded solemnly with only a glint of delight in his eyes to betray him tis better tbe safen sorry i says sloop o wars meant t dash now an agin but tis many a dashin capum laid himself ailaback bcause o it youll be tackin soons we have steerageway i suggest larboard tackll take us too far tloord toward the island i most certainly will mister buchanon and thankee kindly for your wise suggestion lewrie happily agreed heave and in sight the call came from the forecastle as the best bower arose from the depths trailing a storm cloud of mud and sand and the stench of weed pawls clacked in the capstans now rumbling as the hands trotted around them bare feet drumming sails rustled and blocks cried as canvas sprouted on standing stays and on the topsl yards high aloft jester heeled slightly to the pressure stirring and shuffling sidewise crabbing to the wind with her tall rudder hardover to windward two quartermasters spenser and brauer maintaining their full weight on the double wheel a gust and she heeled a bit more but a gust that backed more abeam this time and lewrie saw the quartermasters ease the helm a spoke or two smiling der rutter ve haff kapitan brauer the paleblond hamburg german informed him genug aber she bites zir lay her fullandby close to the wind as shell bear till we have a goodly speed then lewrie told him with relief in his voice they werent going to be blown sidewise onto the shore to their lee ready to come about to the starboard tack well the lee topsl braces and belay lewrie could hear cony shouting from the waist to the gangway bracetenders jester did not rate a yeoman of the sheets in her muster book so a bosuns mate was called upon to supervise several chores beyond the duties of one aboard a larger ship lookin fine will cony alan told himself proudly lookin fine cony had filled out a bit from the stripling volunteer hed met aboard the desperate frigate during the revolution dressed now in a little style with a whitetaped short seamans coat with gilt buttons a dark blue waistcoat and tailored slop trousers good sturdy shoes on his feet wellblacked with silver bucklessolid silver not coated pinchbeck a petty officers plain cocked hat instead of a round hat with low crown and flat tarred brims the former poacher lad from gloucestershire had risen in the world and would rise even further if lewrie could do anything about it the fleet needed men like will cony three knots sir mister midshipman spendlove shouted from the taffrails where he and his new mate midshipman hyde had just taken a cast of the log verdamt brauer groaned and the sails aloft rustled losing their luff as the commissioning pendant streamed farther aft to the starboard quarter headed by god mister knolles ready about lewrie called ready sir helm alee tack her mister knolles new course due east and jester came about logy at slow speed but her bows came around sweetly the harbor sweeping by in an effortless pirouette seawater began to chuckle and gurgle under her forefoot to murmur down her sides from aft there was a burbling highthroated sound of chuckling from around her rudder as she settled on her new course and found new strength in a wind now come more from the south from france where shed been born across the harbor she trundled under reduced sail ride sand and nomansland astern and horse sand and the horse tail off her bows in the narrows directly the wind backed more from the east she fell off and tacked again to larboard tack with the wind striking her left side with warner sand and st helens patch well to their lee monkton fort was the stern rangemark up to the norwest damme can we do it in one long board lewrie exulted within it would be a hellish comedown to chortle too soon if he all but promised an easy departure then was forced to come to anchor after all best keep silent for the nonce and fret while appearing a paragon of equanimity no they were headed again as the fickle breeze swung back to the south larboard tack would force them down below st helens patch and toward denbridge point into the culdesac of nab rock the new grounds and long rock ready about mister knolles quartermasters new course eastsoueast mister buchanon i propose to go eastabout the new grounds and stand out into the channel to make our offing before we come about to west in deep water aye sir thatd be best i think buchanon nodded after hed pored over the chart pinned to the traverse board on the binnacle cabinet he looked relieved that his expertise would not be tested in those narrow channels for below denbridge point there were also the risks of bettys ledge the denbridge ledge close inshore and north offing or princessa rock they were daymarked supposedly lit at night but it was still a chancy business around jester came to the starboard tack shallow langstone harbor and cumberland fort abeam to larboard chuckling again as she passed four knots there was a bit more chop now the promise of the channels lumps to come current flowing one way tide race opposed to it and a southerly wind crosspatched atop it all they would be careening and bounding like a coach on a winterrutted road soon enough if the wind stayed from the south and they remained at ese closehauled as dammit right up against it finally st helens town and its creek on their starboard quarter the last spit of new grounds abeam ring up anchors mister knolles weve no more need of em ring up and fish then buckle the hawseholes idlers a tune there commander lewrie demanded utterly relieved now that he and his fine little ship were safely on their way to making their offing the fiddle screeched again in harmony with a tuning box and a fife heart of oak they began and everyone knew it by heartthe former cockerels the freshcaught merchant seamen from the press the hands turned over from the guard ships those that howe hadnt put to sea aboard his lineofbattle ships the ships boys second class down from london and mister powletts marine society the marines and the sailors lent to him off nelsons agamemnon off victory and windsor castle to work her passage home the midshipmen of a certainty and the brace of nineyearold boys first class gentlemen volunteers whod signed aboard as cabin servants to learn enough of the sea so they could become midshipmen someday themselves and the landsmen from the hulks and debtors prisons the volunteers from some rendezvous tavern inland the sprinkling of maltese seamen hired out by the grand masters hed ended up withsoon they all would learn it and know it by heart come cheer up my lads tis to glory we steer to add something more to this wonderful year add something alan vowed to himself something writ large ive never known a peaceful commission a voyage that was all claret and cruising trouble well damme trouble has a way of findin me this time though this time im all but a captain on me own bottom with a ship and crew seasoned just enough for starters and ill make em even better god save me but i love this ship what shes capable of given half a chance what i think this ship and i together can accomplish father fate the navy beat me into a sailor well then so be it a damn goodun too i believe at last and whod have ever thought it to honor we call you not press you like slaves oh yes we do press pressed me in my own way he laughed for who are

this just as much as family maybe more heart of oak are our ships heart of oak are our men we always are ready steady boys steady alan lewrie had never been known as much of a singer but this time he lolloped out the chorus in a bellow along with the hands of the afterguard and the quarterdeck people well fight and well conquer again and again a first lift of the bows to the channel chops a sluice of sea breaking over her forecastle the rush of water creaming alongside of her impatient flanks a sibilant silken respiring it was of a live being made of oak and iron wind coming stronger aloft keening among a maze of sheets braces jears lifts and halliards an irish banshees crooning moan among the stays and shrouds with frolicsome flutterings as luffs and ratlines danced hms jester eighteengunned sloop of war had been reborn and reborn english and around her beakhead rails and new figurehead of a giltcrowned fool an english channel now christened her with salt offing enough mister buchanon lewrie decided one hour later mister knolles come about to larboard tack then make sail fore and main courses to the first reefs take in the main topmast and the mizzen tgallant staysls aye sir all plain sail bosun porter ready about more canvasmore speed whitehued virginal canvas never exposed to weather except at sail drill during their workingup period of river discipline

angle for a beam winda soldiers windpowerfully long english yards and wider fullercut sails than the moretimid french practice more flutings and keenings aloft more moans and whisperings jester began to bound over the sea her wakebreath sonorous yet insistent as commander lewrie left his quarterdeck at last satisfied to go below he could almost believe he could hear her singing to herselfa chorale of freedom and power while around her forefoot and cutwater around her transom post that chuckling gurgling rush hms jester he could almost conjure was laughing softly with delight as she stood out to sea stood out to find the war chapter jesters first sunset spent upon the sea a rare and rosyhued wonder to the west the end of a pleasant and bracing late may day of sailing lewrie had no time to go on deck to appreciate it however he was concluding the last of his voluminous paperwork with his clerk and the purser i think that should be all for today at least mister mountjoy he sighed after looking over the last revisions to what was now the thriceamended watchandquarter bills and the sheaf of instructions to guide quarterdeck watchstanders as to his personal idiosyncrasies his order book a fair copy of watchandquarter bills for knolles mister buchanon bosun porter and cony and the purser here by oh say four bells of the forenoon order book by the beginning of the first dog watch tomorrow so sorry sir but that would be thomas mountjoy asked a quizzically amused and sheepish grin on his face which seemed so far his only expression becoming even more pronounced umphh commented mister giles the purser from the offhand side of the wellpolished cherrywood desk at which they sat in lewries daycabin but giles was even for one as young as his hapless captains clerk a scaly fish with years at sea to mountjoys newcome ten in the morning for the watchbills mister mountjoy lewrie explained patiently and four pm for the order books ah comes the dawn so to speak sir mountjoy japed with a theatrical overplay of voice and phyz so much to take in dye see i should have thought though once away from all those pettifogging shore officials thered bit a bit less uhm correspondence alan hoped he wouldnt be sorry that hed done his solicitor a favor in taking his neerdowell younger brother aboard he needed a clerk and when offered perhaps hed agreed too readily but hed been fit and full of cream at the moment and full of himself with being confirmed fresh from couttss and the deposit of his officially honored prizemoney certificates smug with his acclaim in the london gazette that had made much ado over his most recent action in the mediterranean which had won him jester and having saved those royalist french йmigrйsmen women and children doomed to slaughter on the spot or beneath the guillotine had he not been victorious and full of a rather good claret he recalled at matthew mountjoys office this younger thomas though was a hopeless legal student a will henill he sort only playing at reading law around lincoln s inn fields and so easily drawn from his studies might a gallant captainto wit lewrieprevail upon the admiralty and obtain thomas an appointment take him to sea away from venal amusements why he could clerk continue to read his law profit financially and return a man with more selfdiscipline hmm daft alan thought studying mountjoy hes the forehead of an addled hen and that in the clouds writes a fair hand though he puffs and pants his way through but gets there in the end mountjoy had at least appareled himself for sea with some delight he wore a dark blue plain undress coat waistcoat and breeches though he clung to land in his choice of hatsa tall tapering narrowbrimmed highcrowned civilian style hed made sartorial concessions to the fleet while it seemed not one whit of effort to accommodate himself to its lore and lingo shouldve thought fore joining sir giles snickered removing his squarelensed brass spectacles to polish on his handkerchief cause once back in the pettifoggers reach a mand think the papist inquisitions got him if his accounts and books dont make sense oh whoaup there young sir that bookd be one o mine the greenun there i believe oh so sorry mister giles mountjoy gaped looking sheepish and hopelessly muddled anew as he gathered up all his untidy piles of rough drafts books and forms but they do appear all of a hellish piece so far sir alan suspected that thomas mountjoy was too henheaded to come in from out of a driving rain a harmless but willless mote who would waft through life on the first wind that found him giles though same age same build same inkstained stricture to his career but there all semblance ended giles had come up from the orlop first jackinthebreadroom then assistant and clerk to some purser apprenticed since his early teens to a dour pennypinching trade far longer than mountjoy all ledgers and finger cramp fretting over hapence per gallon and stone lewrie shouldnt wonder since his voice broke he played the cynical wise beyond his years wizard with his records and sums an able and efficient administrator down from the victualing board at somerset house though he sang his old tarpaulin man song a bit too often for lewries taste confident in his first warrant on his own wry and acting just a touch fly as if it were all a nudging winktipping cheeseparing game he reminded his captain of an east end confidence man with his three walnut shells and a single pea on a blanket and suspected giles had had mentors whod been real captain sharps archetypical nipcheesesand quite possibly crooksas his teachers sadly lewrie could dismiss mountjoy should he not work out but he was stuck with giles mountjoy served at the captains pleasure paid the same as a midshipman which wasnt much worth bragging about and had no protected status giles though had an admiralty warrant after performing mountjoys job for at least a year aboard another ship in addition to his long period of training in dispensing food drink clothing and sundries should jester pay off after a threeyear commission officers and crew would depart while the purser gunner boatswain cook and a few others with senior warrant would remain aboard to await a new captain and crew or should she be laid up inordinary giles would live aboard at full pay like the church it was a lifetime living a good purser went far toward developing a reasonably happy ship a dishonest one could ruin even the best giles could be the sort who could with dexterous and creative ledgering make dead men chew tobacco and continue to purchase china mugs plates slop clothing hats shoes and and wellplug or twist tobacco long after theyd been dischargeddead discharged or run so far alan had kept a wary eye on giles and his ledgers and could find nothing out of the ordinary insisting to see and help account for the quality and quantity of everything that had come aboard which giles would issue in future giles had become even more salty more affably wise but also more amenable and agreeable as if hed taken alans warning to heart and realized that hed met his equal and would settle for legitimate profits god knew that was enough for most pursers when the admiralty paid for sixteen ounces and let him issue at twelve to the pound and that at twentyeight days the lunar month not thirty or thirtyone to the calendar month giles should have quite enough profit thankee right then lewrie said by way of dismissal giles more used to a captains ways rose at once mountjoy however cast a disappointed and hopefulbutsheepish it went without saying glance over lewries shoulder to the wine cabinet behind him where rested a likely looking widebottomed porcelain decanter and some upturned glasses before getting the hint buy your own bloody drink alan scowled silently thats what your navy pays for and that remittance your brother gave you so you could go a gentleman another sad shock for young mountjoy when hed first come aboardthat hed not lodge in the greatcabins and share meals and wine with his employer afterhours he berthed on the rancid fetid orlop deck with the surgeons mate and midshipmen young lewrie thought once theyd gone thank god cept for the few like mountjoy the freshcaught landsmen and the youngest of the ships boys were mostly experienced his proportion of seamen ordinary or able was higher than usual thanks to generosity back in the mediterranean recruiting had gone extremely well too and now he had enough strong backs among the landsmen to do the dumbox work of pulleyhauley and a positive glut of ships boys who were young enough to learn the seamans trade quite unlike landsmen who stayed at the rate for years too old and set in their civilian ways to alter hands and officers young enough full of piss and vinegarand ambitionto know what could be done and not so old theyd turned mossybacked old turtles with their heads and legs drawn up in snappish old age too frightened of departing from the way things had always been done with a thousand excuses as to why a feat could not be accomplished maiwee toulon the ramkitten inquired from atop alans wine cabinet as he poured himself a glass of rhenish the catlingd been lurking up there in the shadows wary of intruders into his territory arching and stretching flexing sleepy claws as he craned his neck forward to touch noses rub cheeks and make lusty purring snorts of gapmouthed adoration after a good nap lewrie chucked him under his white chin gave his white chops a thorough rub then turned to head aft for the transom settee to take his ease and sip his wine where the opened sashwindows promised some fresh sea air come on toulon he coaxed playtime mummer toulon grumbled as he padded his fore end down the face of the wine cabinet his haunches still atop readying for a leap and announcing his stunt as an acrobat in a raree show might shout hopa and clap his hands to make the feat look more exciting toulon sprang a prodigious steelsinewed leap to the desk unfortunately the blackandwhite catling landed on a sheet of folio paper atop that beeswaxed and polished cherry surface he and the paper skidded to starboard and digging in his claws didnt help a bit laid over slightly downhill from horizontal on the larboard tack the silky surface became a greased slipway toulon sat down on his haunches as if that might help surely sitting still meant still right then he sailed off the desktop into space and a very perplexed and forlorn toulon with a contrite and reverent motor asked his cat gods just what the odds were hed not come another cropper or how large a fool he was going to look in a few seconds there was a bit of midair scrambling trying to climb the sheet of papers front end as it collapsed beneath him and went sailing off on its own course of perversely cruel abandonment urrff he grunted as he landed immediately slinking off to starboard into the shadows where the brace of candles on the desk and the gently swinging pewter lanthorns overhead could not shed light on his humiliation god but youre such a bloody disaster alan screeched with laughter plunking down on the transom settee too hugely amused to stand toulon was almost a yearling now and still kittenclumsy and hed been a most excruciatingly clumsy kitten to begin with too andrews his coxswain and his cabin steward aspinall stuck their heads out for a second from the dining coach and small pantry on the quarterdeck the watch and the afterguard turned toward the open skylights over the greatcabins and marveled what sort of a captain we got they wondered that wasnt a sound most associated with a sea officer come out of there toulon lewrie coaxed after hed calmed and had a sip or two more of his wine he got down on hands and knees in front of the pewlike sofa a crude oak construct shackled to the starboard bulkhead between a pair of ninepounders spindle posts on the back and openings around the corners held ties for bright damask cushions that caroline had made for him come on tis only your prides hurt i hope come out poor puss towey another thing caroline had whipped together from scraps of colorful spun yarn a rounded oval with ears and legs toulon s favorite plaything two chatoyant yellow orbs regarded him from beneath the sofa slowly blinking but mostly slit in mortification meek came a mournful little wrenpeep god but he was so embarrassed lewrie reached under to stroke him to offer the playthingbut he was having none of that toulon folded his arms tucked his front paws under his chest and downturned his luxuriant whiskers moi he harrumphed testily past somber jowls bugger off you heartless bastard twasnt funny lewrie interpreted well if you wont you wont alan sighed getting to his feet he got down his plain undress coat threw it on and stalked forward yer supper be ready not ten minute from now sir aspinall assured him quickly yer cook come ttell me aspinall was one of those unfortunate landsmen some regulating captain and surgeon of the press had passed when they shouldnt have a feeblebodied citybred footman whod lost his last employ at least he knew enough about householdery to a gentleman for lewrie to take him off the gangways out of the waist and apply his knowledge aft where hed not rupture himself straining at braces and sheets the lad was a slack sunkenchested seventeen illfeatured but mannerly mostly at least he had been until hed realized how grand his newfound stature was aboard a ship a captains servant ruled the roost over the stewards to lesser men ill be on deck till then lewrie said finishing his wine and setting the glass on the dampened tablecloth which would keep most plates and such from slipping off in a moderate sea such as this evenings ill send yer coxn tfetch ya sir aspinall suggested with lidded eyes and a jerk of his head to andrews the west indies free black whod popped up like a jackinthebox a scant week before sailing to sign aboard if you would come tell me andrews lewrie said to his man directly bypassing the servant who most likely resented having a negro give him orders aye sah andrews allowed cheerfully too experienced a man to take notice of the jealousies of a boy and a freshcaught newly landsman at that it was a huge joke to him alan emerged on the gun deck from the door to his quarters in the substantial but temporary wood partitions theyd come down in battle struck to the orlop and his cabin would be stripped of all finery and furnishings to avoid the danger of splinters a marine private one of the watch whod stand guard over his privacy round the clock presented his musket and lewrie touched the brim of his cocked hat in reply up to the quarterdeck by the larboard windward ladder to the further alarm of his watchstanders carry on he called to them affably just up for a breath of air he elaborated as he paced to the windward mizzenmast stays lieutenant knolles and mister wheelock the masters mate shuffled down deck to starboard yielding the windward side to him which was his by right alone whenever he was on deck there was very little left of the sunset his paperwork had kept him from relishing just a faint bricky trace of red and umber low on the western horizon with towering banks of slaggray clouds spread to either side oн jester s course and but the slightest sullen primrose glade upon the waves over which the ships jib boom and bowsprit rose and fell a touch more wind on his cheek perhaps a hatful no more and veering forrud by no more than half a point from abeam jester rose and fell more regularly now gently hobbyhorsing as the deeper water hinted the longset rollers of the atlantic to come after the chops of the channel closer inshore england was an indistinct razorthin ebony smudge to the north france was below the horizon lost in the companionable darkness it was almost late enough for the lamps forrud at the forecastle belfry by the watch hour and halfhour glasses and bell and the large taffrail lanthorns to appear cheerful and strong a few faint stars mostly astern above the lanthorns were already out lewrie paced slowly aft along the larboard bulwarks skirting the slidecarriages of the newly installed carronades smasherseighteenpoundersthey were short pestlelooking cylinders of guns that threw heavy solid iron shot heavier than anything hms jester could ever mount as deck artillery though they didnt shoot quite as far as long guns they dealt out horrific damage when they struck and so far praise jesus only the boyal navy used them in any numbers there were four on jesters quarterdeck and another pair forrud on the focsle in lieu of chase guns alan would have preferred two long sixpounders there but the officials of the ordnance board at gun wharf had had only so much patience for the blandishments of a junior officer lucky to keep the guns i have lewrie told himself smiling in grim reverie a full twenty guns made jester a small frigate under the new rating system a postcaptains command while an eighteenganned ship sloop was suitable to a newly promoted commander theyd taken two away from him with many tsktsks over his affrontery to show up in a vessel armed beyond his rank british sloops be they brig schooner ketch or threemasted shiprigged vessels were allotted sixpounders and that by god was that sixthrate frigates got nine or twelvepounders th rates carried twelves or more lately eighteenpounders the french though most sensibly alan thought armed their equivalent corvettes with les huitlivre canoneightpounders and the frog avoirdupois livre was just a trifle heavier than the english pound weight so his eightpounders were the equal of a british ninepounder the shot was almost the same diameter perhaps a quimhair about one twentyfifth of an inch smaller allowing a tad more obturation or windage between shot and bore diameter and what was that about a cable less at extreme elevation at rangetorandom shot where the odds of actually hitting anything a mileandahalf off were pretty much by guess and by god half a sea mile was considered longrange shooting and most captains and gunners preferred pointblank which was anything from one cable right down to close broadsides with the muzzles sticking almost through the enemys gun portsclose pistol shot had the officials insisted it would have taken weeks more to outfit jester new sixpounders a full eighteen of em werent just lying about after all might not even be sufficient stock far up north near scotland where most of the foundries had relocated now theyd gone to coke instead of charcoal for melting and casting pig iron wouldnt cost the crown tuppence sirs bags of frog round shot aboard sixty per gun now and replacement ninepounder english shot is a lot cheaper than an entire new set of artillery please sirs pretty please sirs cant swing idle for a month sirs and when theyd come what would he have ended up with some of those new lighter and shorter blomefield pattern pieces which he had heard had a distressing tendency to burst when charged with newfangled cylinder powder stead of puny old corned powder no there was only one thing he admired about blomefieldsthat neat forgedon loop for the breeching ropes above the cascabel button his old guns had breeching ropes eyespliced about the button while blomefields let the ropes pass through ring bolts on the truck carriages then through that loop easing stress on the breeching if fired at extreme angles they wouldnt snap their breeching and roll about like rampaging steers if pointed too far forrud or aft in the gun ports or rip the end ring bolts in the bulwarks loose no hed have his ninepounders and god help the frog who came within range mistaking jester for a quarterdecked ship sloop below the rates armed with mere popguns he spoke briefly with his surgeon mister howse that tall and lanky saturnine of the square mournful face who always looked as if he needed a shave even right after shaving and his surgeons mate legoff who played the gingery terrier to howses rangy mastiff no one had herniated yet there were some sore muscles but howse held that horse liniment usually worked just as well on bipeds as it did for quadrupeds midshipman hyde with knolles near the doublewheel knolles was midtwenties blondhaired and sunbronzed if some spark of relationship had arisen between him and his charge sophieand alan had pressed em damn hard togetherthere was no sign of it hyde a year older than mister midshipman clarence spendlove at sixteen a seasoned lad wellsalted and daubed with his haporth of tar since he was nine hmm good family hed learned was hyde talented cheerful able a bit on his guard being so new aboard but the port admiral had recommended him highly had lifted him out of a rd rate seventyfour for more seasoning aboard jester where hed be one of two instead of one among twentyfour middies to do the port admiral a favor usually meant one in return you scratch my protйgй ill scratch yours yer pahdons capum andrews said at last coming onto the quarterdeck but dot aspinall say yer suppah jus now come from de galley pipin hot sah thankee andrews lewrie brightened as famished as a middie on short commons by then toulon slunk out of hiding yet well sah ah spect hes ovah is sulk andrews chuckled in a deep soft voice an when he caught a whiff o pok cracklins he come on out sah twoz all me an dot boy aspinall could do keepin him off de table do ah go forrud an tell ya cook ya be wantin cawfee later capum fo dey douse de galley fires fo de night no no coffee tonight lewrie decided there was a very good chance this wind would veer ahead during the middle watch rousing him from bed after all the excitement and tension a good meal would put him under quickly and he needed some sleep beforehand you tell him to forget it this evening and turn in the pair of you aye sah thankee capum andrews replied enjoy the singsong belowdecks lewrie grimaced on the berth deck where pussers glims still burned on mess tables the sounds of fiddle fife and tuning box could be heard well into a droning lugubriously sentimental dirgelike song hands were singing along some already in their hammocks hung from carline posts and overhead beams linens bolsters and thin mattresses already full of softly swinging seamen in the minutes before lights out ooh law not dotun sah andrews shook his head in scorn sailors dey know de words thundred o songs but only know de one tune dotun samez it woz board evry ship i been on sah he and andrews went back a long way to the shrike brig and he had become lewries coxswain briefly before shed paid off after the war ended now he was coxn again in charge of alans gig and crew andrews had always been reticent about his past in the west indies lewried been certain that andrews in his youth had been a house slave and a runaway there were no lash scars on his back he vaguely remembered but andrews could read and write even then had skills enough to make ordinary seaman and had been rated able before theyd paid off alan wasnt even sure that andrews was his real name but that was the one he was known by at the admiralty never a place to be picky about a volunteer seamans antecedents his recent history had been merchant service a summer in the portugee fisheries off the grand banks then a spell ashore as house servant and valet to a retired liverpool merchant captain but that fellow had passed over recently and hed lost his comfortable shore position now he was both coxn and greatcabin factotum a bright caroline had called him after shed met him one of what she termed the yardcuffies the byblow of a white master or overseer on a mulatto or quadroon housemaid part white and part black and pent like a storm petrel over both worlds belonging to neither her north carolina slaveowning family experience warned her and alan against him but he was an old shipmate and a navy man a lot longer than hed been a fugitive furtive slave that tune lewrie asked he was not all that musical admll hosiers ghost sah andrews snickered i tink ah teaches de tune t ovah de hill an far away fo we heah any mo bout dot dead mons spook toulon was over his sulks nothing hurt but his fierce feline pride as soon as he was seated at table the cat was up his nose wheedling and begging tail erect and quivering in gustatory anticipation so recent the break from shore there was still fresh meat on the hoof or paw or on the roost aboard in the manger forrud hens ducks geese for fresh eggs and a rare treat after sunday divisions for captain and officers alone of course goat and kid for milkor meat if they did not prosper at sea a sow and piglets a brace of ewes and four lambs there had been a yearling bullock but hed gone into the steep tubs in fourpound cuts per eightman mess that afternoon with tripes and tongue and blood pudding to boot there were smoked or salted joints hanging in gunroom pantries captains stores everywhere one could find a place to hang a hook to stave off the day when everyone had to subsist on salt beef or salt pork alan dined on a fine pork broth mixed with desiccated portable pea soup fresh loaf bread instead of hard and dry soon to be weevily and sour ships biscuit a pair of small roast potatoes piquant with some of carolines herb vinegar and a hefty pile of sliced roast pork some with the cracklings on the most succulent cuts from a piglet shared with the wardroom mess and it was fine to dine alone too for once after so many civilian and perilous suppers with wife ward and children underfoot sure to tip something over at any moment calming it was too tofor a few hours at leasthave some privacy from the neverceasing demands to be social with his officers in a few days or weeks hed begin a roundrobin of dining them in a few at once to be sociable once the rigidly demanded isolation of command got too great there was a rather fine smooth and dry bordeaux which aspinall had let breathe for an hour and how the portsmouth wine merchant got his hands on such a wondrous french wine hed ask no questions fresh greens in a small salad to cleanse his palate for fresh cheddar extrafine sweet biscuits and a smooth and heady oporto gingersnaps the biscuits were another of carolines touches all lovingly packed along with calf sfoot jelly though alan had no clue as to whyhe despised the stuff toulon got his share on the deck by lewries chair cracklins pork a sliver of cheese which he adored a quarter of a gingersnap with a thin smear of fresh butter good for his coat and teeth for as long as butter remained wholesome that is a loll on the transom settee with all lanthorns in the daycabin extinguished a sated toulon stretched across his lap being brushed softly tail slowly curling in bliss after nine pm now on a sleeping ship on an empty and dark ocean all glims out and the ships corporal an officious able seaman named wilhoit making his rounds with the midshipman of the watch to see that all was in order and quiet that no flame burned belowdecks from lanthom or candle lewries gritty eyes fluttered as he yawned aloud so much tension the last few weeks so much lastminute folderol the last few days and hours before sailing regaining his freedom and once back in the mediterranean once back with hood who had surely taken corsica by siege by now first step though would be at gibraltar with dispatches for general ohara the ancient cock of the rock where phoebe aretino was awaiting his return christ lewrie sighed to the companionable dark best to end that fast he thought sadly face to face thatd be best i spose letters so bloody cowardly an cold well i had my joy of her give her what a hundred pounds or so to tide her over till she finds herself a new patron sounds about right and here on out ive far too much on my plate to spare time on diversion even a petite and pretty diversion he shrugged bedtime toulon he announced in a yawny whisper he undressed in the dark of the sleeping coach just abaft the chart space on the starboard side a canvas and folding partition chamber he pulled off his own boots dropped his breeches and tossed them over the top of a sea chest for aspinall to stow away in the morning his man had laid out a clean pair of slop trousers which alan preferred for undress wear at sea cheap durable and easy to part with once theyd mildewed tanned gotten stained with tar and slush or simply wore out fresh virginal bed coverlet painted and embroidered by carolines talented hands fresh linen sheets and pillow slips over puffy neverused bolsters filled with homefarm goose down the mattress in the bed box was from anglesgreen too goose down packed top and bottom over a lambswool batt center sewed into a striped ticken cover the narrow hanging bed cot was slung at about waist level over the blackandwhite painted checker of the canvas deck covering slung foreandaft instead of the moreusual athwartship an elegant form of hammock really braced by a rectangle of oak with double layers of heavy storm canvas inside six feet long it was and a few inches more than three feet wide a bachelors box alan snickered to himself as he rolled into it and set it swinging as toulon sat on the deck crying maiwee in a plaintive voice as if he had to ask permission each and every evening judging the best moment for his leap the little pest required a full ten minutes to satisfy shoving his head under lewries morethanwilling hands to be rubbed purring and vibrating nosepatting with soft paws earsnuffling as he kneaded the bolsters he finally took his ease twixt torso and arm to the larboard side paws braced against the canvas with his back hard up against alans chest damme no not a bachelors box lewrie grinned in the darkness yawning so hard he thought hed dislocate his jaw this time tis a husbands box narrow and straightlaid his husbands box swayed to the easy roll and slow pitch of the ship as she snored her way across the deeps loping for the open seas and rocking her captain his cat and all the sleeping offwatch tars who put their trust in her to a pacific rest chapter the winds did indeed come more and more westerly as jester came abeam of plymouth on her slog downchannel veering bowwards toward a close reach then closehauled her second day of passage forcing her to alter course norwest for she could not maintain a luff nearer than six points to the wind the old problem of leaving england being driven shoreward by a brisk westerly right up toward the lizard or torbay or having to tack and beat souwest toward the hostile coast of france which was a rockstrewn horror in peacetime and aswarm with warships now from the french bases at brest and st malo by ten of the second morning jester was near enough to torbay to peek inside with a longglass from the top of the mainmast no sign of admiral howes fleet though the westernmost war anchorage was empty which meant he was still at sea somewhere out in the atlantic and so one must suppose were the french with a heavy sigh lewrie had been forced to come about south and make that long board down toward france on the starboard tack a day wasted he thought marching in place up and down with no progress westward if he wished to give the lizard a wide berth but near the start of the first dog watch at four pm the winds had begun to back southerly again point at a time and gain in strength near midchannel lewrie had summoned all hands by five pm and brought her back to larboard tack to make up lost ground they continued backing until by the end of the first dog at six jester was thrashing due west closehauled and flying over the wave tops like a tern courses unreefed topsls and royals full and straining and the ship laid so hardover on her starboard shoulderwhere shed heel so far and no fartherfurrowing a wide bridal train of foam astern she slashed the seas the roar and wash of her passing the irregular watery thudding of easily broken waves and the hulls shudders at each foamy curling lumping was a sailors delight a live luffflattening coatfluttering wind invaded every open mouth filled every ear with tumult it took four hands at the helm quartermaster spenser his mate tucker and two able seamen trainees spoke by wary spoke to weather or alee with cries of meet her easy now grunts of dissatisfaction when she faltered an iota from fast if they misjudged the infinitesimal variations in wind direction the press of a curling roller against the windward bow the slightest swing of the lighted compass needle in the binnacle cabinet and sighs of ecstasy the ats th way lads ats me darlin when jester rode up and over a roller met with a welltimed spoke to windward luff maintained the nearinvisible commissioning pendant streaming and crackling at its tip the lee edges of the main course and main topsl still barrelcurved without even a flickering roll of a single cupful of that invigorating wind lost and everyone on the quarterdeck rocking and riding on horsemens legs springing at the knee easy like posting a gaited mount smiles of pleasure and wonder on their faces dutywatch sailors lookouts along the windward side hooting and whooing ships boys giggling those highpitched heartinyourthroat and heartswelling shuddery laughs as if theyd found a pony of guineas in their packet on boxing day offwatch sailors still on deck to savor this fleeting joy landsmen and young first time at sea marines staggering and reeling whooping when a wave crest flung cold showers of spray above the bulwarks fiddle fife and tuning box from the focsle near the galley and copper alley speeding through a dublin jig the cook and his mate beating time on small pots by damn this is sailing lewrie said aloud with pleasure his voice lost in all the bustling noises and hyde and spendlove with the two boys first class in tow and tutelage learning how to read the marks of a knot log in the dark crying out eleven knots sir eleven and a bit there was bad weather in the bay of biscay lewrie was certain some blow responsible for this that theyd soon meet once they made a cautious offing into the atlantic it might be tarpaulin weather by noon of the next day this could not last night winds always waned a little after sundownbut at least they remained steady dead calm by morning mister buchanon tis my experience sir buchanon opined reluctantly that a brisk sundown indeed makes for one o two thingsstorm canvas an three reefs by midnight or a spell o calm an drizzle by dawnin twas another red sunset ya did note so he shrugged and which would you put your guinea on sir lewrie smiled id say thisll blow out in an hourr two sir buchanon said with a rueful wince forced to have an opinion after a long minute spent gnawing a corner of his lips and much sniffing and probing at the skies with his nose best we enjoy it while we can and f r the mornin well a swing o th wind back toward westsouwest an maybe drizzle captain smelt a hint o fresh water on th wind i did rain f r certain een with a red sunset but buchanon lay his hands on the quarterdeck rails at the netting feeling the shudderings letting them transmit up his arms like some dowser witching for water no counterwaves from a roiled sea lewrie inquired to press him or coach him no gales in the offing nossir didnt feel any and no smell of storm rack either lewrie went on having done his own inhaling to sample the future no freshfish reek exactly sir buchanon answered daring to essay his first tentative smile of agreement grew up in the fisheries outa blackpool i did sir an twas promisin days we spent mendin nets an such when th granthers came back in early not likin th smells nor th way th waves felt on th bottom o their boats an they were almost always right so lewrie said going to the chart at the traverse board may we count on being headed a bit we stay on larboard tack all tomorrow wind loses its strength but stays somewhere round souwest and we end up standing on west norwest for a day more we miss the lizard gettin this breeze when we were bout midchannel and a ruler laid from an educated guess of southing at sundownwestnorwesta thumbnails crease along its edge beyond soundings out into the wide trackless atlantic well south of lands end and the scillies alan concluded enough sea room to weather them if under th horizon sir buchanon nodded solemnly damme mister buchanon but i think we should stand on bout a hundred leagues at least lewrie told him returning the ruler to the cabinet drawers too soon a tack south cross biscay well run into something perverse down there around the latitude of nantes or so a norwester thatd force us down toward the spanish coast near ferrol and i dont wish to be embayed and have to beat about and waste two days to weather finisterre well take all the westing this slantll give us before we alter course if it holds capum buchanon cautioned automatically aye if it holds what the hells that lewrie snapped of a sudden disturbed by a tuneful noise you there yes you sirs stop that noise the firstclass boys gentlemen volunteers were by the mizzen stays up on the bulwarks and clinging to the inner face of the ropes starryeyed little newcomes rapt in their first exhilarating beat to windward richard josephs he was only eight a slight cherubfaced minnikin george rydell was only a year older a darkhaired pudding they both turned to peer at him eyes wide as frightened kittens and aghast that theyd done something wrong which of you was whistling on deck sirs lewrie demanded of them hands behind his back and scowling a hellishblack glare mmm me sir little josephs piped back shyly bosuns mate lewrie howled pass the word for the bosuns mate and get down from there the both of you mister josephs no one ever whistles boardship young sir never it brings storm and winds dares the sea to get up im sorry sir josephs quailed folding up on himself like a bloom at sundown and already weeping i didnt know and damn fool mister buchanon spat pray god sir half his life in uniform half his life at sea so far and alan and buchanon knew why men should never tempt neptune with cockiness aye sir cony said knuckling his brow as he arrived on the quarterdeck josephs was whistling on deck mister cony lewrie explained aye sir cony rumbled deep in his chest all his affability gone in an instant half dozen sir aye and then explain to both of em so they never make such a codsheads mistake on my ship again mister cony lewrie ordered mister hyde you will see to it that josephs is restricted to biscuit cheese and water all day tomorrow to drive this lesson home aye aye sir hyde answered smug with lore and distaste for the error there would be a raisin duff tomorrow at dinner and that meant a larger portion for both himself and spendlove you and spendlove both lewrie snapped youre senior below in your mess kindly instruct these calfheads more closely in ship lore and the fleets dos and donts their future behavior well on your bottoms be it aye aye sir midshipman hyde flushed and gulped josephss whiny mewlings rose above the windrush that and the sound of rope starter strokes a half dozen applied to his bottom bent over the bosuns mates knee instead of over a gun to kiss the gunners daughter josephs almost yelped like a whipped puppy at the last but one forcing cony to stop and shake him by the arm by which he restrained him quiet lad he told him almost gently nothin personal but real seamen dont cry out else itll be six more see take the lastun like a man and josephs did though in utter misery as if everything in life had just betrayed and abandoned him which prompted rydell to purse his lips and inhale dont lewrie warned find a new way to express yourself oh rydell all but swooned half knocked off his feet by a further warning nudge from mr hyde oh god sir half dozen dlivered sir cony announced thankee mister cony i trust thatll be all alan told him sternly though he could not quite resist a tug at the corner of his mouth the constriction of one eyelid in a surreptitious wink which gesture was answered in kind as cony doffed his cocked hat from time immemorial boys had been beaten to make them mind or learn boys at sea more than most to drive their lessons home it was a harsh world at sea and it was better to be harsh right off than watch the chubs get themselves maimed or killed or hazard the ship through inattention ignorance or skylarking spare the rod and spoil the child the good book said after all and within one hour of reporting aboard his first ship so long ago lewried learned that simple navy truth some days his entire first year at sea even as a halfripe lad of seventeen theyd been signal days when his own fundament hadnt felt a captains or a lieutenants wrath you two do come wif me now cony snarled putting back on his fearsome bosuns face th more ya cry th less yall piss nr bleed later an mind close twot im goin ttell ya a faint halffelt drumming against the larboard bows as the sloop of war faltered as she met a wave instead of cocking her bows gently up and over a hiss of spray and a cream of foam breaking on the catheads and the forrud gangway and a disappointed sigh from mister spenser on the wheel there was a grousewing beat aloft a soft suspiring whisper as the luffs of fore and main square sails shivered a lazy furling down to the leeches headed damn at boy buchanon spat as he witnessed the winds death damn quick response from old aeolus lewrie frowned trying to be philosophical about it nothing good lasted forever after all the tiller ropes about the wheeldrum creaked as spenser and a trainee were forced to ease her off the wind as it faded as the ship sloughed and sagged to a closer almost weary companionship to waves and sea the apparent direction of the wind had veered ahead almost halfapoint for ships working close to weather made half their own apparent wind backing the true wind slightly more abaft at speed westnorwest half northz close as shell lay sir the quartermaster said with the frustrated air of a man whod still won small on his horse that placed but had lost almost as much on the one hed backed to win westnorwest half north it is then spenser fullandby lewrie agreed just as frustrated he leaned into the orb of candlelight from the compass binnacle lanthorn both their faces were distinct in the growing gloom as if separated from their bodies still alan supposed with a petulant grunt well weather the scillies and lands end few leagues closer inshore but grand while it lasted though was it not mister spenser alan commented easily a glorious devlishfine afternoons sail oh aye twoz capum the older man replied his eyes all aglow deep under a longtime sailors cats feet and gullied wrinkles with the sound of a gammers longing for a lostlost youthful love he ventured to comment further a right rareun sir damn at lad another cast of the log if you please mister hyde lewrie called aft stepping into the gloom eight bells chimed up forward the end of the second dog and the start of the evening watch mr buchanon you have the watch i believe sir aye sir send th hands below then aye nothing more to savor tonight lewrie sighed moving to the windward bulwarks ill call should buchanon began then wrenched his mouth in a nervous twitch to keep from speaking aloud a dread that should best remain unspoken aeolus poseidon erasmus neptune davy jones by whatever name sailors knew them the pagan gods of the wild sea and wind had like een the littlest pitchers exceedingly big ears and like mischievous and capricious children could sometimes deliver up from their deeps what sailors said they feared most uncanny it was thoughwhistling on deck usually fetched a surplus of wind rather than the lack gales and storm that blew out canvas split reefed and quicksavered sails from luff to leech in a twinkling leaving nothing but braces and boltropes never a fade though never a dying away nor one so rapid perhaps tomorrow lewrie fretted comeuppance comes tomorrow sir we now log eight and onequarter knots hyde reported at last sprinkled with spray and damp from the knot logs line thankee mister hyde lewrie nodded keeping his gaze ahead toward the west aye we had ourselves a rare old thrash to weather he thought nigh two hours at ten to eleven knots thats at least twenty more sea miles made good due west till damn that boy at sundown winds usually faded replaced by night winds that might not be so stout but usually remained steady in both vigor and direction clear weather winds did at least and pray jesus that holds true he grimaced stays like this the rest of the night fade around sunrise of course for a bit but thats nine hours at eight knotssay another seventy or so to the good and only half a point to loord of the best course i can hope to make if the wind didnt get up and make us reef in if we dont get headed comes westerly again tomorrow well either fall afoul of ushant down south or lands end or the scillies up north he decided to do his further pondering over charts in his greatcabins where he could worry and smolder in private good evening to you mister buchanon alan said touching the brim of his hat in salute i wish you joy of the evening sir and a peace ahem and a good night to you too sir lewrie nodded firmly at buchanons sensible reticence and his rephrasing then took himself to the larboard ladder to the gun deck dispatches aboard too valuable to lose he mused frogs out in fleet strength wind most like to die away to nothin head us again or come up by the bloody barge load and damn that boy chapter surprisingly the winds did no such thing the third day upon passage there was mist to be sure light sunrise winds that slatted sails for a while but most cooperatively backing to the sw or ssw again clouds stayed low and creamjug pale for most of the day at the end of the middle watch when the crew was summoned to scrub and sluice then stand dawn quarters there was a lot of dew the mists riming everything with damp sunrise wasnt ominously red the fog and mist dispersed but never quite disappeared limiting visibility to a scant four miles around jester even from the crosstrees noon sights were educated guesses of how high that diffuse cloudcovered sun ball was but the consensus of results on the quarterdeck except for mister spendloves which placed them somewhere on the same latitude as iceland showed them weathering the scillies and lands end and dead reckoning and the record of the knot log suggested a position beyond the scillies almost nautical miles west of the lizard since yesterday noon and with the wind backing southerly jester could come back to due west again though only at seven or so knots on a light tantalizing wind and stand even farther out into the atlantic and the sea it was almost calm mashed flat by a humid and rather pleasant warmth glittering and rolling folding and curling not over three to four feet more mirrorlike more oily and without ripples though the long atlantic rollers made themselves felt the ship rose and fell slowly and grandly lifted her entire length by the long period of the scend instead of hobbyhorsing when pitch she did or roll it was a slow creaky procedure quite predictable and almost pleasant for all but the landsmen and newcome marines who cast their accounts to neptune over the leeward rails faint wake astern barely a bustle of disturbance down her flanks as water churned sudsy close aboard and her forefoot cut clean and sure into the roundtopped rollers to part them with hardly any fuss at all uncanny lewrie thought warily retributions coming sure as fate theyre toyin with us soon itll be roarin when we least expect it damme i hate surprises dawn of the fourth day was coolish and bracing with a bit more life to the sea the rollers now shorterspaced and surging higher in four to fivefoot swells the wind backing even more now all but out of the south toying with them backing then gusting up a touch as it veered ahead a point or two yet still easily manageable winds jester would luff up through the gentle gusts driving closehauled and was able to maintain a base course of westsouwest and a halfhourly cast of the log showed a steady ѕ knots by noon sights alan was just about ready to start chewing his nails in fretful apprehension and mister knolles and mister buchanon two more who knew what whistling on deck could bring stalked softfooted about the quarterdeck as if the slightest misstep might bring the sky down on them like a tumbling house of cards sail ho came a most unwelcome cry from far aloft oh jesus lewrie gawped in the middle of his fifth breakfast at sea a forkful of treacly broken biscuit halfway to his mouth he was off and running shrugging into his undress coat cramming an old unadorned hat on his head before the marine sentrys musket butt hammered the deck without his cabins and his leatherlunged announcement of mister midshipman spendlove sah captain sir spendlove began formally the first lieutenants respects to you and he bade me inform yes yes lewrie snapped impatiently preceding spendlove to the quarterdeck where away he demanded two sail came another shout from the topmast lookout sir knolles reported crisply handing his captain his spyglass one sail on the larboard quarter up to the noreast royals or tgallants cant see her from the deck yet but theres a second ship sir off the larboard beam a touch southerly of us say eastbysouth to be her bearing just appeared moments ago as these morning mists cleared royals and tgallants bove the horizon sir thankee mister knolles lewrie frowned he took in the set of jesters sails the strength of the wind that flailed the commissioning pendant even closehauled jester was loafing along in light morning air the sunrise cast of the knot log had shown only a touch over seven knots and the wind felt no fresher than when hed quit the quarterdeck to go below a halfhour earlier be back shortly he said slinging the telescope over his shoulder he climbed atop the larboard bulwarks swung out around the mizzen stays and began to ascend the mast recalling how terrified he had been the first time hed been forced aloft so long ago all these years and it still hadnt gotten any easier he thought surely he would be senior enough and like many postcaptains too stout to have to do this could stay on deck and let the younger and spryer be his eyes except he knew himself for an impatient hound and wondered just before essaying the futtock shrouds if he could ever be content with secondhand information most careful for a good handgrip and sure feet puffing some he got to the deadeyes of the fightingtop after a breathless dangle on the futtock shrouds scaling the underface of the outwardleaning ropes and ratlines then on to the mizzenmast crosstrees far up by the doublings of the topmast to take a perch on the bracing slats the vessel off to the east wavered in his ocular as he embraced the topmast with one arm shiprigged he saw three sets of yellowtan ellipsestopsls tgallants or royals visible with her hull and course sails still below the horizon swiveling to the noreast he spotted the second she was more broadside on with three umber rectangles of sail peeking over the indistinct rim of the sea he returned his interest to the nearest ship had she changed her aspect to them when he first espied her hed thought shed been beamreaching westnorwest across the wind her upper yards and sails fatter and wider now they looked narrower more edgeon her masts beginning to overlap in his narrow viewpiece altering course he muttered sourly comin over to smoak us discover what we are well sufferin jesus an infinitesimal gay splotch of color burst forth upon her upper yards vivid bits of flapping cloth she was making a signal as she came about hard on the wind but to whom he wondered it was hard to make out plain red square flag atop what seemed like the blue peter nextbelow a yellowwhite beneath that and a fourth he couldnt make out that of certainty wasnt a recognition signal in the howe system he knew nor was it one of the private signals to identify one royal navy ship to another he turned back to the ship up in the noreast sure enough she was replying making a single hoist of what he took to be a red square with a white speck in the center a oneflag signalthat could only be a reply to an order more like an affirmative and it was not a british yes and was she turning too foreshortening the broadside view of her upper sails also coming onto the wind merchantmen had no desire to speak each other with flags nor be curious about strange vessels a merchantman sailing independently would shy from the sight of any other ship even were hms victory to heave up alongside with an invitation to dinner they had to be french a brace of frigates he decided out scouting in the van of the main body of that fleet howe had been seeking and had just discovered a weak and tasty treat deck there he shouted pipe all hands mister knolles make sail royals tgallants and staysls a little faster now though heeled perhaps a bit too far hardover jester began to trundle along adding another knot to her speed to keep their minds off it and prepare them for the worst alan told his officers to practice gun drill five weeks in port and not a shot fired he lamented port admirals didnt like the sound of guns going off in their harbors bad for their digestions he supposed interrupts any naps they take and was a waste of good gunpowder that theyd have to replace at admiralty expense before a ship sailed jester had a good warrant gunner and mate in bittfield and mister crewe her quartergunner was a prussian named rahl who claimed that hed been one of friedrich the greats artillery masters cockerels and victorys agamemnons and a few others were experienced but except for dryfiring mostly runningin loading and runningout work with the newcomes his guns wouldnt be wellserved not after the landsmen and marines who would be forced to assist on the tackles were deafened and quivered to a state of nerves by the first blasts and half of that had been instruction employing only a single piece at a time mostly letting them watch before trying them out at the leastskillful jobs thered only been a week of dryfiring using an entire broadside at once and that wasnt nearly enough would you say this seems a bit familiar sir knolles said after going below to change into clean clothing and silk stockings and shirt which were easier for the surgeon to draw out from wounds it appears pretty much the way we got jester sir lewrie nodded playing along in spirit with knolless humor the officer was possessed of a very dry wit to begin with and was purposefully japing for the crews benefit to make them think that things were not quite as bad as they appeared damme mister knolles alan said more loudly again for the crews ears chased by two corvettes shot one to flinders and took thisun do you think sir that the frenchll oblige me a second time and make me a postcaptain when we serve these alike he got the appreciative laugh hed expected though most of his inexperienced new men merely tittered nervously and that only because the older hands had done so french frigates he pondered pacing aft to the taffrail for a peek longer on the waterlines perhaps feet to his theyd be at least a full knot faster the one down to the noreast was too far off and with only a knot advantage would take until sundown to catch him up no the main threat was the one to the east now almost abeam shed cut the corner on jester sail a shorter course with a halfaknot to a full knot greater speed than her consort because she wasnt beating to weather but was sailing a point free on a damned close reach to intercept off jesters larboard bows when she came up to shooting range lewrie decided hed have no choice but to wear off the wind himself reach across the wind due west to escapear out into the atlantic scouting frigates thatd be most likely he thought out ahead of the french fleets van division looking for howes fleet so they could steer their admiral into a massive battle if jester showed no sign of leading them to howes main body they might break off their chase he most fervently hoped perhaps by sundown at the latest were nigh on miles out to sea he mused miles west of ushant or lands end for gods sake what do they think im leadin em tothe happy isles of the west he whispered and the weather alan felt like ordering all hands up on the gangways to begin whistling if it would stir up one more pint of wind that remained steady from the sw or ssw and none too strong the morning was less humid than the day before less dew and mist upon the decks at dawning the clouds were higher and thinner a first thin coat of whitewash brushed over cerulean blue with many traceried gaps of open sky not superb sailing weather but no sign of bad weather of a certainty which might bring a rising of the winds for the atlantic in early summer it was almost warm and pleasant too just warm enough a day as it progressed to bring a stronger wind as the seas warmed or enough heat to stifle any winds leaving all three warships boxing the compass on lying little zephyrs and a longer and heavier french frigate might still coast through the dead spots maintain her steerageway even in very light air whereas the lighter shorter ship would struggle and flag mister knolles lewrie called out coming back to the center of the quarterdeck well run in the starboard battery to loading position and bowse the carriages to the deck ringbolts then open the larboard gun ports and run out the larboard battery to firing position that should shift enough weight to set her flatter on her keel aye aye sir knolles responded mister bittfield if that didnt work next hed try shifting all the roundshot into garlands on the larboard side by hand then crack the water casks and use the washdeck pumps to start all that weight over the side to lighten her hed heard of people jettisoning cumbersome cargo even artillery during a stern chase of course most of the time thatd been the heroic captains doing the chasing not the chased and the prize money afterward paid for all it occurs fine sir knolles began in a soft voice minus his confident japery and a tad shy of making a suggestion at all aye mister knolles alan rejoined with a smile well captain knolles coughed into his fist nervously as he dared advise a senior officer should we stand on closehauled uhm surely our brief spell together since gibraltar sir alan chuckled to put him at his ease and youre still afraid ill bite ease her a point free is that your thinking aye sir knolles grinned shyly spin the chase out make her work harder for her supper an excellent idea mister knolles very well ease her wear us a point free off the wind so jester ii sail even flatter on her quickwork so it takes yon frog another hour to get within rangetorandom shot if you would be so kind sir aye aye captain knolles replied turning to issue orders to bracetenders idlers and helm the forecastle men who tended the jib sheets and the bosun and his mate no way wed ever outfoot her and cross ahead anyway lewrie told himself shell be up even if she doesnt headreach farther upwind of us by dusk for certain with the wind gauge and us to her lee jester fell off from closehauled to a fair wind heading westbysouth sometimes luffing up as the wind backed no more than half a point she settled down with less heel to starboard as the braces and jibs were eased a trifle the yards swung around with the leading larboard yardends not quite so aligned foreandaft apparent wind eased no longer keening through her rigging softer on the ears so conversations did not have to be shouted above the rushing harkee sir buchanon called speaking for perhaps a second time in the last hour as three bells of the forenoon watch chimed hmm lewrie asked wondering if there was something he had forgotten that hed ordained to happen at halfpast nine am thunder sir buchanon oracled sniffing at the wind with his large crooked nose like a freshawakened mastiff a squall line thatd be a blessing alan wished bags of rain and thunder somewhere off to windward dive into it before the foe did and tack away leaving him to play silly buggers with himself but theres not a storm cloud in sight mister buchanon he was forced to say after a long and hopeful search of the horizon thunder sir buchanon insisted harkee lewrie went up to the windward rail left the quarterdeck to amble forrud along the larboard gangway to get away from the noise a ship makes or a crew makes something but what once more he raised his telescope resting it on the foremast stays this time nope nary a smudge upwind the southern horizon was knifeedged now that the mists and haze had cleared roily since waves made it but was there more cloud just looming over the sea far down souwest not squallgray or bluegray but damme if it dont sound like thunder he enthused off and away but a roll of thunder nonetheless a faint sound that was not the winds flutter about his head teased at his hearing or was it a devoutly wishedfor fantasy again came something that might have been if only bosun porter pipe the still he snapped hed served captains who did it made their people work quiet with pipes halliard twitches and finger snaps as orders to the hands their slaves after cockerel a ship run deadsilent would always strike him as devilishqueer hed much prefer raucous caterwauling at least that bespoke a crew with spirit hed made a vow hed never be the sort of captain who demanded the still yet here he was yes it was thunder very far off uptoweather thunder on the wind thankee mister porter you may pipe the hands free now he said with a grin on his face and kept that grin plastered onlooking like the cat that lapped the creamall the way aft past the curious sailors on the gangway or below at the guns in the waist and thinking that perhaps he owed little josephs a lapful of gingersnaps for whistling up a saving storm thinking too that he owed aeolus a debt as well the windgod was an old slowcoach sometimes in dealing retribution to cocksure sailors but he got there in the end mister buchanon is right gentlemen he told the quarterdeck i heard thunder on the horizon under the horizon to us of yet but there is a faint smudge of something stormlike visible up to weather id admire we hardened up halfapoint to westbysouth half south so we reach it in time to befuddle yon frog and lose him in the squalls one hour more standing on on jesters fair wind and the heat of the day increasing she began to heel a tiny bit more to starboard as the wind freshened even with her artillery run out to balance her it was piping up at last not gusting never approaching any blusters but it was rising slowly the nearer they sailed toward the single tumulus of cloud on the souwest horizon and beyond the main cloud mass there appeared more mere suggestions of clouds fuller and more substantial than the mares tails aloft seductively tantalizing in round cumulous detail pristine white those clouds though for such a din of thunder that came faintly but more often under the rushkeening of the wind no black or bluegray hazes of an advancing storm front no trace of an expected towering thunderhead nor of the vast sweep of gloom which should be swathing half the weather horizon nor the flickering sizzle of lightning which accompanied all the faint thundergrowl lewrie began to get a queasy feeling though he masked it well by pretending to take a nap in a woodandcanvas deck chair with wide wellspaced feet deck there the foremast lookout finally hollered they be topsls on th orizon dead on th bows how many topsls lieutenant knolles shouted back with the aid of a brass speaking trumpet as alan pretended to wake dozens sir came the reply one point off th larboard bow t two point off th starbrd lewrie arose and took a catlike stretch well could be at grain convoy buchanon opined hunrds o ships i heard mister knolles indiamen with new orleans rice more with corn an wheat from th chesapeake ose ewnited states of america payin eir debt tfrance and makin th devils own profit ill warrant as arseoertitz france s farms an markets are since their revolution tis import r starve this summer why their navys out t prtect th food r the country goes under sounds like we found em justz op admiral howe lit into em sir somebodys lit into someone mister buchanon lewrie agreed warily there was too much thunder for ships of the line in general chase of prizes no convoy could ever make such a din either perhaps we might gobble one up captain knolles asked he came of a good family yes but they werent that rich and prize money of his own would be more than welcome im going aloft again mister knolles might you lend me your glass forward this time to scale the foremast right up to the crosstrees to join the lookout a spry young topman named rushing mine arse on a bandbox lewrie muttered once hed had his long look thats no grain convoy nossir it aint rushing agreed breezily bout twelve miles off would you say rushing ay capum bout that be up to them he pulled out his new watch it was nearly gone eleven of the forenoon an hourandahalf two hours and they would be up within spitting distance or shooting distance without another word lewrie took hold of a standing backstay and clambered down it legs locked and going handoverhand like any topman hating every nutmegshrinking moment of it of course with nothing but oak to stop his fall from nearly feet above the deck should he slide too fast and burn his hands or swing away and dangle by his fists alone once on the quarterdeck again he gathered his breath by taking another peek at the french frigate off to the east their closest pursuer was about five miles off hullup now and driving hard she had slowly gained on jester closing the distance between them and more importantly crabbed up aweather a touch so she would still hold the wind gauge when they finally met hard on the wind mister knolles lewrie ordered lay her as close as shell bear hoist every scrap of canvas cept for stunsls weve a race to win aye sir knolles replied before turning to issue orders sorry to disabuse you mister buchanon lewrie told him with another forced grin but we havent discovered their grain convoy no tis their entire biscay fleet yonder and ours having at each the other thats the thunder weve been chasing all morning wull stap me sir buchanon sighed blanching a bit another hour or so and well hear all the thunder a mand ever wish lewrie chuckled genuinely amused this time pass the word for mister giles aye sir the purser inquired from the midships hatchway mister giles id admire should you issue the midday meal as soon as weve completed bracing in and making more sail lewrie told him the rum issue too today is a banyan day is it not sir well aye sir giles frowned little need for the galley fires then on banyan days the issue was cold victuals smallbeer cheese and biscuit perhaps with the eternal pea soup but no meat to be simmered in the steeptubs on the wind sir knolles reported very good mister knolles once the hands have eat and drunk their cheer well beat to quarters say bout halfpast noon or so weve a sea battle before us from a point off the larboard bow to two points to starboard and were going to have to tack around the short end if the fleet that lies alee turns out to be hostile let us hope the frogs are on the far side holding the weather gauge but be ready for the worst lewrie explained to them all and must we tack around to get inside the protection of our own liners were going to have to deal with this bastard frigate aye sir knolles nodded grimly plucking at his clean silk thunder by jesus alan snorted mine arse on a bandbox mister buchanon mine arse on a bandbox and laughed out loud as he strolled aft to study the frigate in his glass leaving them all perplexed by such good cheer chapter hands at quarters standing by their charged shotted and nowprimed artillery pieces swaying as jester rocked and rolled over the sea gun captains would fire them with modern flintlock strikers in lieu of ancient slowmatch linstocks but slowmatch sizzled slowly wound round the middeck water tubs just in case the french fleet unfortunately for lewrie were the fighting ships that lay to leeward those closest to him there had to be at least thirty of them it appeared a ragged procession of proud lineofbattle ships s s and larger right up to massive threedecker flagships of gunsin a tormented shotracked inlineahead formation that headed due west stretching easttowest across jester s track for nearly three miles like an oak and iron reef it was no longer the tidy arrangement it had seemed as theyd approached there were gaps between ships greater than the rigorously ordained halfacable separation there were gaps aloft too where ships had lost topmasts and yards still they doggedly plodded west barring jester a path as she beat closehauled to weather westbysouth safety unfortunately lay on the other side of that bellowing reef of warships howes thirty or so liners had gained the wind gauge and followed a parallel course to the french lost in the foggy towers of gun smoke that rose from every ship worse yet there were even more french frigates to leeward of their battle line to serve as aides to the combatantsas rescuers for those forced to break away as occupiers aboard any british ship that was forced to strike and be towed away as prize and as signal repeaters down in clear air to relay their admirals wishes and some of those repeating frigates toward the rear of that battle line had begun to show interest in the strange ship approaching them with no flag flying the one that appeared to be pursued by one of their sisters and the pursuing frigate lewrie turned to have another look no longer needing the telescope she was up to them within a mile or less well within rangetorandom shot it had taken her awhile to recognize that jester had hardened up to windward shed soldiered on still sailing a pointfree for about a quarterhour before going closehauled to keep the wind gauge herself shed lost some windward advantage but there she lay off the larboard side nicely framed behind the mizzen stays almost on a parallel course of westbysouth as a mate to jesters another ten minutes and lewrie would face a hard choice of standingon within range of the repeating frigates perhaps the disengaged broadside guns of the french battle line or fighting a larger heavierarmed frigate that blocked her only chance to come about to starboard tack and jink around the stern of the french liners a tackd lay our head soueastbyeast mister buchanon lewrie speculated aloud aye sir bout that buchanon grunted excuse me capum but id not stand on five minutes more on this tack else we fetch too near th frog liners an have no wind alee of em een for a reach to th east tsail around the last in line a close shave een now sir quite so mister buchanon lewrie nodded unconsciously rubbing his own raspy and unshaven chin at the mention thered been more to worry about this morning than his toilet mister hyde dig into the flag lockers aft i blieve our lords commissioners issued some false flags find the frog tricolor aye aye sir the lad yelped dashing off to search a legitimate ruse de guerre lewrie shrugged to his officers give a few minutes confusion perhaps aye sir found it hyde shrilled forward bend it on mister hyde and hoist it aloft he ordered he was hoping that the french lineofbattle ships had just a tad too much on their plate at the moment to care one way or another and the repeating frigates that could come about and intercept him would lose interest just another corvette arriving with orders from brestsome silly civilian nonsense from the landlubbers of the revolutionary directory or however they now styled themselves he raised his glass as the french tricolor was twoblocked high on the mizzenmast what would that pursuing frigate do now he wondered wasted a whole morning chasing some idiot who ignored his signals to fetchto come to think ont lewrie grinned he never sent me a signal saw me as a chase right from the start and if were both galloping for his fleet flagship like john gilpin on a good horse i have to be french same as him a bodyd be daft as bats to get this close else threequarters of a mile separation now between jester and her pursuer good gun range damned good gun range ah sir buchanon prompted uneasily aye mister buchanon mister knolles stations for stays sir we will put the ship about on the starboard tack and anyone who puts her in irons ill have his nutmegs off with a damn dull knife bosun porter hands to the braces hands to the sheets lieutenant knolles bellowed ready to come about a breathless minute of preparation hands tailing on braces and sheets laying paws on tacks easing all but the last overunder turn around belaying pins and bitts no more than halfapoint free to ease her around quartermaster lewrie snapped tis all the leeway we may spare ships were usually eased a full point off the wind to gather an extra surge in speed to assure a clean tack helm alee knolles screeched at last around she came driving back up on the wind with a quarterknot more speed jib boom and bowsprit sweeping like a pointer across the embattled warships before her bows jibs and staysls fluttering and canvas popping like gunshots as jester neared the eye of the wind as sails lost their luffsyards creaking and woodball parrels crying as they were swung around for a heartstopping moment she slowed to a crawl everything aloft aback and banging before the foreandaft staysls and jibs whooshed across the deck to larboard as she took the wind fine on her starboard bows the spanker over the quarterdeck and the royals and tgallants rustled flagged then filled with the hard crack of laundry airing on a line soueastbyeast quartermaster lewrie cried meet her the wheel spun spokes blurring as they tried to catch up with her momentum as she paid off halfapoint to the new lee in spite of their best efforts as the hands braced hard on the gangways to make a proper spiral set aloft royals more sharply angled to the wind than tgallants tgallants more than topsls from his position at the new windward starboard rails lewrie espied their pursuing frigate which now lay just a touch to the right of jester s bows it would be a damned closerun thing but soueastbyeast would take her clear of the last struggling behemoth lineofbattle ship in the french line and cross the frigates stern if she didnt alter course shit he muttered though as the frigate opened fire it would be a bowrake on jester as the frigate crossed her t employing every available gun in her starboard battery while jesters two shorterranged carronades on the forecastle would be the only guns that could respond roundshot tearing through the curving bow timbers frailer than her sides rebounding and tearing down the complete length of her gun deck and down her gangways he winced into his wool broadcloth coat as if it might be some protection flinching from the avalanche of screaming iron the jagged metal shards whirlwind cloud of wood splinters and the sagging ruin of masts to come though feeling an urgent desire to fling himself to the deck like a sensible person the air trembled and moaned above the general cannonade between the fleets a very personally directed moaning and fluting as fifteen or more twelvepounder balls bored their way toward jester before their revolution france had possessed the finest guns the finest school of naval gunnery in the world with a dedicated corps of lifelong professional artillerists and frail little jester was about to receive nothing pretty much a ragged line of feathers erupted from the sea to either side of her bows as irregularly spaced as a london urchins teeth great and rather pretty pillars of spray and foam leapt up where the roundshot struck the sea at first graze more feathers abeam or astern as cannon balls caromed and bounded over the wave tops like a young lads stone might skip across a duck pond lewrie was sure he heard one or two howl overhead like extremely fat and fatal bumblebees but so high above the royals they didnt even spill an ounce of wind from frail canvas or sever a single stay in passing well damme he cried in befuddled exaltation those poor buggers couldnt hit the ground if they dropped stonecold dead a first broadside usually the bestlaid and pointed at less than threequarters of a mile and theyd missed completely lewrie jeered now stand for mine you poxy clown mister knolles give us a point free mister bittfield the starboard battery fire as you bear he shouted up the fairly steep slant of the deck to windward ninepounders on their heavy truck carriages rumbled and growled foot at a time as the hands ran their pieces up to the ports and beyond to point deadly blackpainted hog muzzles at the foe a tug on the sidetackles or a lever with a crow iron for aiming fists raised in the air from the focsle to far aft in the greatcabins beneath his feet as the gun captains drew their flintlock lanyards taut and stood clear of their charges recoil on the uproll fire lewrie howled primed for vengeance the focsle eighteenpounder carronade began it with a deep bark of displeasure then a stuttering series of roars rippled down the starboard side lewrie looked aft to andrews serving as captain to a quarterdeck carronade he jerked his lanyard and the piece erupted a short stabbing flame and a corona of muzzle smoke it snubbed to the rear on its slidecarriage greased wood compressors smoking too we fired under the french flag sir knolles cautioned it was a grave breach of etiquette that a ruse de guerre was accepted practice right up to the moment of initiating combat get that frog rag down mister spendlove and hoist our true colors lewrie yelled not caring much beyond witnessing the strike of his shot swab out and give em another mister bittfield glorious feathers of spray closeaboard the french frigate short some of them but grazing along at reduced speed for a solid hit on timber the sort of lowvelocity hits that smashed more hulls in than faster strikes which might punch clean through the frigates sails yards and masts quivering and twitching as guns fired from leeward up that slant of the deck even with their quoins fullin went high spanker holed deadcenter mizzen topsl winging out free of its weather brace and the main course ripped in half the frigate stood on stolid in spite of her hurts cannon appeared in her ports again and a second ragged illspaced broadside erupted from her with little more success than the last one and then she was forced to tack she could standon on the larboard tack sail up to her fellows or she must come about to continue the fight tack or wear lewrie mused even as his guns spoke again to wear would put her even with jester wellastern after completing the twentyfourpoint circle no she must tack he decided or throw her hand in as valueless and thatll silence her guns for a bit our ensigns aloft now sir spendlove told him very good mister spendlove one hopes the frogsll take our error as a minor slip in punctilio it appears theyve worse things to worry about at the moment sir midshipman spendlove japed pointing to the french battle line close as jester had come to the fighting they could now take gleeful note of british menowar through the thick banks of powder fog up almost yardarm to yardarm with the french blazing away at pistolshot range oh there she goes sir coming about the frigate was presenting her stern to them swinging up onto the eye of the wind yards all acockbill and canvas slatting took em long enough lewrie sneered jesters gunfire was splattering all about her as she slowed and turned sails caved in on themselves as they were punctured to refill lank and disheveled and alan frowned as he thought he saw a roundshot strike her foremasts topsl yard spilling a wiggling speck or two loose two topmen whod just fallen to their deaths on the hard oak below or into the waters alongside where theyd plunge deep before surfacing to watch their ship sail on uncaring just before they drowned mister knolles harden up fullandby lewrie ordered to put jester back onto the wind and wring out every foot of advantage above the frigate which was visibly struggling to get around to her tack the last french gunned rd rate at the tail of the enemy battle line was off jesters starboard bows by then still with her offside gun ports closed thank god a minute or two more and she would be too acutely angled to take jester under fireout of her gun arcs in the narrow ports and that was punchdrunk and reeling her lower masts sprung and shivering to every new blow ready to go by the board any moment mister spendlove perhaps you might oblige me alan inquired casually in a moderate voice as the gunners swabbed and loaded anew aye sir go aft and bend on this months private signal to identify us he suggested with a wink once we get around to the british side of this battle id not like to be shot to ribbons in error by some overeager repeating frigate aye sir spendlove chuckled the wind was dying away to nothing massive broadsides usually blasted air to stillness and they were witness to one of the greatest sustained exchanges of massive firepower even greater than any battle known so far in history jester was flagging once more coasting along on her builtup momentum more than she was driving ahead closehauled hazed and half concealed in the sulphurous reeking mists that blew alee from that cannonading the french frigate had come about to the starboard tack at last but she was halfamile astern by then though well up on jesters starboard quarter mmm mister ss spendloves respects sir boy firstclass josephs almost hiccuped below lewries waist and shivering frightful as if hed quiver every bone from his body five days at sea less than a month in the navy and he was already under fire wondering what had ever possessed him to go a gentleman volunteer or wish a naval career and still half terrified of his own captain aye mister josephs pp private signal aloft sir he bb bade me tell you thankee mister josephs lewrie replied looking down at him intently his fathers heart softening sewallis was just as twitchy just as miserablelooking half the time something to write home about lad to see a grand battle such as thisun perhaps the only one youll ever see your entire career now dye understand why we start off harsh so you end up the sort o manll stand such i think so sir josephs said with a gulp good lad lewrie said rewarding him with a smile it was going to be buchanons close shave around the stern of that frog after all perhaps by no more than a quartermile he could ease her off the wind a bit and parallel her but the frigate on his starboard quarter was still pursuing bulldog game broadside gunsll no longer bear sir bittfield shouted up from the waist the ninepounders were sharply angled astern in the ports any more and theyd snap their breeching ropes sure cease fire mister bittfield mister rahl supervise carronades on the quarterdeck they have a greater arc of fire ja zir their emigrant prussian barked almost clicking his heels in glee to have some noisy toys to play with a bit longer and that frigate lewrie exulted to himself shell have to fall in almost astern of me if she wishes to continue she stays that high up on our quarter well brush her off against the side of that last liner the frigate reopened fire with her lighter forecastle chase guns fiveor sixpound ball went sizzling across the quarterdeck a little better shooting at last knolles commented theyre not the skillful shots their fathers were lewrie agreed with some relief bless me sir knolles scoffed theyre not the men they were two years ago the starboard quarterdeck carronades belched fire swathing them all in powder smoke for a period before it was wafted away to the noreast by the light winds before jester sailed past her own pall on the bruised air hit i tink herr kapitanl jal rahl delighted watching heavy ball strike and raise a gout of splinters dust and oakum on they stood continuing their duel the last french warship in the battle line was left astern off jesters starboard quarter a run of five minutes more would give her sea room enough to come about and resume her original course of westsouwest with the entire royal navy a protective fence between her and danger gunners aft and the afterguard began to jeer as the french frigate was forced to haul her wind to avoid a collision with that last limping rd rate frigate sir hyde pointed out one of our repeating frigates four points off the starboard bows acknowledging our private signal sir spendlove chimed in mister knolles you may secure from quarters now alan said with a great sigh of success safe in mothers arms from here on french frigate is wearing about sir lewrie looked aft aye she didnt have room in which to tack so she was swinging broadside on to jesters stern presenting them her starboard side to make the greater twentyfourpoint circle off the wind to end up heading west plodding along in company with the other vessels of her fleet deprived of her prey beaten better luck next time you snaileatin bastard alan bellowed in triumph cupping his hands so his words might carry though he doubted a shout across halfamile would register on french ears it was after all the smug insulting victors jeerand thoughtthat counted uh sorry i did that he told himself at once the frigate outsailed then outshot spent a last fit of gallic pique upon jester rippling out one final irregular broadside a crash aft and below as a ball scored at last caving in the transom timbers abaft the stores rooms and officers quarters a great thonk as the ball continued to carom down the length of the empty berth deck glass shattered as another exploded the larboard quartergalleriesboth lewries and the gunroomstoilets splashes and feathers to either beam around the stern and a further hollow thonk and high whine as a ball ploughed a furrow down jesters side and josephs up on the bulwarks was beheaded one instant cheering and waving a fist in the air the next he was flying his small body flung almost amidships of the quarterdeck minus his head throat and shoulders which had been pulped into red mist by six pounds of wailing iron my word lieutenant knolles gasped as his compatriot on the bulwarks his mate rydell hopped down and began shrieking utter horror and terror hed escaped unscathed though theyd been close enough to rub shoulders close enough though to be spattered with droplets of gore brains and bone chips surgeons mate lewrie shouted uselessly loblolly boys wheyfaced himself but determined not to show it nor allow this horror to demoralize his crew he was forced by duty to cross to rydell shut your mouth mister rydell stop that noise he rasped go below if you wish to unman yourself loblolly boys get that that off the quarterdeck at once and turn his back to deal with duty oh dear jesus legoff whispered as he came up from the cockpit on the orlop the place of surgery during quarters poor little chub deal with it mister legoff knolles ordered coolly after he was over his own funk anyone else injured below or aft no one mister knolles praise god lewrie heard legoff say to the first officer here you men scrap o canvas the carrying board take him below to the cockpit and ready him for burial mister buchanon lewrie inquired his face a stony mask i believe we have enough sea room to return to larboard tack aye sir the sailing master muttered as shaken as anyone very well then mister knolles stations for stays come about new course westbysouth till were well up to windward of our lineofbattle ships then well ease her due west to parallel aye aye sir knolles replied happy to have something constructive to do mister porter stations for stays onliest one sir buchanon continued with a whimsical air hmm lewrie grunted still in pain but curious about that tone in buchanons voice josephs capum onliest one een scratched buchanon said more soberly almost in a rueful awe we got our comeuppance from th op mad buggers an ey took eir due from us th gods o th sea capum th ol pagan gods o winds an seas ey took im surely mister buchanon in this modern age lewrie began to scoff a little angered by such a heretical suggestion or maybe a little angered at what he did not yet know at himself perhaps for having the boy started for making his last days fearful me da he was welsh capum buchanon related twas oft he toi me bout em him an th granthers all sir on th stormy nights with th rain an winds ahowlin gainst th shutters r th public house onliest folk still take note o emz sailormen sir priests an church ey drove em out into th wide trackless seas but at dont mean ey passed away capum oh no not at all ready about captain knolles intruded very well mister knolles put the ship about lewrie said in response mesmerized and only half paying attention to his first helms alee rise foretack and sheets one ey named th most sir atd be lir buchanon went on paying only half attention himself as jester began to come about to the eye of the wind dont know much bout th ones crost th seas in th heathen latitudes ones i read about in school sir em ol roman an greek sea gods ey sounded like gennlemen ya could deal with so longz ya didn cross em r eir boss zeus sportin sort o gennlemen who didn mean much by it but lir now capum op irish an welsh sea god one th scots dread too sir oh hes a right bastard sometimes jealous an vengeful hardhearted sort a blooddrinker some say nackyun too capum smartz paint th sort wholl bide his time til a bodyd gone an forgot what he done gainst im but he always takes his pound o flesh in th end he always gets his due when ya least expect an hurts most and a hellish gobble moren a pound of flesh he took lewrie thought trying to stifle an involuntary shiver of awe himself as he recalled the sight of that pitiful remaining husk he turned his attention to his ship away from this spectral higgledypiggledy that buchanon spoke of this ancient superstitious folderol that he sounded as if he really believed buchanon a man whod dragged himself out of the fisheries gone to sea in the fleet come up on science for gods sake astronomy mathematics the art of navigation study of weather charts the sailing of a ship which was mans greatest most complex engine now mainsl haul knolles was crying as jester finished most of her tack passing the eye of the wind as braces dragged the sails aloft to the starboard side where they began to fill and draw um this lir lewrie asked of buchanon in a conspiratorial voice eerily fascinated in spite of himself sea god of the british isles in other words maybe all of em have eir own domain capum buchanon said softly poseidon around th greek isles an aegean op neptune he has th rest o th mediterranean wherever roman sailors went sir lir now id expect hes got th channel north sea all round th british isles an far down inta biscay celts were ere too long ago down south o cape finisterre well leave him capum now he has his revenge lewrie shivered for real in spite of his best intentions as a cool zephyr of clearer air not shot to stillness crossed the deck almost an icycool zephyr that raised his hackles and his napehairs as it passed the sort of eldritch feeling caroline sometimes called having a rabbit run cross your grave that unbidden spookterror of the unknown that harbinger of dire tidings that far lewrie said after clearing his throat we should be fine though sir his pricez paid now lirs took th mocker longz ere isnt another we can go in peace ahum lewrie commented sealing his lips in a thin and wary line ahum chapter toss yah oars andrews ordered as his captains gaily painted gig came alongside queen charlotte a venerable old threedecker and the flagship of admiral earl howe better known as black dick hook onta th chains boat yah oars andrews snapped it was a hellishlong climb up past an ornate lower gundeck entry port as solid as an inigo jones housefront to an upper gundeck entry port thence to the uppermost on the gangways larboard side though lewrie griped to himself not the side of honor where subordinate commanders were usually received jesters position up to windward saw to that and the proper side was probably shot half through after a full morning of battle he decided welcome aboard sir a lieutenant greeted him with a minimum of fuss and you are sir alan lewrie of the jester sloop he replied short as the time had been between attaining safety behind that wooden wall of warships and receiving a flag hoist for captain repair on board with his number hed had a quick shave and thrown on his dress coat and hat admiral howe was a stickler for details and he hadnt earned that sobriquet black dick simply because he didnt often crack a smile either come aboard as ordered sir perhaps it wouldnt have mattered this once since the strange lieutenants whitelapeled coat waistcoat and breeches were stained gray with powder and queen charlotte looked as if shed been rather badly knocked about allow me to name myself sir lieutenant edward codrington welcome aboard sir if youd come this way the young man said as he gestured aft toward the poop lewrie followed him along the larboard gangway to the quarterdeck a rather tall and slim and rather handsome postcaptain looked up as they passed he wore a short tiewig no hat and was holding a white cloth against his head looking rather befuddled and forlorn too lewrie noted hoping his battle had gone well for him and that he wasnt looking so sunk in the bluedevils sitting on an arms chest like a felon for good reason you are feeling better i trust captain codrington took the time to inquire some better aye thankee mister codrington the man said though looking as pale as a crosseyed corpse and you sir codrington did the introductions naming him to capt sir edward snape douglas queen charlottes commanding officer then they were off for the greatcabins under the poop deck the admirals quarters that grand space was being put back in order again guns bowsed taut against the bulwarks furniture and partitions being restored by a procession of seamen took something on the noggin dye see ahem codrington said clearing his throat sir i have the captain of that sloop of war for you ah good good a heavierset postcaptain said leaving the desk where hed been rummaging through a stack of hastily ordered papers lewrie hey he sniffed after the introductions were once more done cant say as ive heard of you sir well no matter sir roger curtis was admiral howes captain of the fleet suave and slightly fleshfaced lewrie took an instant dislike to him if for no other than that very reason and what fetched you to our little dance this morning sir curtis asked some dispatches from london for us hey dispatches for the mediterranean sir lewrie began to tell him but was interrupted by admiral howes arrival from farther aft beyond some reerected wood partitions good christ lewrie gasped though in silence black dickwith a smile on his phyz thats a new worlds seventh wonder milord commander lewrie here off jesterthat ship sloop that popped up like a jackintheboxon passage for the mediterranean already to lord hood i spose the perfect thing damme do i know you sir howe inquired with a puzzled look lewrie sir you interviewed me early spring of eightysix before giving me alacrity in the bahamas milord oh my yes that piratical business in the far east howe sighed squinching his mouth as if his dentures pained him telesto i seem to recall come to see the show did ye commander lewrie a chair arrived yet damme howe frowned turning away before he could hear alans answer like a good sycophant sir roger curtis had a seat whistled up for the old fellow before one could say knife not quite my doing milord lewrie smarmed with his hat under his arm once howe had his chair the battle seemed to have aged the old fellow devlishhard and he was sixtynine to begin with he quickly related his leaving portsmouth five days earlierthe pursuit by french frigates and his escape hoping the smoke had been too thick for anyone aboard queen charlotte to have seen him open fire upon the foe still under false colors sadly hed assumed he was going to be chastised for it why else have him come aboard when the decks were still reddened with casualties blood and the stench of gun smoke still lingered damme commander lewrie howe almost wheezed with delight at the end of his narration a hellish wellmanaged affair wasnt to know dye see your gaining a command but from what i recall of our last recontre you always were the pluckyun now sir during your passage did you see any sign of admiral montagu gave him eight liners to escort a trade far as finisterre and he should have rejoined me long since sorry milord but we neither spoke nor saw any english ships of war since sailing lewrie had to tell him had a bad slant the second day sir he dared to continue to to prose on to a senior officer who hadnt asked yet almost into torbay and nary a sign of him did i see sir well we did manage quite well without admiral montagu sir curtis said sounding very smarmy himself bootlickin toadyish to lewries lights as a fellow whod always known how to toady to those above him lewrie could appreciate a good performance and did forgive me for being remiss about doing so milord but alan could not resist interrupting allow me to extend to you congratulations pon your splendid victory this morning damme lewrie we laid into em aye howe barked with a tiny yelp of rare amusement twentyfive of us lost the use of audacious early on the first dayand montagu already off with eight almost equal in strength to my opposite number admiral villaretjoyeuse im told hes called four days of sparring with him daring him to fight toetotoe him hanging up to windward of me down south nettling him cost him the use of four ships or better he had to send back to brest undertow knocked three about was that yesterday curtis two days ago milord curtis supplied all but wringing his hands in concern for his chiefs health howe looked exhausted dark circles under his eyes and his faceflesh so worn down it appeared to hang in tatters cut off his rear two days ago sir thats when we isolated those three and shot them to rags aye yes howe nodded almost nodding offl with a jerk he was upright again once again enthused forced him to wear about sir took the weather gauge from him then and borrowed a page out of rodneys book at the saintes he lies to my lee hed imagine i must come down upon him while he shoots high damaging rigging as the french are wont to do i become too threatening sir he always has the lee advantage of hauling his wind and retiring in good order but sir but commander lewrie our villaretjoyeuse was not ready for us to close with him direct bowson to him then lask up alongside and lock yardarms signal i flew sir closer action though not all followed your instructions milord curtis said with a sad begrudging moue and lewrie suddenly felt sorry for whichever captain hadnt gotten in pistolshot range seven commander lewrie howe exulted getting to his feet to cramp about wearily perhaps his shoes pinched him sore lewrie wondered six taken as prize one a total loss four more and one of those a threedecker mind four more battered so badly they might spend the next year entire in graving docks oh aye twas a splendid day indeed sir perhaps my last service to the king oh sir surely not why curtis toadied some more damme curtis im ancient howe countered petulantly i should be ashore and allow some younger fitter man a sea command so you are off to admiral hood are you lewrie aye milord gibraltar first then corsica then we shant keep you but the one hour more sir roger will have dispatches for you to carry on for me i would be most honored milord lewrie replied firmly all but laying his hat over his heart and making a leg to the old man your clerk has a fair hand sir curtis inquired aye sir then i shall deliver to you a single copy and your clerk and anyone else with a fair hand may reproduce it while youre onpassage curtis decided it is vital it is urgent goes without sayin smirky little smile and a chuckle but hardly a national secret not after a ship gets word to london one more thing commander lewrie howe interjected coming back to the desk after a fruitless search for something to drink a wineglass was in his hand from his reerected pantry though there was no sign as yet of his wine cabinet sir roger an order for admiral montagu directing him to place his squadron off brest denying the french reentry explain to him that my ships your most able ships at least sir sir roger suggested as he whistled for the flag lieutenant who should be doing the scribbling for his betters and captains he muttered sotto voce uhmph howe grunted with a sour dyspeptic expression one more time reminding lewrie of just how much black dick really did resemble the rebel george washington with an attack of gas that until the fleet is fully found again he must keep them from reaching the french coast and that i will bring the main body along as soon as were able should he have taken prizes from the grain convoy made contact with it at all he is to send them into english ports under prize crews without escort further it is my appreciation the french having suffered severe damage aboard those ships that retired our recent action will be shaping course for brest or lorient and quite possibly will be unable to make any reasonable or spirited resistance to any action he should undertake do you have that roger i do milord in essence sir roger curtis replied making a few hasty scribbles of his own and seeming to resent it lewrie i cannot delay you making the best of your way with dispatches but should you sight admiral montagus squadron you are to break your passage and speak him deliver my orders to him i will milord but what if i should sight their grain convoy alan asked should i break passage and attempt to inform anyone no howe decided after a long mazy yawn and a period of weary reflection you carry on with dispatches i will use our attached frigates for scouting and we rather doubt their convoy is actually close enough to even midatlantic as of yet lewrie curtis added and most certainly will not be taking a southerly track anywhere near your course i see sir roger alan replied much eased that hed not be swanning about for days or weeks in a fruitless search very well then milord should i stay aboard queen charlotte to await orders or go back aboard jester i am completely at your convenience sir no best let mister codrington fetch them to you admiral howe decided after another stupendous yawn and taking his chair once more i fear our hospitality at the moment given the circumstances is none of the best after all ill take my leave then sir milord howe sir roger alan said beginning to bow his way out my congratulations once again on this victory a glorious way to usher in the summer a most glorious first day of june commander lewrie aye sir roger curtis brightened making a little note to himself that he stuck in a side pocket of his ironbound dress captains coat sorry we could not make you more welcome commander lewrie lieutenant codrington said once theyd gained the gangway after your actions as well in escaping those frigates and shaving their battle line well there should have been a bottle in it at least i quite understand sir lewrie chuckled in mock rue im quite satisfied the fleet was here to rescue me as it were uhm when you come aboard lieutenant codrington the fleet will be off for home soon i doubt that commander codrington told him still all the frog ships that got away to deal with a letter to send aye alan answered a letter of condolence to the parents of a lad who was killed this morning i apologize sir i didnt know none needed sir alan allowed id hate for them to think hes still well im quite certain captain curtis will have a frigate sailing for england with our good tidings commander lewrie lieutenant codrington scowled dashing reallysails set all to the royals when i fetch you the documents you may rest assured your letter to the lads parents will be aboard that frigate my word ont my heartfelt thanks to you then sir lewrie said as they shook hands on the agreement ahoy th boat party below make ready a petty officer shouted down sideparty uhmm sorry mr codrington but do make no fuss over me alan offered most graciously and modestly he thought youve better things to do at the moment im sure than take men away from repairs or seeing to their mates oh thankee sir the petty officer beamed in approval an hour no more sir codrington promised casting an envious eye over lewries shoulder to the beautifully formed sloop of war that rode fetchedto two cables off chapter ships compny off hats bosun porter ordered speaking in a throaty rasp though one almost soft and reverent for once as the ship lay once more fetchedto just at sunset once free of howes fleet just after sailing them under the horizon the winds had come more westerly more like what was expected in the bay of biscay and jester on starboard tack had loped nearly fortyfive miles farther by dusk now she lay cocked up to weather some sails full of drive others laid all aback to snub her motionless tgallant yards acockbill though to signify a death and a burying liftlines purposely put out of trim to speak grief the entry port on the starboard gangway to weather was open and a party stood by with the canvasshrouded corpse on a long eightman messtable board the small hump beneath the red ensign seemed too small to bother with how much room did a mere boy take alan wondered short before shorter now thered been little to find of his head and shoulders but scoops of offal josephss body looked arseyvarsey the two roundshot at his feet more headlike heretical it might be but lewrie had the thought anyway as he opened the prayer book to the ribanded page custom said the sailmaker took a final stitch through the nose of those dischargeddead to assure the crew that the departed was truly gone over now if there wasnt a nose or a head he shook himself to silence such fell musings the light of a spectacular sunset was fast fading he had to hurry o god whose beloved son didst take little children into his arms and bless them give us grace we beseech thee to entrust this child richard josephs gentleman volunteer to thy neverfailing care and love he intoned from the prayer book and followed its suggestion that for the interment of a child lamentations was particularly apt for he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men there followed psalm tried and trusted by sailors since time immemorial most of them knew it and could recite it softly with the older men leading out of the deep have i called unto thee o lord lord hear my voice o let thine ears consider well the voice of my complaint and it got especially tearful and lewrie could hear rough tars beginning to weep when they got to my soulfleeth unto the lord before the morning watch i say before the morning watch a lesson from the new testament the equally familiar rd psalm and then since they had no clergy aboard to celebrate the eucharist or speak a homily lewrie skipped ahead to the committal in sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life through our lord jesus christ we commend to almighty god our shipmate richard josephs and we commit his body to the deeps earth to earth ashes to ashes dust to dust the lord bless him and keep him the lord make his face to shine upon him and be gracious unto him the lord lift up his countenance upon him and give him peace amen there was a dry swishing noise as the mess table was upended as the red ensign collapsed followed by a splash alongside josephs was making an end to his first and only passage sped by the weight of combative iron to abyssal depths where it was hoped there was no corruption until the day of resurrection thank god he knew it by heart for he could no longer read the text of the prayer book his eyes were just as full of tears damme only a year oldern sewallis he thought as he and his crew began to chant the lords prayer even as the westerly huffed impatiently over the gangway fluttering the pages of both prayer book and bible as ratlines quivered and shook and an eldritch wailing keened aloft in the rigging and ghostly windmutters spoke in the shrouds for ever and ever amen he concluded saints presarve us an irish catholic seamen whimpered and a number of the burial party on the gangway crossed themselves muttering like sentiments there was a surge forward to the bulwarks es come an ancientlooking member of the sailmakers crew swore es come f r im he declared lewrie stepped to the starboard bulwarks and peered over the side and once more his hackles and napehairs went up heart rose in his throat stomach chilled in icy terror and his breath stopped faint there were seals in the water closeaboard cavorting about their winebottle bodies swirling half submerged round in a circle below the entry port where little josephs had splashed sweet jesus save us lewrie gibbered to himself a seals head broke water about ten yards off to windward a sleek bewhiskered hounds head with wideopen gentle puppy eyes lir lewrie gawped seals this far out to sea why else a more heads appearing in a pod as they backpaddled gazing up at the sailors along the rail as more and more left off their circle to join them until the entire pack was motionless just breathing and staring bobbing on the slightly restless sea letting wrinkly windstroked waves break over them as the sea got up seals not sharks capum mister buchanon whispered harshly near his ear which made lewrie like to jump right out of his skin you be th one ttell em sir tis seals come fr him youll see they wont be afeard no more when ey hear at calmly lads lewrie called out still skittery with fear of the unknown himself twasnt sharks that have come to take him twas seals look at em just playful seals aye tis a selkie th tykes t be the irish sailor said with a note of gladness and pleasure in his voice and several more west country men agreed aloud still crossing themselves cautiously but sounding almost crooning now as if a wrong had been righted goobye lad one called down to the depths goobye boy twill be playin t yer hearts content yell be doin now on til foriver christ what sort of madness is this what heresy have i countenanced lewrie wondered though his hands were calmer easier and no longer terrifiedmost of em anyway he thought noting how a landsman or newcome was being told the real facts of life by the old and experienced seadaddies ye selkies the old sailmakers assistant chortled poor chubz a good lad twoz josephs see ye take th best o keer o him hear me an more fresh tears ran down his aged cheeks an when it come me own time pray jesus an all th saints ye come f r me when i go oer th side god pity ye an god love ye one by one the seals heads submerged into a swirl of barely disturbed water until only the oldest and largest was left blinking incredibly huge and soft brown eyes at them why he did so alan had not a clue but he waved to him the seal seemed to nod as a sea broke over him and came up blinking once more his huge gentle eyes swept clear of saltwater tears lewrie could conjure with droplets of sympathy bedewing his mustaches and then he was gone as if hed never been he submerged making not even the tiniest ripple on the waters he sank out of sight and he was gone and alan lewrie shivered like a wet dog having to grip the bulwarks oak to keep a grip on his sanity shivering at the revealed presence of a sea god far older than jesus christ was all he could mutter in icy awe as he came back to his senses and wishing to be far away from that hoary phantasm ahum he continued mister knolles hands to the braces put us back on the wind and get us underway aye aye sir knolles replied from the quarterdeck astern bible and prayer book gathered from the deck where hed dropped them bent pages reverently smoothed out that took a few welcome and contemplative moments hat back firmly on his head back to his place along the weather bulwarks of the quarterdeck where he could pace as a symbol of authority christ as a symbol of reason again mister buchanon he had to ask though drawing the sailing master to his side where they could talk confidentially what are they the whatyoucallems selkies eres a legend capum buchanon told him at long long ago twas a battle comin twixt good an evil an lir a as one o op gods come tthis fishin village lookin for help gainst evil now th villagers cried off dye see sir said eys too

souls sir who remembered livin ashore an how good twoz drove em inta th sea weepin an wailin where eyd bawl all eir livelong days doesnt sound like a good god to me to punish so lewrie sniffed in disapproval of action tale or truth he didnt know op testaments full o such though sir buchanon countered wryly but heres the cruelest part o lirs curse after a centuryr two his cess seemed t sputter out one at a time ey swim ashore on some rookery beach an woke up people again capum thought eyd paid for eir sins at last an woz free but oh no dont tell me they got so used to being seals that he kenned with a wry grimace they began to ache for the sea aye sir at ey did buchanon chuckled fell in love an wed had babes an houses an lives worth livin but then some night sir when the winds blowin

off eir clothes an swim out with no lookin back an turn back inta seals ey do capum have a high old time o it for a while back with eir ol friends in th sea as selkies again and then that gets old and they remember being people and their loved ones ashore lewrie shivered doomed tgo through th whole pain over an over again til th end o time capum buchanon intoned as sure of his lore as he was of the next sunrise but tis said sir eres times ey come back ashore tfetch eir gits selkie makes a babe hes half selkie himself then an he cant resist wadin out some night neither when his da or ma does no matter whose heart it breaks twaz a heavy curse lir laid on em sir a heartless bugger he no mister buchanon lewrie protested or felt that he had to as a rational man as some sort of a christian lir sent the sealsselkiesto take josephs thatd be robbing god of that lads immortal soul thatd keep him from salvation th ladz from bristol sir buchanon explained shaking his head utterly convinced of his lightness no matter that he was speaking an ancient pagan heresy little josephs might o been a selkie tbegin with livin at close tth sea from a seafarin famly i seen or heard o such before capum back home when iz a lad a spell as a seal lir didnt rob god jus borrowed josephss soul for a piece more like th ladll appear in is world again might be a foundlin an grow up tbe a sailor maybe one with a

shake a stick at an we just saw one sir and ats a fact all folk can do sometimes is be left twonder amen to that lewrie said automatically looking astern at their wake a gray specter only darkly sunsettinted upon the foam wondering if it would be a wonderor a sign of a further curse from lirto espy another seal well then ahum thankee mister buchanon thatll be all for now do carry on aye aye sir the sailing master replied doffing his hat in salute as he wandered over to the hands by the wheel as seven bells of the second dog were struck up forward lewrie went below to his cabins for his supper stowing bible and prayer book in the shelf above the chart table on the way yer rhenish sir aspinall inquired cleaning his hands on the fresh white apron he wore a glass o claret tonight then brandy aspinall lewrie decided grimly bigun aye sir best for what ails ya says i aspinall rambled on cheerily as he poured three fingersworth into a snifter sad it is sir that little tyke but a stout measure o something always bucks a body right up sir toulon came slinking out of hiding into the cheery light from the overhead lanthorns wailing a welcoming maaahhawr with even more urgency and enthusiasm than he usually showed and that was not insubstantial to begin with greeting his master as much as cats may be said to have the concept of master down pat with a desperate show of affection or a desperate need of it himself never known to be a particularly doting tribe except when it suited them still toulon seemed to empathize as he climbed alans chest patted and kneaded furiously and reclined on his shirtfront finally little head butting under alans chin licking and purring in remarkable commiserating ardor you feel it too toulon lewrie asked softly scare you too maiwee was the ramkittens shuddery reply as he turned himself boneless to flatten his body even closer scared the devil out of me let me tell you lewrie confided to his creature he stroked toulon down from forehead to tailtip in thankfulness that there was somebody there to give him comfort at least was it even real puss did it really happen like i think it did god should it ever come my time alan thought cringing at the very idea thats one way to escape the devil and his fires a back gate for the damnedbecome a selkie wouldnt do you a bit of good would it toulon lewrie told the ramcat cant abide your spongedown now much less a swim moi the cat sang under his jaw paws working as he slinked higher toward his collars christ what use is a selkie who cant swim lewrie snorted forcing himself to chuckle like most good english seamen he could not swim a single lick if a ship went down most of them said that trying to swim only prolonged the inevitable or saved one just long enough to be eaten by something right after one got ones hopes up and damme lewrie sighed taking another refreshing draught of his brandy shoving another fey feeling away poor little josephs he pondered instead barely got his sea legs and bam maybe it is best that that lir took him just for a bit say chub might be happy to be a seal for a while happiern he was board this ship at any rate a lad about sewalliss age and size lewrie mourned with infinite regret dreams shattered terrifiedstartedheartbroken then dead long fore his time there came the faint sound of a fiddle tune from the gun deck slow lugubrious and atonal like what captain ayscough aboard telesto had delightedly told him was the great music played on bagpipes but this was one he recognizedthe funeral song played for stuart hopes and the dead of culloden after the the flowers of the forest his eyes pricked with remorseful tears he thought for an instant of ordering the fiddler to cease but toulon climbed to his shoulder to snuffle at his ear lewrie felt him stiffen heard him chitter as he did at the sight of a seabird claws dug into his shoulder and the little ramkittens tail which lashed before his nose bottled up to doublesize he made his chatter again a seabird this late in the evening he wondered or a selkie in their wake ill not look he whispered keeping his gaze firmly ahead and taking another deep draught of brandy i dont want to know and he didnt though toulon continued to knead and shiver his little chops quavering and would not get down and lashing his tiny tail thick as a pistol swab brush in a frenzy lewrie did turn his head just enough to see toulons neck his whole body straining aft intent as only a cat may be intent upon something astern almost as if in yearning or silent beastly communion rot lewrie muttered harshly rot i say has to be muumhh toulon said at last sounding disappointed as his body lost its lockspring tension then he was amenable to a rub on his flank to turn clumsily and drop down to alans lap to knead a new nest and rasp his rough little tongue on alans hand purring like anything book ii anceps aestus incertiam rapit ut saeva rapidi bella cum venti gerunt utrimque fluctus maria discordes agunt dubiumque feruet pelagus haut aliter meum cor fluctuator a double tide tosses me uncertain of my course as when a rushing tide wages mad warfare and from both sides conflicting floods lash the seas and the fluctuating waters boil even so is my heart tossed medea book ii lucius annaeus seneca chapter a quick inventory a circular course for his jittery right hand along his uniform cuffs shot waistcoat tugged straight hat set on just so washleather purse full of guineas still safe and a blank noteofhand snugly ensconced in a coat pocket well then a deep spinestraightening breath before he rapped on the door as he waited for someone within to answer lewrie experimented with a range of expressions on his face smile no frown that wouldnt do either something inbetween perhaps though he suspected that something inbetween would resemble a gas attack or a pair of tootight shoes he was striving hellish hard for ambivalent and why the devild she remove herself to this set o rooms he asked himself with a quick fleeting scowl her olduns were nice enough and not that dear she have a comedown spite of the money i left her waste it all on fripperies or gamblin yessir a mobcapped oldish maidservant inquired of him as the door opened with a rusty creak at last commander alan lewrie he flummoxed out not sure exactly what sort of expression his phyz wore then come to call upon mademoiselle phoebe aretino is she in god be praised sir the square old crone cried in delight clapping her hands together and raising enough noise to wake the entire neighborhood youre her navy fella come back at last come you in sir come you in let me take your hat commander lewrie have a cane an no mistress she bawled that with the door standing wide open cartmen and vendors were stopped dead in their tracks in the narrow steep little street that straggled uphill from the old moles a curate and his wife out for an invigorating uphill stroll both clad in old rustyblack dominйe ditto were frowning heavily as lewrie sought some way short of strangulation to stifle the old morts bellows mistress phoebe the woman halloed upstairs tis commander lewrie hes come maam hurry at least he could use his foot to slam that heavy old door to keep their reunion somewhat private as a delighted shriek came from above quickly followed by the patter of petite feet on the carpet and floorboards and stairs lewries lips twitched as he attempted to regain the composure of his face anew and trying to recall just exactly which demeanor hed thought most suitable alain phoebe cried breathlesslyalmost brokenly as she appeared on the tiny middle landing of the narrow pair of stairs her brown eyes were fawnhuge and lambent as if suddenly aswim with tears of joy and her cheeks flush with emotion oh damme lewrie thought with a shudder a definite lurching in his chest and an instant tumbledy flood of warmth why the devil she have to look that handsome that young and he went to raise his right hand as if to doff the hat he didnt wear to her in genteel salute but it got no higher than his midchest appearing to her as an invitation before she dashed down the stairs to fling herself upon him with such a fierce ardor that he was almost driven backward off his heels to the floor he rocked one heel backward to balance put his arms about her to hold her up savoring all over again just how tiny how petite and perfectly formed phoebe aretino was with her arms about his neck and most happily dangling with her heels far off the floor showering his face his neck his eyes with a positive deluge of kisses whispering betwixt each some french some english endearments and declarations of how much she had ached for the sight of him to support her of course doin the gentlemanly thing lewrie swore to himself he was forced to place his hands under her bottom touch her small spare incredibly soft phoebe he whimpered hed meant to growl to caution her about the maid whose presence phoebe was blissfully ignoring meant to greet her pleasantly in point of fact merely pleasantly but their lips met open and inviting coffeehot and musky already as she still oblivious to the cronish maidservant lifted her ever so slim thighs and wrapped them around his waist phoebe he essayed again well damme he thought in a hopeless muddle meant thatun to be japing cajole her down but it had come out throaty caressing he evidently had called upon her just about the time shed arisen from bed or just after her morning ablutions phoebe hadnt taken time to throw on a morning gown in which visitors could be decently received only a spiderwebthin silk dressing robe no corsets stays or underpinnings no chemise nothing even atу cumbrous came between his hands which were now beginning to rove her back and bottom fondly and her tender young flesh but that dressing robe damp ringlets of lustrous dark brown hair toyed about his face and collarsrich sultrily italian mediterranean exotic and darkascoffee hair so long alain mon cerf formidable she crooned in his ear a tiny breathless huskiness to her usually small voice mont an mont you be away an ony ze une lettre mon coeur ah mees you si trиs beaucoup phoebe he sighed chuckling with uncontrollable undeniable delight by then as he dipped his head to kiss her throat the soft flesh under her chin her slim neck below her ears knew thisd happen he chid himself knew it but not anywhere near as harshly as he might god help me but nature had her way with him by then unbidden in spite of a whole host of good intentions the fork of his breeches felt nigh to bursting with a raging tumescence which he swore could serve as taffrail flagstaff in a full gale he took a clumsy step toward those first set of stairs felt her shift against him meaning to keep his balance under such a tempting alluring topheavy cargo and he was lost again ma chйrie he muttered ma petit biche ma choul oh alain urry she teased glancing upward mon amour well he thought not a touch rueful spose we have to get reacquainted first in for the penny in for the pound an all that theyd not quite attained real privacy not that first reunion a trail of his shoes sword and belt neckstock and coat littered up the second flight attested to that waistcoat gone longtail shirt and breeches open hed played horsey to her hunter and trotted her to the tiny upper landing into her bedchambers and all about the room laughing all the while crying yoicks tallyho and making bugle calls through his nostrils trot canter draw sabers and sound the charge as he recalled from seeing the local yeoman cavalry practice their drill back in anglesgreen spitted upon him phoebe had shrieked aloud open windows to the street bedamned and more than once too he smugly congratulated himself before theyd collapsed exhausted across her high bedstead in shuddery giggles of delight tears of ecstasy and muchneedful pantings a quarterhour of kisses caresses strokes of dearly remembered skin a quarterhour of endearments of pledges of heartbreak over the long separation many sighs and shudders and rolling about twine and countertwine stoking the coals with kisses becoming more and more intimate and giving looking up at her rough sailors hands on her slim swansdown hips as she bestrode him rocking and riding bold as a plumed lancer riding saint george with her head thrown back and her carefully coiffed hair come down in sweaty а la victime ringlets incredibly slim arms her waifslim waist and taut little belly phoebes small breasts in his eyes large dark areoli and pouty little nipples mesmerizing him all over again bedewed with perspiration as she flung herself thrusted to meet him so tiny she was so gamin and light so completely engrasping and enfolding about him so utterly kittenish yet minxlike and enthralling and so strong her slim little fingers on his shoulders as she leaned forward face crumpled tears flowing breath rasping harsh and insistent between her moans and cries he slid his hands up to surround her breasts and she leaned in to support herself eyes flying wide open as she began to smile expectantly speared to the utter depths of her heart of her soul in one more of a series of the little deaths as his own release built to more than he could stand without bellowing like a steer not a moment more could he wait withhold himself delay his pleasuring in hopes it might help her attain hers hard and greedy now niceties bedamned and phoebe took his hands in hers crushed swordbruted ropebruted palms into her tenderest flesh twined fingers and keened aloud a victory paean that went on and on rising falsetto in time to their every shift and judder until at last she screamed a weak thin scream twined fingers tighter and leaned back trusting him to keep her from falling as his own head exploded as he departed his life for a maelstrom of colored stars tumbling down a cannons barrel into the swirling sparks and flame points of eruption exploding upward delirious and aswim reeling and rolling in a feverdream feeling her grip him grip him grip him and spasm as their senses tumbled around the cosmos utterly ruined when he came back to his life a few moments later chest heaving for air utterly spent as she sat back erect then dropped shuddering and gasping atop him her soft gentle breath gusting now across his shoulder damp ringlets clinging to both their faces surprisingly strong little hands and arms about his neck yet such an utterly soft sweet and spent kiss did she give him in reward her full sweet lips brushing his so lightly and curling upward in a smile he put his arms about her slim back stroked her damp flesh from shoulders to buttocks then encircled her and squeezed possessively inhaling deep for his wind and taking in every subtle nuance of cologne scented soap perspiration sweet hair and lovemaking as if to fill his lungs with her forever je tadore alain she told him her voice tiny and barely audible even with her lips near his ear afterr aw zees time you are ere encore je tadore mon coeur mon chou fantastique missed you too alan sighed giving her another squeezing hug and feeling a shoulderrolling shudder go right down to his toes as he did so you i adore aussi ma chou je tadore trиs beaucoup damme to hell but he sighed to himself biting his lip but with his hands gently caressing her in spite of all i said it both waysfrog and english damme to hell but its true je tadore ma belle amour je tadore he whispered in for the penny in for the pound indeed but it felt so good to be back chapter ahoy the boat midshipman spendlove called to the heavy hired cutter as it neared them oars dipping in liquid gold water in an ambertinted mediterranean twilight jesterl came the return hail from their captain himself must be in a hurry not tove sent off for his gig hyde opined by his side on the starboard gangway thought wed have been upanchor and away hours ago mister midshipman spendlove rejoined though he had already speculated on why the captain had sent his gig back to the ship just after he had gotten to gibraltar s old mole landing a heavy bundle of dispatches in a canvaswrapped case under his arm and then he hadnt returned since noon and midshipman clarence spendlove from previous service knew what tempting lure still lurked at gibraltar to ensnare the captain just like dido from his latin texts dido and whatever his name was imprudent reality made his slim erudition flee his head mine arse on a bandbox spendlove muttered sotto voce emulating his commanding officer once he had a gander at the cutters contents mister rydell midshipman of the watchs duty to mister knolles and inform him the captains returning aboard run boy mister cony bosun o the watch there sideparty man the gangway spithead nightingales shrilled marine sergeant boothby and the first officer mister knolles presented swords marines stamped their feet and slapped walnut musket stocks in salute as the top of their captains hat loomed over the lip of the entry port crewmen of the watch and most of the offduty watch idling on deck doffed hats to pay homage homage that was returned by the doff of a goldlaced cocked hat on lewries part once hed attained the security of the upper oaken gangway deck mister knolles i lewrie began hesitantly quite unlike his usual demeanor aye sir knolles prompted wondering why his frank and open commanding officer could not quite match glances with him of a sudden bosuns chair over the side to the boat mister knolles the captain grunted arad a workingparty blackwall hitch on the mainyard staytackle to fetch dunnage aboard aye aye sir knolles replied mister cony rig a bosuns chair and a cargo staytackle hoist dismiss the sideparty mister knolles lewrie ordered turning to peer over the side arms spread wide on the bulwarks were not receiving officers ralph knolles raised an eyebrow stepped to the side surreptitiously and cast a single furtive glance over their lone passenger was a woman a most beautiful young lady knolles frowned oh he gasped in recognition last time we were at gibraltar the captain they said he had a doxy ashore but hells bells knolles thought with a weary sigh before turning to supervise the working party it was no concern of his really what his captain did whom he entertained aft onpassage knolles had served in ships with a captains entire family aboard had been aboard a rd rate in which every warrant division or department head had his wife and kiddies along the solitary celibate seafaring life was a convenient fiction for the most partmostly for the benefit of the true wives and families left ashore but he never thought commander lewried be no probably not a lady knolles sniffed in prim dismissal an affair most definitely an affair he had no business in you damn fool lewrie eluded himself you damn fool his face felt flush and his clothing chafed him itchy and sore or perhaps his very skin he thought yet he stood atremble with more concern for phoebes safety than for his repute as she was hoisted aboard hed really meant to end their relationship had taken a fair amount of solid coin and a noteofhand upon his shore agent then his london bank to cushion her dismissal from his life so short a time though in her bewitching presence and he was as willless as a drunken gambler zat ees effroyable phoebe peeped once free of the slings of the bosuns chair a high color to her own cheeks but with glitter to her eyes mais ees trиs їmotionnant with a giggle of fading delight she slipped an arm through his ahum mister knolles allow me to name to you mademoiselle phoebe aretino lewrie stammered over the social graces she will be sailing with us mademoiselle is from corsica originally so mademoiselle aretino knolles said doffing his hat and making a leg in reply to her graceful curtsy though his expression was hellishbland lieutenant knolles enchantй msieur phoebe rejoined with her best formal manner ah msieur spenloove bonjour encore you areah well she cried as she spotted a familiar face maam spendlove greeted blushing aye well uhm an msieur lapin non pardon merci merde alors phoebe stumbled msieur cony ze gran ero weez ze grenades aye maam cony said preening twaz grenadoes we used good o ya tremember maam well hmm lewrie flummoxed once the many introductions were done among the quarterdeck people who had crowded forward after word had gone around that a vision had descended from heaven and that the captain had a doxy alan felt as a pilfering thief might forced to run a gantlet of his messdeck victims and their starters or rope ends cony do you be so good as to see uhm mistress aretinos dunnage aft mister knolles i note the windll serve just weve an hour till full dark we could be standing out around europa point by then pipe the hands to stations for weighing anchor and prepare us for getting underway aye aye sir knolles replied just as glad as lewrie to escape into something more mundane and maritime ill see mistress aretino aft and get her somewhat settled lewrie promised then rejoin you carry on till then sir but isnt he married midshipman hyde queried in a whisper aye but spendlove griped just as softly met her at toulon used to be enamored i spose you could call it of our lieutenant scott but he passed over when we were sunk didnt have anyone else to turn to around the time of the evacuation so oh like the vicomtesse de maubeuge hyde said his tongue firmly in cheek i must say clarence at least the captain has grand taste when it comes to women wives and doxies hmm my word cony knolles grumbled my bloody oath so she is well was scotts paramour first now our captains aye sir cony said with a faint scowl of worry a sweet lil thing though hed known lewries amatory appetites for years shared em in point of fact reveled in em truth to tell going to sea becoming lewries man so long ago had opened his eyes to life broadened his horizons far beyond that bucolic innocence hed known as a rustic gloucestershire chawbacon with thatch sticking from out his ears what enthusiasm he had for his new status as the proper married man he owed to the lewries fondness for each other and what enthusiasm he had for maggie had been born abed with her how else was there a little will in swaddlings now if not for prйnuptial passion being a practical commonsensical sort bosuns mate will cony knew from long experience that sailors will usually be sailors far from home with months between letters or news maggie almost kenned that as any seamans wife should as they said on the lower decks shouldnta joined if ya cant take a joke still hed always believed that lewrie would be more discreet than that hed even spoken disparagingly of officers who carried a mort to sea parading before the lovestarved lustsurly people what they could not have if the little saucepot had that much influence on him though she is that knolles commented rather wistfully well mister cony ahem carry on aye sir cony chuckled knuckling his forehead in salute knowing hed been dismissed knowing that knolles had said too much to an inferior and was seething inside for being so open dot de guhl th capum woz ssweet on will andrews asked once knolles had walked away de one ya toi me bout aye that she be ope she dont

of europa point and reaching easterly on a beam wind the galley funnel fuming once more to simmer up a late supper aspinall took his hat to hang up as lewrie hesitantly went aft to his daycabin suddenly feeling like an intruder in a strange salon there was a slanging match going on with much hissing spitting and a noticeable nimbus of stressshed fur as the litter mates toulon and phoebes kittennow halfgrown to an almost calico whiteandtangot reacquainted toulon on the desktop pawing the wine cabinet in threat as her cat cowered atop it looking over the edge hunkered up and snarling trilling deep in her throat between nervous choplicking take no guff off the ladies toulon thats the way alan muttered as he opened the cabinet doors to pour his own drink sorry sir but i wasnt goin nowhere near em long as theyre in a snit aspinall apologized no problem aspinall lewrie told him tipping himself a glass of hock and whats your name little girl whatever did your mistress name you spit whurdrdrdr did ye say he yodeled a traveling case thumped to the deck in the sleeping coach a bustle oн domesticity accompanied by a pleased humming tune sometimes breaking into a softhalfconscious lalaing good christ but im such a fool lewrie told himself perhaps for the hundredth time since midmorning well tis only till corsica bags of time to wean both of us after the military authorities at gibraltar had been gloating merry about admiral lord hoods siegework there the main harbor san fiorenzo had fallen early on and just recently the city of bastнa had come into british or coalition possession now the french were isolated hanging on by their fingernails at the extreme northern end of the island in calvi the coastline was so well guarded by royal navy ships that a fishing smack couldnt sneak in with supplies or reinforcements neither could the french hope for a piecemeal evacuation over several nights and to discomfit the frogs even further the fleet theyd put together from scattered units in the mediterraneanor brought back into commission after the coalition had failed to burn them when they had evacuated toulon the previous christmashad been countered at sea rather deuced well hood had sailed away from the siege to meet rear admiral comte martin and had snaffled the dismal bastard into a sack in the golfe jouan east of cannes where he was now embayed and most effectively blockaded of absolutely no use to the desperate republican army at calvi or anyone else pretty much toulon interrupted lewries musings breaking off his own sort of siegework to rub and purr and meow for attention which he got at once looking up and sneering a lofty so there see at the cat atop the wine cabinet only the few days toulon lewrie promised him oww piqued perhaps phoebes calico had taken a defensive swat at him and had connected on his right ear oh merde alors phoebe cooed exiting the sleeping coach in a lacy flutter of feminine finery juliette elle est ze mйchancetй ees naughty oui ze trиs naughty jeune fille i am sorry mais she ees protec uhm its my wine shes protecting he groused placing a handkerchief to his ear damme he carped to

nestce pas i kees an mak eet better hein she cajoled swishing her hips and gazing up at him with mischievous impish eyes aprиs souper peutкtre he japed in return any qualms in his head evaporating in another instant certainment mon chou she replied with a promising grin and retrieving her cat joliette and keeping his wineglass to sashay off astern to the crude sofa to sit and stroke her beast down he poured himself another and joined her along the way he got a peek into the sleeping coach to find that her pitiful collection of luggage he recalled from toulon before the evacuation had grown considerably there were now two full portmanteau chests brimming with yard goods not only dresses but bed linens coverlets the wink of pewter there were unopened crates that had rattled as theyd come aboardglassware and plates i was surprised your removing he began oh alain to ave ze proper establissement pour vous i mus buy ze many sings she explained looking as if she would be eager to jump to

care of me i weel non be expensive you weel see parce que because i love you so much a quiet little place then he inquired hopefully though coin did chink about in his head how much might that quiet little place cost thered be furniture paintings servants wages and quiet secure lodgings meant good neighborhoods far removed from the commercial quarter a coachandfour might be necessary the need for china silver plate cutlery lanthorns and candle stands beeswax candles by the gross drapers and paperers in and out with even more costly he took a fortifying sip of wine nozzing grande mon chou she

cheap alan turned to peer at her for such a sweet seemingly guileless young fairy girl phoebe had suddenly sounded as calculating and pinchpenny as grasping as a haymarket horse trader be grow up poor as moi alain mon chou she chuckled in answer to his puzzled expression with a wry tip of her glass in salute to her past you fin ow to shop for bargain the thought did cross his mind it must be said even as he was placing a supportive and comforting arm about her shoulders that there was still time to cry off their cozy arrangement he could give her fifty pounds in cointhe devil with his noteofhand fifty pounds would be more than enough to support her for months if corsican living was as cheap as she described it certainly it would be cheaper than establishing an entire new household with all the requisite furnishings damme he thought wryly i know sailorsre said to have a wife in every port but nobody said a bloody thing bout whole houses trus moi alain she whispered her soft breath close and promising near his ear as i trus you wiz my hole eart well that did it i do have a fair lot o prize money he relented anew maybe it wont be as cheap as it was in toulon or aboard radical after the evacuation god that didnt cost tuppence really and the navyd paid most of it didnt they they looked into each others eyes fond smiles threatening to break out on each others lips eyes crinkling in remembered delights that too did it right so shed had a hard life he told himself she was so lost and alone in a harsh world should he spurn her shed find a new patron of course that was the lot of penniless but beautiful young girls with no family connections or power to resist that was the way of the world if needs must phoebe might return to being a courtesan for a dozen a hundred other men to make her way what was it his brotherinlaw burgess chiswick had said when they were besieged at yorktown a north carolina folk colloquialism hard timesd make a rat eat red onions shed hate doing so of course phoebe had abandoned that life to take up with poor lieutenant scott as her only lovershe his onlynot because barnaby had been any sort of decent toward her really or kept her in any sort of style but because she didnt want to tumble any farther down that maelstrom spiral to ruin and oblivion that was the lot of most whores no matter how pretty or clever aye phoebe might be a little captain sharp when it came to finding a bargain of wheedling for any edge that might guarantee her another week of safety and security in that she might be as grasping as the boldest most raddled dockside mutton as cunning and sly and rapacious as a starving fox by the henyard fence but phoebe hadnt yet grown talons and teeth or armored herself against exploitable emotions she was still vulnerable and somewhat open for the sham the semblance of true love and affection phoebe would offer him dammit any man who was halfway kind to her all that she possessed so shed never have to surrender herself to servitude in some filthy knockingshop so she could think of herself as something more than an easily expendable commodity so she could cling to that longedfor sometime in the misty future that happy isles of the west fantasy of hers that she could rise that she could be somebody fine before she lost her beauty and it was too late to escape her lot or her povertystricken childhood not much of a sham at all really alan told himself as he gave her a gentle kiss on her forehead god help me i really am fond of her cant ever offer her what she most like wishes of me but even if im a halfway port on her passage the voyagell be great fun shes fond enough of me certainly and trusting rather simple and trusting when you come right down to it god help me again but ill not be the one to turn my back on her ill not throw her back into the sordid stew shes worked so hard to flee i do trust you phoebe he told her at last and giving her a supportive hug i wont let you down do my best by you hmm you bes eez formidable mon amour she chuckled shuddering a little with emotion with perhaps a girlish childishpleased trill to her insides and perhaps with some measure of relief he imagined i am yous alone oh alain you male me so appy right then he sighed lost in their mutual embrace if she makes a fool of me after all well i went into it with mine eyes wide open and least im a welloff fool she means half what she saysbout bein a careful buyer bout bein faithful to me well tis a folly i can almost afford chapter so you never actually saw nor spoke admiral montagus ships lewrie admiral lord hood inquired rather offhandedly to alans lights no milord he replied a return voyage from finisterre might have taken him inshore of me if hed planned to peek in at any of the french biscay harbors or pass close to ushant damn good work though on old black dicks part hood smiled thinly for a moment at least his villaretjoyeuse wished an action unlike my opponent martin well fewer french liners to return to brest the fewer they have to send to reinforce against us hood seemed preoccupied a tall sheaf of reports orders and fair copies of dispatches mounded upon his desk and a flag lieutenant and a brace of midshipmen and clerks trundled back and forth with more and hed aged too like admiral howe he appeared worn down by care far more than hed looked when lewrie had last spoken to him back in march and arent he and howe both almost seventy and fewer officers and seamen who know what theyre about milord lewrie offered with a smile hood seemed though as if he had not heard the comment so lewrie blundered on cut the heads off all their senior officers or turned them into emigres made captains out of bosuns mates command by committee ive heard tell bad as any yankee doodle privateersman during the hmm aye hood said with a nod though handing his clerk a freshly signed document for sanding folding and delivering sounding as if his comment had been directed at the clerk not lewrie how many times i know better than to rattle on and yet he chided himself trying to find a graceful exit line what do you draw lewrie hood asked though already intent upon a new document which intent furrowed his brows devlish gloomy uhm two fathom milord ah hood nodded distantly good thatll be useful well should that be all you require of me milord ill not take a moment more of your time lewrie offered his major patron trying most earnestly to not offend his commanderinchief who could make or break any officers career in an eyeblink and hood had done so before sometimes over what others might consider to be mere trifles orders for jester will be forthcoming lewrie hood told him with a brief but dismissive grin make good any lacks firewood and water an such then hood turned dour and away aye milord thankee for receiving me sir lewrie replied backing toward the door in the daycabin partitions never know what that mans thinking he griped once he was out in the clear never know whom youre dealing with one day to the next spose got off fortunate at that and got at least one welcoming glass o claret off him it didnt matter whether admiral lord hood liked you or not he could be uncommon gracious in the forenoon then tear a strip off your arse for all the world to hear by the first dog watch well lewrie had already made arrangements for supplies with the captain of the fleet and mister giles was off to old hms inflexible the fleet storeship with a workingparty to secure fresh livestock and salt rations to top off what little they had already consumed onpassage the ship was in good hands safely anchored in four fathoms of water as snug as a bug in a rug surrounded by larger frigates and rd rate lineofbattle ships phoebe had the right of it he notedsan fiorenzo was steephilled a wide and sheltered bay on corsicas northwestern tip just west of and below nowtaken bastia and about twenty or so miles east of nowbesieged calvi san fiorenzo itself wasnt much of a town a small and drowsy place before the arrival of the fleet and the army who were now busy farther west dusty rocky and sere the color of old canvas it was roadways buildings soil and hillsides and many sheltering walls separating tiny farm fields or olive groves grazings or residences all of a rocky paletan piece but for the dullred tile rooves in ancient roman fashion what greenery there was consisted of hardy windsculpted trees gorselike pines as matted and tangled as dogwoods or coastal capeland oaklets as tightly kinked as the hair on a terriers back and that mostly a muted welldusted dark olive even in the verdant month of june phoebe had said the forests were called the maquis where only the toughest trees could survive and san fiorenzo was hot even for midtune sitting in the stern sheets of his gig being rowed back to jester from the flagship hms victory where one might expect motion to create a cooling breeze it was beyond balmy warmth quite frankly it was as hot as the hinges of hell and as stifling and humid as calcutta on a bad day before the monsoons orders he mused upon admiral hoods promise and his inquiry as to jesters draught whenever senior officers had asked that before it had meant service very close inshore feeling his way through unfamiliar waters by leadline and guess and soon he thought if admiral goodalls blockade of the french fleet in golfe jouan was to continue hed need scouting vessels to warn of reinforcement or any attempt at resupply by sea roads ashore anywhere in the mediterranean were so horrid hood had intimated that coasting merchantmen were the fastest and surest conveyors of civilian or military commerce the local road to calvi was little better than a goat track that wound a serpents dance over every hillock and ridge coalition troops were better supplied from the sea as well there was the blockade of calvi too to sink take or burn any local vessels no matter how small or unimportant which could deliver even a single cask of water to the frogs shore service he rather doubted it and made an audible sniff of dismissal hood already had idled many lineofbattle ships crews of seamen and marines sent ashore to help the army to manhaul then man the heavy lowerdeck guns to serve as siege artillery to strip jester of even twodozen hands would leave her useless swinging around her anchor just as idly ineffective as any of those decimated liners and after his most recent bitter spell of shore duty at toulon lewrie would gladly have run on his elbows to calvi and back with his thumbs up his arse before being forced to spend a single day playing at soldiers out to sea within the week he suspected and with more than a little joy in the doing too perhaps a long independent cruise far removed from pettifogging admirals commodores and fleet captains or any of their pestiferous interferences far removed from phoebe too for a time at any rate sweet though she was as heady and passionate though their rencontre had been he was aflutter to be out and doing and be far removed from whatever horrendous expenses he was certain his heady passionate and sweet relationship was going to end up costing him cost him perhaps that very afternoon he gloomed to himself orders surely couldnt come that quickly but from what little he had seen of san fiorenzo from shipboard and as bustling as the army traffic and many uniforms in the streets the prospects of discovering suitable lodgings looked pretty damn dismal hed have to get phoebe settled that very day there might not be time afterward and get her off my ship instanter he concluded frowning just a trifle more as he looked past andrewss shoulder to gaze upon jester at her anchorage gaze almost jealously swore id never carry a wench aboardto myself tooand just look what ive gone and done caroline to the bahamas and back well that was proper doins takin the wife along but caroline went ashore and stayed there when it came time to set out on kings business should have stuck her board a packet paid her passage to corsica stead of well whats dones done sides toulon cant abide that joliette of hers and and dammit theyre my greatcabins and i want em back chapter happily the first place was the perfect place a walled house halfway up a straggling cobbled street from the waterfront from the outside it had seemed a blankfaced enigma a warehouse perhaps on a corner about five streets up and back only the proppedout wood shutters of the upperfloor windows revealed it to be a residence a heavy ironbound wooden gate in the outer wall which towered almost nine feet above the street was the only break in the lower levels fortresslike exterior on the cross street as was a narrower ironstrapped doorway that faced the uphill street the only entrance upon that side a doorway they discovered later which was the kitchen and servants entrance upon entering the larger gateway though theyd been delighted to find a miniature eden there was a small courtyard sheltered from the harsh sunlight by an expansive woodslat pergola adrip with ivies or climbing flowering vines the courtyard was ringed with planters full of flowering bushes round amphoraelike planters tropical and adobecolored or pale stone rectangular box planters there was the luxury of a fountain and pool in the middletiny but refreshingas a cherubic winged pan poured an endless plashing trickle of water from a tipped jar there were patches of carefully tended grass verdantly green and tender compared to the harshness outside though most of the courtyard was sandy soil over which square paving stones had been laid there was a door off the courtyard to the kitchens a covered walkway wide enough to shelter a small table and two chairs whenever the residents felt like breakfasting en famille and a larger round stone table with curved stone benches near the streetside wall to seat a larger party off the courtyard on the house side there was a pair of tall glazed windows and shutter panels a wide doorway that led into the parlor there was a proper dining room behind that just off that kitchen pantry stillroom butlers closets and a jakes completed the downstairs a rather larger than necessary necessary he noted with amusement which also held the splendor of a large copper hip bath perhaps that necessary closet had once been a firstfloor bedchamber he thought though one done all of stone which he deemed rather an odd choice and with a trough set into the floor for outflow of effluents and used bathwater that looked intentional the agent a wary old tub of a puffing panting padrone done up in velvet and satin fineryas unctuously leering and beautrap as a covent garden pimphad insisted upon cash payments and only in gold preferably whats he sayin now hey lewrie had asked over and over again as their negotiations proceeded and those mostly in extremely rapid french far too fast for lewrie to follow or in italian which was another of the worlds languages he most definitely lacked she did all the negotiating switching easily from french to italian then an aside now and again in fractured english which had become even more tortuous and fractured as the afternoon drew on as phoebes brow furrowed in frustration now and again too there were shouts some hand gestures more easily understood by mediterranean peoples ah billioni the welllarded agent had once exclaimed in a worsethanusual snit poo hed pretended to spit upon the tile floor of the parlor alain ve ave arrived on ze price phoebe had then informed him e tak no less zan ze five doppia per mont ze feelty peeg for emphasis she had then pretended to spit upon the floor and put her thumbnail to her teeth and flicked her hand at him for good measure billion hed been forced to ask rather tremulously wait half a minute hed thought in alarm theres people invested with john company in the far east somere said to be worth a million pounds by now i aint buyiri the whole damn island just payin rent on a single house by god i aint eez pauvre silver coin alain non to be worry mon coeur there had followed a bewildering tirade from both sides it must be admitted as to the relative merits oн florins zecchinos scudos and doppia in comparison to the value of livres liri and the ducat savoian lira versus the papal states or the kingdom of the two sicilies where alan had learned whether hed really wished to or not denieri made one soldi soldi made one lira or lira equaled scudo but as good catholics should they obey the popes decrees that baiocchi made grossi or guilio or one festone and baiocchi equaled a scudo or more closely attuned to english measure perhaps sicilian cavalli made tornasi and tornesi equalled carlinis or piastre no no piastre zat eez trop igh alan dimly recalled her stating although tornesi which was only one ducat would be preferable in good undebased silver now most definitely not billionil ah magnifico the agent had declared kissing his fingertips and thence the very air but the piastre the tallero the scudo the royal crown ecu and pesothe last two the triedandtrue french prerevolutionary ecu or the ancient spanish piece of eightthey were understandable somewhat and the mention of the sum crown at least penetrated lewries fog though they all weighed different amounts of silver at least he knew what a bloody crown was worth let me see if i have this straight so far alan had stated after what had seemed a full hour of haggling the greedy bastard is aware we arent buyin the damn place lock stock and barrel isnt he oui alain phoebe had replied a tad huffy and exasperated i sink she had been forced to admit kittenshyly right then were makin progress damme if we aint hed cried with a huge sigh of relief so just how many good english shillings make one of his bloody ducats the ones he keeps rantin on about uhm ze doppia zat ees deu two ducat so she told him and the ducatd be hed prompted with a surly purr een silver shed puzzled followed by a rapid ticking off on her lacegloved fingers and much muttering under her breath thatd be a grand place to start hed muttered under his own breath as shed done her current exchange rates and trust a retired whore to know her sums to the hapence hed told himself mmm une ducat zat ees twelve shillings alain mon chou aha now were getting somewhere hed beamed let me see one of them the fubsy agent had produced a ducat from a floridly embroidered silk poke it weighed next to nothing a waferthin and almost bendable gold coin little larger round than a silver sixpence so ten ducats thatd be shillings the month or six english pounds hmm lewrie had pondered hed extracted his purse weighing it on his other palm heavy and promising toying with it to make the gold one and two guinea pieces inside rustle and chink the agent had swallowed heavily eyes darting in a fever of greed or in fear that his ducat might be conjured away if he didnt keep his eye glued to it two twoguinea pieces in gold sir lewrie had offered as he lay them out on his palm next to the ducat which shrank in comparison to the size of a tea saucer next to the dinnerplate appearance of the twoguineas breadth and most importantly its thickness i will offer four guineas the month and not a pence more thats worth eightyfour shillings or seven of his damn ducats or you tell him phoebe that when the troop convoy arrives with thousands more english soldiers in need of billets well we may commandeer any house that isnt already rented dye see for nothing tell him it amounted to ј hed thought smugly a bargain if the damn fool will just realize it markets not a stones throw off down to the waterfront or a short block uphill and one over to that plaza we saw and all the market stalls no need for a carriage after all or even the keep of a single horse furnished mostly a tad tawdry at present two bedchambers abovestairs both with balconies and ocean views rather good bedsteads an such his price would have been ј and thatd be a trifle steep even for a decent set of london rooms expostulating that hed been gored diddled raped the agent had at last acceded and the place was theirs if theyd pay the year in advance feeling just as gored lewrie had been forced to accede on his part as well knowing that as long as the french had a navy inbeing in golfe jouan or toulon that could threaten their hold on corsica or the sealanes across the ligurian and tyrrhenian seas to genoa porto especia rome or naples hed most like be based out of san fiorenzo far longer than that half that ponderous purse of his disappeared into the agents poke with a further stipulation that hed remove any items of furnishings they didnt need or wished to replace thus lowering the rent somewhat later on that had required another spitting hissing catfight to negotiate but in the end it was done to the begrudging dissatisfaction of both parties phoebe had received the heavy ring of keys from him had hugged them to her bosom and had skipped and danced around her new parlor in great delight after the agent had taken his leave alain eez so shed sighed at last coming to him and flinging her arms about him crooning as he lifted her off her feet to eye level eez non ze appartement no more eez ze ouse grande si bellel eez non ze shabby solid an secure an i mak eet even nicer soon merci mon amour oh merci si trиs beaucoup and there had been tears of joy in her eyes to be so settled at long last her lips had trembled against his as she kissed him so warmly and her little shoulders had shaken in grateful emotion we mus urry alain shed declared finally we can ave moved een avant coucher de soleil uhm before sundown non cook we ave tnight mais we fin ze cafй an zen een our own bed i tell you ow ver much i love you for non i show you ow much i am thanking you mon chou theyd left phoebes chests and luggage at a waterfront osteria a tavern lodging house in the care of an elderly couple who had made much of phoebes arrival in their midst lewrie was arranging a burro and cart and phoebe was chatting away gay as a magpie with her fellow countrymen and stroking joliette who was daintily lapping at some goat milk when midshipman spendlove arrived with a packet under his arm sweating heavily sir spendlove announced doffing his hat thank god youre here sir else id have had nary a clue as to where in the town trouble aboard mister spendlove lewrie barked breaking off his negotiations with the carter no sir spendlove took the time to smile orders sir come aboard not a quarterhour past mmm eood lewrie sighed in relief that was quick work i must say i didnt mister spendlove these have been opened he rasped turning stern and surly in an instant not my doing sir spendlove assured him with some heat nor the first lieutenants uhm your clerk mister mountjoy he ahh mountjoy lewrie snapped said he thought they were normal correspondence sir that he as your assistant should read first so spendlove shrugged not in defense of the captains clerk no by the tone of his voice even a lowly midshipman could express a tiny bit of exasperation or disgust with a newcome who knew so little or could not seem to learn damn fool lewrie growled ships orders were addressed for captains only for their eyes only not you mister spendlove pardon the comment sir no one else aboard has read them yet no sir spendlove strenuously denied mister hyde was at the gangway to receive them and took em aft still sealed to your quarters we informed mister knolles of course and he thought it best if you saw them straightaway so i readied a boat to fetch you captain but were they urgent mister knolles then thought to send them on so he went aft to get em and he asked of them from mister mountjoy well my assistant lewrie hooted sourly my god thats rich but as long as he had them he might as well read them so he stepped away for a tiny shred of privacy when he discovered you are directed to ready your vessel for sea and at your earliest convenience the wind being obliging proceed to the port of leghorn upon the italian mainland carrying with you the assistant surgeon of the fleet his appurtenances and monies for the purchase of a quantity of onions and thirty to forty pipes of wine from the tuscan authorities to store aboard as expeditiously as possible the aforesaid upon affirmation by the assistant surgeon of the fleet as to the antiscorbutic properties then to proceed afterward to san fiorenzo bay with the onions and wine and just what do you draw lewrie hey he muttered half amused jesus christ there went all his previous speculation on hopes of neckornothing sea service amazing really what fickle dame reality actually had up her sleeve he folded them and stuck them into an inner coat pocket very well mister spendlove go back aboard and deliver my utmost respects to mister knolles and the sailing master they are to ready the ship for sea tell aspinall well have a single piece of livelumber aft in the greatcabins with some dunnage of his to store away in my personal lazarette have chips run him up a bed cot and warn my cook hell be sizzling for two this evening san fiorenzo bay was a mirror there wasnt a breath of wind and every commissioning pendant every sail freed of its gaskets and let hung to prevent mildew were as slack as a hangmans noose still and flaccid thered be no departure this evening perhaps the morning might bring up enough wind to work out of harbor on or theyd lower the ships boats and row her out in tow to a sea breeze hed have about an hour no more to settle phoebe leave her some coin for incidentals but would have to forego her expressions of gratitude before he could inform her of that sad fact though he espied a navy officer at the dockside one familiar to him about to mount a horse captain nelson he called walking down to the pierfront to remake his acquaintance ah commander lewrie the little minnikin of a postcaptain cried jovially once hed gotten his seat saw your jester lying at anchor on my way out to victory just come in and with such a wondrous packet of news too about admiral howes splendid victory how i wish id but been there to take part but and how do you do sir mainwell and thank you for recalling me sir lewrie said doffing his hat and thank you again for the permanent loan of men off your agamemnon they eased our passage home wondrous well form the very backbone of my new crew i cant express how indebted i am to you for your generosity shorthanded though you were at the time god what a complete toadying wretch you are lewrie he chided himself must be instinctive nelsons just another captain not an admiral whose back you have to piss down for favors and you are well yourself sir alan asked as a party of seamen trudged by in a dustraising shamble loaded down with sacks like so many draught animals in splendid fettle sir nelson assured him been on shore service over toward calvi dye see as long as the french navy is blockaded theres the seat of the action theres the very cockpit a chance for action great doings capt horatio nelson was such a thin and nervous whippet of a fellow so lean and wee to begin with well lewrie thought his duty ashore had sweated him down he didnt look in splendid fettle really haggard as a dogs dinner in point of fact why were i half sunk with the flux the opportunity for action against our foes would revive me from my very deathbed sir nelson assured him firmly speaking a trifle louder for the benefit lewrie imagined of those trudging plodding sailors and the general audience at dockside always did have a touch o drury lane theatrics in him lewrie recalled smiling in reverie you should see what british tars can accomplish lewrie he emoted regaining that infectious enthusiasm for a chance to get himself blown to bits or knightedwhichever came first you simply must ride up and visit us should you have the chance erecting batteries manhauling guns over hill and dale digging trenches and parallels ah heres captain fremantle another of our stalwarts taller lankier and mastiffdour was capt thomas fremantle whose sole response to nelsons introduction was a nod and a grunt shelling the frogs night and day storming their positions to keep monsieur on the hop nelson rattled on minding shot around their own ears no more than peas i tell you lewrie been at it ever since the first days of the siege of bastia well captain fremantle might mind shot and shell after our little incident hey uhm interjected that worthy shifting in his saddle rather uncomfortably the frogs got the range of us at bastia nelson reminisced gaily and literally blew us off a hillside right down off the side of the path showers of earth gravel and dust fremantle was sore hurt tore a good pair o breeches fremantle grunted laconically now he swears hell not walk within a musket shot of me sir nelson chuckled i attract too much attention from their gunners sounds like fremantle is smarter than he looks alan thought should i do come visit sir lewrie said with an agreeable chuckle of his own id hope for better horses than these for the journey while all the while swearing that it would take a battalion of gaolers to drag him anywhere near calvis trenches or nelsons side spavined wretches are they not sir nelson shrugged even as he patted his illfeatured mares neck a poor prad but mine own to quote the bard and well fathers a churchman and our glebe didnt run to blooded hunters then i away to sea at such a young age i must confess i am nowhere near as confident upon this horse as i am upon my quarterdeck this idle waiting and swinging around the anchors i quite envy you sir your freedom of a smaller ship out at sea our proper place anything exciting by way of orders for you yet lewrie onions sir lewrie sighed onions and wine im off for leghorn at first light pray god the wind returns to purchase onions to prevent the scurvy oh poor fellow nelson seemed to commiserate for a single sober moment though he perked up rather quickly not a second after still your turn will come sir be confident of it once calvi is ours well all be free to seek out our foes and win such glory as even a hawke anson or drake might envy lewrie continued to smile though he did raise one rather dubious brow fremantle though whod been slouching like a sack of onions in his saddle sat up a bit straighter got a light upon his dull visage as if hed just been saved and was leaving church with his life amended uncanny how this wee fellow nelson could inspirit people well sirs if you must ride as far as calvi before dark i wont keep you a second longer and the best of fortune go with you sirs captain nelson captain fremantle ill save you a sack of my very best mmm produce sirs he could not help saying with a deprecatory smirk my word ont likewise good fortune attend your voyage sir and i would be much obliged for something more savory than army rations for the men dye see nelson beamed godspeed commander lewrie he kneed his spindly mare into motion to clatter off to join a procession of heavily laden mules heavily laden sailors and topheavy twowheeled carts crammed with ammunition damme i just promised to deliver them onions lewrie shuddered now ill have to ride up there once im back within speakin distance of nelson and lets hope the frog gunnersre sleepin wherever that firebrand went there was blood and mayhem and the devils own amount of shot and shell involved in a nelson outing forever thrusting himself forward all that death or glory twaddle and alan suspected the little minnikin actually believed what he was forever saying still he could almost essay a feeling of dare he call it jealousy to be left out grubbing about in trenches plagued with insects flinging oneself flat whenever a shell howled over well an officer could wish to fling himself flat but had to stand and take it like a dumb ox to inspire courage so please you sleeping rough as a gypsy well perhaps not alan wished to make his name and his ships name at sea where sailors belonged not playing greengrocer certainly but he felt a hellish snit coming on sent off to be a carter for the fleet stead of a fighting cruise deprived of phoebes charmsthat hed by god paid damn dear fornot even one evening with her in their new house the prospects of a damn dull supper with a sawbones for company they were usually horrid drinkers and just how much of his wine cabinet would be left to him by the time jester returned to san fiorenzo bay he wondered it all put lewrie in a devlish black fettle mayhem well god help mountjoy when he got back aboard a chance to shout to rant and scream at someone to vent all his frustrations it sounded damned pleasant of a sudden book iii ego dum cremandis trabibus accresdt rogus sacro regentum maria votivo colam now while the pyre feeds on the burning beams with promised gifts will i worship him who rules the sea hercules furens lucius annaeus seneca chapter now this is more like it lewrie told himself fidgetting but with pride as he stood foursquare on his quarterdeck with his hands clasped together in the small of his back rocking and swaying on the balls of his feet easy as jester tore through the waters gun ports open and artillery run out it was a rare day no error a brilliant glittering morning of brightwater winds whitecaps and horses the sea heaving and chopping in short closespaced waves and the sirocco up from the south was a force one could almost lean into a stout clearweather quartergale deafening in his ears a hatsnatcher of a wind into which hms jester pounded closehauled in pursuit of prey a clumsy old provence bilander already lay far astern a prize easily snatched up from the clutch of odd vessels assembled in convoy no matter that shed sported a massive lateen mains on her after or mainmast the compromise of her foremast crossed with course topsl and tgallant yards had made her slow to windward taken with but one warning shot fired cross her bows and a long ten minutes of nailbiting frustration as a boat was gotten down and a prize crew under wheelock the masters mate rowed over to secure her then jester was off once more lumping and drumming into wind spray flying high to either beam with a bone in her teeth theyd spotted the convoy at dawn on easttowest patrol sixty miles north of corsica a gaggle of tartanes bilanders and poleacres to their south lyingto hardly moving as if awaiting the coming of dusk before closing the coast in the wee hours when they might stand a chance of sneaking past other patrol ships immediately jester had hardened up beat to quarters and taken off in pursuit now the motley collection of ships had become what were termed chases the nearest chase mister buchanon informed them was a tartane a singlemasted coastal trading vessel with a foreandaft lateen mainsl and a bowsprit that allowed her to set jibs and staysls to go closer to the true wind than jester could ever hope to she might have made an escape outpointing them if shed been longer or been less heavily laden she merely ploughed along burying her bows whenever she met the rolling chops and flinging clouds of spray and foam over herself as if trying to hide in it starboard focsle carronade lewrie shouted to the gun deck one shot across her bows theyd overhauled her rapidly striding up to within half a cable yardsof her larboard side as she labored to flee a sharp bark a quickly dissipated bloom of smoke sulfurously bitter and smelling of rotten eggs as it whipped past the quarterdeck and then a great splash and pillar of spray as the ball struck short and a little to the right of across her bows under them was more like it the eighteenpounder roundshot five inches and four parts across caromed up from first graze like a goosed dolphin smashed into the underside of the hapless tartanes bows shattering the jib boom and bowsprit amputating it just beyond the cutwater sofort jal quartergunner rahl could be heard to exult as he saw the results of his handiwork genau exactly without jibs to balance her helm she sagged alee veering away to starboard under the press of that great lateen sail and yard showing her weeded quickwork as she heeled precipitously helm aweather quartermaster ease us a point free lewrie snapped so jester would surge up even with her still on her larboard quarter showing her there would be no escape number one gun ready he waited until she rolled more upright so he wouldnt lose her by putting a ball through her hull too far below the waterline to be repaired no more warning shots mister crewe show her we mean it a quick fiddle with the quoin for elevation a tug on the side tackles then the crew scrambling back from the line of recoil bang the ninepounder erupted at yards the balls strike was immediate a crash of timbers the squawk of rivened wood as a starshaped hole three feet across was blasted into her side just before her mast and the tartane shook and rolled alee once more to the impact then down came her long lateen yard crashing to the deck as halliards were cut instead of handed eight or nine menperhaps her entire crewappeared at the rails hands flailing arms raised in prayerlike pleading and jabbering away fit to bust in french mister hyde shes your prize sir lewrie crowed mister tucker the quartermasters mate and six hands to go with you hoist what sail you may once youve secured her crew and follow along aft of us as best youre able take the jolly boat move yourself sir mister knolles fetch us to to lower away the boat two prizes already and it had barely gone eight he exulted why we might take all of em by the end of the forenoon and not a single other sail in sight to share with any other british warship with even her royals bove the horizon in sight at the time that a prize surrendered shared in the prize money adjudged by an admiralty court this morning lewrie was feeling particularly greedy hungry for more than his breakfast sides theres my bloody expenses to make good he sighed as the jolly boat was swung high off the crossdeck beams that spanned jesters waist from gangway to gangway even before she came to a full halt in a welter of foam and a calamitously windy din from aloft come on come on damn yer eyes he muttered under his breath at how long it was taking take in fore and main courses so theyd not be torn topmen aloft to trice up yard tackles with clew jiggers hook on burton purchases from the tops to the yardarms jump a triatic stay between the staytackle pendants and send the falls to the deck lift the jolly boat off the crossdeck beams that spanned the waist with stay tackles swing her outboard with the yard tackles and six guy lines for preventers then lower away together then even before the boat crew was down overside take in all the hoisting gear which was in the way aloft ungasket the coursesails and clew them full of air once more his own gig was away to the bilander with andrews in charge of it now the jolly boat there was only the one twentysixfoot cutter left which took eight hands to row and one to steer only one more prize taken before he ran out of conveyances for prize crews he groaned surely not cony he decided half a cables worth of messenger line to the jolly boat as a painter once shes alongside the prize and empty walk the painter aft and use it as a towline well keep her with us what seemed an hour later they were off again this time chasing what looked like an egyptian dhow highpooped two masts with lateen sails a sweet curve to her sheerline almost saucyalmost too cute to frighten but a prize was a prize like the tartane she was too short on the waterline to make any speed but beyond spreading out now hauling their wind to escape individually all order gone were three rather substantial and rewardinglooking ships one the nearest heading souwest and another pair farther off bearing soueast still almost in company dodging away with the boisterous wind abeam threemasted poleacres with lateen rigs upon their fore and mizzenmasts to take the place of spankers or jibs but oddly and downright gruesomely squarerigged on their much taller mainmasts with courses topsls and tgallants towering over their decks as bastardly appearing as hermaphrodite brigs they fetched the dhowlooking coaster up to their starboard side in a brief quarterhour up close she was scarred weathered faded and neglected as stained and dull as an old dishcloth she labored within close musket shot about fifty yards off her few crewmen stockstill and hangdog at the rails no warning shot was even required down came her lateen yards collapsing those triangular ellipses to her decks and jester fetchedto once more the jolly boat was led around to the entry port by its towline and midshipman spendlove with quartermaster spenser and six seamen rowed over to take charge of her the jolly boat hauled back to jester afterward for further use hardly seems worth the effort captain lieutenant knolles remarked laughing in scornful appraisal a dowdy old tub she is well lets hope shes a decent cargo aboard to pay for our efforts mister knolles lewrie shrugged mains haul and lets be going now their problem was that of a single staghound that had come across an entire herd of deerwhich to pursue next the nearest to them was running due west by then about two miles off the other two poleacres had fallen off the wind to eastsoueast were closer together but had at least another mile lead on jester before she got back to full speed of nearly eleven knots mister buchanon lewrie called to his sailing master aye sir those two masters yonder know something we dont sir current around the eastrd of corsica lewrie inquired seems silly to run eastsoueast closer to the bastia peninsula northset current capum aye buchanon agreed pointing to a chart runs up past cape corse tween ere an th isle of capraia an in shallower water too nought tdread tis deep enough even for a st rate but do they get into its fan i spose an with this southerly wind eyll fly like a pair o pigeons one an a half mayhap two knots more eyd gain if they may weather cape corse lewrie intuited at once the poleacres had run far enough south within forty or so miles of corsica that flight in that direction could come to an end hemmed in by bluffs and shoals if they stayed somewhat on the wind as they still were sir starboard chase is altering course knolles cried out to warn them inexplicably the nearest poleacre had come about to the starboard tack as if suicidally intent upon making calvi after all and arriving in late afternoonbroad daylight even as closehauled as she lay to the eyes of the wind shed cross ahead of jesters present course or their courses would meet like the two upright legs of a triangle and jester of course would shoot her to rags and then take her mister knolles ready about stations for stays lewrie said with a wry smile well come to starboard tack make our new course east by south aye aye sir knolles replied automatically though sounding quizzical mister porter pipe hands to stations for stays ready to come about only a purblind foold come about like at capum buchanon opined meanin her yonder sir dye understand no disrespect my thoughts exactly mister buchanon lewrie agreed with a soft laugh remind you of a mother goose leading the stoat away from her hatchlings flaggin th broken wing aye capum that pair to the eastrd theyre hoping to get away thisun might be their leader a merchant poleacre yes but perhaps carrying a french naval officer aboard as short of ships as they are it might even be a wellarmed poleacre servin as escort itd be a criminal waste to send these poor vessels out to resupply calvi without at least one warship ill wager that pair has the valuable cargo ready about sir knolles reported very well mister knolles tack the ship about half an hour on starboard tack floating almost without visible effort now across the seas on a close reach with the winds nearly on her beamstriding closer and closer to those two poleacres who were forced by her presence and the threat of the sofar unseen cape corse to haul their wind even farther steer due east to try and heat jester to that underwater river of current that would speed them back up north to the french riviera coast where theyd come from sail ho came a cry from the foremast lookout rushing two point off th starbrd bows lewrie twitched almost began a quick dash to the shrouds to take a peek for himself but checked his motion it looked like an upright stumble which made him blush in chagrin chiding himself for appearing to start at the slightest omen like a goosegirl two points to weather thatd be he said instead stalking to the chart trying to seem deliberate this time down near the cape believe mister buchanon aye sir inshore o cape corse west o it do we see her with her royalsr tgallants bove th horizon buchanon agreed show me the frog with any sense at all whod venture into san fiorenzo bay or its approaches by herself lewrie frowned surely tins newcomes bound to be one of ours oh bad luck sir knolles groaned another man o war to go shares with should we take these last two well they havent a hope of our bilander the tartane or our dhow at any rate mister knolles they werent in sight when we took those lewrie said striving for a less than greedy pose himself there is that sir knolles shrugged signal sir rushing shouted down to them from far forward white ensign to the mmnmast truck number pennants four six repeater nine fifteen sir with both midshipmen who normally were in charge of the signal nag lockers away on prizes it fell to lewrie himself to delve into the binnacle cabinet drawers for the latest code combinations ah hum right then he concluded after a long moments fumbling over a loose sheaf of wrinkled papers that threatened to go overside with the wind this months recognition code to the tee gentlemen shes one of ours mister knolles do you have the white ensign hoisted to the mainmast truck and reply uhm fifteen twentytwo three repeater four got that aye aye sir knolles called back snapping his fingers at a man of the afterguard one of those literate strikers who assisted on the taffrails as a signalman barely had that been bent on and hoisted high on the weather side of the mizzenmast where it could be more easily read than the newly arrived ship up to the soueast hauled down her original hoist and up went another one identifying her then a third this one orders pursue chase more closely lewrie translated as the numerals were read off to him feeling like a halfwit midshipman all over again at how long it was taking him compared to the fluency of his inferiors and with every eye on the quarterdeck upon him too to loord he completed puffing out his cheeks in frustration well o course he thought with a silent grunt that recognition code had told him that the other ship was a thrate frigate hms ariadne twenty guns a proper postcaptains command a man senior to him two guns all the diff rence in the world alan griped she wished jester to haul her wind sail a touch north of due east cutting off any hopes the poleacres might have of simply turning and running to the north or of gaining their saving current before ariadne had come to grips with them haul our wind mister knolles lewrie snapped give us two points free to east by north and topmen aloft to set royals aye sir ariadne alan sighed a brandspanking new ship of war my old un mustve sunk at her moorings in english harbor at last his very first ship had been hms ariadne then a tired and worn old sixtyfourgunner of the rd rate condemned after his very first action in the west indies too for hogging at bow and stern her back most likely broken shed become a guard ship receiving ship later just a useless hulk without a single gun stripped down aloft to her fighting tops and gant lines captain cashiered for her loss first lieutenant courtmartialed with him fourth and fifth killed third lieutenant convicted of cowardice oh shed been a miserable old hag even before then and a terrible place for a seventeenyearold to begin a naval career autumn of it was damme im gettin bloody ancient he thought he took a deep breath clapped his hands together and paced to the lee bulwarks with a telescope to shrug off just how far back in the antedeluvian age hed really gotten his haporth of tar there was their bilander pacing along about ese four or five miles alee and off the larboard quarter nearer in to them was their tartane only a mile astern but three miles alee and spendlove and his dhow or whatever else one might call itwas of course the poor third behind them all even though shed been the last nearest taken a clumsy udderswinging old cow to begin with and now directed by english tars whod never even clapped eyes on her like before much less tried to handle her lateen rig to best efficiency and the poleacre that had tried to decoy them away from her two consorts was christ shat on a biscuit shed hauled her wind worn about to run with the wind large on her starboard quarter and was not three miles astern of jester at that very moment crossing from starboard to larboard quarter steering on what he took to be a course of noreast by east the bugger was after the prize vessels bold as a dog in a doublet mister knolles new course noreast lewrie shouted and bend on a signal to our prizes make all sail and add imperative to that uhm they are to what the devil was the clearest signal he fumed running through a combination of orders damme yes order them to take station to weather of us halfpast ten oclock of the forenoon watch by then the winds beginning to abate beaten into sullen submission by the oppressive and sultry heat of a mediterranean july last summer around toulon had been a coolish fluke of nature all that rain and nippish cold here in the ligurian sea summer winds were fickle at best a mornings gale blown out and hammered to compassboxing zephyrs by midday just what they needed least lewrie thought and hellish bad timin too deck there rushing called from the foremast ariadne is sending interrogative almost polite of him considrin lewrie said with a grimace what that fullofginger postcaptain yonder had really asked was just what the devil you think youre playing at you damn fool he raised his telescope once more to study his laboring prize ships yes theyd begun to make more sail to alter course harder on the wind to get closer to jesters protective artillery even mister spendloves weary old dhowthinggummy had sprouted a mustache of foam under her bows not much of one admittedly but it was there lash the foreends of the lateen yards low to the center of the decks and haul them foreandaft by brute force though she simply must sail better to windward like a gaffrigged cutter or sloop sir knolles prompted at his elbow his voice soft and confidential what reply do we send ariadne the only one shell understand i spose mister knolles alan snickered with a lift of his eyebrows bend on good old number one admiral howes revisions to the code flags always put the most important message the one that alerted warship captains to the prime reason for existence at the very top of the list and in an easily understandable singlepennant hoist number one of the howe system was enemy in sight chapter mister knolles is there a code flag for suggestion alan inquired once jester had worn off the wind and had begun to run alee toward her struggling prize vessels uhm theres submit sir knolles answered and i spose thats a picture of a man tugging his forelock lewrie posed tongueincheek groveling most humbly as well i should imagine captain his first lieutenant replied with a bright grin make to ariadne then most humbly mind lewrie ordered submither numberpursue chasesuhm closer action he might make some sense of that followed by our number closer actionchase to leeward no sense losing those two poleacres to deal with a single armed ship jester can handle thisun by herself aye aye sir knolles agreed full of pride in their ship besides lewrie continued damme if ill make that fellow a richer man at the expense of our peoples freedom ill not lose em when weve come this far together farther off the wind then running almost bothsheetsaft on a landsmans breeze due north jester passed the first of their prizes and put herself between the overly aggressive french poleacre and their tartane the strangeacting frenchman hardened up on the wind as well coming more noreasterly to meet them ignoring the bilander and dhow mister bittfield well engage with the larboard battery alan told his master gunner porter be ready to brail up the main course chainslings on the yards now and lay out the boarding nettings at least eighteen prime hands gone lewrie fretted gunners and tacklemen rammers and loaders off on the prizes this short of a voyage from toulon to corsica the frogll most like have no need to worry bout victualing a large crew hes liable to have a hundred men or more aboard that damn thing like a breton chassemarйe privateersman two hundred more like he thought with a wary sniff we have to stand off so he doesnt board us but blow the living hell out of him lewrie thought a full cables range would be cautious both so eager for combat the two ships closed each other rapidly the range fell off to barely five cableshalf a nautical mileand alan sorely regretted not having sixpounder chase guns up forrud on the forecastle with which he could open the affair he raised his telescope to scan the poleacre indeed she swarmed with seamen as thickly clustered as a pack of cockroaches around a butter tub at least his estimated men aboard a ship little larger than a merchant brig bout feet on her waterline he pondered flushdecked almostgun deck and weather deck the same with only a slightly raised quarterdeck astern how many guns could she carryand how heavy a battery could such a small ship bear he wondered there gun ports coming open ready mister bittfield he called in warning make your first broadside count sir full battery firing on the uproll ready sir bittfield shouted back on the uproll wait for it fire almost as one they opened upon each other the poleacre disappearing behind a cloud of spent powder smoke gushing from bowtostern as if shed just blown up and jester poised atop the scend a stable gun platform for a breathless second or two without rolling hammering and shuddering at the violence of her own broadsides eruption then shaking and quaking as roundshot hit her almost flinching as thick iron ball droned or screeched past in nearmisses spray flung high from strikes that landed short wetting down her gunners and bracetenders seven guns at least lewrie thought coughing on niters as the smokepall from jesters broadside ragged away to leeward creating a sour fogbank just yards alee through which he could barely make out their foe and a heavy seven guns he frowned in perplexity seeing the quick damage done to jesters larboard side the twentysixfoot cutter on the crosswaist beams had been shattered there were hammocks and thin rolledup mattresses scattered like so many fishing worms about the gangway bulwarks bulwarks that had been caved in in places by the impact of heavy shot there were men down lying still men too who shrieked in sudden terror writhing frantically over their wounds again mister bittfield quickly lewrie shouted quicker to load and fire the quarterdeck carronades behind him were coughing thunderously followed by the pleasing sound of french timbers being penetrated with booming thonks and rawrkks no hastily converted merchantman no matter how billeted inboard with reinforcing baulks had a chance against the weight of eighteenpounder iron a second broadside still controlled but a little more ragged this time spat from jesters larboard guns aiming was perhaps more a hopedfor thing though blazing away through a bitter haze firing into a thicker bank of smoke now only four cables off tricolor sir buchanon pointed out french national ship no error damme shes comin hard on th wind clewin up sir out of that fogbank came the thrusting jib boom and bowsprit of the poleacre her anchor catheads jutting through the haze that taller mainmast bore topmen aloft taking in her topsl and tgallant sails clewing them up to the yards by sloppy spanish reefs using her weatherly foreandaft lateen sails to keep drive on her christ lewrie gasped appalled by his stupidity she would claw up abeam the wind cross his stern and rake jester at close range quartermaster helm hard alee he cried trying not to sound panicky as jester trundled on north with the poleacre slipping astern on her moving from afore the main chains to afore the mizzen chains in the blink of an eye shorthanded he could not man his starboard guns in time he must keep the larboard battery engaged and round jester up abeam the wind on the opposite tack to keep her thicker side wood facing those unexpectedly heavy guns instead of her frail transom mister knolles scandalize her eveiy square sail alan said in a rush waisters bend on main and mizzen staysls bowrake her now bittfield while we have the chance a bloom of smoke from the french poleacres bow from her forecastle a damn heavy chase gun its report deeperbellied than a sixpounder as ominously loud even upwind of her for the moment as any twentvfourpounder gun aboard a rd rate a tremendous pillar of spray which leaped into being closeaboard jester feeling almost wrenched off her course by the slamming impact a damn heavy gun of some kind carronade mister lewrie cony screeched from the gangways reverting to his old form of address to him th buggers got a carronader two yonder sir the french warship was blotted out of sight by the blossoms of gun smoke as bittfield got off his broadside a ragged effort starting amidships of the waist and stuttering left or right from there or from the far ends to the center the gunners half blinded and pulling their lanyards as quick as their sweating crews could stand clear jib boom tip poking through the sudden pall abaft the mizzen stays jester heeling hard to starboard as her wheel was forced hardover squarerig canvas aloft shivering and flapping carronades lewrie screeched load with canister grapeshot mister rahl hear me clear her decks with canister and her quarterdeck when were closeaboard ease your helm quartermaster steer due west as best youre able aye aye zir brauer the hamburg seaman replied crisply jester had just worn from one tack to the other off the wind everything crying and screaming aloft as out of order and confusing as a rioting mob yards cocked anyoldhow some topsis and tgallants aback against the masts others flapping useless aye canister lewrie thought grimly murder that bastard over there who outsmarted me powder monkeys staggered under the weight of the canister tins come up from the lower deck shotlockers as the guns on the quarterdeck were loaded ready larboard mister bittfield at close pistol shot fire as you bear he cautioned shes coming up fast and did his foe have men enough to man both his own batteries lewrie gulped with a sudden cringing in a throat gone bonedry from shock and excitement and did that frenchman have his own artillery loaded with canister and grape to return the favor if he was smart he did and thisun was bloody clever christ alan sighed as the poleacre loomed up as if sailing through a parting in a stage curtain not sixty yards off larboard to face the poleacres larboard gunners and sailors lined her bulwarks french marine infantry with muskets leveled her antiboarding nets were down and her guns were run out inbattery at least one carronade on her foredeck to fear lewrie saw another aft on what passed for a quarterdeck and five long guns amidships upon that flush spargun deck frog eightpounders thank god no heavier than his feuer quartergunner rahl shouted up forrud and the larboard eighteenpounder carronade lit off with a deafening roar fire as you bear mister bittfield screamed as soon as the first larboard gun could bear in its port and the long guns began to bark like ferocious guard dogs out of my hands now lewrie groaned to himself heaving a philosophical shrug our weight of iron prevails or theirs does sweet jesus just a little help here he prayed let em not have thought to load with grape or canister jester bucked and trembled like a firstsaddled colt as her guns the enemys guns filled the short space between the racing hulls with hot gushes of graytan smoke as both ships screamed in agony as heavy iron took them in their vitals lewrie could barely see enemy sailors at her rails being tossed aside bulwark timbers flying bodies flying hear the stupendous boomings of guns fired straight into his face oak screamed masts cried short stabbing blooms of pink fire lilies and swarms of amberreddish sparks swirled spent as dazed lightning bugs in the smoke wall quick splinters of wood flew from jesters wounds flicking past whickering and fluting a giants toothpicks their sharp edges hungry for flesh the high terrieryip blasts of swivel guns at the rails which spewed loose bags of pistol shot and langridgescrapiron bitsat the french and then the blessed barroomingl of the quarterdeck carronades as the enemy command staff came abeam lewrie shut his eyes staring directly down the barrel of their quarterdeck carronade the instant before the sight of his own death was blotted out and he was staggered almost off his feet by the noise and the shock waves another shock wave which made his heart flutter and pause the breath stop in his chest turned half sidewise and hammered to his knees for real this time as a roundshot passed within a few feet of him howling over the quarterdeck ululating off into the distance like an irate eagle robbed of its prey at the last moment jesus sir ya hurt sir his cabin steward whimpered coming to his side with a box of pistols aspinall was shaking like a sodden hound might just after leaving a stream terrortears streaking lower lip blubbering dont think so aspinall alan grimaced as if in real pain feeling himself over quickly but thankee for askin bloody hell whatre you doing on deck aspinalls post during quarters was down on the orlop to assist chips ships carpenter mister rees as a dumb carrier and fetcher should any repairs be necessary b bosuns mate sir aspinall wailed his teeth chattering so badly he could barely avoid biting his tongue mister cony he top me tfetch ya yer pistols sir said e thought yad be needin em so i did an kin i go below agin captain sir now ya have em like aye with my gratitude aspinall me lad just help me to my feet first mister knolles aye sir the first lieutenant rasped back his throat raw with gun smoke and his hat gone somewhere on its own helm down sir lewrie ordered once hed gotten erect a tack cross the wind and keep the wind gauge bove that bastard my telescope so close one bloody instant so far apart the next the frog poleacre had fallen off the wind was running large to the noreastminus her mizzenmast and lateen spanker in the round ocular lewrie saw shed been beaten to a pulp by that broadside fired so close they could have spit at each other her larboard side was bashed in with several large punctures below her gun ports and about a third of her bulwarks had been torn away merging two gun ports into one long tear larboard mainmast stays were sagging loose the chain platforms and the deadeye blocks that tensioned those shrouds savaged and on her quarterdeck that mob on her stern her officers and afterguard were gone barely half a dozen figures could be seen moving about mostly throwing themselves on the abandoned helm topmen were sheeting home her main course and topsl not trusting the upper tgallant mast with the pressure of canvas her foremast lateen sail swung almost athwartship trimmed for a run ware below bosun porter shouted as jester swung up close to the wind there was a rending screech of pine as tophamper ripped as jesters own royal and tgallant topmasts sagged backward shedding blocks and rigging crosstree slats snapped like twigs freeing tension on shrouds and the entire mess slowly inclined farther astern until everything above the crosstrees sagged back into the mainmast stays and hung up on the main tgallant yard tangling staysls and halliards jears and liftlines into a rats nest in der irons herr kapitan brauer reported from the wheel as jester poised in the very teeth of the wind and stalled unable to complete her tack and slowing to a crawl secure from quarters porter cony secure what you can till she pays off lewrie ordered however much a draw the battle had been it was now over it would be long minutes before jester could fall off to either beam even more a long half hour to clear away all the raffle and take up pursuit once more by which time that poleacre would have sailed herself almost hullunder for toulon or hyeres bay beaten at everything shed tried ignored when shed attempted to lure them away useless when charged with protecting her convoy and shot to ribbons when shed tried to retake the prizes denied even that crumb of comfort still she would escape them lewrie devoutly hoped hed slain her captain had it become a real broadsidetobroadside slugging he wasnt sure he might have won after all unless that bugger had died aye he hoped that poleacres commanding officer had been shot to a blood pudding by a cloud of canister should he live to fight another day there was a damn dangerous frenchman on the loose a one too clever for anyones good a one too dangerous to live two dead outright sir surgeon mister howse related grumpily still streaked with splotches of blood on his butchers apron one more to pass by sunset if gods good to him nine injured i see lewrie nodded almost numb still shaken by how brief yet how savage the engagement had been those injured uhm two captain howse scowled a bite to his voice as if wars mayhem was lewries fault and the butchers bill the captains debt amputees to be discharged both marines tother seven well few weeks to mend light duties after assuming suppuration does not take them i have their names for your clerk howse offered a quickscribbled list almost officiallooking but the red wax seals were his gory thumb and fingerprints thankee mister howse lewrie replied gingerly accepting it and passing it to knolles at once adjust the watchandquarter bills accordingly mister knolles ill go below to the surgery for a moment aye sir but knolles answered uhm as to the foremast you said you wished to oversee aye right with you then lewrie harrumphed there was little more to do for the short run than to strike all that damaged tophamper off the foremast right down to the fighting top the mainmast too had lost its royal and tgallant topmasts and spars a spare foremast topsl pole stood quickly doubled to the lower foremast cap so they could raise jibs to work her to windward into shelter and the hands to see to to visit the wounded tell them their suffering was scuse me capum bosun porter intruded doffing his hat to him but th hands from th prize crews you recalled is come aboard aye mister porter lewrie all but snarled do you and cony tend to alloting them work with mister knolles and his damn list aye aye sir porter nodded almost scraping his feet as he backed away from his captains foul mood damme so much for being a lucky ship lewrie mourned in silence everything going so bloody good so far the crew shaken down and mainwell content proud of her and now this should have been a day to celebrate taking three prizes and sharing in another two then he hoped they werent as dispirited as he felt right then he heaved another bitter sigh and started forward to judge their juryrig repairs on the foremast sir spendlove cried as he came back inboard on the larboard gangway sir another damned interruption what mister spendlove sorry sir but this fellow master of that dhowthinggummy spendlove said gesturing to a civilian hed fetched along with him in a borrowed longboat spot of bother sir says hes genoese and he has papers and manifests you must see sir at least thats what ive gathered so far sir speaks damnall french or english a word or two and ive no italian so mister spendlove this is hardly the time lewrie glowered at him he was caught for fair sailing inconvoy with french ships and with french escort admiralty prize court s the place for him well sir he claims neutrality and all spendlove allowed one more member of the crew suddenly wary of his captains wrath if i may sir mister mountjoy offered of a sudden popping up like a jackinthebox from their offhand side whether lewrie knew it or not mountjoy had been dogging his footsteps making hasty notes and juggling fumbling more like a sheaf of record documents such as the forms for backstays shifted during the course of the commission and pestering one and all with questions to inscribe upon those forms as if that made everything tidy what mister mountjoy lewrie demanded impatiently of him as well mister spendloves concerns sir his clerk said with an apologeticpurr why i was so pleased to take the position under you captain to the mediterranean and all bloody lewrie huffed ready to explode at the nearest target to hand the very next pestiferous ive a good ear for languages sir mountjoy hastened to explain backing up a few half steps the romance tongues were my particular forte a hobby at schoollanguages french italian portuguese spanish should i converse with this merchant captain for you sir thats what i meant begging your pardon sir ah lewrie sighed deflating once more and unable to fume at such a wheyfaced tomnoddy with such a sheepish expression he had already delivered one prime rant over the opened orders weeks before and mountjoy had been as shy and missish about him as a dormouse in a roomful of ramcats ever since aye deal with him mister mountjoy practice your skills make him no promises mind think of it as an exercise before the bench perhaps and him a debtor i will sir with that lewrie went forrud with knolles and cony mister rees the carpenter and his crew to complete what atsea repairs they might by dusk they could be anchored in san fiorenzo bay begging supplies from hms inflexible for permanent repairs looks a whole lot worsen hit really is sir cony told him confidentially after theyd descended the newly rove larboard foremast stays from the fighting top larboard catheads shivered well need a newun framer two busted carline posts broke and scantlins on the larboard side stove in o course but thatd be bove th gunnels mister lewrie sir an nothin permanent like lessn theres no oak plankin r baulks tbe had well it feels damn bad cony lewrie confessed to him aye sir that hit does his longtime confidant agreed with a sad shrug but we give a whole lot worsen we got them frogs woz bein blown highz their own main yard last i seen of em heads an arms an all one second they woz thickern fleas on th bulwarks th next twoz cleanz a tavern counter at opnin time werent all that much fun ill lay ya sirtbe on th receiviri end o carronades f r th first time but we beat em sir beat em bad and the lads lewrie asked chary of conys optimism lord sir cony grinned they got eyes too mister lewrie an sense nough tknow that we got off easy compared tth monsoors and uhm sir well five prizes altgither took afore noon sights sir and th shareoutll be better fr them wot lived sir take yerself a gander sir give an ear to em this aint no beat crew not by a long shot mister lewrie theyre a lucky crew they thinks with a lucky captain jester got blessed back in th bay o biscay seal e spoke tya mister lewrie after e come fr little josephs were still a lucky ship dear lord they believe lewrie sighed hed say no more about it if cony was right and as a damned good seaman and boatswain he usually wasas a decent and caring person who usually knew more and had more sense than his superiorsthen he still had a crew who would be willing to dare a crew whod be willing to toeup and fight once more in future at that moment he didnt care what the people believed was responsible if they wished to sing praises to mahomet or pitt the elder he couldnt have cared less and if they wished to hold to the belief that a pagan sea god had come to them and blessed jester as one of his chosen blessed ramcat lewrie as a captain they should follow then so be it lucky ships were made of even more insubstantial moon wash than that and lucky ships triumphed in spite of all signal from ariadne sir uhm what now then lewrie asked feeling relieved of his foul guilty mood though still burdened by the deaths and injuries of those who had taken their kings shillings and blindly allowed him to lead them to such a slaughter do you require assistance then submit remain on station the signalman striker read off slowly bawling his translation from far aft his number escort prizes into harbor sir be damned if he will lewrie snarled make negative to his question of assistance then our number escort prizes into harbor and add require repairs the greedy bastard lewrie went aft while the signal pennants soared aloft sour again as he contemplated what a report ariadnes captain might write shed taken the pair of poleacres without a scratch and had run down to jester long after the french warship had sailed out of gun range shed made a halfhearted attempt at pursuit but had broken it off after half an hour and beat back to jester and her huddled prizes report lewrie thought id best be writing something myself and get hoods ear first why theres no telling what ariadne could claim he did to recover the first three prizesand share in the lot mister knolles mister buchanon let us get a way on her alan decided best course to san fiorenzo make sail conformable to the weather aye aye sir knolles agreed ah captain sir mountjoy harrumphed shyly once lewrie was back on the quarterdeck aye mister mountjoy our genoese yes sir a most specious case sir mountjoy said fussily his papers uhm what any court might construe as highly colorable then there is mister spendloves hasty inventory as to what she carried as opposed to what is listed in her manifest do you see water wine flour and biscuit uhm rice dry pasta outwardly it might seem innocent but there is the matter of powder flints boots premade cartouches and pouches all bound in cases bearing french markings most conveniently not listed as cargo sir his clerk concluded preening a bit now that his legal and linguistic skills had been of some use at last so his ship and his cargo are certain to be condemned in prize court aye lewrie surmised well fine then mister mountjoy a fair mornings work sir there is uhm well sir mountjoy rejoined as i stated i was a scholar of languages our recent foe sir was called fleche signore capitano guardino rather grumpily informed me that worthy at the mention of his name drew himself up to his full height which wasnt much worth mentioning and tucked his voluminous coat over his greasy straining waistcoat a most interesting regional dialect sir the genoese thomas mountjoy happily digressed so quite unlike that neapolitan italian that i first heard anything else mister mountjoy lewrie pressed sensing that there was and unwilling to waste half the rest of the day letting his clerk maunder and prose uhm that her captain flйches captain that is was named michaud signore guardino refers to him in rather a hostile manner so i intuit sir a perfect tartar altogether the signore capitano did express the wish that you blew him back to hades where he came from i believe were his exact words sir or at least made him as hideous as his superior who is in the capitanos mind satan himself had he to choose betwixt the two a cheeseparer a miser he called him and a fiend sir this brutto faccia or le hideux he derogates him in genoese md french with equal ease sir both of which mean sir in italian sir that is to say ugly face the hideous is the french vernacular signore guardinos ship was lying at toulon sir and was he protested dragooned into french service such excuse for his participation he believes most strongly wont do him a damned bit of good lewrie said smirking well sir le hideux is some new senior officer just come down from paris so signore guardino related to me sir to command their convoys and arrange escorts mountjoy related with a confidential air and to uhm inspire loyalty and enthusiasm in those officers and men under him brought his own guillotine so tis said sir mountjoy concluded with a shivery theatrical shrug then mister mountjoy do let us wish that captain michaud have we not already knackered his arse lewrie said with a grin over hearing the first bit of news that could possibly be considered cheery his loss of this convoy will encourage his hideous superior to harvest his head very well mister mountjoy well done er thank you sir mountjoy replied nearly stunned to be complimented do you see mister knolles hell have work for you and when hes done theres a fair copy of my report to be produced for admiral hood oh mountjoy said dashed at the prospect of another slew of correspondence very well sir damme i just hope the bastard gets the guillotine lewrie sighed to himself this michaud was just too clever by half well have a much safer and quieter time of it with him toasting on satans coals commander alan lewrie rn surveyed his ship peering forward at the truncated main and foremasts the untidy unbalanced juryrigged display of lowangled forestays that bore spare canvas jibs of masts spreading nothing crossyarded above the topsls the sailmaker mister paschal and his crew had taken half the foredeck for their work area and were busily stitching and patching no jester wouldnt dash into harbor in triumph shed limp no faster than the odd clutch of prize vessels she would escort it would be near the end of the day watch the beginning of the first dog before she dropped anchor time and enough to go below and visit the wounded first see that fellow who was sure to pass over before then if howse was correct in his assessment and think of something to say to him the report could be done later after all delivered verbatim in hoods presence really with a written account to follow perhaps a rough draft in hand should he dictate it to mountjoy and in the waist along the ravaged larboard gangway marines in slop clothing and sailors toiled sluicing and holystoning away the bloodstains hammering and driving what spare lumber they carried in carpenters and bosuns stores to the music of the fiddler and fifer not the dirge he expectedthey labored to the easypaced lilts of the derry hornpipe softjoshing each other faint smiles and some bleak chuckling now and again a subdued and fairly somber crew aye he thought but not a broken one h m s jester was still a useful instrument of war chapter and lewrie dictated to mountjoy who was scribbling away as fast as he could to get a rough draft at no time were the three previous captured prize vessels ever actively threatened with recapture as hms ariadnes captain suggests in his report therefore sirs his claims upon them are damme mountjoy whats a good legal word for horse turds i should think nugatory would suit sir mountjoy allowed with a brief grin of little or no consequence right then lewrie exulted mopping his sweaty brow with a handkerchief almost stifling in the greatcabins enclosed warmth and exercised with sullen illhumor to boot therefore ariadnes claim of shares in the aforesaid three vessels taken solely by jester long before her arrival on the horizon mind are nugatory and totally without merit same thing really captain mountjoy said dubiously wrap it in ribbons plate it in gilt and shit you read the law you know the catchphrases lewrie snorted impatiently hold him to the coals and paint him the greedy fool trot out your really big guns and hull him mr mountjoy the prize court s bought every one of them and their cargoes and the settlements been adjudged at nearly ј and the lions share should be ours ariadne didnt even get a scratch aye add this or something like itcouch it however you will jester fought the french national ship and by her valiant duty reaped the higher honors the greater glory so to the victor belong the spoils sir something like that capital lewrie rejoiced ill leave the rest to you you know the form by now for closure in navalese have it and a copy in hand for my signature by tomorrow morning just into the forenoon yes sir mountjoy assured him i meant to say aye aye sir sorry very well mister mountjoy that should be all aspinall aye sir ill have that fresh shirt and stock now for shore insufferable damn pinchpenny lewrie still fumed even as he made his way uphill to his town house sweating that fresh shirt and stock his waistcoat and breeches to a pearlgray rather than white san fiorenzo bay had turned into a roasting pan the last month or so aboard ship one might snatch a cooling draught of air under awnings or down a ventilator chute made from a topmast staysl but ashore the town had grown in size had spread out along the strand and up over the scraggly hills on either hand in the blink of an eye but a tent city mostlyfor the sick and wounded from the siege of calvi more sick than wounded though illness that accompanied a land force slew even more than shot or shell that tumbledown osteria at the waterfront that sprawling and sleepy little tavern had become a freshpainted wonder had added some patios tables and benches almost doubling in size the owners bowed to him as he passed saluting him in the local dialect as if he were their feudal liege osteria paoli their large new signboard boasted replete with a crude portrait of the corsican patriot leader british officers officers only lewrie noted were its principal patrons who almost filled every seat and table them and their doxies least someones profiting lewrie scowled begrudging soon as the prize court had released their judgment the month before hed fought a running battle to keep what hed captured off at sea again taking another pair of prizes in the meantimelarge poleacres this time burning or scuttling at least halfadozen more for which hed been unable to supply prize crews those new captures were all his but every return to san fiorenzo had brought new obfuscations about the convoy and the shareout of prize money admiral hood and his flag captain his small staff had already been awarded their eighth while both jester and ariadne were still waiting for their portions and lewries twoeighths represented nearly ј he suspected the agents and commissioners of the prize court were having an enjoyable time just living off the interest and their take for performing their dutiesand those badly probably spinning this out damn near till next epiphany so they can play with the hullo he had groused under his breath suddenly stopped short at the corner having seen his and phoebes town house what the devil there were two fashionable carriages coachandfours along the curbing equipages that gleamed in the sun teams of decentlooking horses flicked their tails and manes against the ubiquitous flies and liveried coaches and postilion boys did their duties as their masters prepared to depart richly clad civilians done up in gowns or suits that wouldnt have looked out of place on the strand back in london and another brace of dray wagons along the side street laden with heaped picture frames paintings chairs and tables had phoebe moved again taken cheaper lodgings been forced to no theyd paid the year in advance or had she left him he shivered he crossed the street ready to lash out at somebody anybody but was greeted most jovially in french or italian most of which he couldnt follow but did get some gist from something to do with being affiliated with la contessa or vicomtesse which association perplexed him even further just who the blazes lived here now phoebe he bawled once past those posturing clowns and into the cooler air of the courtyard which had turned into a furniture gallery it seemed couches wine tables armoires and cabinets gilded chairs were everywhere twoapenny ah alain mon amour a familiar voice called down from the upper floor and phoebe appeared in the ironguarded bedchamber window of the guest room above i be down wiz you immediate mon chou she was wearing a new sack gown something suitable for presentation at court though her hair was down informal and unpowdered as she tripped across the flagstones to embrace him what the bloody hell is all this i ask you he tried to say sternly just before she threw her arms around his neck and lifted her feet off the ground phoebe im serious girl

allowing himself to be led inside as her blindmans buff voilа alain she cried giggling atiptoe regardez bloody he could but weakly gasp at the transformation the parlor now held creampainted gilded couches and chairs upholstered in shimmery white moire silk with goldflecked filigrees deep rich tables and chestscherry mahogany or rosewood marbled topped or delicately inlaid with precious ivory coinsilver candelabras teathings vases and trays the kaleidoscopic prism speckling of lateafternoon sunlight glinted off fine crystal gewgaws or from the magnificent giltandcrystal chandeliers the sooty fireplace had been redone with new marble inlays dressed in carved stone that was very romanesque there were cloisonnй silver gilt or chinese vases cherubs candlesticks on the mantel below a gigantic goldvein mirror hung above it paintings in baroque gilt frames portraits landscapes painted scoured papered in some places elegantly draperied the parlor was now a showplace and not anywhere near the gaudy hed expected from someone of phoebes provincial and untrained background their plebeian lodgings had become a miniature palazzo as genteelly elegant as any fine mansion in the whole of england sit mon chou ere a cool glass nestce pas he had to sit he was too dumbfounded to stand he fell into a deep wide massy armchair done in burgundy chintz over priceless rosewood so elegantly carved his senses reeling as she dashed off to fetch him a glass of something joliette appeared prancing into the parlor with her tail erect she hopped up on the matching hassock and hunkered down warily barely out of reach but looking as if she might like a petting around her slim little ruffed neck there was a brown velvet riband from which hung a tiny amber cameo set in real gold a cameo of a cat of course there came the promising thwockl of a cork being pulled somewhere off to his right in the kitchen and a moment later phoebe reappeared bearing two exquisitely cut crystal flutes of champagne followed by a slim darkhaired maid hed never clapped eyes on before who carried a most impressive silver wine tray and a chilling bucket that held the bottle a wine bucket as big as a coehorn mortar barrel heavily ornamented with cherubs pans and grapes solid silver he goggled it had to weigh three or four bloody pounds cool too he muttered after the maid had poured them both a glass and departed without a word i kep ze bes you see she informed him waving a slim hand over her new fineries you like ze champagne alain bon ve ave ze dozendozen bottles now a ver good year just

and a poser and a puzzle and god knows what else alan thought damned well relieved himself but above all girl a sweet cunning little entrancing dearun chapter contessa the street vendor greeted her from his flower cart followed by some liquid italian and the offer of a nosegay of local blooms contessa lewrie frowned anew it had been the sixth time in their short evening stroll that hed heard the word but the first that hed associated it directly with her zey call me zat alain phoebe shrugged a bit too artlessly and with too much nonchalance though she could not hide her blushing why is that exactly he inquired striving for an equally offhand air i do ze busnees wiz zem loan ze une peu monnaies so she blushed again a lady cannot be padrone hein zat ees for men i elp eem buy donkey for ees cart an now e pay me back wiz ees profits oui like ze padrone does mais several gentlemen and their ladies out for a stroll of their own bowed or curtsied to themto her specificallyin the next half block doffing their hats fawning over her chatting away mostly in italian making raving sounds over the miniature portrait of pascal paoli that hung on a gold chain about her neck zey are patriotes alain phoebe said blushing even more prettily i tell zem where i fin eet an zey wish to purchase aussi dont tell me you paint em in your spare time he teased with a droll expression assumin you have

orders for more for ony ze une peu petite commission nestce pas mon dieu merde alors e ees kin shed already explained to him long before on the intricacies of corsican kinships which were pretty much on a par with a scottish clan with commerce of the most cutthroat kind thrown in immediate family down to distant cousins came first second was clan loyalty then god and church with self coming in a poor fourth usually one obeyed the family padrone then the feudal lords of ones extended clan who it seemed were forever feuding with each other as bad as capulets and montagues in shakespeares romeo and juliet blood was always answerable in blood and they had longer memories and grudges than an entire pack of abused hounds the vendetta they called it paoli everywhere he looked it seemed too portraits names of children names of shops and favorite horses troop a large painting or effigy of pascal paoli through the streets and one might imagine the second comingor a saturnalia with one and all kneeling in tears or hosannahs like roosian serfs did to their icons or their masters hero saint liberator caesarall of them was paoli in the corsican mind hmmf phoebe sniffed suddenly turning her head and turning up her nose in remarkable imitation of a grand dowager whod just delivered the cut sublime to some mountebank on the strand back home what eem she sneered inclining her head toward a party farther down the street zat messieur jheelber elliot of yous hes viceroy of the island phoebe representing our good king george lewrie told her patiently whats he done to you alain she rejoined scandalized and reproving e ees tyrant mon dieu merde alors corsica fight ze genoese hunerd year to be independent genoa give corsica to france an zen signore paoli lead us in fight zem for year an year and back in king george the seconds reign corsica offered to become english as i remember sign the whole island over to us he countered oui to rid us of genoese so we non become part of france be free she argued wait a moment he scowled perplexed again youre french papa was franзais maman was italian mais alain i am corsican you see an now you messieur elliot e will mak us british wiz monarch like you scotland poor relation when what we wish ees to be corsica independent papa come from france so long ago e was corsican maman be born ere in italian clan but she was corsican firs hein say corsican non franзais or italiana you elliot e say we mus ave king an parliament but mus be corsican king an parliament we say an zat ees quel dangereux oo ees king what clan ooh la you sink you see vendetta now so she summed up with another snooty heave of her bosom ze man oo open zat box belong to pandora zat man ees ze fool grande but not republicans alan hoped mean tsay if you dont have a king you might as well be like those anarchist americans or the french these days mon dieu alain non phoebe chuckled oo ees say evryone ees йgal zat ees stupeed people are non born e equal ever ow you ave padrones an clan lords eef paissans conardes be jus as good as ze noblesse zat ees seelly idea add perplexing to the list alan thought of his earlier appraisal of phoebe aretino paradoxical i ope you ave ze appetite grande alain ze cuisine ere ees so ver good she urged changing subjects and moods as quick as the mercurial little minx she was non franзais but corsican the ristorante liberatore with a portrait of pascal paoli for its centerpiece of course was packed with diners and doing a stockjobbers business but a table was always reserved it seemed for la contessa bella aretino and with much smacking of lips kissing of fingers crooning oohs and ahhs of welcome joyalong with an occasional smacking of a foreheadthey were led to that table that had a commanding view of the harbor and docks as well as the rest of that crowded dining room on a slightly elevated upper terrace and as they made their way to it several of the more fashionable diners paid phoebe passing honors with even more glad cries some almost groveling at her feet in gratitude for some earlier favor her hand was kissed and wrung so often alan thought she seemed more like a member of parliament on the hustings right after hed trotted out the free gin and roast beef for purchased votes hell of a welcome he thought for a little slip of a girl and a retired courtesan he could not help himself from adding there must be somethin latin in that surely god what a country with an almost regal air of true nobility phoebe smiled and inclined her head responding to their greetings before allowing a squad of unctuous waiters to seat her and grinning her eyes alight gleeful as the cat that ate the canary over her newfound adulation oh theres some poor fellows cant get a table alan pointed out damme its nelson and fremantle lewrie allowed himself a tiny smirk to think he was being treated like a prince consort to a queen as phoebes companion while those two distinguished senior officers were forced to idle in the entryway pretending with the patience of job that they werent famished or humiliated or almost reduced to groveling or bribery to gain a table and a meal captain nelson raised a hand to his right brow of a sudden and winced as if in mortal agony pressing his palm to his eye like he was trapping a persistent corsican fly capt thomas fremantle left off scowling at one and all to turn to him solicitously and alan could almost read their lips as they debated whether to stay or to go zose officiers alain phoebe said as their first wine arrived a fruity sparkling blushpink strawberry something zay are you compatriotes oui ze poor man e ees suffer ze mal de tкte peraps we should let zem join us eef you are willing of course alan responded quickly this heat and all why he must be wilting and theyll starve to death else phoebe summoned a waiter who bowed to hear her whispered command then quickly dashed off to invite the two officers to join them grateful fremantle explained as they shuffled their seats so nelson didnt have to face the sunset glare off the bay awflly an hellish crowd hey settle for a bread stick captain horatio nelson captain thomas fremantle allow me to name to you alan began grinning impishly as he continued in the spirit of the evening and the sentiments of the town la contessa mademoiselle phoebe aretino contessa he gave her a quick conspiratorial wink captain horatio nelson of the agamemnon and captain thomas fremantle of the inconstant frigate messieurs enchantй phoebe replied with another slight incline of her head as if speaking from a throne to acknowledge lesser barons whered she learn all this so damn fast lewrie wondered to himself you appeared so uhm ow you say indispose capitaine nelson ooh la i trus you are well msieur my infinite gratitude for your most gracious invitation mademoiselle nelson rejoined trying to be sociable even as he seemed to suffer another tiny spasm a trifling wound i received the other day trifling fremantle countered with a snort ha weeks ago nelson discounted with a dismissive wave as their waiters returned with more wine and actual written menus middle of july actually i must say this uhm ristorante is so certain of their supplies they can print their fare stead of chalking it up by the day incredible ah oui msieur capitaine nelson phoebe answered gaily and lewrie suspected one of those on the island who had a hand in assuring those regular supplies what didnt she have her hand in by now he wondered you will fin ze fare ees limit limited local ordinaire ony nestce pas mais you will fin eet consistent an all ver tasty corsican cuisine odd lewrie thought id have thought nelson was the sort to play up a tale of honorable wounds seen him posture and prose before now aint i to alans lights though nelson didnt look particularly cut up no limp no bandages a bruise or two some scabbedover cuts on his face must have been too trifling he concluded else wed be sitting deathwatch by his bed to watch the hero pass over pardon me for discussing shop in the mess as it were sir lewrie said but i must own that my curiosity has the best of me you both have been up at the siegework tis rumored the french are almost ready to give in i was wondering if there was any truth to it pray god that will be so commander lewrie nelson said with some heat and with what almost sounded like a croak of uncharacteristic gloom aye soon they simply must do you see theyre short of almost everything by now save powder and shot as i learned to my cost he added with a faint deprecatory grin our parallels have been advanced nigh to musket shot of their walls and our batteries are dominant over their artillery at last general stuart is confident of their surrender within the week failing that an attempt against them might well a final assault might have to wait for a time horrid sickness fremantle supplied as nelson faltered like a watch spring run down weve what barely two thousand men now and half of them down half the time bouillabaisse hmm some sort o fish chowder fremantle wondered after pondering the menu oysters they might be in it dye think like an english meal back home aye sir more a brothy fish stew but some oysters lewrie informed his superior hiding his smirk at how provincial most english gentlemen were away from home how wary they were of unfamiliar dishes and how unenglish he sometimes felt to delight in the exotic and new might i offer a toast sirs lewrie grinned raising his wine to our foes the french sirs may they be similarly afflicted and confused confusion to our foes nelson and fremantle rejoined tossing back their sweet sparkling wine and echoing the ancient words of the mess or wardroom response to such a toast frightful campaign weather nelson admitted as the waiters topped them up worse than any ever i did see even in nicaragua in the last war for heat and disease bad as the indies i must allow een corsica phoebe informed him we name zis season ze lion sun capitaine nelson ow you say uhm dog days fremantle offered oui merci capitaine fremantle dog days lion sun aussi phoebe went on july to october ze eat an ze damp zis time of year mos people stay indoor an nap srough ze wors of ze day an many sick many leave us even so quel dommage i marvel zat you eenglish soldier you fight in zis weather non wait for cool time as you pointed out mademoiselle aretino nelson said with unconscious pride were english english seamen fight in any weather hey fremantle commented though tis true mademoiselle nelson sobered many leave us dear lord so many leave us why a spasm of grief perhaps another tic of pain in his brows that quieted him for a moment but nelsons voice broke and he was forced to massage his right temple and brow as if to knead away whatever agony ailed him with those long slim delicate fingers that seemed so out of place on such a wee little fellow so fond of hardhanded war oh do forgive me for for being a killjoy nelson frowned after hed mastered himself for even broaching the subject but fremantle and i just came from the local churchyard a fellow officer commander lewrie you understand im certain my condolences for your loss sir lewrie gravely offered a most gallant young man sir nelson all but croaked one whod have made a name for himself that would have been on everyones lips had he not hmm lt james moutray board victory a fine young fellow was to have been promoted soon his father captain moutray and his mother we were great friends when i had boreas at antigua tween the wars he was navy commissioner at english harbour dye see and i knew james from a child just a wee lad back then its as if id lost my own son had i as sorrowful a thing as if fanny and i had lost our dear josiah fremantle made a tiny face rolled his eyes in dubious humor which expression of contempt lewrie caught knew you were married sir lewrie prompted to pique his further curiosity but i didnt know you were a parent as well might i offer you congratulations some cheer that hes safe abed in england at this moment uhm nelson was forced to confess pulling at his long thin nose stepson actually my dearest fanny and i met on nevis while i was in boreas as well shed been widowed and no josiah is with me lewrie in agamemnon brought him aboard as a midshipman to keep a weather eye on his progress hmm to assure myself that there will be a successor in the navy why as i recall lewrie youve sons of your own nelson brightened of a sudden as mercurial in his grief as he was in his enthusiasms perhaps twas lady emma hamilton in naples who spoke of you when i represented admiral lord hood with king ferdinand im sure she was the one told me mmm well sir lewrie almost winced phoebe turned a cool and amused gaze upon him though she already knew his marital status and that he was a father and didnt seem to mind my eldest sewallis i rather doubt now hugh the second son o course had to fetch him down from the mizzen stays just before we left portsmouth ees devotion to ees family amaze me capitaine nelson phoebe chuckled the other shoe dropped at last and nelson almost flushed as he realized their relationship phoebe also took pains to tap the side of her shoe against lewries under the table and reward him in public with a cocked eyebrow and tiny smile hiding her impish teasing for later in private mmm well nelson summed up at least the moutrays may have some comfort sir alan went on trying to change the subject and wiggle his way free that their son lieutenant moutray passed over in an honorable cause fighting his kings foes ah you see though lewrie nelson said with a bitter sigh god knows why they allowed it but he was their only son and heir and it wasnt honorable battle no twas a fever so please you a bloody fever took him just as a horrid waste of talent of promise can i dig the grave any deeper hey lewrie asked himself feeling an urge to look heavenward where he was mortalcertain god was having himself a kneeslapping good time at lewries expense absent friends fremantle harrumphed raising his glass in toast to bridge the embarrassment of the moment embarrassments rather wrong day for it but fremantle shrugged absent friends was the sunday toast in the wardroom aboard a kings ship lewrie was of a mind though to believe that the morrowsthursdaysmight be more apt the one lieutenant moutrays fellows were probably most callously making at that very moment now a rival for promotion or command had passed from their midsta bloody war or a sickly season thankfully alan was spared any further chances to embarrass himself by the arrival of their food bouillabaisse aswim with clams and crabmeat with mussels and a few puny oysters that might please fremantle and a host of tiny pink bits of cutup shrimp peeking coyly from the rosy broth decks awash a fresh wine course the hard mediterranean bread sticks then an appetizer of goldenfried crab cakes with a rйmoulade of horseradish garlic and a dash of olive oil lewrie tucked in savoring every morsel though fremantle and nelson seemed a bit put off nelson ate as if being merely polite fremantle muttered scowled and inspected every bite as chary as a customer in some twopenny ordinary who knew a fellow whod died after eating there he almost sniffed each new arrival casting his eyes about as if looking for a hound to try each dish out on first hed have a rough go of it alan thought the carte de menu had no roast beef no smoking joint of mutton to offer the choices were mostly fish wild fowl pigeon or chicken eked out from paltriness of portion with rice pastas and tomato gravies like the goat ragout he had ordered at phoebes insistence the arrival of which he was awaiting with a great deal of almost lustful anticipation and some manner of glee just to see the look on fremantles phyz when he declared what it was he was eating small pheasants or grouse appeared and with them a new course of wine squab most like alan thought how many corsicans had powder or shot with which to hunt these days squab on a thin bed of rice colorful with steamed vegetables and a brown sauce one of the waiters came to nelsons right side to fetch off his nearempty glass of rhenish and replace it with a fresh stem of some red wine just as nelson reached for it to drain the last of it down to heeltaps their hands collided the glass turned over and went smash on the tiled floor frightfully sorry tell him nelson snapped now it was his turn to burn with embarrassment once more he massaged his right brow as if to knead a devil out and wince with more than mortification just have em corne under your lee from larboard from now on fremantle attempted to jape theres your answer nelson perhaps that would be best fremantle nelson responded essaying a matching light tone of voice my sight do you see still a bit impaired sir mademoiselle frogs smashed three guns complete to flinders while i was in the battery rock sand splinter of something i had the misfortune to be within feet of a shell that burst a temporary affliction i do trust yet tis hard for me to discern much more than light from dark with this poor eye could not spot the fellow to my starboard side pray god that will be temporary sir lewrie said should he lose his sight alan thought surely hed stand a good chance of being beached and lose his ship no wonder hed not made much heroic ado pon it least said soonest mended went the old adage the leastmentioned a commissionending careerending wound perhaps the soonest forgotten by their superiors surely you saw someone lewrie wondered aloud oh of course nelson assured him warmly turning nigh jovial to disguise those very fears doctor harness a physician a surgeon mister jefferson certified me today as a matter of fact sawbones and potion pushers i tell you eye of newt and toe of frog thats about all theyre good for all their kind prescribe im down to see chambers surgeon to forces in the entire mediterranean in a few days i am most confident my veil will be lifted as it were and full vision restored by then or shortly after a few days rest lewrie kept an enigmatic expression on his face though he peered closely at that offending eye no reason he could see to follow the biblical injunction to pluck it out yet it did not seem to wax or wane as a normal eye should did not follow in conjunction with the dartings of the left orb and the faint scar that might have been the result of rock or sand or a tiny splinter lewrie kept himself from wincing with nutmegshrinking horror when he finally noticed that the scar was not on the brow only but far down onto the right eyelid itself poor little bastard lewrie silently cringed raised a glass in mute sympathy to restore his own courage too and damp the fear that hed ever suffer such a mutilation himself there was a commotion at the entryway some shouting in the road and the scruffing of urgent feet calvi blah blah blah louder in italian inside the door francesil calvi waiters translating for a party of british infantry officers on the main floor and a host of loud hosannas of triumph from them once the news had been digested i francesi esse arrendere calvi di mattina applause and cheers arose from everyone in the ristorante corsican or йmigrй french italian or british the french would surrender calvi in the morning and british forces had at last won an important victory in the mediterranean to expunge last years shame of toulon and its abandonment and something worthwhile too the total ownership of the strategically valuable island of corsica nelson appeared weary yet relieved and wore a faint bemused smile he applauded briefly but remained seated fremantle though rose to cheer cockawhoop abandoning even those halfmute essays of his at complete sentences to howl and cheer not even trying to form recognizable words for a minute until recalling that english gentlemen werent supposed to be seen enthusing and sat back down abashed thank bloody christ alan thought getting to his own feet and dancing phoebe about using the joy of the moment to embrace her in a most wnenglish expression of joy the fleetll be fully manned again he speculated all those seamen and marines back aboard from the siege well put to sea again and fight the frogs proper at sea sail into golfe jouan or gorjean bay whatever they call it and shoot the frog fleet to kindling if they wont come out to fight and get the damn war over in another three months or so austrians piedmont genoese all ready to march west into france and them without ships to serve their troops protect their seaward flank why well chop them to hindu chutney sauce and prizes he further speculated with few warships left the french coasting trade would lay wide open and unprotected to his guns in another three months jester could reap a bountiful harvest then he could go home the hero wearing the laurel wreath corona a gilded laurelwreath heros crown he crowed to himself with enough money to buy his rented land from damnable old uncle phineas chiswick buy even more acres have that london town house at last into the bargain and see caroline and the children enchanting mistress or no hed been on the beach too long before those four years between commissions and where his heart lay and where his lust romped were two different places entirely only one letter had come from anglesgreen so far in reply to the half dozen hed sent off aye get this over with quickly he mused as he resat phoebe at their table shes a fetchin little mort but shell land on her feet when im gone you gentlemen will permit me alan asked them in the spirit of the news i think a brace of champagne might be in order spumante was the best the house could boast overly sweet for most tastes a bit on the cloudy side but sparkling and spritely on the tongue frothy with pearly bubbles as they charged their glasses sirs mademoiselle contessa lewrie posed to them a toast to a complete and convincing victory over our enemies and an even greater one at sea soon to follow here here they all agreed book iv haec deus in melius crudelia somnia vertat et iubeat tepidos inrita ferra notos may a god turn this cruel dream to good or bid the hot south wind carry it away without fulfillment book iii lygdamuss dream albius tibullus chapter its working lieutenant knolles exclaimed with the sound of true wonder in his voice it is actually working well o course it is sir mister buchanon chided his earlier skepticism th capum knows a thingr two lee guns run out inbattery though aimed at nothing weather artillery run into loading position and jester forced to sail over on her shoulder canting her deck as if she were beating closehauled instead of sailing with the scant wind large on her larboard quarters it was a thing old lieutenant lilycrop of the shrike brig had taught his first lieutenant during the tail end of the american war and it might not avail aboard a larger ship of the lineto heel a shallow draughted brigsloop or shipsloop in very light airs reducing drag created by her hull by reducing the total area of her quickwork which was immersed and it was working for jester was slowly forging ahead of the main line of battle on the lee side where frigates and lighter ships belonged of course to catch up with agamemnon and cumberland which were almost up to gun range of the fleeing french fourandahalf knots at best but that was at least a knotandahalf quicker than anyone else at the moment as the fickle weather of the ligurian sea in midsummer played its usual coy games deck there came flushings call from the foremast cape sepet two points off th weather bows never catch em up lewrie glumly predicted god what an opportunity wasted again cape garonne two points off th lee bows rushing further informed them signals cross is aworkin on sepet four bloody days all the way to toulon and damn em the van squadron of the french mediterranean fleet now a much reinforced assemblage after ships from the biscay ports had slipped in past the weak guard at gibraltar as soon as milder spring weather had freed them would be almost abeam of the croix de signeaux atop cape sepet the windwhat wind there waswas coming more southerly directly into the bay of toulon before noon the main body perhaps the lead ships of the rear squadron would be inside the two horns of the bays wide entrance able to shelter under the heavy artillery of toulon s many formidable fortresses signal from brittania sir midshipman hyde shouted and from the repeating frigates discontinue the action sir lewrie turned aft to watch every ship of the line hoist replies to watch every frigate on the disengaged lee side hoist the blueandyellow checker mister hyde hoist the repeat lewrie ordered with a sour grimace so everyone knows were useless damn him on agamemnon of course there flew the query trust nelson to dare to challenge vice admiral hothams decision no respectfully submit this time as there had been after the last fiasco then nelson had gone aboard brittania to plead that the two french s he had takenзa ira and censeurbe left astern under guard of some frigates and the pursuit continued admiral comte martin didnt have the stomach for a real fight hed continue to run in rough disorder and his trailing ships could be overhauled and battered into surrender in penny packets but no hotham had demurred and even days after nelson had been pinchmouthed and pale with anger when hed repeated hothams words to lewrie no weve taken two weve really done very well nelson we must be content those two taken but illustrious had been mauled after she had come up to aid agamemnon and the lead frigates shed been taken in tow by the meleager frigate but blown onto a rocky shoal off avenca on the genoese coast and lost hms berwick captured alone too tit for tat and today one french ship of the line shot to rags set on fire and her colors struck to agamemnon and her tiny squadron but shed blown up before she could be taken as prize and admiral hotham was most like content again with the results one for nought tit for tat what a bargain alan thought why by the turn of the century well surelyve whittled em down to a manageable number hes a glass on me sir hyde carped referring to the signals midshipman aboard agamemnon not half a nautical mile ahead and to their right surely he sees our repeat signal id imagine his captain is trying to digest it first mister hyde lewrie snarled farts a brace of farts the pair of them their martin and our hotham goddamned rabbithearted dismal cowering farts staggrin about in a bloody fucking trance there at last agamemnon hauled down her query and hoisted the proper repeater reply cumberland answered a moment later along with fremantles inconstant captain cockburns meleager and the rest of captain nelsons small detached squadron which had ended up far in the lead of the battle line as usual mister knolles secure the hands from quarters lewrie said run out the larboard battery and bowse up to the bulwarks same with the starboard battery get her flat on her keel again and ready to comply with any alteration of course agamemnon directs aye sir knolles grunted in disappointment uhm i spose sir aye mister knolles lewrie snapped well sir at least we chased em back to their kennel that must be worth something kept em from escorting a grain convoy from north africa knolles posed with a wistful hopefulness to which his captain replied with a dismissive shit well sir knolles shrugged martin came straight for us chased us a day and a night from nigh to genoa back to san fiorenzo mister knolles lewrie commented as close to looking for an engagement as that mouse will ever get while the grain convoy most like went souwest near the balearics so wed be feinted away from any hope of intercepting it four damn days weve been playing tail chase far off to the north and east ill lay you any odds you like theyre loaded by now and heading home and ill lay you even better odds our admiral hotham will trundle back to corsica as pleased as a pig in shit and never think to detach scouting frigates to look for em till theyre back in marseilles weve been buggered in short again now attend to my orders sir ive no time nor any reason to discuss tactics or strategy not when our commanding admiral is so bereft of understanding either aye aye sir knolles almost wilted under the unaccustomed heat of lewries bile he was not usually the target for his captains wrath philosophically he realized though that anyone would suffice for the moment and that it wasnt in any way personal or permanent hes having one of his days knolles said to bosuns mate cony a few minutes later once the guns had been secured powder bags and shot drawn flintlock strikers removed touchholes and vents covered and tampions inserted in the barrels poor bugger ya might say that mister knolles sir cony allowed looking aft at the moody impatiently pacing captain all hunched over like some plowox brooding on remembered goads but hes had a power o worry tfret on sides how we look tbe losin this ere war so far sir but th latest news from homez better an hes the sunny sort i spect hes weathered th worst sing small f r a few more days mister knolles till were tgenoa proper an hell be himself again but right now he dont need no more frustin point taken mister cony knolles grinned shyly no more of our petty uuhm frustrations he suggested diplomatically now ats th very word i wuz lookin for sir th very word got to stop taking things out on the people lewrie chided himself massaging his temples and the bridge of his nose as if trying to scrub himself into a better humor but it had been a horrible winter a miserable spring and looked to be a dismal and frustrating summer this fine new year of both professionallysaddled with an inept sluggard of a shitbrain fool as commander of the fleetand lately personally as well in fact for a time it had been a terrifying time though that was somewhat eased by his brotherinlaws last letters for perhaps the hundredth time he wished hed never made that bold smug toast to nelson and fremantle how hollow that wish for victory seemed now how rashly hed tempted fickle fate with corsica theirs and lord hood worn down to a nubbin by the pressures of command hed struck his flag the previous september just after calvi surrendered and had sailed for home in his flagship hms victory and had taken victory or any hopes of one with her hood had promised intentions of returning refreshed sometime in the new year but black dick howe had kept his promise to retire and hood had been retained as senior admiral in london ashore vice admiral hotham had taken over the mediterranean fleet after sir hyde parker had stood in for the interim parker was cautious and conservative to be sure but competent hotham now well cautious was about as much as anyone might allow dull dithering slow as molasses unable to commit or make a decision his favorite color was rumored to be plaid but he was so senior he couldnt be passed over too healthy to ship home as unfit and had far too much patronage to be trifled with even by lord hood the board of admiralty or the prime minister pitt perhaps hood was too exhausted to care lewrie brooded in foul humor though the signs had been evident long before while jester was fitting out at gibraltar to go home in the early spring of hotham had been at sea near toulon hed loped back to corsica just as soon as the french put out to join up with hood though hed been an equal match for admiral comte martins fleet and could have won himself an epic victory if hed even lifted one finger to try french seamanship was abysmal back then the jumpedup matelots from the lower decks whod commanded hadnt the first clue and it could have been a proper massacre but for hothams caution by the time hood sailed from san fiorenzo martin had staggered into golfe jouan and got himself blockaded for seven months as out of the game as a legless pensioner at greenwich naval hospital with hoods departure though it was like taking tea water off the boil and setting it out on a windowsill without pouring into the pot their brew had gone tepid unleaved then positively cold the winter gales had set in around november and hotham had so reduced poor bear admiral goodalls blockading squadron that once hed been blown offstation martin had been free to nip along the coast to toulon and refit toward the end of the month then like locking the stable door after the horses had bolted hotham had assigned the proper number of frigates and lesser warships to watch marseilles toulon hyeres bay and gourjean bay when no one but an utter drooling idiot in bedlam would have thought of sailing and jester had been one of those lesser ships one of the very unlucky and had spent up to twelve days at a stretch at times heaving and bobbing like a wine cork under storm trysls or heavedto and barepoled trusting to seaanchor drogues to keep her bowson to wind and sea so she wouldnt broach or capsize and a very merry christmas season that had been then in the spring of once the weather had cleared martin had come out much better armed refitted and trained as well as reinforced probably threatened from paris with the guillotine he had at least pretended to try to retake corsica hed left his men and transports at toulon thinking he had to clear the seas of the royal navy first and where was hotham and the fleet at san fiorenzo bay where they could guard corsica good christ no hed taken them over to leghorn on the tuscan coast no matter that the mediterranean was so full of spies and informers you could purchase two with dinner surely hotham had been told hadnt he had an inkling and if the lineofbattle ships had needed refits then why hadnt he fetched the supplies to corsica rather than sailing over to them so everyone could come down with the pox lewrie muttered in acidic jest leghorn was a hotbed a paradise of vice and veneryand hipdeep in diseased whores of every persuasion something for just about anyones purse or taste san fiorenzo by comparison was almost stuffy and calvinist and dull as scotland on a sunday and what better way to erode the efficiency of his ships than to expose officers and men to the debilitating effects of the pox and the mercury cure god even nelson and fremantle had succumbed fremantle had met some greek doxy through old john udney the british consul another of the prize agent prize court set and lewrie strongly suspected he also lined his purse as a pimp to the visiting squirearchy nelson took up with one adelaide correglia no raving beauty that no sylphlike armful the night lewrie had dined aboard agamemnon at anchor that doxy whod moved into the greatcabins with nelson for gods sakehad trotted out to table in little more than a sheer nightgown and dressing robe so tight bodices or corsets wouldnt aggravate the abscess in her side she temporarily suffered so please you prating silly and inane twittering and titteringand that went for the pair of them why the mand made a perfect ass of himself over the mort all but cutting her meat for her and feeding her forkfuls all but wiping her chin and toasting her so loveydovey every five minutes itd damn near made him spew and as fremantle had put it on their way back to their gigs makes himself ridiculous with that woman damned bad supper to boot no hotham had been just as bedazzled and as buggered as any of his officers and when word finally came hed scrambled to sortie with only thirteen of the line well fourteen if one could count a neapolitan rd rate as seaworthy or battleready that first setto in march had been in weather as scant and a wind as light as todays three days pussyfooting aboutfarting aboutand unable to close each other and even with twentytwo sail of the line martin had proved to be just as timorous as hotham and just about as benighted with no eagerness to do much of anything while the rest of the fleet had almost posed for paintings atop a mirrorsmooth sea nelson in agamemnon thankfully without adelaide correglia had forged ahead dragging fremantles inconstant cockburns meleager frigate and a few more with him to harry the tail end of the french who had been content to run for home and mother with their tails tucked between their legs jester had been right up with them and for a time it had seemed as if that epic sea battle would occur two french s shot to lace зa ira and censeur after nelson fought them for twoandahalf hours of close cannonading over men killed or wounded aboard зa ira alone as opposed to only seven wounded aboard agamemnonl which shows what a properdrilled ship can do lewrie thought and what a barking shambles a badun can be but what could have been accomplished if hotham hadnt broken off that action too hadnt said we must be content weve done pretty well then after saving corsica hotham had scattered his frigates and such to the four winds on patrol duties and ineffective blockades trundling his liners back to leghorn perhaps mister udney had a doxy lined up for him jester had at least scooped up two more prizes from that spell of duty though theyd not seen a penny of the prize money for them yet either one of them a supposedly neutral danish merchant brig was still anchored at san fiorenzo while the prize court nattered as to whether her papers were colorable or not even though shed been crammed to her deck heads with warlike material another bad comparison between hood and hotham at least under hood the prize court had been a tad less venal and corrupt less so than what anyone familiar with a courts doings could expect hotham in charge though no not in charge lewrie sneered just bloody here but never in charge even of his own bowel movements now todays muddled fiasco again thered been rumors that martin was to come out this time to escort merchant ships to north africa to pick up corn so the south of france wouldnt starve or riot when their own crops failed for two summers in a row the piratical barbary states had grain aplenty and were more friendly with france than anyone else they pirated yet what had hotham done with that information go look for a convoy cover marseilles and toulon so tightly that no merchantmen might come out no again hed sat as sulled up as a bullfrog at san fiorenzo conserving what little energy he was still thought to possess and had detached nelson with a squadron of the very sort of ships that should have been prowling the seas in search of the french convoy or their fleet not west to interdictbut east to genoa to buck up the austrians who didnt have a navy to play with and were loath to advance one foot west of genoa without a guard on their seaward flank nelson in agamemnon clinging to his halfwornout gunner like she was a lucky talisman even though hed been offered command of newer larger ships time and again fremantles inconstant and a fine gun frigate the southampton cockburns meleager two brigs of war tarleton and tartar the frigate ariadne jester and a small gun brigsloop hms speedy and the humble cutter resolution how satisfying it had been six days earlier to set sail for genoa and vado bay under a commander who could at least be trusted to charge into battle and to get away from admiral hotham naturally itd turned into a farce not a day out theyd run into admiral martins entire fleet twentythree sail of the line and supporting frigates stooging about northeast of corsica theyd spent a day and a night being chased themselves this time turning to combine against any french frigates that got too near then spinning away when the odds became too daunting chased all the way back to san fiorenzo and hothams aid seven hours it had taken him to rescue them to recall his shore parties and libertymen to weigh anchor and lumber out on a poor wind to their rescue seven hours of damned fine seamanship to stand offandon san fiorenzo bay and not be crushed like bugs by the weight of the approaching french lineofbattle ships before hotham could save them and then had come these last four days of slackweather pursuit to end up off toulon letting martin get away again toothless hounds too feeble to bark chasing each other back and forth without even a nip on the hindquarters to show for it as if making a show for the young dogs in the neighborhood that they still knew how to beat the hounds even if neither one couldnt have cared less if theyd actually caught the other or remembered what it was a dog really did with a rival dog piss on the gatepost alan snickered with dismal amusement and toddle off with yer tail high sir midshipman spendlove inquired close at hand just maundering mister spendlove pay me no mind alan said blushing to have been overheard and glowering hellishblack aye aye sir spendlove replied meekly scuttling away from his captains possible wrath as if serving under hotham were not plague enough as if a pagan god had decided to muck about with his life of a sudden everything he held dear seemed to be tumbling down like a house of cards prize court phoebe caroline he shook himself and shrugged deeper into his coat turned his face to the dubious freshness of the wind to blank his thoughts of how near hed come to being a widower after calvi had surrendered as if a floodgate had been opened letters from home had begun to arrive on an almost monthly schedule to keep him informed of hearth and family caroline was a highly intelligent woman witty and expressive and her many letters wellcrafted and filled with newsy chatty gossip local lore the farms doings what his children had got up to and how much she loved him all of which had made him squirm but only a little with shame of his betrayal yet it was a socially acceptable betrayal was it not most english gentlemen of his stripe married more for connections or land than love in the beginning one had to be careful it took a rich mans purse to attain a bill of divorcement from some unsuitable mort so they weighed their options and the girl and the material benefits she could bring to the marriage with care beauty was valued as was a pleasant and agreeable demeanor mean tsay if one were stuck forevermore but once at least one male heir was assured of living to adulthood two or three was much betterit was expected by both parties in the better sort of society that the man would keep a mistress for his pleasure sparing his wife the perils of further childbirth they might be civil sociable and agreeable to each other still but it was understood and tacitly accepted as long as one had discretion many wives even welcomed such an arrangement and felt a sense of relief some few men with the purse and the ton for it kept more than one mistress a man had his needs after all especially one facing such a lengthy separation in time and distance but carolines letters had stopped arriving toward the end of january gales and storms in the channel the bay of biscay a packet ship lost onpassage and her latest missive with it the risk of correspondence over such a long distance that every navy man faced lewrie could have thought yet there were letters from london that still arrived letters from burgess chiswick and his father in india finally in april just after the first indecisive setto against the french fleet a letter had come from his brotherinlaw governor in anglesgreen and worry and longing coupled with his lingering sense of guilt in spite of being such a smug hound with purse needs and ton had chilled him to the bone as soon as it was in his hands alan i most sadly take pen in hand to discover unto you and most strictly against my dear sister carolines wishes and most rigorous instructions that both she and your children have been on the very verge of death thered been wave after wave of illness in the parish beginning sometime after the harvests were in and continuing into the new year flux grippe the influenza and fevers many of the elderly and weak the very old and very young about anglesgreen had been taken to their beds and a fair number never rose from them but had joined what the vicar at st georges termed the great majority first to succumb had been little charlotte then hugh lastly sewallis all within two days and nights first sniffles headaches and fevers followed by incontinent bowels vomiting chills and the most heartrendingly wet racking coughs no cordials no herbal teas or purchased nostrums or folklore remedies had helped not even warming pans hot and dry flannels or hot and steamy flanneling the local surgeonapothecary was an idiot theyd sent at last to guildford for a gentlemanphysician educated at edinburgh whose jesuits bark opium and antimonies had broken their fevers whose bleeding had restored the balance of their humors and whose pills and drops had quieted their coughs and allowed them to draw breath once more passing quiet restful nights seemed to restore them wondrous well though they were for days afterward listless and languorous quite febrile and weak with but the most delicate digestions or appetites as you may well imagine caroline had been too busy to write governor further imagined he might understand later worn down and too exhausted by her valiant struggle to preserve her dear childrens very lives so at the very instant that the family could feel relief and give thanks to a merciful god caroline had also come down with chills and fever headaches and sniffles then collapsed over supper pale as death itself before she took to her bed she enjoined us all dear brotherinlaw that we were under the sternest threats not to communicate to you any of their travails so that you so nobly and honorably in arduous service for king and country should have no distracting worries no additional burden that might affect that service i thought it quite daft but demurred for the nonce however now that theyd despaired so much of her life as caroline suffered very much more than the children had that theyd sent to guildford for the physician once more and he had all but thrown up his hands and told them to expect the worst governor chiswick was also a skilled writer much too damned skilled like some droning bore who relished describing every agony of his own surgery for a stone governor had gone to wretched terrifying and overly excessive details painting a picture so vivid and ghastly of carolines and the childrens every moan of how haggard and bedraggled how skeletal her visage had appeared as shed sunk to the last extremes how scant her breath how thready her pulse christ if he was here now id strangle him lewrie thought in oncemore impotently distanced rage and quite damn gladly too by god hes done me no favors yet miracle of miracles and with the unstinting damned near ferociously tender care of sophie de maubeuge caroline had rallied shed lived the crisis was over sometime in late february and since caroline was well on her way to a full restoration of her health but still too weak to pen much more than spidery henscratches governor thought it was time he was told in morbidly excruciating detail and what the hell was i doin in late february lewrie sneered to himself scathing himself again with selfloathing why i was on top of a corsican whore dickerin with criminal prize agents too full o lust for mammon an just plain old lust tgive family moren the idle passin thought when did i get his damned letter late april just after a night ashore with phoebe damn my blood feelin like the devils own buckofthefirsthead with nothin on my mind but more quim and breakfast noble honorable arduous service mine arse he felt guilt a shipload of raging bellowing guilt not just for his dalliances for his venal concerns placed ahead of family but for his smugness his conceit his blithe disregard for lifes lessons how fortunate hed been so far and how cocksure hed breezed through battle wounds that hed not lost an eye like nelson or a limb like lilycrop that hed been exposed to the most hellish fevers in both the indies china that he hadnt come down with sepsis or lockjaw fever from a cut in battle or those two unspeakably daft duels hed fought in his callow feckless youth that it was such a wonder hed lived this long was some assurance that he always would or that those close to him would be just as fortunate and that he could pay them no mind dismiss them from his thoughts once he had sailed them under the horizonand gaily assume that theyd be there at home unchanged pristine and untouched like porcelain gewgaws he might collect like marionettes stashed in a glassfront cabinet until the next performance which would occur whenever it suited his lights sobering to think he could have lost them all wife children heir love and joy shameful and sobering to consider what hed been up to while all this nearhorror had happened hadnt he seen it how many couples birthed ten twelve babes and ended burying all but two a man with means and the best physicians on retainer might lose two three wives to childbed fever before they interred him as well at the ripe old age of fifty that letter and the ones that had followed from governor and his motherinlaw charlotte finally a shaky one from his dearest caroline herself had brought him relief but little joy perhaps this was what the reverends called an epiphany perhaps it had occurred in some ironic conjunction with seeing a stern tarryhanded fireeater such as horatio nelson spoon and coo over his mort adelaide correglia making an utter fool of himself even though he still spoke of his dear fanny back in norfolk as some sort of household goddess or of seeing the dour taciturn and inarticulate capt thomas fremantle chortle and blush as he tried to play the gallant with his greek doxy at the opera in leghorn how much of a purblind fool do i look hed wondered how huge the quimstruck cully have been hmm whatever as drenched as a dog doused with a bucket of water to get him off a bitch in season hed cooled to phoebe turned surly and short made excuses invented duties that kept him aboard jester until he could hide from her no more and what a muck i made o that he squirmed working his mouth on his weakness as the squadron stood on norwest toward cape sepet hed gone to break it off cut swift and clean to make amends to caroline even if she never learned of it pray god she never learned of it but in explaining himself and his reasons and it hadnt helped that phoebe that day had looked so fetching so damned handsome neither had it helped that her huge brown eyes had filled with tears so readily at his sudden and inexplicable dismissal and betrayal frankly their rencontre had not been one of his shining moments pauvre homme shed muttered brokenly her face crammed into a lace handkerchief and shed rushed to throw herself into his armsto comfort him crying and clucking stroking and soothing as if he was the one to worry about phoebe i do love them all more than my own life dye see hed muttered and nearly lost them so mean tsay this we but zey are recover alain mon amour merci a dieul phoebe had shusshed ow orrid eet mus ave been fo you ow thankful you mus be mon coeurl an no one you may tell but you tell me there had been that what captain could unbend let his tears flow show weakness before his inferiors oh hed had cony and coxn andrews in given them the bald facts with hopes that maggy cony and their infant son might be weathering it but how long hed pondered fretted wished to weep to scream to beg god to spare em surely you must see dear phoebe hed stammered mademoiselle aretino rather hahummthat this that our you mus tell me evrysing dear alain shed insisted so he had sitting together on a sofa embraced and his own tears had at last come no matter that hed held them in control this long and what was another hour of a sad duty wept on her damn tits lewrie railed at himself went to end it and i ended up toppin her again yorktown toulon thered been a power of rogerin the days before the end o both twixt soldiers an camp followers like tellin death tgo bugger himself long as were playin at lifemakin you can just piss off hed taken his comfort with phoebe the comfort and sympathy she had been so eager to offer and hed been so grateful to receive but it had felt so perverse a thing to do even more worthy of guilt than before when hed been unaware that hed ended despising her to her face which was to say that hed despised himself and had simply found a suitable target theyd had a high old row shouting cursing flinging expensive gewgaws at each other and damn his blood if they hadnt gone right back to rantipolin in the heat of the moment hed spent the night and had awakened even more confused even more dithering than when hed climbed the hillstreet to her no their house the sudden transfer to nelsons squadron had come as a godsend if he couldnt make up his own bloodyweak mind he thought then the navy would make it up for him if he hadnt the nutmegs to tell phoebe off proper then perhaps time and distance from san fiorenzod do it for him god yer such a bloody coward me lad alan told himself such a weak venal spineless but damme whys she have to be so sweet about it so still no signal for a change of course sir lieutenant knolles said at his side were standing in rather close to cape sepet and those batteries hmm lewrie grunted in alarm certain his quavery musings had been spoken aloud in even a tiny mutter or whisper that just bloody everyone knew his business or soon would standing on sir knolles repeated with a quizzical expression he took off his hat ran his fingers through his blond hair and clapped it on again in a gesture lewrie had come to know as concern why for spite i spose mister knolles lewrie allowed now he was back in the real world to trail our coats right to their doorstep rub their cowardly noses in it i see sir knolles nodded with a slight wolfish grin though just what it is were rubbing their noses in is beyond me at the moment lewrie shrugged damned by his irresolute dithering beyond all glee of his own witticism knolles though and those on the quarterdeck nearest them rewarded him with a tiny appreciative chuckle even so as if to mollify the mourner the word had surely spread through the ship as the word always will in an eyeblink lewrie was certain since then the people had been walking on eggshells around him though they certainly sympathized with his plight they couldnt commiserate until he allowed it till he even mentioned his family he was approached like a new widower who was barely launched into his period of mourning cosseted gently without actually broaching the subject of what he needed cosseting for hellish challenge lewrie thought to be captain of a ship and thought lucky sure theyre wondrin if im not blessed if i can have a nearfatal sickness back home am i suddenly just a runofthemill captain jester still a lucky ship or to their north the french fleet was entering harbor just as he had predicted without even trying to turn and show their fangs their van was already inside the bay only their topmasts showing above the rugged heights of cape sepet and the main body around their flagship brailing up square sails to slow as they entered the bay of toulon eres a sloop o war fetched to sir mister buchanon pointed out to their left just below th battries at cape sepet one o eir corvettes like us bout our size sir twentytwentytwo guns i make her a most sleek and jaunty corvette she was too presenting her larboard profile to them about two miles off and about an equal distance from the sheltering guns new lewrie thought noting her yellow pale upperworks still pristine and virginal under a freshfromtheyards first coat of linseed oils a black lower chain wale that set off her saucily curved sheer line and a broad white gunwale though her sails belied that newness they were of a moreworn dun than most french ships sported from spending more time at sea since her launching signal from agamemnon sir hyde interrupted at last the squadron he read off slowly wear to starboard tack course easterly and make all sail conformable with the weather sir for genoa lewrie nodded suddenly feeling a weight depart his weary shoulders dither enough and someone elsell make your decision for you and have sense enough to be damn grateful when they do alan almost snickered in relief with the frogs run back to their pond i trust well have a much quieter passage this time hey mister knolles indeed sir knolles replied chuckling very well mister hyde hoist the affirmative mister knolles pipe hands to stations to wear ship a glance astern to agamemnon then past her to hothams line of battle which had already begun to turn east in rigid lineahead order the lead ship hardening up across what little wind there was and the one next astern of her sheeting home and bracing in to turn in her wake once the lead ships stern galleries were midships abeam going back to san fiorenzo bay he supposed their dubiously performed duties done for the time being and another fine chance for a victory lost signals down sir hyde shouted wearho mister knolles lewrie directed moodily put the ship about to the starboard tack there was a thin warlike sound down to leeward that turned his attention north once more a flat slamming thud of a gun that french corvette had just shot off a lee gun the traditional challenge to combat the misty single bloom of gun smoke rose over her decks obscured by her hull and sails would they but agamemnon showed no sign that nelson had even taken notice no directions to jester or another of the powerful frigates in the squadron to go teach that frenchman some manners what a lot of gall i must say sir knolles all but yelped in spite of himself once the ship had her head around thats the french for you mister knolles lewrie felt like japing just like women always have to have the last bloody word dye see in everything and full to their hairlines with gaul dont ye know he simpered oh merciful god sir midshipman spendlove groaned at just how bad a jape it was ow you wouldnt be just the slightest bit french yourself would you mister spendlove lewrie snickered feeling his mood brightening at last now that jesters bowsprit pointed to someplace more promising do i detect a touch of gaul in you as well sir god no sir spendlove countered that was good old english cheek the sort allowed midshipmen a different matter entirely sir i stand corrected about your antecedence young sir he said with a mock bow as lewrie turned away he missed the wink exchanged between hyde and spendlove the smiles of relief among the crew the captain had cracked a jest and a smile after weeks without perhaps the bad times were over for him and for them all so long corsica lewrie thought peering souwest though that isle was far under the horizon a hundred mile or more so long my shore house and my damn rent money and phoebe and my well free of hotham free of the fleet under an energetic commander such as horatio nelson lewrie was sure thered be action galore and the reek of fired guns bags of other things to deal with to think about so much that he would no longer have a chance to remain venal or weak a chance for redemption perhaps daft as a march hare reedy as a willow wand was nelson but lewrie was coming to like his direct and enthusiastic aggressiveness and whod o thought it the first time hed met him or the second and this time please god he prayed silently i promise to keep me member buttoned snug in me breeches swear on a stack o bibles if you like just steer us to action so i can stay out o trouble mostly he amended quickly and he could not help smiling ruefully there was a phrase he had heard mostly on the lower deck the wry wisdom of a frazzled sailor who had bitten off more than he could chew and it even rhymed when in trouble when in doubt hoist th main and fuckoff out ahum he coughed into his fist steady as she goes mister brauer eastsoueast thus chapter pipes squealing marine muskets and deckofficers swords presented in salute as commander lewrie attained the entry port of agamemnon just after captain cockburn the dance of gigs roundabout to line up in order of seniority had almost seemed laughable had it not been deadly serious to some of the participants welcome aboard sir an agamemnon lieutenant greeted lewries safe arrival on the starboard gangways might you join the rest on the quarterdeck yonder for just a moment sir till certainly sir alan smiled looking forward to an opportunity to speak to fremantle again that tall laconic stalwart and to become acquainted with the rest of the captains of their squadron who had so far been faceless names aboard distant ships captain fremantle good morning to you sir lewrie hey thomas fremantle replied never known for the use of five words when one or two would do keep well indeed sir and free of our admiral sure to keep better an audible sniff to his right which turned lewries attention to a very young postcaptain a prim upright almost delicately handsome sprog with an eager and earnest expression on his phyz though at first glance a moment before that phyz had borne the notquitewithusyet blandness and perpetual weakmouthed pout of someone from the peerage the sort who felt nighoverwhelmed but was determined not to show it to lesser mortals now a long vane of a nose with a pugtilted tip was lifted high in what appeared to be sudden revulsion allow me to name myself sir alan lewrie the jester sloop lewrie beamed with malicious glee to so discomfit such a paragon and i believe you are captain cockburn of the meleager frigate of course hed known all hed had to do was see from where a captains gig had come and observe the rigid order of boarding its announced coeburn sir the young sprog announced in a testy snap looking lewrie up and down like a disbelieving tailor your servant captain coeburn lewrie offered and i stand corrected beaming on as if nothing could deter a sunny smile really commander lewrie our admiral cockburns petulant thinlipped mouth grimaced in disapproval savior of corsica sir lewrie asserted quite cheerfully uhm yess though you sounded less than supportive of cockburn frowned as if disarmed or at least confused spot o bother at home we heard lewrie fremantle interjected quickly to defuse the situation better now quite captain fremantle alan said allowing his intercessor to lead him away quite thankfully winter agues twas a near thing but my wife and children have recovered sir and thankee for askin he caught a testy sniff from cockburn to his rear was he one of those hidebound in the navy who had no use for a married officer suspecting them of a lack of zeal and attention to duties damn him then lewrie thought quickly senior to me or no hes barely a jot over twentyone already made post when most his age are lucky to be commissioned at all as much the boycaptain as nelson looked at turks island i swear touch of the brogue or burr to him no matter how plumby he speaks too irish or scottish lewrie wondered to himself no definitely a burrmaybe lowland variety fair complected like a scot your daddy a trewed lowland scot laird young captain coeburn no knees for the proper kilt as he and fremantle conversed he turned a corner of his eye to measure cockburn just an inch or so taller than his own fivefeetnine perhaps no heavier than his own twelve stone courtierslim elegant in his carriage aware of himself too lt george andrews agamemnons first officer joined them and fremantle drifted away bit of a rigid stick hmm cockburn alan inquired softly know much about him do you sir oh him sir lieutenant andrews shrugged the usual story commander lewrie a long schooling like most of us carried on ships books without actually serving till he was fourteen or so andrews smiled went into his first ship in eightysix passed his board first try in ninetytwo i believe was aboard brittania with hotham when the war began no wonder he didnt like my scurrilous comments lewrie almost winced beginning to wonder if hed tromped through the manure again in his best boots a scurrilous comment bout our admiral sir andrews recoiled in mock horror probably not a jot on what ive already heard but then into victory under hood as tenth lieutenant then into speedy after a few months you know the benefits of the flagships wardroom and may we all thank god for it i say had speedy for just a little over four months and did incredibly good service in her too then was jumped to post into inconstant when captain montgomerie had to ask for relief mercurial lewrie sighed a month in her then into meleager commander lewrie andrews chuckled no i should think mercurial cant quite convey how quickly hes rising a good enough sort ive gathered captain nelson thinks the world of him sober highminded a taut hand though a bit of a stickler stiff and stuffy but andrews shrugged again why just want to know with whom im dealing lieutenant andrews lewrie discounted after all well be depending on each other oh i get your meaning sir andrews brightened havent a worry in the world with him at your back sir when it comes to combat captain cockburns a perfect tartar doesnt look the sort does he but then neither does captain nelson were one to judge solely pon a fellows appearance commander lewrie though i must say you appear as dare i say sir as dashing as your past exploits repute you to be andrews drew a finger down his own cheek as if to scribe the cutlass scar on lewries god help the french commander lewrie our captain remarked when he learned jester and ramcat lewrie were to be part of our squadron it was quite refreshing for lewrie now that he was somewhat a senior officer to be toadied to gushed at to have a subordinate piss down his back as he had over the years to senior officers all he could do was blush in surprise scuff his shoes and make a stab at shy noises ah lieutenant andrews chirped when a midshipman came to his side very well mister nisbet gentlemen sirs captain nelson is now able to receive you and allow me to express his apologies for keeping you waiting if you will follow me sirs nelsons stepson josiah nisbet lewrie gathered looking that somewhat portly smug young man over god help nelson he thought as bad as old forrester back in desperate and thinking about old times in the american revolution he could not help wondering one of his old captains aboard desperatetobias treghuesone of gods own cuckoos he offend him once and you were in his bad books forever and i think i just offended another of his tribe cockburn well then god help me again stewards circulated trotting out glasses and wine as senior men took seats near nelsons desk and the rest stood as close as they were able it was a tuscan red a tad dry and puckery but it was as close as nelson might come to a proper welcome aboard claret after a year or more in the mediterranean gentlemen good day to you all nelson began once they were supplied i should like to start by proposing a toast to our squadron to us to us they chorused tipping back their glasses it is a fragile and may soon seem like an arduous and frustrating task upon which we have been embarked nelson continued one i trust given your zeal for its performance which shall not prove to be unrewarding or absolutely vital to our cause but one that may seem to pose you on tenterhooks should this duty be pursued properly topup for you and then i will reveal it to you the stewards came around again and lewrie found a place to slouch against a carline post with his second glass in his hand we are as you may know under orders to liaise with the austrian army and their allies the piedmontese commanded by general de vins to be his left flank as it were and act as a wing of his cavalry might at sea to scout out and discover then harass and destroy any attempt by the french to advance eastward along the coast general de vins aims to advance west clearing the french from those ports and fortified towns of the genoese riviera containing french expansion then driving them back behind their own borders eventually it is hoped nelson said forcefully he will bring them to battle and destroy them clearing the way for a second invasion of the french portion of the riviera and provence that task is made daunting by the nature of the country inland there are steep mountain roads little better than corsican goat paths these narrow passes that are easily defended suppling his army inland will be most difficult and equally difficult for the french do you see he said sweeping a hand over a large map on his desk at which they all craned their necks to peruse the french aim is to spread eastward seizing the genoese republic piedmont then all of the italian peninsula weve checked them at sea so far so the army france assembled to retake corsica has been diverted to here east of toulon they come forward slowly depending on coastal merchant ships for supply hence the necessity for our squadron in these waters to harass their trade and to protect ours we are gentlemen much like a cavalry vedette or piquetpost a force flung forwardmost at the very lancetip of contact with our foe we may help delay therefore assuring the defeat of their plans or we may most surely lose this campaign entire for the time nelson told them proudly we are the most vital naval squadron in the mediterranean perhaps in all of european waters things nelson was forced to admit sobering have not gone entirely in our favor he outlined the reverses the coalition had suffered the austrian army under general coburg had been defeated and run out of belgium an austroprussian force across the rhine had been run back to the east side which forced the prussians to split off from the austrians and sign the treaty of basle with france holland had been overrun its icebound navy capturedby french cavalry charging over the iceand was now a mostly enthusiastic french republican possession called the batavian republic and the unfortunate duke of yorks army mostly hessian and hanoverian mercenaries had been run from dunkirk into flanders then into holland as it was being conquered and finally into germany where the royal navy had fetched off the officers their baggage and a large part of the supply train but the men had mostly been abandoned and lost spain never much of an ally anyway had just signed a treaty with france and had quit the coalition closer to home austria and sardinia were still officially in but genoa and tuscany were wavering and what the kingdom of the two sicilies in naples might do from one moment to the next was iffy with tuscany now neutral leghorn and porto especia could no longer be considered allied royal navy bases though they could refit and victual individually during a limited stay as could every belligerents warships genoa directly in the path of both armies maintained her shaky but still friendly neutrality quite unable or unwilling to defend her own territories or too frightened of the consequences the trade with the french is bolstered by many danish dutch tuscan of a certainty vessels perhaps we shall see spanish vessels seeking to profit presenting the most plausible but colorable papers even genoese ships are suspect and must be stopped hullo alan gawped slouching a bit less hell of a way to deal with a neutral almost an ally this coast now occupied by the french properly of the genoese republic along here west of vado bay nelson said with a sweep of his hand over the map which encompassed porto mauritio in the far west the harbors of oneglia diano and alassio luano and finale as well as a host of lesser ports fishing villages tucked into almost every sheltered inlet on that steepto rocky coast all the way to the wide sweep of porto vado and vado bay even further west along the coast of formerly sardinian savoiafrom cape antibes nice and san remo the riviera presented a hundred places where shoaldraught coastal trading ships could shelter almost take to the shingly stony beaches overnight like ancient greek or roman galleys it had more hideyholes than a wellwormed cheese to be perfectly charitable and humane sirs nelson glowered sternly one might expect us to turn a blind eye to the genoese trying to relieve the sufferings of their own subjects who have been invaded and trampled under the conquerors heel through no fault of their own genoa cannot rescue them free them of the tyrants yoke and we may be certain with their coastal trade cut off and the french army foraging from their larders they shall certainly go hungry until such time as general de vins may liberate them shortcommons may be the least of the suffering the french bring to them you understand the callous and rapacious nature of triumphant soldiery yet every morsel of pasta every swig of wine or cup of flour that might charitably nourish a genoese may just as easily end in the gullet of a french republican soldier so hard though it may be for me and i am certain for you gentlemen to contemplate yet must we interdict that trade completely mister drake our minister to the tuscans and the genoese republic and his agents assure me that such a trade already flourishes excuse me sir lewrie simply had to say which drew another reproving sniff from captain cockburn seated close to nelsons desk and alternately frowning in humane concern or beaming in rapture at his words were to base here just off the genoa mole and in vado bay might we not make the genoese so angry with us that they order us out and ally themselves with the frogs a point well taken commander lewrie nelson allowed without a trace of rancor indeed there is that risk mister drake and i have wrestled with that contretemps many an anxious hour but i believe it a sea officers duty to not only have the moral physical courage that our calling demands but political courage as well if it is political courage that the genoese lack then there is also the possibility that they will accede temporarily in the face of the greater good that is to say the preservation of their wellprofessed love of independence but are you not sir that is to say we would be uhmm captain cockburn fretted softly acting against orders i mind aye captain cockburn nelson confessed there are extant instructions from home which state that our warships are to avoid giving just cause of offense to any foreign power in amity with his majestys government i am in fact acting without not only direct and specific orders and instructions from admiral hotham but i am in some measure acting directly contrary to them and good on you lewrie thought with rising expectations feeling his face crease in a wolfish rebellious grin anything that goes contrary to hothams edicts is probably the best course of all damn fool genoa may qualify loosely as a foreign power in amity nelson all but smirked but they have proven too irresolute in defense of their neutrality and their amity with us is but grudging we will stop up the trade along the coast entirely no matter which flag is presented horrible as it may be to make innocent civilians pay for a war as against the honorable and christian usage of a military campaign this may be i am sure that i have the support of his majestys ministers both at turin and genoa and a consciousness that i am doing the right and proper service of our king and country well sir captain cockburn grinned bashfully sounding as if he had been turned around to a new way of thinking and was enthusiastic aye we are acting contrary to whatever orders might have come from our senior admiral nelson further confessed means he didnt think to issue any that mightve alan thought aye we face the risk of litigation over illegal seizures of political diplomatic wrangles nelson went on no one knows more than i and commander lewrie i recall of how fraught with possible cost to career and purse such lawsuits that might be brought in admiralty court against us lewrie and i had a rough old time of it in the west indies tween the wars did we not sir but we persevered and succeeded in suppressing illegal foreign trade in upholding lawful navigation acts and in hanging a few pirates in the end of bringing the biggest rogues to book so this is what we shall do sirs the harbor at vado bay will become our main anchorage and where we will fetch all seizures no matter how small mister drake here in the capнtol is arranging agents to inspect and condemn our prizes to pay the freight release the vessels sell their cargoes and hold the monies for us until a real admiralty court may adjudicate them neutrals may be released once emptied should their papers prove legitimate and proper but without cargoes or profit thus hopefully deterring them from a second attempt vessels of belligerent nations to be kept as droits of the admiralty subject to prize money as will any ship neutral or belligerent found to be carrying warlike stores now here are my specific orders which you will also receive written you will stop and inspect all ships bound for france or any port now occupied by france no matter how inconsequential such ships may be nelson ticked off on his fingers you will be careful not to give too great an offense but stop them you will you will prevent any embezzlement of their cargoes taking inventory as best you are able against the manifests should they still be aboard after seizure the masters will be kept aboard so they have no certifiable complaints to level against us at some future court you may take out of them such people as may be deemed by you improper to remain aboard either of the crew or the passengers most especially those you deem suspect or who cannot provide proper bona fides should they offer any resistance to you then on their heads be it as long as your responding force is commensurate and requisite to the situation i assure you i will uphold you to the utmost of my power as long as you feel you did your duty honorably and as best you saw it that cheered them up considerably what horatio nelson proposed was fraught with risks professional ruin a courtmartial financial disaster and years of litigation so expensive with possible judgment against error so steep theyd die in debtors prison without even a penny for beer on sundays i know it is not the usual thing nelson said with a smile on his face a bit shy that a senior officer explain himself so elaborately but i have found gentlemen that hastily issued unexplained or mystifyingly purposeless orders are never half so diligently pursued as those that are made clear concise and the sense the reason for them fully shared i promise you all that i will endeavor to share with you all pertinent information as soon as i come to know it which pertains to our situation so that you may feel free to act with more certainty knowing that you are in full obedience and full agreement with me as well so that we may diligently enthusiastically and cooperatively function more as a likeminded band of supportive men toward the greater good instead of at halfguessed loggerheads that too drew a good on you from lewries thoughts hed been clueless too often in the navy too compartmented and menial to suspect why most admirals issued orders while holding the reasons as close to their waistcoats as whist players with a good hand well then gentlemen a final glass to success in our new endeavor and well be about it nelson suggested summoning his stewards once more written orders that illuminate the points i raised will be given you the port of genoa isat present mindcooperative toward port visits and victualing rights which ships require supply before putting to sea half the captains hands went up lewries included victims of capricious mystifying and conflicting orders to join the squadron at san fiorenzo before victualing before theyd tangled with the french this last time and san fiorenzo already short of supplies nelson gave them a wry expression perhaps verging upon shammed horror no captain would usually put to sea without every water butt or breadbag bungful his stored rations especially livestock and fresh meat or flour crammed into any odd nook or cranny available and well nelson knew that fear of running short or of being deprived he might have urged them to sail with what they had but seemed to shrug off the greed for oversufficiency philosophically in that case then uhm captain cockbum the young man perked up his phyz turned all noble and enterprising and conscious of being singled out since your meleager is better stored than others you are most ready to put to sea nelson told him you will cruise off vado bay in company with uhm the tarleton brig and the resolution cutter and in temporary charge mister drake informs me that there is rumor of a genoese convoy keep your eyes peeled for it some talk of monies plate and jewels to be transported east from marseilles in genoese bottoms the interception and seizure of which i am certain would be most discomfiting to the french cause along with the grain i would be honored sir cockburn preened could a man swagger still seated lewrie thought sourly regretting his own selfish desire to cram jester with lastminute supplies lucky bastard still even though jester barely drew more than two fathoms this duty would involve inshore work cutting out a merchantman in shoal water from under the very noses of forts almost in musket range of the cliffs or beaches jester had but two boats on her tiers to use for this and they were both too small to hold a crew of raiders and oarsmen he reckoned he might use the delay in harbor to chivvy up something larger something mediterraneanlooking shabby but stout to serve as jesters tender something so commonplace that her arrival in an occupied port would go unnoticed until damme if ill cheat myself out of a shot at plate gold and jewels something just big enough to bear the weight and recoil of swivels or one of the smashers he mused the other captains seemed regretful of their avidity too bereft that theyd ceded a chance for untold riches in prize money for the lack of a haporth of tar or a stoupful of water i could ariadnes captain grudgingly offered now he saw the fortune he had missed no no sir nelson countered amicably do fulfill your every need first so your ariadne may keep the seas without stinting your men and thus reducing your effectiveness once there you damn clever hound lewrie realized gaining a sudden appreciation for nelsons nacky wits you want us likeminded and all thatbut you want us hungry for loot too no better way to light a fire in em than dangle baubles in their faces were it just orders or grain wed be keen enough but now hes more than the dashing heedless bugger i thought him hmm lucky dog sir fremantle crowed at cockburns luck once they were on deck once more queuing up to depart in reverse order of seniority and their gigs aligning themselves in a like circle but for firewood and water sir cockburn simpered seeming modest but more than a little certain of how high in nelsons regard he really was compared to the others stiff stuffy aye like lieutenant andrews said lewrie thought but more prissy than prim like a woman with a new ball gown i dont think im going to like him very much all my good fortune and patronage aside being in the right place at the right timebein damn successful tooand he made post in a little moren a dog watch got a frigate doin less than half of what i right add jealous to weak and venal he scowled and had to snicker at his own pretensions oh well good fortune sir lewrie offered cockburn and good huntin extending a hand to be christian about it jealous or no thankee commander cockburn replied stiffly one may hope hey ill try and leave something for you thatd be damn good of you sir alan forced himself to say with smile you vauntin turd damn limp hand and wrist cold an weak as some well urhm cockburn said retrieving his hand seeming as if he felt a sudden urge to wash it before we sail sir allow me to give you the name of a rather decent genoese tailor he cocked a brow and gave lewrie another of those searching toptobottom looks perhaps your delay in port will give you time to obtain the requisite epaulet and lace commander lewrie one must be properly attired dye see else our socalled neutral traffickers might not take you as seriously as they ought kind of you sir lewrie rejoined stifling the fiery retort he really wished to say back it was possible that cockburn was genuine with his offer that he really was such a stickler for details or was such a toplofty sod he didnt understand when he gave offense lewrie though had never been more than ready to be chary of other mens motives and was pretty sure he was being deliberately galled for the nonce sir he continued still with a thankful smile on his face ill have to let my guns be my guinea stamp ah fremantle coughed with sudden relief mboat good day tyou all sirs captain cockburn commander lewrie confusion to the french alan had to admit he was a bit behind the latest regulations for sea officers dress but then they almost all were the latest directives ordained the addition of a vertical scallop slashcuff over the sleeve rings of rank with the gilt buttons moved inside and vertical instead of horizontal and finally after years of grumbling that the senior naval uniforms were too plain compared to the armys they were allowed to wear epaulets commanders got a plain fringed goldbullion epaulet on their left shoulder captains of less than three years seniority got one on the right while full postcaptains were to sport the full pair cockburn had already obtained his though few of the others had so far bothered so much at sea where it didnt make one damned bit of difference on a foreign station out of sight of admiralty or fussy port admirals my thanks for your excellent suggestion captain coeburn sir lewrie said continuing to doff his hat turning to include cockburn in the salute hed just given fremantle ill toddle on down the queue if you will excuse me blieve your boat is next anyway sir quite cockburn replied giving him a brief jerky headbow as lewrie wedged in astern of ariadnes captain but before the juniors who commanded the lesser ships he took time to look over the harbor searching for a useful boat he could purchase as a tender to jester even with a replacement cutter on her boattier beams he had three small boats to work with a localbuilt tartane lateenrigged fishing boat or small coaster would best suit his purpose he decided something around fiftyfeet long or so about half jesters length a twomaster perhaps which would be fast enough to chase shoaldraught enough to go very close inshore and could pay for herself at least fifty times over were they lucky another thought struck him as he was at last being rowed back to jester in his gig were they to wage fullfledged commerce warfare then why were they limited to the genoese coast while nelson had said little about savoian portsnothing reallyhadnt his hands encompassed them when hed shown them the chart wait a bit lewrie enthused squirming on his padded thwart he had any ships bound for france or any port now occupied by the french hed directed better pickings he speculated easier pickings troops all off far to the east with only small garrisons left in the backwaters and shipmasters thinking themselves safe as houses that far west around cape antibes and san remo he thought defenses might be lighter yet the effect of a raid could hurt the long french supply trains just as badly maybe worse theyd have to divert troops and guns from their march on genoa to protect those neglected ports spread their ships too thin which escorted or patrolled and most profitably yield the value of contraband cargoes as prize money with no other british warships in sight confusion to the french indeed he thought with a feral grin of anticipation eager to be at it and to get ashore quickly to grab a tender before the others thought of it and get those changes to his uniforms done after all as long as he was at it chapter lewries problem was being a bit skint himself short of the wherewithal to pay the outrageous prices genoese masters or captains asked for their fishing boats so jester had departed genoa in midjuly without a tender once at sea though hed simply taken a suitable vessel bombуlo her owner had named her a tartane of only forty feet in length tubby and broadbeamed shed been running along the riviera coast fat dumb and happythomas mountjoy whose command of italian idiom was growing by leaps and bounds told him her name meant a fat person and was therefore particularly aptoff san remo thered been no beach to ground on no convenient inlet into which she could slip and jester had cut inshore of her she was savoian and empty of anything of value save for a few casks of freshcaught fish but she had attempted to flee which lewrie wrote up in his report as the sort of suspicious activity nelsons orders had warned him to be on the lookout for a quick palaver at gunpoint with her terrified captain and the deal had been struck with three casks of their catch in her longboat the captain and his small crew allowed their freedom to row awayand lewries offer of ј in silver shillingshed bought her quoins full out when youre quite ready mister bittfield lewrie ordered number one larboard gun fire bittfield shouted a ranging shot howled away for the tiny extemporized fort sited on a low bluff overlooking the entrance to the harbor of bordighera asleepy town awoke to the clap of thunder and the crunching rattle of rocky soil and shale blasted loose from the bluff just below the redoubt there was an answering bang from the shore as one of the guns in the threegun battery returned fire adding a bloom of smoke to the cloud of dust that hazed the morning air below the thin flagpole and french tricolor cold iron lewrie spat to mister buchanon as he saw the shot fall far short and wide to the left by at least a hundred yards and if the battery corrected their lateral aim theyd still fire astern of jester for at least their first or second full salvos number two gun fire bittfield shouted pacing aft as if he were firing a timed salute with the prussian quartergunner rahl almost frantic as he scampered in advance of him tugging and trimming the aim and elevation casting urgent glances over his shoulder to mister bittfield to see if he was still scowling at him a touch higher a touch to the right that second shot fountaining gravel and dirt just short of the low stone rampart an officer on horseback appeared with one or two aides to the right of the battery and unslung a telescope so close was jester to the steepdiving shore that they could hear the faint whistlethroughyourteeth tootle of the garrison being called to battle by fifes and drums number three gun fire bittfield barked oh bloody lovely lewrie beamed that shot scored a direct hit on the rampart nine pounds of iron ball striking between the two righthand embrasures poor mortar or no mortarperhaps the wall had been quickly erected with its stones laid as loose as a welsh pasture fencebut when the dust cleared down it had come creating a fourth embrasure on the seaward side a ragged gap with a skreeslope of tumbled rock below it number four gun fire down the deck the tolling went gun after gun lurching backward on its truck carriage to chip away at the top of the rampart smash in low on the wall skim just over it or pummel the soil beneath making a pall of dust and smoke to obscure the french gunners aim larboard battry make ready for broadside bittfield cried raising a fist in the air wait for it on the uproll firel nine carriage guns went off as one this time shaking jester to her very bones reeling her sideways to windward a foot or two a shot amputated the flagpole bringing down the tricolor the rest battered down a stretch of wall flinging rocks as big as mens heads into space the officer on horseback fought to control his terrified rearing mount and the mounted aides vanished as the dust and smoke cleared lewrie could see at least one french fieldartillery piece laying canted on a smashed wheel and carriage through the vast gap his guns had blown mister hyde lewrie shouted fanning in front of his face for fresh air hoist the signal to mister knolles mister buchanon well put the ship about on the larboard tack porter pipe stations for stays and ready to come about little bombуlo wheeled about from her position astern and to seaward of jester easing the set of her conventional jib winging out her large lateen mains and bore off north for the harbor entrance at the same time jester swung south into the wind tacked and sailed to her support to reengage what was left of the battery with her righthand guns steady thus lewrie told the helmsmen all yours mister bittfield starboard battry ready broadside on the uproll fire closer this time within a quartermile of the shore and even the carronades blazing away from focsle and quarterdeck bulwarks a hailstorm of roundshot savaged the entrance face of the battery and more stone flew in the air more gravel and dirt slipped down the hillside to patter into the sea one shot from the french who had gamely wheeled one of their light field guns to a spare embrasure from that unequal combat on the sea face a shot that went warbling low astern to raise a tiny splash seaward of jesters wake the tricolor showed itself again risen on the stump of the flagpole by some brave soul now only a little higher than an infantry regiments banner ey got spirit capum buchanon commented when he took his attention off the sea to starboard for a moment well shoot that out of em sir lewrie grinned ah eres at rock ledge well tstarbd missed it by at least a quartercable sir buchanon grunted with professional pride no worries deep water clear tth entrance with the fort so busy with jester and being pounded into road gravel little bombуlo was free to breeze into the small harbor without a shot being fired at her around the point behind the bluff fort there sounded the panicky patter of musketry fired at impossible range broadside ready on the uproll firel and another exchange of shots two french guns this time but still badly laid and aimed one ball struck short skipped twice and struck jesters starboard side just below the mainmast chains with a dull thud it hung for a second in the dent it had created in the oak planking just below the stout chain wale then dribbled off to splash into the sea the second whined overhead not even clipping rope once more the tricolor went down as the fort shivered to the monstrous weight of iron and the wall between the embrasures slumped flinty sparks smoke and dust flew then the whoomphl of gunpowder cartridges as a reserve went off like a miniature vesuvius flinging rock and gravel a hundred yards offshore creating a rising gout of smoke and the hint of flames at its base near midchannel ease her quartermaster well enter harbor in midchannel mister buchanon hands to the braces lewrie called winds from the soueast wear us for a run with the wind large on the starboard quarter around the point and under the bluff the land fell away toward the town on the righthand side the shoreline of the harbor almost a full circle as if cut from the rocky coast with the rim of a cup with high hills all about behind the bluffs short peninsula he could see that bordighera held slim pickings there were three shabby locally built tartanes tied up to a stone quay near the center of town a narrow and rocky beach to the right and a much wider softer beach to the left of the inlet where at least twodozen small fishing boats no bigger than the ships jolly boat rested with their bows on the shingle and gravel bombуlo was coasting toward the quay prompting the crews of the tartanes to flee ashore into the streets leading uphill but down from the battery at least a hundred french infantrytwo companies alan thoughtthat had formed a line midway between the fort and the town were jogging townward to intercede the mounted officer appeared again this time at the infantrymens backs his sword drawn to spur them on mister bittfield that lot lewrie shouted load with grape and canister quartermaster put your helm alee two points to lay us closer inshore o those buggers pistols were popping on the quay with his telescope alan saw a few men in french naval uniforms falling back from their vessels to the buildings as knolless raiding party came alongside the largest of the tartanes no more than halfadozen against knolless fifteen he thought abandoned by the rest but still game a swivel gun banged and a uniformed frenchman went down a twopounder boat gun went off aboard bombуlo spraying canister into the front of an impressive shorefront commercial building and dropped another the rest at last fled far outnumbered and outgunned loaded an run out sir bittfield reported range bout two cables too far forrud o th carriagegun ports but were sailin fastern they can trot sir steady quartermaster well stand on a little closer do you be ready mister bittfield ready bittfield yelled to his gun captains tacklemen and loaders rammermen and powder monkeys stepped clear of recoil of the rope tackle that could ensnare a foot and have it off lanyards were pulled taut to the flintlock strikers quartergunner rahl more used to the employment of artillery against troops in the field scampered onto the forecastle after directing the train of the forwardmost gun the french soldiers were intent on getting to the quay to stop knolles from taking those small coasters of getting into the town and the main square just above the quay to volley or snipe from cover a moment more lewrie thought wondering if those local charts were right and he had depth enough along that shore but for the creak and groan of the hull the swash of water and the rustle of the wind and sails it was for a moment peacefully silent he could distinctly hear the rattle and thud of boots on the roadway of musket butts clapping upon bayonet scabbards and sheathed short swords canteens and metal plates and cups hung from knapsacks tinkering one another as they jogged at the doublequick helm up to windward quartermaster lay us parallel to them lewrie said at last wait for it bittfield soothed as jester swung her bows about and the shoreline road and its panting target appeared in the gun ports wait for itttl he squatted to point over the number one ninepounder nein herr bittfield rahl countered from the focsle der mute kanonl middle zir he fanned his hands to mime the spread of shot of a fulldozen barrels carronades and long guns verbreitung der spread bittfield swore under his breath but trotted aft to the waist wiser than the small french garrison the savoians of bordighera had gone to earth or run for the hills above their hardscrabble little town the dusty harbor street down which the infantry pounded among the first shanrylike outlying homes and tiny shops was shuttered and closed not even a dog or curious cat in sight proceed mister bittfield on the uproll bittfield screeched drawing breath for his final shout the mounted officer reined in his horse savagely making it rear once more as if suddenly realizing hed bitten off more than he or his men could chew the rearrank men at the tail of the column the file closest to the low stone boundary markers of the shoreline road suddenly shrank in on themselves looking over their shoulders hunched as pensioners firel it was not over yards from ship to shore when that broadside erupted canister so army artillery texts stated was most effective out to nearly yards and in army usage jester carried the equivalent of three fourgun batteries a battalion of guns the ship shuddered and complained with wooden groans as gun smoke blotted out the view ashore it was an avalanche that swept everything away in a twinkling dust flew low shrubbery wavered and frothed and the stucco fronts of low houses and shops were dimpled and crazed to the brick beneath and roof tiles were flung into the air some in shards or whole precious glass windows shattered wood shutters and awnings disappeared all those screechings and crashings lost in the terrorstricken wailsthe death screamsof the infantrymen who were scythed away plebeian dun stucco was splattered or sheeted with gore the officers horse was flung over a waisthigh fence of a pigsty its riderminus an arm and a legflung the opposite direction and his gleaming sword did a silvery pirouette twirling over and over when the smoke cleared there werent a dozen frenchmen who still stood to stagger blindly away for another long moment all was quiet then the moaning began the panicky yelps and whimpers of the dying as they felt themselves over to discover their mortal hurts reload lewrie barked though his knees juddered as he beheld the enormity and the suddenness of that slaughter roundshot this time mister bittfield aye aye sir the master gunner muttered in awe himself mister buchanon hands to the braces ready to wear about to the larboard tack well circle the harbor until mister knolles has way on the prizes mister porter clew up courses and topsls keep way on her with tgallants jibs and spanker fire on the town sir bittfield inquired from the gun deck those fishin boats no mister bittfield lewrie grimaced no call to ruin the civilians lives unless were fired upon that is andrews heah sah his coxn replied leaving his quarterdeck carronade three prizes and bombуlo to manage take my gig with a full boat crew and row over to join mister knolless party my compliments to him on his quick seizure and he is to get them underway as soon as possible he is to lewrie ordered then paused looking astern he is to lay off the entrance until i join him ill be tending to that damn battery aye aye sah andrews nodded dashing off to gather the men who usually made up the captains boat crew sergeant bootheby lewrie called mister porter join me on the quarterdeck if you please sah jesters mostsenior marine barked in his best paradeground fashion the admiralty put little faith in the abilities of a lowly second lieutenant to lead a shipboard detachment postships got a marine captain with at least one lieutenant as his assistant while vessels below the rate such as jester rated only a senior but experienced noncommissioned officer mister porter lead the cutter and jolly boat around from the stern lewrie instructed full crews for both boats sergeant i would like you to take your men ashore and spike those guns better yet tumble them down the bluff into the sea take powder and oil so you may set their carriages alight too ill send mister meggs the armorer and mister crewe the gunners mate to assist you weve shot most of the garrison to rags i expect so there should be little opposition aye aye sah sergeant bootheby bellowed fiercely pleased to get a chance to shine at something more useful than polishing brass well debark your party as we sail back out toward the bluff five minutes i make it before we let you slip hurry lewrie looked back toward the quay as bootheby assembled troops calling some of them from the guns to dash below and fetch their coats and hats spatterdash gaiters belts and gear knolles had the lines cast off and the first rags of sail were being hoisted andrews with the gig was almost to them and he could see shouted exchanges as his coxn relayed his orders above bordighera some civilians at last showed themselves on the rocky lowshrubbed heights no threat there yet alan thought grimly as he eyed them with his glass no sign of reinforcements or that bordighera had had a larger garrison the crowd grew larger and thinking themselves safely distanced began to wave their fists shout silent imprecations and curses a few mounted men waving swords about in the air though they were dressed as civilians no there were some few men in uniform climbing up to them stragglers from the tartanes he surmised in french navy uniforms what appeared to be a lieutenant leading them no sign of firearms though or not too many he told himself at that distance it would be hard to discern a musket from a manure fork what could they be so angry about he wondered they were savoians conquered by frogs ripped away from their longtime allegiance to sardinia rather a lot of fit young men up there he frowned and them the angriest dont tell me they prefer the frogs he gawped to himself worse than yankee doodles i swear throw off your kings your princes the french cooed stand up and be free men with liberty equality fraternity for all had their blandishments taken root here in tiny sleepy bordighera in spite of how butcherous the french revolution really was how twofaced the real motives were they werent out to liberate europe they were out for conquest and domination as callous and canting well there was holland sensible damned people peaceful and prosperous in point of fact rather a damned dull people the ones he had met yet thousands had been elated to see their nation conquered a batavian republic proclaimed and thousands more had enlisted in the army to fight alongside the frogs what on earth lewrie puzzled it dont make sense the allure the frogs had on people he lowered his glass as the quartermasters steered jester along the western beach crabbing up into the wind and preparing to tack to make a short board across the harbor toward the peninsula and those bluffs where the shattered battery still smoldered the winds were scant as usual and she barely ghosted across her bows lieutenant knolles aboard bombуlo was leading out their prizes toward the entrance channel waving and shouting in glee lewrie counted heads not a single man down no casualties thatd make good reading in his report we could wear off th wind sir buchanon suggested or we could fetchto light as is wind be do we bare a jib or th driver itd be as good as heavin in on a spring line thout anchorin fetchto mister buchanon lewrie decided so we may keep the larboard battery directed at the shoreline road should that mob work up its courage the sight of our guns should daunt em aye sir landing partys ready sir porter reported away the landing party mister porter now he could do nothing but wait oh a dashing captain might go ashore himself that made hellishgood reading in reports too at the admiralty made for good fiction lewrie snorted in derision the plucky aspiring young captain at the head of his troops doing what a junior officer was hired on for lieutenants were expendable and hed been expended or nigh to it often enough in his past to know that now hadnt he under the right circumstances he still might have to exert himself beyond his captains role but if one wished officers in ones wardroom to aspire one gave them first shot at the sharp end of the dirty stick and didnt go about trying to hog all the glory at their expense how else were they to rise without getting their name mentioned in dispatches they usually resented that type of captain a quarterhour of fidgeting and fretting that his plan misfired that he hadnt thought of everything a captains proper duties alan glowered worrying without showing it about french cavalry a battalion appearing over the heights a battery of siege guns that might just be intransit on the coast road toward san remo and pop up to take jester under fire forcing him to sail off or lose her abandoning the marines survivors lurking in the kinky shrubs behind the battery sniping and skirmishing a french warship happening by out to sea espying smoke from the bluff and that damned mob gathering its courage at last smoke curling and wavering over the battery thicker smoke and the red flicker of flames as field carriages wheels limbers and shot and powder caissons were set ablaze a gun barrel manhauled by rope about its cascabel went rumbling down the steep slope of the entrance face to tumble and roll turning muzzleup as the heavier weight of the breech dragged it and trailing a plume of dust gravel and rock behind it as it fell so that it looked as if it reeked powder smoke after being fired a second followed it and with his telescope he could determine that meggs and crewe had done a very thorough job of it trunnions blown or hammered off making it impossible to mount it on a carriage again even should the french recover it from the shoal beneath the bluffs as overburdened as the supply roads already were useless but valuable guns sent back to a foundry to be recast or repaired might be an even greater delay to the french taking precious draught animals from moving things forward lewrie strongly suspected theyd rust out where they lay alongside the detritus of roman triremes till the last trumpet too hard to dredge for or raise bootheby and his marines appeared a slim scarlet snake curving down the bluff road a fife and drum playing a short column of twos tramping in good order with skirmishers thrown out ahead and to botli sides and sailors in slop clothing a shambling blot in the rear a fiveminute march and theyd be at the boats again lewrie heaved a huge sigh of relief it was almost done he turned to look at bombуlo which drifted barepoled about one cable seaward of the channel there was no signal from her that an enemy ship had come into sight either that mob finally they were moving downhill the mounted men leading them nothing like an army it was still a righteous but disordered mob with women and children alongside no fight in them lewrie thought with even more relief they just want a good excuse to shout probably hasnt been this much excitement in bordighera since the crusades he allowed himself to chuckle and along the eastern shore road where the two french companies had been slaughtered hullo there were bordigherans there he started no no threat in them either old women in black a few younger women in gayer gowns some gaffers and kids keening and wailing over the broken dead some of them the wind brought thin screams wails and prayers to jester as civilians raised their hands in supplication beat their breasts and wrenched at their undone hair throwing their heads back to howl like hounds in mourning eyve profeshnal mourners back home beat all hollow sir buchanon grunted as the civilians began to drag off the badly wounded or prop up those lesser hurt and get them to their feet to stagger off crying and weeping with agony might give these local lads a bellyful of war mister buchanon lewrie spat were they of a mind to volunteer before well mourners my eyes sir buchanon said with an outraged snort looters more like look yonder sir sure enough once lewrie raised his telescope again he could see pockets being turned out boots and stockings stripped off the bloody knapsacks being rifled taking his first closeup look at his handiwork lewrie could view horribly wounded men being rolled over so the looters could get at their valuables flailing their hands weakly or screaming in protest shaking their heads to be left alone to die in peace those hands being stripped of rings bloody purses or tobacco pouches torn away from punctured waistcoat pockets urchin children quarreling over corpses and their pitiful wealth like buzzards a few of the younger women honestly grieved and took no part in looting simple little fishingtown girls lewrie thought bedazzled by romantic young soldiers so exotic from so far away bragging about booty and plunder and glory when conquered there were always those whod snuggle up to the victors who could offer power money or food when everyone else went hungry or could offer novel adventure love yet even a few of those weeping young girls had the common sense to pick their dying lovers pockets for mementos or a token of security for their own precarious futures mister bittfield lewrie howled a roundshot over their heads well over mind but scare those harpies off aye aye sir boom went a larboard ninepounder its ball a rising black dashmark aimed with the quoin below the breech fully out a redoubling of the wailing ashore but for their own safety now as they scattered running in all directions skirts hiked up to their knees the shot struck earth a full mile away but they werent to know that again the road was as empty of life as it had been just after the broadside another larger boom atop the bluff as the assembled powder charges and spare kegs exploded another vesuviuslike eruption that flung charred gun tools and carriage timbers into the midmorning sky and a patter of rock and gravel that rained down as far as the marines reembarking on the narrow beach the mob which had been so intent upon reentering their town perhaps advancing toward the battery had also scattered to the four winds bordighera was as devoid of people of a sudden as stonehenge five minutes more lewrie swore pulling out his watch in spite of his best intentions to appear calm and unruffled the boats would be back alongside the people aboard and he could quit this horrible place and he didnt much care if those three tartanes were full of gold bullion he didnt much care for the taste in his mouth all well sergeant bootheby he asked as the last marines and sailors gained the gangway and the boats were led astern for towing once more not a scratch sir bootheby boasted his grizzled bearface glowing with pleasure in a soldiers proper job well done and thank you captain sir from me and all the lads that were a rare treat sir anytime sir were ready anytime damn well done sergeant and aye ill keep that in mind lewrie promised smiling now that they could depart mister buchanon hands to sheets and halliards hands to the braces get sail on her and get us underway once around the point and well offshore set a course for vado bay with pleasure sir buchanon agreed working his mouth as if hed been chewing on something disagreeable too chapter once well out to sea and headed east shepherding their prizes lewrie had hoisted captain repair on board to summon knolles so he could write his report on the action to their surprise knolles had fetched along a french prisoner of war a surly coldly sneering lout in a midshipmans uniform that was a very tight fit so bad that he appeared as if hed stripped a much shorter and slenderer lad for his clothes all out at the elbows and wrists breeches that buckled up above his kneeshad they buckled at all a tall and lanky thatchhair who wore it long and unclubbed to either side of his face like a parted curtain midshipman jules hainaut altogether resembled a very dimwitted peasant just off the turnip wagon whod been clad in some castoff theatrical costume as a jape speaks damnall english of course sir lieutenant knolles said with an apologetic shrug and only a word or two of italian those mostly food drink or something to do with whores so mister mountjoys skills as a linguist might not avail either hes french ive determined but from where god only knows sir hes no french i ever learned a parisian would send him to the guillotine for bad pronunciation however did you catch him mister knolles lewrie asked he was aboard the largest tartane sir the armed one popped off with a brace of horse pistols missed by a mile and dropped to the deck when cony shot back at him knolles laughed easily savoring his small triumph at the quayside rather clumsily at that so the frog committee for public safety or directory lewrie said chuckling appears to have their own bad bargains as does our king aye sir knolles agreed now the prizes mister knolles lewrie urged turning to more rewarding thoughts and dismissing the french midshipman immediately lord sir knolles exclaimed arms uniforms boots packs everything to equip and feed and field two regiments the smaller tartanes are savoian ive determined the larger one is french she carries some fourpounders swivels and a pair of twelvepounder frenchcast carronades sir rather clever mounting foreandaft in the middle of the forecastle and at the taffrail the slidecarriages are built atop a round wood platform which can point in about threequarters of a full circle quite ingenious really pinned through the deck just like a seamortar platform on a small vessel without a lot of standing rigging to impede ones aim sir well she could employ them even closing or fleeing on a bowandquarter line and her cargo lewrie pressed powder made cartouches cartridge paper tents and blankets mostly sir she escorted the others to bordighera i got that much from our french mute but her main load was a company of french infantry to do the training sir half of that lot you erased on the shore road they were raising at least one savoian regiment of volunteers captain with hopes of another do you see knolles crowed himself and we put paid to that scheme sir but her crew lewrie wondered aloud whered they gone when we closed them they could have given you one hell of a scrap oh them sir knolles sneered savoians too for the most part fisherman and such pressed into french service they offered a joining bounty some fraternity cant and gaol as the other option if they didnt uhm willingly volunteer sir even our lout yonder thinks them scum scampered off soon as we sailed in leaving their frog masters to do the honorable thing well weve had ourselves quite a productive morning mister knolles lewrie grinned and hurt the french cause no end your part in it was gallantly carried and ill stress that in my report thankee kindly sir knolles all but blushed thinking it was necessary to appear modest and unassuming lord dont scuff your shoes like a schoolboy mister knolles lewrie genially chided him save that for captain nelson and your patrons just twixt you and me its quite all right to admit youre all the go aye sir knolles grinned lifting his eyes if you say so yon frog tartane mister knolles lewrie pondered shes a bit stouter than our little bombуlo and a tad longer about sixty feet altogether sir knolles supplied cleaner certainly and doesnt reek of fish condemned as a lawful prize shell swing idle for months and then get disarmed and sold out lewrie griped how many fourpounders did you say six sir knolles informed him damme lets keep her and those novel swiveling carronades lewrie decided quickly shift your crew over to her and leave just a barebones crew aboard bombуlo youd best shift our twopounders aboard her too and the swivels thatd be easier than stripping her then rearming bombуlo whats her name by the way la follette sir knolles said snickering the little fool really lewrie gaped with amazement then began to laugh in hearty appreciation most apt the little fool tender to a jester well damme it cant be coincidental dye think god knows sir knolles shrugged but it sounds lucky there it was again that thing of his and jesters luck but perhaps it wasnt coincidental perhaps with her capture his luck and his ships were turning for the better very well mister knolles carry on send me andrews soon as you can cony to serve as your acting bosun five hands for bombуlo same as the other two prize tartanes and we may have enough men to go around till we drop anchor at vado bay its only eighty sea miles or so with this soueast wind we could be there by dusk pray god aye aye sir a late dinner bites taken between writing and fending off his young ramcat who was ever fascinated by the waving plume of his quill pen no toulon sweetlin cant you go play with mousey lewrie attempted to cajole aspinall sir his steward replied from the pantry dangle something tempting will you for gods sake monkeyfist toulon aspinall offered see it swing hey wanna fight yer monkeyfist hey cat toulon would with an excited trill he jumped down to dash for the pantry door where a newish toy of intricately plaited smallstuff swung and jerked alluringly it was aspinalls first successful stab at decorative knotwork a skill he was picking up from andrews there were rather good place mats woven from sennet in the greatcabins now a set of restraining ropes in the pantry where he labored prettily served with turksheads so he wouldnt go arseovertit in the next spell of nasty weather but andrews had done half of those himself as examples crash came the sound of a marine guards musket beyond the door capums dark mister mountjoy sah enter lewrie sighed around a chunk of salami and goat cheese excuse me sir mountjoy said as he entered but i expect youre almost ready for me to make a fair copy of the report from your rough sir just about mister mountjoy glass o chianti aye sir thatd be welcome a tad puckerish is chianti lewrie admitted but it grows on one aspinall a glass for mister mountjoy and a topup for me aye sir a bit of news too sir mountjoy offered that french prisoner mister knolles brought aboard is flemish did as you bid sir tried to speak with him but i do declare sir ive never heard worse french in all my born days but most happily mister rahl the quartergunner happened by mister rahl lewrie posed a trifle dubious rahl couldnt put four words of the kings english together with a pistol pointed at his head the austrian netherlands sir or rather should i say what was once the austrian netherlands mountjoy explained a polyglot sir flemish waloon bastard dutch a version of french as far from good french as birmingham mumbletonian is to english but they do still know the tongue of their conquerors sir german mister rahl was wie gehts and was machts du with the clod quick as a wink sir our msieur hainaut is the usual story these days a prentice seaman from antwerp or thereabouts of french blood sir joined up eager as anything soon as the frogs drove the austrians out bad as the frogs need skilled men they took him on as a petty officer much like mister cony bosuns mate aspinall said almost under his breath back to entertaining the cat after fetching the wine uhm quite mountjoy frowned anyway sir hainaut rose to become a midshipman doublequick acting one might suppose and poorly paid if thats the best uniform he could afford what earned the notice of a senior officer came under his wing patronage lewrie supplied to enlighten mountjoys continuing ignorance oddly he wont tell me who he is sir just refers to him as die narbe rahl tells me that means the scar captain capitaine de vaisseau scar sir might be another german who threw in his lot on the french side but mister rahl believes its more a nickname sir but then german names ive found are much like red indian names holdovers from tribal times when strong arm and bearkiller were popular so it could be a proper name no matter what mister rahl believes i gather this captain scar is in charge of coastal convoys and their escorts mountjoy blithely shrugged off taking a sip of his wine sail hoi came the interruption making lewrie almost tip his glass over later mister mountjoy lewrie said getting to his feet and into his coat and hat and finishing his wine first things first he told himself do you go ahead with the fair copy of the report while i see to this a final pat on toulon s head and he was out the door and pounding up the ladder to the quarterdeck where away mister buchanon three points off th starboard bows sir the sailing master told him pointing an arm in the general direction tgallants bove th horizon so far capum i make us bout ten miles off th coast an bout ten miles east o san remo shes almost bowson sir an that could mean shes on a course t a frenchheld port from somewhere to the soueast then lewrie mused from leghorn to san remo very possible sir might be one o em socalled neutrals ey told us twatch for buchanon agreed check with the signalmanstriker mister buchanon have him fetch out that french tricolor we used off ushant and order lieutenant knolles in la follette to come under my lee im sure he has a tricolor aboard but hell be needing one of our smaller ensigns to declare his proper identity when the time comes a boat ensignll do one aboard bombуlo now sir buchanon reminded him very well have him send a boat for that one lewrie schemed damme mister buchanon were you an italian captain running goods to the frogs what would you make of our motley group be relieved sir buchanon guffawed couple o french warships escortin a threeship convoy long th coast just th thing bettern runnin afoul o one o em nasty englishmen would you be tempted to come close enough to speak them sir were i worried bout any royal navy ships in th area i would sir aye i surely would sail right up an ask fore i put in to san remo might have too much wagered to lose else let us devoutly hope mister buchanon lewrie enthused along with him once weve our flag situation settled well harden up to windward a point as if were standing out to smoak him like what a properly wary escortd do very well sir ill send knolles a quick note tell him to guard the prizes while were gone and what were about and conform to my flag when i show them false colors damme alan swore in wonder again i do believe this could turn out to be a devlish profitable day it could at that sir oh mister rydell lewrie said snapping his fingers at the small lad nip below and order mister mountjoy to come to the quarterdeck and for him to fetch my new goldlaced coat with the epaulet and my full dress hat has the gentleman a sword hes to fetch that from his cabin as well aye aye sir little rydell replied with a puzzled look thankee captain cogburn lewrie thought with a wry grin one of us at least is going to look very convincing to that ship chapter ooh law sah andrews drawled doffing his hat and making a formal leg but don ya look pretty why ah expects dey ain nevah been such a dashin lookin capum in de whole royal navy sah i really mountjoy protested bashfully aware that he was the object of the entire ships amusement sir how can i pose put your hands in the small of your back sir lewrie said beaming frown a lot right mister spenser ats a capums way sir spenser said from the wheel and when you speak do it from deep down in your chest alan further instructed mountjoy and shout shout very loud he said handing him a brass speaking trumpet imagine youve not had a spot of joy your last ten years entire sir or the gout whichever you think makes you the gloomiest begin in french should they wish to switch over to italian ill be right by your elbow prompting you to the proper commands in english so you can shout orders to the crew in frog ill pass them in english through mister rydell to mister porter and the master gunner soft enough so they wont hear me i must say though mister mountjoy lewrie was forced to snicker but you do cut a most dashing and nautical picture uhm sir mountjoy sighed feeling put upon in spite of the necessity for him to be tricked out in lewries best coat and hat and wearing a spare sword borrowed from the gunroom but wouldnt it be best sir to pose as your first officer while no sir lewrie countered that might have been the way in the royal french navy beneath the dignity of a titled captain but a captain come up through the hawseholeu shout his own questions be ready shes within half a league of us practice bein a tartar a loud tartar mind scoggins hoist the french colors aye aye sir the signalmanstriker shouted back hauling at a flag halliard on the mizzenmast with the most powerful glass aboard lewrie could almost recognize the shivers of relief that went through the people on the strange brigs quarterdeck instead of edging astern as she had been to shy away she now resumed her old course straight for them mister knolless hoisted his own false colors sir buchanon said almost in a conspiratorial whisper at lewries side very well mister buchanon thankee lewrie nodded emphatically edgy and fidgety with worry of all that might still go awry it was many a slip twixt the crouch and the leap as caroline ever said her own colors mountjoy drawled out in a regular voice an arm extended to point mean tsay theres her own damn flag at last he amended suddenly gruff and rather loud too in what alan feared was a fairly accurate impersonation of his own style damme do i sound that fearsome he asked himself tuscan sir buchanon identified first and a house flag i dont know lets pray its a house flag lewrie said and not a secret recognition signal theyd tried in the hour that hms jester and the strange brig had taken to close each other to interrogate the french midshipman but hed gone even surlier and more mute once the subject had been broached surely there were signals lewrie thought must be if theyre to approach french forts that could blow em to flinders a godsend for the entire squadron would be the discovery aboard the brig of her codebook which would let them raid any harbor they wished for a time before the french changed the signals wearin sir buchanon grunted two cable up twindward helm alee mister spenser two points to weather close her on tippy toes lewrie told the helmsmen nothing too sudden two points tweather sir andsomely spenser replied chuckling can they hear us yet do you think sir mountjoy asked not upwind of us lewrie scoffed nor in the middle of a jibe mister porter brail up and reduce sail he shouted the rather pretty brig wore her stern across the wind and took in sail herself slowing and sloughing atop her bow wave and falling leeward at a slight angle warily keeping the wind gauge oн jester but approaching to as close as half a cable possibly less shell be fine catch sir buchanon murmured rubbing fingers as if shining a guinea between them a damn handsome thing dark green gunwale over welloiled oak with only a misers pale yellow gloss paint in lieu of a braggarts gilt was the brig rigging was well set up the wood of her yards and lower masts freshly painted in white and her running rigging was almost goldenhemp new lewrie eyed her with his glass estimating her length at around eightyfive or ninety feet just a little larger than their brigsloop speedy and there was gilt on her he noted a figurehead lady was gilded as were the upper beakhead rails and the trim around her quarter galleries a pretty thing he thought and a richly doneun a shout from her quarterdeck as she fell down alee within two hundred yards in french qui va la answer them mister mountjoy lewrie prompted uhm mountjoy quivered nervously coughing and practicing a false basso sounding like a mastiff with a chest cold la corvette emeraude marine de guerre franзais mountjoy said through the speaking trumpet sounding a bit shriller than lewrie might have liked a touch too quavery ici capitaine de frйgate hainaut et vous qui vive il briosco came the wail of a shouted reply en partance pour san remo parlezvous italien rnsieur sil vous plais got you you bastard lewrie hissed with fierce glee should i repeat that to him sir mountjoy whispered from a corner of his mouth with an expression on his phyz that questioned his captains sanity mine arse on a bandbox sir o course not just palaver with em in dago till she drifts a little closer lewrie spluttered and wondered about mountjoys sanity be ready mister bittfield he asks about any british ships in the area mountjoy went on tell him no not this far west lewrie prompted damme howd he know of our ships even beginning patrols so quick lewrie frowned in puzzlement home port he demanded jogging mountjoy in the small of his back leghorn sir mountjoy muttered turning his head a trifle to speak from the side of his mouth again after posing the question thats at least a twoday passage and we only arrived four days ago so lewrie frowned again damme close enough sir the brig had made a little leeway sailing alongside jester while spenser and brauer had been edging the helm over spoke at a time to go up to her there werent a hundred yards between the two hulls wakes creaming slowly their outer wave fronts beginning to mingle astern gun ports open and run out lewrie screeched suddenly true colors aloft marines up up the port lids flew and truck carriages squealed and roared as wood wheels rumbled over oak decks down came the french tricolor to be replaced with the white ensign with the union jack in the canton up the marines bounded from kneeling behind the bulwarks of the starboard gangway half turned muskets at half cock and ready to aim heaveto or i will open upon you lewrie snarled to mountjoy resist and i will blow you to hell tell him mister porter cutter to the starboard main chains muster the boarding party andrews a boat crew four spare sailors and six marines under corporal summerall trotted to the entry port as the cutter was led out from being towed astern mister buchanon you have the deck until my return sir alan instructed mister mountjoy you have my coat and hat ill thank you for em back yes sir uhm could i go with you sir mountjoy pleaded as he stripped to shirt and waistcoat they speak either french or italian sir and their papers will be in italian most likely id do best at translating for you or searching speed us along sir right then come on lewrie nodded retrieving his uniform keep that sword on you but try not to cut yourself thank you sir mountjoy gushed breathless with excitement down they went into the cutter without ceremony clambering on the boarding battens to the chain platform low on the chain wale then timing leaps into the gently bobbing cutter ship starboahd oars andrews snapped toss larboahd shove off bow man and fend off forrud backwatuh starboahd fend off larboahd aft easy all now ship oars larboahd and give us way togethah the brig had let fly all clewing up her courses and topsls her jibs and spanker flogging it was a short row to her and within a minute they were hooked on and boarding lewrie first with a pistol in his waistband and his sword dangling from his right wrist from a leather lanyard four cutlass and pistolarmed sailors next preceded the marines a damn wellkept little brig lewrie thought happily as he saw how clean how navy fashion her decks had been holystoned or swept he waited for his sailors to join him glaring at the crew that gathered near the main cargo hatch and the entry port in her waist they didnt appear much concerned of their capture nor cowed either he thought defiant smug and only a trifle hangdog as if they knew nelsons orders that theyd soon be released aft was a bit of the same story as he paced along the gangway to the brigs quarterdeck helmsman afterguard a couple of men in plain blue coats and cocked hats who were probably the mates and one dapper little fellow with gray hair and a closetrimmed gray beard in a fancier coat and hat he took for the captain two further civilians in the latest fashion one drab in snuffbrown and boots and the last a silken peacock clad in an almost metallicgleaming electric blue and silvertrimmed coat with darkblue velvet cuffs clerk and owner alan speculated signores lewrie stated commander lewrie the jester sloop reggia marina britannico he knew that much italian anyway with me yet mister mountjoy here sir mountjoy replied from his right rear tell these gentlemen that there was a hefty splash from starboard and astern papers sir mountjoy wailed corprl summerall the greatcabins lewrie barked move a sneer on the peacocks face crude grins on the mates and from her captain an attempt to remain bland but a daunting smug look of satisfaction in spite of his best efforts only his lively wee eyes laughed damn them lewrie spat they think this is some bloody game perhaps sir mountjoy confessed softly introduce me tell em theyre prisoners and that were taking this brig into vado bay lewrie sighed bitterly working up the enthusiasm for an air of false bravado and success in spite of them and in spite of his dashed hopes that hed discover just how they knew to fear a british squadron along the genoese riviera so quickly then sir mountjoy asked once hed delivered that news tell em no harm will come to them but theyre to be searched for weapons then confined until we drop anchor officers passengers and crew well search their personal belongings and cabins a muffled bang from below followed by several louder reports what the devil lewrie shouted wheeling toward a ladder to the waist watch em andrews aye sah andrews drawled drawing his pistol and pulling it back to full cock he might not have been tall enough or beef to the heel enough to seem menacing but his feral grin and the unspoken and exotic danger of a darkskinned man with a gun did the trick for him what happened corporal summerall lewrie demanded once hed gained the greatcabins civilian sir summerall reported from rigid attention eyes fixed over lewries shoulder on a cabin door caught im pilin up a mess o papers an such sir drew a pistol sir fired at us returned fire sir no elpin it capum sir he might have been a servant a valet to one of the gentlemen on deck a wiryhaired fellow approaching middle years his hair gray and neatly dressed an aging clerks soft hands and cherubic face but he now lay sprawled between two open chests or traveling trunks amid the blizzard of loose and bound correspondence hed tried to jettison his clothes were quite good much better than a servant usually received as part of his wages castoffs lewrie thought kneeling down no they were too new of good fabric and elegant cut drab gray trousers not breeches but of excellent wool a black waistcoat now torn and gory a fine cambric linen shirt with lots of lace slowly turning rusty red youre a damn fool sir lewrie told him as his eyes opened and his breath which had seemed stopped heaved his chest aaahh he whimpered a trickle of blood appeared along his mouth lung shot or gut shot and goin fast lewrie grimaced who are you sir anyone we should write lewrie offered as he knelt down beside him tell your family familial famille in the little fellow almost chuckled though he was choking on his filling lungs inconnu and with a rictus of a grin he closed his eyes a racking cough the gout of blood that drowned him flooded his mouth dammit lewrie groused sliding back on his knees to escape the last coughed blood inconnu in french sir that is to say i know what it means mountjoy unknown was what the damn fool said lewrie fumed getting to his feet having his last wee jest see his eyes twinkle for a second there means whatever there was worth finding went overboard and he died fore we could interrogate him mightve planned it that way couldnt find the nutmegs to put a pistol to his own skull but he could make us do it for him french agent without a doubt sir mountjoy flatly stated no one sane would kill himself for loss of profit mountjoy looked a little queasy as if he were suffering seasickness again so far there hadnt been much dying aboard jester for him to witness for the young gentleman to wade through hellish business sir still i say corporal summerall was he still trying to gather bundles of his papers as if there was something left to toss into the sea aye mister mountjoy sir saw us dropped em then snatched up at pistol sir summerall reported turned to face them but still speaking to windowsills and the like there is a remote possibility sir mountjoy posed have at it then sir lewrie agreed with a weary air and sir aye that fellow in the snuffbrown sir did you notice notice what mister mountjoy well sir he was the only one of the principals aboard this ship who didnt look pleased when they heard that splash sir thomas mountjoy pointed out didnt look anything stonefaced as a good gambler sir pinched his eyes at the shots for an instant i recall a trace of sadness then back to his pose sir as if he knew thisn was going to die beforehand didnt flinch or jump like the others thats what made me remark him sir well damme mister mountjoy thats lewrie gawped as if toulon had begun forming words and speaking in english thats sharp of you i must say however did you come by this talent of yours a barrister i clerked for sir when i was reading the law he discovered to me certain quirks people have when they give testimony in the dock had he feigned surprise i might have dismissed my first impression of this fellow but mountjoy shyly confessed lead them on with innocuous prattle sir then rock em back on their heels hard with a question they dont expect then read their reactions and since you speak italian and french so well in addition to this most welcome skill of yours mister mountjoy lewrie decided i will put you in charge of not only perusing what remains but of quizzing our prisoners as well especially our snuffbrown friend er thankee sir i think mountjoy all but preened just before he realized how much and how arduous a labor that would be him last i should think lewrie speculated let him stew over what the other missed an admirable idea sir ill see to it lock them all up separate cabins no personal belongings i think would be best these trunks and chests ready for debarking at san remo could you go through them all these two particularly sir this dead fellow seemed anxious to purge just these two open ones mountjoy dared to grin excited again to be useful why just these two his and the snuffbrown mans id wager rather plain good leather but unremarkable hmm nothing as gaudy as those id strongly suspect the fancy ones belong to the elegant gentleman might be the ships owner do you not think sir might have bags of incriminating stuff crammed in his but these got the attention as if this ships problems and theirs were i leave it to you sir lewrie interrupted i have to get way on her sort out her crew disarm and inspect em shuffle hands aboutagain to man all our prizes and such well speak later once were safe and snug in vado bay and knowing too that once his clerk got enthused about something hed talk six ways round whatever had heated his blood and waste the rest of the day watch doing it too manifests lewrie said snapping his fingers delaying his departure for the upper decks bills of lading ships papers crew and passenger lists ill send you mister giles and his jackinthebreadroom to take inventory of the cargo so you may see if it conforms very good sir i mean aye aye sir lawyers lewrie thought pounding up the companionway ladders minds like snakes nests god save us chapter a most gallant action commander lewrie horatio nelson told him waving a hand toward a cutglass decanter of newly arrived claret perhaps a bit beyond our brief to raid a savoian port rather than a genoese but one which has no doubt discomfited the french no end thankee sir lewrie replied making free with that welcome claret and feeling like gods own dammeboy to win praise from a man so aggressive himself and most circumspect of you as well sir nelson went on to confine your findings concerning the merchant brig and your suspicions to a separate report mine and my clerks sir mister thomas mountjoys alan added hed won almost gushing praisethere was enough and more to go around and mountjoy surprisingly had done almost as much as knolles bootheby cony or any of the others hed cited for significant contributions to their overall success too far from the entry door to be able to respond to the musket butt rapped on the deck nelsons next comment was cut off by the knock at the louvred partition door to the daycabin excuse me sir but captain cockburn is come aboard as you bid him lieutenant andrews informed him and is just without ah show him in sir nelson brightened devil of a fellow cockburn took a genoese just off finale bout the same time as your jester was at bordighera lewrie and in much the same mysterious ah here he is come in captain cockburn come in sir do you join us and join us in a glass nelson offered newcome claret captain nelson sir good morning to you lewrie cockburn nodded almost affably especially since lewrie was sporting his newer fulldress coat with the suggested epaulet and slash cuffs small talk was made for a few minutes a review of cockburns doings off finale which lewrie felt politic to beam over lewries doings far to the west over which cockburn raised a brow and simpered almost politely and both of you have taken merchantmen violating our unofficial embargo nelson summed up ships that present to us a most striking and mystifying similarity of circumstances one might initially think that their coinciding similarities were simply that coincidence but i now am coming to suspect that any similarity between them is a first inkling of something planned do you see first off captain cockburn brings in ii furioso a ship of genoese registry all her papers seem to be in order though she was observed departing finale a port that is now frenchheld her captain bavastro and her crew abandon her just as soon as they are able she attempted to prevent meleagers gallant first officer lt thomas hardy from boarding her guns were loaded with canister and langridge and her matches lit hardly the acts of a declared neutral and therefore liable to legitimate seizure laden with valuables too coin gold bullion silver plate and such in her masters greatcabins which are now here aboard agamemnon damme but cockburns a lucky bugger lewrie groaned to himself odd though that so far mister francis drake ashore cannot seem to find anyone who knows her as ii furioso or has ever heard of a ship by that name clearing from genoa more perplexing is the presence of a different name on her transom nostra signora di belvedere horatio nelson posed and mine sirs lewrie exclaimed sitting up straighter il briosco nelson agreed that is to say lively as in a lively tune but bearing the name nostra signora di capraia across her stern of tuscan registry or at least flying a tuscan flag when taken lured in by jester flying false french colors and playacting as escort to a convoy which were really his prizes and tender captain cockburn i strongly hold that only the nearness of ii briosco to her captor and her runout battery and the suddenness of lewries revelation as a british ship which took them all aback prevented them from resisting her guns too were loaded but not runout with langridge and canister nelson stressed lifting a finger one person at least did resist below whom lewrie suspects was a french spy intent upon jettisoning a bag of incriminating documents the man succeeded just as someone aboard ii furioso did commander lewrie as if it were the drill sir lewrie puzzled no it hardly sounds like coincidence at all take him sir cockburn asked shot dead in an exchange of fire with my marines sir alan had to admit theres a second though whom my clerk thinks might be another frenchman traveling under a false identity gave us a name enzio brughera but his companion who called himself inconnu in his dying breath didnt quite empty this brugheras chest there was a purse of italian coinage and a hefty purse of french gold too we found some odds and ends that show at least two more italian names i have him below in irons nelson said i intend to hold him here until mister francis drake may contact some uhm associates more used to this sort of chicanery and out of the hands of the civil authorities sir lewrie added who might feel pressed politically or militarily to set him free or look the wrong way for a minute or two quite nelson nodded grimly while your french midshipman may go ashore once hes given his parole and may be exchanged along with the civilian sailors and those passengers we think are legitimate another mystifying thing sirs lewrie commented is captain menzi of li briosco or our thinggummywhicheverdeparted leghorn two days after we arrived off genoa mole and set off on our blockade yet he knew to inquire about the presence of our ships along the genoese riviera and off san remo why was that that too is intriguing ill grant you nelson agreed with him waving a hand toward the decanter so lewrie could play mother and top them all up well sir cockburn sniffed it is not as if british ships have been completely absent from these waters they were engaged in a smuggling endeavor after all genoese ships might know it is now considered smuggling sir lewrie countered but how did a vessel ostensibly tuscan come to know of it and so quickly that too smacks of chicanery of an organized and wellinformed combination latins nelson chuckled with a worldweary sigh and a raising of his good brow gossip and informing is in their temperaments i do declarebred into their very bones and blood something larger than turning a quick profit or any charitable motive if you will allow me to color it so sirs lewrie continued both of these ships feared the presence of the royal navy not since we just did intend to stop up all coastal trade but because they were engaged in trade with the french sirs someone perhaps a great many someones are eager to aid their cause beyond turning a profit those two agents aboard ii briosco the similarity of the subterfuge then too there is the possibility that influential or simply corrupt people actually believe in the exportation of french republicanism and revolution and would do anything possible long as they may make a fortune from it to aid the frogs undermine their own governments a very large supposition commander lewrie cockburn drawled pulling a face nor one spun from whole cloth but only a few raveled strands as of yet well perhaps the french may pay more than we can offer sir lewrie rejoined all the wealth seized from royalists from guillotined aristocrats the catholic church in france and what they looted from their recent conquests well leave it to the proper authorities nelson decided for them raising a brow slightly as he detected the slightest hints of animus between them we dont have all the facts and cannot discover more from leghorn or tuscany commander lewrie you did recover commercial documents from il briosco which lead you to suspect at least a financial combination he urged il briosco is owned by a leghorn jointstock company much like the east india company lewrie said sitting back in his chair men invest as ships husbands or as riskcoverers such as lloyds sharing the risk and the possible profits its called the compagnia di commercia mare di liguria rather confusing though neither my clerk nor i can make heads or tails of it so far sirs captain menzi is shown as a shareholder in some papers just a hired captain in others the supercargo aboard a signore gallacio admitted hes a shipowner not a shareholder yet theres an inscrutable little ledger book mister mountjoy turned up that shows several people or organizations and their share of the profits of the ships voyage theres a gg which i take to stand for guilio gallacio the rest are just initials and no telling what they really mean sir i find it odd though for a tuscan company to call itself a ligurian seatrading firm we are in the ligurian sea sir cockburn snorted liguria is also the ancient roman name for the entire coastal region sir north of leghorn or porto especia were they really a tuscan concern sir why did they not use their own sea the tyrrhennian or the entire mediterranean to describe their intended trading area another matter for mister drakes associates commander lewrie nelson suggested after inquiries may be made in tuscany should it be registered proper the names of the major stockholders will be revealed to us and if some of those majority owners turn out to be genoese or agents representing genoese investors then we may be able to say that it is without a doubt an illegal combination and most likely such an inquiry may also reveal the names of ships to be on the lookout for cockburn said with a sly chuckle a tap of his finger against his temple with such information we may concentrate on the largest bestorganized smugglers their capture or elimination from the trade would daunt the smaller players were their ships to be seized often enough theyd throw in their hands as a poor wager if it is merely financial and not political sir alan said unwilling to concede the point on principal certainly because he still suspected the presence of french agents hinted at something dangerous and hating to give the smug bastard the last word in anything i daresay lewrie cockburn allowed with a bemused expression that there is the possibility of the french being involved taking full advantage of the greed or the humane efforts of the genoese to aid their occupied compatriots anything to undermine resistance in italy but as i also said before we simply do not know enough to take a leap of logic into the speculative i see sir lewrie relented a bit truculently it must be said resenting being lectured to by a man ten years his junior but i will lay a wager with you this very moment sir he added with a sly grin that when we do come to discover all there will be french collusion and french gold at the root of it name your sum sir five hundred pounds cockburn grinned back just as slyly sufferin jesus alan thought his mind awhirl now im for it even if the prize court came through with what im due id still be bankrupt if im wrong borrow it from phoebe no gentlemen really nelson chided them with the affable and amazed tone of a father interceding between two headstrong brothers make it a shore supper or a case of wine and the terms are vague of course the french are involved whether they are the instigators or the recipients of a fortuitous accident which they hope to exploit hardly a proper wager at all really it lacks the either or a shore supper then sir lewrie amended that it is the full cabal set up by the frogs and i say they are exploiting the greed of misguided shortsighted tradesmen cockburn countered aye a shore supper done lewrie cried offering his hand to seal the bargain done and done then nelson laughed well i think thats about it we must suspect a formal organized attempt to trade with and succor the french the valuables suggest that il briosco had a full cargo of flour salt boots and shoes what else about a ton of tanned leather sir suitable for harnesses or belts and pouches lewrie was happy to supply castoff military accoutrements sail cloth suitable for tents blankets and quite a lot of naval stores salt meats sausages and salami cheese and all the rough wine in the world which will fetch a pretty penny at mister drakes sales nelson beamed rising to dismiss them and deny the french any joy of it i think that will be all until we know more gentlemen thank you both for coming aboard and sharing your information with me and with each other hmm so you may cooperate in future more attuned that wasnt a hope that was an order lewrie almost winced stay a moment commander lewrie there is one other matter nelson directed before they said their goodbyes aye sir he prompted once cockburn had gone the matter of your tender sir nelson said squinting over his report impatiently turning for the best light in the greatcabins for his one good eye this little bombуlo quite a good idea most ingenious of you though you were damned fortunate against such odds thank you sir lewrie smiled glad it wasnt to be a tonguelashing for being at odds with cockburn i fear youll have to keep her nelson said soberly this la follette betterarmed i grant you and a valuable seizure but she is a french ship of war little or no and must be properly condemned then bought into the royal navy before i could possibly condone her addition to our squadron i see sir lewrie sighed there are certain customs and usages of the fleet that even i cannot ignore no matter the situation do you see lewrie captain nelson laughed softly only so many orders i may flaunt or act contrary to no i am sorry but she must go to san fiorenzo our admiral may wish to inspect her unique carronade armament that she is armed with carrуnades at all in the first instance and the novel training platform beneath them in the second and after all i doubt if you would wish to give up your first officer mister knolles sir you would you know were she taken in or sent off shes a lieutenants command not merely a tender to another ship nelson told him could i condemn her myself and buy her in well i fear there are other lieutenants senior to mister knolles more deserving of command and were she a part of this squadron this instant i would assign her to work inshore with meleager inconstant or southampton allowing one of the deepdraught frigates a shallowdraught companion i fear you must recover your swivels and twopounders from la follette and rearm bombуlo you can tow her astern ready for another bold raid on the french but you cant come nigh to hoisting your own broad pendant as an exofficio squadron commander with her your consort oh well sir lewrie shrugged sheepishly putting a good face on it i trust though that the prize money from her capture mollifies you lewrie nelson offered by way of condolence should the court ever see their way clear to paying it sir lewrie reminded him then aye i spose it must aye those nelson seethed for a moment i tell you sir i am determined to become an admiral to have say in matters redress so many shortcomings prizecourt doings not the least of them but he said coming around his desk to steer lewrie to the door of his daycabin until then there is the satisfaction that you did your duty as best you saw it with aggressiveness pluck and daring and more than your own portion of good fortune confounded french recruiting perhaps certainly destroyed a battery a garrison and took those coasting bottoms theyll sorely miss and captured a french national ship into the bargain this fellow who runs their convoys must this very instant be tearing out his hair in frustration confusion to the french sir lewrie boasted amen to that sir nelson exclaimed as a sendoff amen to that now off with you lewrie recover your tender and well be off about the kings business perhaps not quite so far as cape antibes hmm a little closer to home a daily cruise west returning to read my signals mister drake suggests a large convoy soon a rich one aye aye sir lewrie heartily agreed scour the coast for me lewrie and good hunting chapter you the scarred man sneered his permanently scrubpink complexion mottling with an anger so fatal it could have killed just by itself straight across the desk in the greatcabins of the french national corvette la vengeance vengeance was at anchor in the port of nice but a southerly a sirocco blew into the harbor making the agile ton corvette do an edgy dance which didnt do lt henri becquets attempts at composure any good either as he suffered the welldeserved tirade as lt henri becquet attempted to find a way to wriggle free of responsibilityand the threat of courtmartial and the guillotine france did not suffer its fools gladly had no use for failure or excuses for it you the scarred capitaine de vaisseau hissed again he partially hid his brutally scarred face with a black silk mask an eye patch that extended upward to cover a brokenlined brow downward to hide a cheek that had been slashed to the bone there was no disguising though the tyrannical mouth the upper lip and part of a nostril that had been savaged and crudely sewn making him an offset harelip you stupid goddamned fooll he thundered idiot msieur lieutenant becquet shivered so violently that his teeth chattered his very life depended on the next few moments suspended in midair at the end of a figurative single skein of light thread and le hideux the one with the razor blade perversely becquet cast a glance to the civilian aft near the transom windows who was a dark brooding shadow against the midday glare le hideux was showing off performing for the civilian becquet suspected covering his own failures with a spectacular rant if the civilian was down from paris to inquire why the convoys failed so often so much was lost what can you do the senior captain asked the ether with a soft toss of his hands and a look toward the deck head he rose and paced slowly his weakened left calf supported by a stiff knee boot reinforced with an iron brace clump shuffle clump shuffle and lieutenant becquet began to sweat an icy flood as le hideux approached him here is the very sort of laziness i continually fight against citizen he said to the civilian for his benefit and his own idiots fools shit for brains oh they spout all the right slogans cheer when you tell them citizen pouzin as if halfhearted enthusiasm for the revolution was enough nestce pas but deep in their souls they stay shop clerks open on time pretend to work then run for the cafйs or the brothels as soon as the door is shut for the evening without a thought of working without a care for anything but their comforts clump shuffle clump shuffle behind becquet who kept his gaze straight ahead at the silhouetted citizen pouzin pleading with his eyes and expecting a dagger in his kidneys a gun captain did you know that citizen pouzin le hideux sneered from the garonne where they do not understand the sea a river man a gun captain who turned against his aristo masters when he saw which way the wind was blowing when we broke up that elitist naval artillery corps that pack of bootlickers becquet turned on them to save his hide hein so he could have his soup and bread a ready supply of coin only for his wine and his whores got promoted because he shouted the loudest so he could make even more money to waste on wine and whores le hideux accused shouting into the lieutenants ear so close that spittle from his ravaged lips bedewed becquet as cold as antarctic ice crystals capitaine i did my duty i too hard a task was it becquet le hideux scoffed too much to ask to unload the cargo as soon as you got to bordighera even if you had to work past closing time hein but you had time you docked at dusk answer oui capitaine just at dusk but the savoians let the infantry company go ashore instead of ordering them to help unload le hideux growled stumping back into his sight i ordered you to unload quickly did i not dash in dash out before a bloody patrol saw you so that the convoy would be safe so those savoian volunteers would get their arms and equipment a direct order and an important task which you nodded and parroted back to me did you not here in this cabin becquet swore on your honor youd fulfill to the letter hein oui oui capitaine but thought one puny threegun battery of light fieldpieces would be protection enough did you for ships in your charge to protect your lazy hide were you aboard la follette when the bloodies opened fire on the battery certainment capitaine becquet declared liar citizen pouzin asserted calmly snapping becquets head around a letter from your midshipman hainaut oui hainaut le hideux chimed in not four days since his capture and we already have a letter he sent asking for his exchange he at least did his duty you were not aboard where were you in bed with a whore up in the town a whole half hour they took before the battery was silenced were you so taken with wine that you needed a whole half hour to wake up a half hour becquet a real man would have mustered his crew sailed out and supported the battery with the guns you had aboard la follette you could have deterred them entering but what did you do with that precious time nothing the crew they ran off capitaine i tried to muster them not run off citizen pouzin countered coming closer you gave them shore leave for the night how convenient they didnt come back i becquet almost swooned in fear some did i brought them from the same brothel where you wallowed le hideux scoffed the bloody corvette entered and the few whod stayed or the few whod come back with me they hainaut had mustered them for you le hideux accused hainaut had sense enough to load the artillery to load the artillery do you hear citizen pouzin the guncaptains guns were unloaded were they even loaded for the voyage you idle fool we drew the charges once we tied up accidents new allies convenient pouzin whispered coming close enough from those harsh shadows at last so becquet could see him a squarecut hefty man quite handsome in a roughandready way with a blunt chin and a square head all business perhaps capitaine too much so all you had thought for was a bottle or two a good supper and a plump whore wasnt it becquet le hideux snapped crew let go for the night so they could have a good easy time of it with you so they would like you perhaps a bit too much libertй йgalitй fraternitй hein citizen pouzin lifted a bushy brow at that statement a french officer was supposed to be no better than the commonest man beneath him due no more dignity there was supposed to be brotherhood among them a true comradeship in the service of the cause time enough for that when the voyage is over when you had completed your mission le hideux added in a softer voice pouzin was in charge of intelligence and had as many connections in paris as did le hideux as many ears into which he could pour poison against him then and only then he continued glaring at pouzin to show how heartfelt were his sentiments and how innocent may you let your guard down had you lost your ship in battle id be kissing you on both cheeks becquet had you hurt the bloodies gotten the cargo ashore it would have been bad luck bad timing their arrival but but it seems such a total lack of diligence and caution we might be able to think of it as treachery pouzin challenged in his gruff maddeningly calm voice how else may we explain the suddenly foolish actions of a man so well regarded just weeks ago with such a diligent able and unblemished record in the republican navy msieur oh god i citizen pouzin corrected with a warning hiss now your savoian hands have run away and will never come back hein le hideux summed up goading becquet with a cruel leer the savoians delayed training and arms when they seemed so eager to join us a brave french garrison turned to blood soup a valuable company of experienced battlehardened officers and men who would have trained them lost how much enthusiasm for military service do you think the savoians have now hein there is no doubt word has spread deep into the mountains of how inept french warships of how ludicrous the french army look and its all your fault dear god sir becquet whimpered almost pissing himself but you will atone for this mon pauvre petit gun captain le hideux promised in a caressing whisper that whisper more threatening than his loudest rants oh indeed you will on your head be it sir by the authority given me by the committee of public safety le hideux intoned stumping away to lean on his desk to rest his leg i order you be held in irons until the time of your trial by courtmartial where you will answer charges of grave dereliction of duty cowardice in the face of the enemy the loss of your command without a shot being fired the loss of your convoy and their cargo and treason against the republic pouzin tacked on heaving a huge shrug trafficking with the enemy and conspiring to there was a thud as becquets wits left him and he swooned to the deck a spreading wet stain on his trousers at five this afternoon le hideux grunted guards take this cowardly scum away a foregone conclusion pouzin sighed heading for the cabinet to pour them both glasses of wine a court packed with officers and men of sound republican revolutionary spirit of a certainty le hideux agreed wincing as he sat down to rest that continual dull ache that had been his burden the past nine years the bastard whod cut him with his sword laying his face open had also slashed his left calf after he was down and disarmed writhing and howling with agony pour encourager les autres citizen the grand revolutionary thomas jefferson he said that the tree of liberty must be watered with the blood of patriots i water it with the blood of fools and cowards of shop clerks so the others might become true patriots even if they come to their patriotism from fear you see what i contend with hein citizen pouzin the idleness the thoughtlessness i endure i am surrounded by incompetence and lackluster pinheads what i would give for just a few more bretons here a few more with the hardy seafaring courage of the ancient celts pouzin rolled his eyes bored that le hideux was harping upon his favorite theory hed heard quite enough of it in the full year theyd cooperated together most warily cooperated that is neither was superior to the other running their separate operations in parallel sometimes at crosspurposes sometimes hand in glove and writing to paris to their own superiors and patrons of a certainty reporting on each other they were both in the same business really this horrid little deformed ogre le hideux and pouzin the spy if pouzin was indeed his right name that of seeking out defectors traitors failures and fools such as becquet of inspiring the others to keep the ardent flame of passion for the revolution alive in every breast to weed the unworthy the lazy the smugly satisfied so that france so threatened from without and quite possibly within such as in the vendee where resistance still sputtered might survive then march to the ends of the earth to spread her glorious doctrines if that took a thousand bad bargains and traitors to the guillotine et alors pouzin thought philosophically and the brutal logic the innate sense of the breton peasant le hideux sighed in longing not these shortsighted citybred he took a sip of wine to cool his melancholia i envy you pouzin the zeal and dedication of the people who work for you do you ever face a different sort of worry capitaine pouzin chuckled i worry about who is loyal who is lying to me of which reports can i trust and which are made up to please me to earn my gold who works for the other side or both but thankfully no no lack of zeal it is far too profitable to them and for the good ones too much fun a good spy thoroughly enjoys his work now then the rest of the bad news this ship that raided bordighera your hainaut tells us quite innocently in his letter to the parole commission that she was named jester even worse she took one of the ships we arranged off san remo aboard were two of my best agents returning from leghorn one is dead the other a captive thats bad le hideux commiserated but far west of where we expected this embargo to reach in a backwater had your people in genoa told us this i would definitely have provided escort within fifty sea miles of the coast though my few poor ships are stretched so thin he added to excuse himself pouzin could smell a brave but exculpatory report to paris his and le hideuxs i grant you pouzin allowed and i sympathize with your lack of suitable warships yethe posed with another gallic shrug two ships lost le hideux rasped running a hand over a rough and patchy beard and short mustache hed grown to help disguise his injuries another taken off finale again where my vessels dare not go except in squadron strength our principals in genoa and leghorn are upset that our mutual arrangement unravels so quickly pouzin gloomed there are so many other ships naturally but the captains and crews must take even more risk now and one of our tuscan principals was temporarily detained he is not a man of stout courage it will take more gold he writes he is robbing us and he knows it le hideux spat a chance encounter off san remo an idiot who should have put back into finale under the protection of the castles guns as soon as he saw a bloody frigate two out of dozens the vagaries of war which they agreed to happily the bulk of the goods messages and money get through certainment capitaine pouzin quickly agreed certainly le hideux was ruthless a monster in human guise but hed been successful enough to keep his commandand his headthis long grain from north africa coastal convoys that lost ships also of a certainty but mostly delivered the goods to support the advance of the army and allow pouzin to maintain his farflung spiderweb but with the british squadron in vado bay and our army threatened by de vins a greater effort is called for no matter the cost get me hainaut back le hideux said of a sudden hes not a breton but hes of the ancient blood of the belgae in his head he has information we need pouzin hes been in vado bay aboard this jester he may be only a midshipman now but hes paissan connard a wily one a cunning one he has a great future hes counted their guns can tell us of their ships their schedules but we know them pouzin countered he could not relate what his latest secret letter from genoa hinted from one of their principals aboard ii briosco that hainaut had been taken so easily so clumsily that the bloody sailors laughed at him a cunning peasant yes he was pouzin was sure cunning enough to have a very strong streak for selfpreservation a sixtyfourgun ship of the line three frigates a pair of what we would call corvettes a pair of brigs of war a brigsloop of fourteen guns and a cutter we know the ships yes pouzin but not the men who command le hideux demanded hainaut will know to listen and learn to probe and discover their faults you will get him back quickly i will get him paroled pouzin promised it was easier than saying no though how long it might take there are midshipmen of equal value from the berwick admiral comte martin took in his initial trv against them but now theres a head that should tumble into the basket pouzin le hideux sneered tossing back his wine and reaching for another a coward and a fool who abandoned зa ira and censeur another becquet another timeserver another shop clerk hainaut is ten times that martins worth at least he is dedicated and zealous you dont see do you have i not told you of the ancient chinois general sun tzu the man who knows his enemy as well as he knows himself will never be defeated especially if he knows himself best of all what are their faults their strengths their vices their weaknesses what have we learned about them so far i ask you that was an indictment of pouzins intelligencegathering and could not go unanswered a fair amount capitaine pouzin retorted baring his teeth we know that this nelson took both зa ira and censeur traded fire with alcide before she blew up he was a favorite of hood led the battle line both times martin fought hotham a very aggressive man our principal met him when he represented hood in genoa last year and was highly impressed a little fellow a bit frail watch out for the little ones pouzin the minnikins have more ambition than most le hideux cackled he will be vaunting brave perhaps too ambitious and eager for glory ah ha the frigate inconstant pouzin went on proving his worth to le hideux and hating every minute of justifying himself to such a hideous fellow her captain fremantle dull dogged quiet capable but inarticulate a follower le hideux dismissed a gundog the others the one off finale meleager her captain cockburn is a young man a minor aristo from lower scotland very prim and proper but his family rich i dont know pouzin intoned the phrase he hated most of all a rich aristo will be smug easily satisfied a poor one will be all ambition and nosehigh airs too proud to listen to anyone hes lucky once but again go on tell me of this jesters captain a commander in his early thirties she has eighteen cannon on her main deck ninepounders carronades of course they all seem to have them almost doubling their armament she was a french corvette once sans culottes taken off toulon after the bloodies but you dont know his identity le hideux purred not yet he has not set foot in genoa so no one but your midshipman hainaut has seen him so far pouzin sighed in surrender it appeared that he would have to get hainaut exchanged and as quickly as possible after all we know little more about her an agent from calviwhen we still had communications with himreported jesters arrival at san fiorenzo last june or july as i recall i dont have my records with me i doubt that agent is willing to make inquiries now since corsica is occupied getting a letter to him is almost imp try genoa first i know the bloodies theres nothing they like more than a stroll ashore an invitation to a supper or a ball a coupling with a whore you can arrange that pouzin of course capitaine pouzin agreed with a tiny smile poxed or otherwise oh the bloodies so many of them are already poxed look at how little effect it had after their long stay at leghorn le hideux chuckled i want to know who he is what hes like so i can lay the trap that kills him pouzin hes dangerous this one whoever he may be hes hurt our cause made us look like fools le salaud intrigant made you look the fool pouzin thought his face a stony mask i will move the squadron east pouzin le hideux announced suddenly i must our presence at sea must be seen by the savoians and our unwitting traders hein escorted convoys pouzin hoped aloud we must le hideux growled else we risk losing more ships more supplies which the army needs so badly and soon before de vins masses his austrians or the genoese at last find a scrap of courage we must both use our influence or our threats against toulon to force martin to give me the strength i need he hoards corvettes and frigates refuses me any of the trained men or experienced officers i need yet expects me to work miracles with my castoffs and converted merchantmen here here is where the navy should be pouzin facing the bloodies with a large squadron under my command four of our little armed tartane expedients could never outgun or outfight one british frigate yet how dare they sneer when we fail if we wish to defeat the austrians and guard our borders they must release to me the proper ships at last i cannot face this embargo otherwise well there is a way perhaps to weaken it pouzin hinted coyly while you prevail upon toulon to send more warships jester fired a shot over the heads of those looters who were desecrating our brave soldiers but can we not allege that the damage to their buildings came from an indiscriminate broadside against bordigheran civilians that this british ship fired on innocent helpless villagers hein we both know the bloodies have no real love for savoians or the genoese they mean to exploit them use them in the most cynical manner to uphold rich aristos and landowners at the poor peoples expense a broadside of our own a paper broadside hein might make infuriating reading in genoa a slaughter on the docks too when the poor people came down to save their town from being burned to the ground i see le hideux nodded his eyes widening with the possibilities but he countered with a petulant air they might send this jester away from the coast put her at patrol duties far out to sea where i cannot reach her with the force i now have a jester took my little fool at bordighera but i will not be this mans fool pouzin i will not laugh at his jests he must pay oui we must weaken the embargo and embarrass the bloodies if it takes your lies to do it et alors but it is bloodless the italian states must see british blood for french blood we must have victories to boast of so they come to fear us or admire us we must be seen able to punish this jester dont you see le hideux insisted his eyes bulging and a livid purplered cast coming to his scars in a flushed ginger face and you will aid me in arranging it le hideux concluded with the sureness of the delusional demented a hid pouzin began to say but checked himself a titanic task he amended too late le hideuxs good eye had slitted in black fury no one but hainaut had ever been able to mention his maiming without suffering for it die narbe he named him in admiration and a respectful jest something pouzin was not allowed would never be allowed too many slips of the tongue like that and pouzin would pay with his head on the block beneath the blade one day pouzin flinched a trifle though he meant to stare calmly turn bland and innocuous since his first sight of le hideux brutto faccia die narbe however men called him hed felt ice water trickle down his spine in dread of him had felt his coulles shrivel up inside his groin and had felt his stomach turn in utter loathing of the outward appearance as well as the soul within i will compose the rumor at once capitaine pouzin swore and get it off east and arrange for jesters captain to be studied hainaut to be paroled and exchanged for someone off berwick and you still plan the convoy to alassio i must make arrangements for them to meet it pouzin ticked off trying not to sound rushed though he felt a tremendous urge to be away from the poisonous little monster you will extend your escorts east to protect this convoy and offer battle to the bloodies hein oui le hideux confirmed his remaining eye hooded with venom au revoir then capitaine au revoir citizen le hideux snapped coldly it was quite a clever plan the hideously scarred captain mused and hainaut s testimony to an alleged massacre once hed been coached on what he was to remember would be even more official and convincing citizen pouzin indeed was very good at what he did and being master of an intelligence ring was most likely as great a delight to him as the deadly game was to his minions a tireless and clever worker one totally dedicated to furthering the revolution look what samuel adamss lies about the boston massacre had started even if he had been a commercial importerexporter from lorient before the terror and a minor representative in the fledgling assembly an elevated shop clerkand a nattering lawyerle hideux glowered a rich man as exalted as any aristo pouzin was not to know it but le hideux had already discovered his true identity through his own intelligence network of informers and collaborators minor functionaries of local or naval committees and a host of officials in the ministry of marine there were skeletons in pouzins closet some royalist sentiments in the family a cousin conveniently sent to boston and pouzins attempt to purchase a title back in of the old calendar someday le hideux was sure he would use that information to damn pouzin if he persisted in ogling him like a carnival monster or sneering behind his back at his mutilation not anytime soon though le hideux sighed a new guard was taking over the original patriots being supplanted deposed or guillotined after show trials and the unctuous lawyers and bien йlevй schemers were now in the saddle no better than the haughty aristos theyd helped kill the professional politicians le hideux sneered it is ever thus men who thought him an ogre too a frightening crippled toad who rose in the patronage of the giants of the revolution that theyd replaced a time to lie low he decided to escape their notice and to give them such a military and naval success that his witchfinding activities for the original rebels could be conveniently forgotten when genoa became theirs he could become their scourge a shabby but useful tool for the sneering arrivistes and take his chances thered never been a time when he hadnt felt like a tool an implement to be discarded safer perhaps to have remained a breton peasant in the fisheries with his father he might have come to own three or four luggers by now but still go home each evening to a drab and limited village cottage stinking offish and shiny with their scales the ambitions his father had that he had had he could have become a priest a pampered sycophant of the aristos even without a cassock the jesuits had taught him much had declared him to be a wondrous pupil had they not introduced him to machiavellis writings how apt a preparation the jesuits and their coldly calculating logic had been to him to ready him for the time when he was better to be feared than loved his acceptance into the old royal french navy the best he had been allowed since getting into the glorious old aristocratic armйe was impossible for a fishermans son the sneers and jibes there too as the smelly fishmongers boy the dirtyarsed coastal peasant hed risen though by doing their dirty work by being better than anyone else by taking on the tasks the idle aristos wouldnt or couldnt but successful though hed been until his downfall in the far east hed been their despicable tool a brute instrument best kept on the orlop until needed then cast him aside with a pittance for a disability pension as soon as hed made them pay all those who had sneered at him derided him passed him over so some simpering frailty with a weak chin but a perfect lineage could advance revenge had been so sweet and their terror so savory when theyd beheld his new appearance hed hunted them down with the diligence of a starving ferret clawing his way into a henhouse found them denounced them no matter how secure they were in the new order along with the aristos who truly deserved the guillotine the weak the foolish the idle no despite the appalling risk he ran to remain in power even at the gall of his soul to remain the tool of more powerful men the power was heady tried in the fire hed beenby his failure and all the years hed suffered the jeers and curses in the streets the urchins who taunted him and imitated his limp or ran screaming at the sight of himfor the fun of it now he knew how to use his hideousness to terrorize in making handsome men jump when he gave an order or shiver like an aspic with a single glare and the women the ones whod turned away crossed the street and crossed themselves for luck against him even whores whod laughed him to scorn or refused his trade well hed hunted down a few of those too and their families and made them pay their comeuppance in his cells before their trials and beheadings fear was a wonderful aphrodisiac fear of his physical person and fear of his power greater and more coercive than mere political power more brutal and direct to get what he wanted no woman anywhere in france could dare refuse him now and those officers wives and daughters oh yes the daughters best what a thrill it was to have them without the mask candles lit so they must see him so he could savor their revulsion the stomachchurning shame and horror on their faces all so he might spare their husband their father from the guillotine indictment or denunciation the perverse duties theyd performed weeping to keep them alive only the prettiest now only the slimmest most graceful and youngest as long as he held on to his power he could enslave an adolescent for months keep her father in chains all that time until hed tired of her and his preordained but delayed sentence was hardly jesuitical he thought with a leer dragging pen and ink to him there must be a letter to toulon no longer begging for ships but demandingthreatening if he failed for lack of support they would go down with him those timeserving timorous shop clerks a set of orders to ships of his squadron to escort the alassio convoy a letter to the captain of la resolve a corvette only victualing at nice to consider himself permanently attached bayard a devilishly handsome rogue who knew better than to sneer or gape but bayard le hideux pondered what tale had he told him etienne he shouted for his clerk oui capitaine the careworn little nonentity quavered at the door leaning in as if scared to be alone with his employer something nags at me etienne le hideux replied distracted two things you have a retentive mind perhaps you may recall early last summer reports from citizen pouzin regarding the arrival at san fiorenzo of a british ship named jester all engagements or sightings mentioning identified bloody ships since the fall of bastia or at least before calvi surrendered search my files and find it secondly capitaine bayard told us a tale at dinner from his time with the brest fleet something concerning a british vessel that he witnessed do you remember his story no sir sorry etienne stammered ever in fear of failing his master of paying for it y you might do best to ask of bayard sir the other though jester something akin to le bujfon or le plaisantin i do recall that i think around the time the convoy to calvi was lost he dared remind le hideux of that debacle oui find it vitel le hideux glared so fiercely that clerk etienne went quite pale and fell on his knees before a large chest of documents and reports hands shaking and palms wet it took several long minutes for him to produce all the while aware of the scratching of the senior captains quill then the drumming of his fingers on the desktop after hed finished his letters and was waiting voilа capitaine etienne sighed with relief in lieutenant de mallerets report from la flиche the british ship she fought when lieutenant michaud was slain was jester he saw it on her transom salaud intrigant le hideux exclaimed with an inward hiss of air the meddlesome bastard the ship that had taken his convoy at bordighera the british ship that had savaged la flиche and taken another convoy killed a promising fellow malouin a breton champion lieutenant michaud they were the same oui capitaine quel dommage send for bayard i must know what his story was about there was a name he mentioned but le hideux ordered seething this one this jester we must destroy her etienne and her captain too this i vow whoever he is i will eat his brains and shit in his skull oui capitaine etienne nodded mouth agape hed never seen this gingerhaired ogre this angry not even when presiding at a trial of an aristo trial he thought a good excuse to become scarce ah i have the charges drawn up for your signature capitaine becquets oui give them here etienne once youve sent to la resolve for bayard finish searching all the files for any further mention of this jester i must know her him pouzin promises but i cannot wait on him le hideuxbrutto facciadie narbehe went by an entire host of sobriquets none of them flattering or reassuring he dipped his quill and signed becquets fate charges and expected sentence citoyen guillaume choundascapitaine de vaisseau chapter a bestsilkstockings evening lewrie elated all tricked out in lowcut shoes and breeches and his best full dress feeling the winds though after getting used to slop trousers or his londonmade hessian boots with the gold braid and tassels his shoes it must be admitted as well as his conscience were pinching him sore letters come from caroline and from phoebe in the same post and held aboard agamemnon for jesters return to vado bay fond and loving devotion from caroline now quite recovered as gay as larks at being able to ride their acres again of how glorious was an english country summer how desperately she missed him and would never withhold vital information from him again a note from sewallis replete with paw prints from his dogs a scrawl from hugh and and from phoebe such desperate longing tearful phrases words of love and devotion too dammit chatty newsy delightful as if a light touch might cajole him into believing their relationship had never suffered a grounding time and distance from her had caused him to forget just how delightfully cheery she really was her use of english had grown so skillful that he might have imagined minus news of children of course that the signatures of wife and mistress were interchangeable that either missive could have come from the other a welcome and diverting amusement nelson had promised them so he had scrubbed up shaved and donned his best for a night ashore in genoa as welcome guests of a very influential and powerful member of their senate one extremely close to the doge himself genoa was indeed more distracting and impressive than naples and lewrie had been most impressed by naples every other house was a magnificent palace he could have sworn each one richer and grander than the last in a merchant city that had been rich as far back as julius caesars times and had hoarded and multiplied its vast seaborne wealth ever since surely he thoughta sailor would find warm welcome in genoa their hosts palace was truly magnificent if a bit overdone gilt coinsilver solid gold gewgaws silk wallpaper silk hangings crystal chandeliers ablaze with two hundred or more beeswax candles at a time precious everything in sight was precious rare priceless including the clothes of the guests their jewels and fripperies bareshouldered ladies bodices half exposed the heat of candles and too many bodies gusted the confined night air fanned overly sweet or musky scents of hungary water gentlemens cologne or ladies perfume over him like a levanter along with the dry talc aroma of face powder or hair powder the tang of rouges and pastes and admittedly a sour reek of past and present perspiration from those expensive suitings or gowns and the poor toilette or bathing habits of the rich and noble a bit offputting certainly but a flower bed compared to the odors of a warship full of men nelson and his lt george andrews cockburn and his thomas hardy lewrie and knolles along with a gaggle of midshipmen from their respective ships were led down the receiving line by mister francis drake their sovereigns representative to genoa a grossly untidy man who appeared most unlike what a kings agent should be nelson had wondered if he was even an english gentleman lovely place cockburn commented his town palace drake muttered swiveling about like an illtempered bear as if looking for a place to spit it was rumored that he chewed you should see his real one up in the hills tremendous estates owns half of the republic damn near quite handy place for him to leave the wife and kiddies really cockburn drawled with a dubious note in his voice quite small in comparison this pile drake tittered with a rogueish nudge in cockburns ribs tis said hes a mistress cached in either wing rough life hey captain ah here we go then ahum cockburn sniffed in displeasure as he was left astern as they queued up to be introduced drake did the honors in passable italian with their host the genoese senator marcello di silvano further allow me to name to your excellency commander alan lewrie captain of hms jester commander lewrie our distinguished host drake simpered like a mastiff after a bone your servant sir alan offered in his best social purr signore comandante benvenuto marcello di silvano replied in a deep cultured basso he was for a senator of a republic that gave at least lip service to electing its leaders though only from the rich or noble dressed more like a prince di silvano wore a glaring white suit of figured satin with silk cuffs pocket flaps and lapel turnbacks of a very regal reddishpurple clothofgold satin waistcoat white silk hose and solid gold knee buckles on his breeches solid gold shoe buckles set with rubies and diamonds a sash of office crossed from one shoulder to a rosette on his hip in genoese colors a gold chain and medallion of office rested on the snowy white breast of his heavily laced shirt there were some civil or military decorations on coat and sash as well signore di silvano was a devilishly handsome man in his midtolate forties with a lean hard firmchinned patrician face as genteelly weathered as lewrie might expect to see on old roman coins in celebration of a successful general or a new emperor as if di silvano spent time at sea or out hunting and didnt care a fig for a courtiers morefashionable powderaided pallor the signore offered his hand a roughtextured hand taut and muscular and as strong as a sailors alan imagined a giltwreath corona would suit the man better than the high white periwig he wore the hand was withdrawn and sensing that his time was done lewrie began to turn to his right merciful god in heaven he gasped to himself quite nonplussed nobody has poonts that big the ethereal bewitching beauty next to cara mia comandante lewrie capitano di aschemmaessa jester simile il motteggiare hmm senator di silvano informed her inclining slightly to her and leering with amusement comandante lewrie signorina claudia mastandrea your servant signorina lewrie said with a deeper incline of his head and bow than his usual wont so he could peer at those impressive tits directly instead of ogling her under his lashes ive died and gone to heaven he exulted as she dropped him her curtsy leaning forward a bit to incline her own head and and to rise from that curtsy to look him directly in the eyes and smile curl the corner of her mouth up with a veiled mischievous amusement as if she knew exactly where his eyes had been she kept her head inclined to the side in wry acknowledgment her entrancing amberbrown eyes twinkling as she looked him over as if taking his measure uhm aye he stammered turning to lumber down the line a pleasure to meet you commander lewrie she murmured in a more than passable english in a surprisingly husky seductive voice pleasure was all mine maam alan assured her fighting for an air of gracious gentlemanly gravity and to keep his hands to himself he broke off at last wondering if hed been slobbering on his shoes feeling the urge to wipe his chin free of drool to be introduced to the lesser lights but could not help glancing back furtively now and again just to see idly curious no moren that damme he gasped again feeling his innards lurch she leaned forward a bit past some shoulders and wigs looking back at him a missish sort of minx might have ducked her head hidden behind lashes or a fan nothing brazen about her but he met a hooded smile a long approving blink which was as good as the nod anytime dear lord he muttered free of the line at last desperately in need of drink and male company to buck up those tattering vows of his mister knolles he cried in relief snagging a passing waiter with a tray of fine cutcrystal stems of spumante for you sir thankee captain im fair parched aready knolles beamed as he handed his first officer a glass cant they open some doors some windows so bloody hot in here must be his mistress that uhm lewrie speculated dye think that claudia mastandrea wonder if shes his east wine or his o west wing ride rich as he is the fridayun id say sir knolles said with an appreciative leer of his own were i that john company nabobwealthy id have one for every day of the week save sundays wonder what his wifes like if ill lay you odds mister knolles well not discover that he snickered back doubt theres even a miniature of her hereabouts gorgeous bloody creature though lewrie thought browneyed blonde ill wager those eyebrows were pale down on her arms those catheads he was forced to gulp again and slosh back most of his champagne and took another surreptitious look across the room most fashionable ladies he knew used tight corset laces to push themselves anywhere near such bounty attain such a deep cleavage or crammed cotton stockings up underneath hed been rooked before hey those few who had been so blessed he groaned fought it laced or banded themselves flat under a higher bodice so theyd not be taken for strumpets or fondled by the bullybucks in the streets thisun though he watched signorina mastandrea gaily swirl beside her keeper on the way to а wine table four or five inches shorter than his fiveandthreequarter feet he recalled almost petite which was why her husky voice had surprised him coming from such a slip of a girl woman he corrected himself as he snagged another glass of wine styles changed though and he didnt think a corset could explain her slim back her narrow waist acres of underpinnings and petticoats were passй as were hip pads and concealing whalebone frames the way her matching white satin gown clung to her swished against her limbs why shed be slim as an eel he speculated very slim legs narrow hips almost childish bottom hed seen a few like that those who seemed overblessed by nature in one area but deprived in the rest of their person and that was a damned intriguing stop it damn you he told himself take a deep breath a round turn and two half hitches cant keep a vow with a pistol to my own head tup a senators doxy mine hosts doxy jesus excuse me sir but do you think there will be dancing later midshipman hyde asked at his elbow he turned to give the wiry gingerhaired lad a peek but hyde was casting a shy but ardent look off toward the walls where stood a slim lighthaired beauty perhaps no more than fifteen or so in the tow of a female chaperone who was gazing back at hyde with wideeyed admiration the coy covert art of a fan quite forgotten close your mouth mister hyde lewrie chuckled before a fly pops in aye lets hope there is dancing for your sake just be careful she moren like dont speak the kings english and they take the ravishin o their daughters more serious or promises hmm as in betrothals god yes sir hyde replied blushing furiously yes to what lewrie hadnt a clue and expected hed prefer not to know well hold the british end up mister hyde lewrie warned lewrie expected there would be dancing later large as signore di silvanos town palazzo was he could see no sign of a hall set for dining tables almost like a basilica it wasa round central hall or rotunda beneath a soaring dome with marble stairs and balconies up at least three stories with three projecting wings the longer two to east and west lay open to the rotunda salons each as big as two st rates lying hull to hull one was lined with chairs around its entire girth the handsome and intricate inlaid tile floor bare with all the carpets removed a chamber orchestra played from the balcony above its entrance all they had do was turn their chairs to face the salon to supply music for dancing sparse damn place lewrie muttered in spite of all those rich silk hangings the drapes the wallpapers and such it sported more dressed stone than people would be comfortable with back home niches filled with rare old vases amphorae and statuary that ran to the classic heroic vein like a roman basilica when they were homes or palaces or imposing public buildingsbefore theyd been turned to churches the matching salon on the other wing did seem to be the public offices the parlors and libraries the music room lined up one after the other with all the massive impressively tall doorways opened to flaunt and overawe marble columns painted wood columns arches and insets some few civilians dared tread the carpets down that wing oohing and ahhingand careful with their drinks the rotunda though held the food and drink table after table groaning under their hosts largesse there a long table for twentyfour minus chairs topped by a tapering pile of pastries surmounted by a statuary group of winged cherubs and doves another bore taxidermied wild fowl suspended on the wing or roosting in the branches of tree boles and short limbsthat was where the goose duck partridge or pheasant meat could be found wine tables too each with a fountain plashing colored wateror real winedown a series of miniature waterfalls each in the color of the wine offered the white wines and spumante tables bore statuary carved from ice resting against what looked to be snowfields in which spare unopened bottles chilled a bit gaudy dye think cockburn commented to nelson as they wandered by nodding pleasantly to one and all theyd sampled the victuals already having visited the pork table with its gigantic papiermвchй porker and nursing piglets the fruit table with its titanic cornucopia the fish table the pasta and madedish table alan goggled in wonder noticing that cockburn and nelson were eating from real gold plates held goldandsilver damascened utensils knows how to impress i must admit nelson whispered back to cockburn using his free hand to pull at his nose and play up a nasal norfolk twang in ironic commentary makes king midas look like a publican at a twopenny ordinary lewrie japed what fine greasy wooden trenchers you gentlemen hold anything particularly good sir or merely showy all quite good nelson allowed still too much in awe but do allow me to recommend the vinegared pressed beef levantstyle i was told particularly spicy and tangy cockburn agreed though he and nelson both bore a dubious look as if to say that an englishmand never act the fool so as to lay on such a rareeshow it was heathen hindu grand moghul and not quite the hearty country thing the aromas stronger and more alluring than those of the guests around him drew lewrie to the tables where he began to graze taking a small taste of everything before finding something exceptional that pleased him most nod smile shrug and chew nod smile shrug in perplexity and take a sip of wine knowing latin didnt do him the slightest bit of good when it came to conversing in italian one word in twenty perhaps just enough to get him in trouble all he could be was mutely agreeable making the rounds he crossed drakes hawse winced to watch him load his plate to overflowing then tuck it in quickly all the while gabbling and gesticulating with both hands in hearty conversation with the genoese lewrie encountered cockburn and nelson again hands free of plates at last god what a scruffy fellow cockburn muttered i find it hard to believe that he isnt some excellent imposter a bosuns mate whos run and gulled the genoese like doctor gulliver in lilliput much my opinion too at first sir nelson confided to them last year his repute with these people was odious hasnt a shred of respect from even the lowliest genoese yet sirs one comes to discover hes a man of more parts than a first impression might allow i find him like sir william hamilton at naples to be a fellow with whom i may do direct business some less direct do you follow he added with a cryptic smirk oh god lewrie cried suddenly shrimp sirs a whole fresh bowl of em my soul is lost you will excuse me sirs a cauldron would have been more like it which took two strong servitors to carry abrim with peeled and boiled shrimp as big as his thumbs he made his way to the fish table quickly trying not to trample civilians to beat them to them bloody marvelous he sighed once he had a gold plate laden with a fiery hot sauce in which to dip them what is it how did a sauce from the far east comandante lewrie his host said from across the wide table lewrie had been oblivious of everything and everyone his whole attention greedily focused on the shrimp the far east really sir they name it kaitsap comandante senator di silvano told him with another smug expression as if once more secretly amused with englishmen in general and lewries ignorance in particular spices peppers vinegar to which italia contributes its humble marinating tomato sauce i see that you relish it hmm damme the wretch speaks some english lewrie thought huzzah and his wench is with him too huzzah again allow me to compliment you signore on the kaitsap and italias improvements on it and your remarkably skilled fluency he toadied and aye i do relish it most wondrously well almost as much as good old hot english mustard or worcester sauce but the worcester sauce of which you speak signore comandante is not english signore di silvano chided him scusa but when roman legions conquered your island they brought with them their garum the salty fish spice you english sweetened it by adding fruit but it is still made the roman way first comandante you still begin with the boiling and fermenting of the sardines we do lewrie wondered to himself feeling a touch of acid of a sudden well wasnt it said one didnt ever wish to see sausage or legislation made it didnt signify he liked worcester sauce my compliments as well as my thanks signore lewrie went on fighting the urge to dart a glance at di silvanos bewitching mistress for your kind invitation and the bounty the excellence of the bounty you put before us ah bounty senator di silvano sighed turning sad thank you for your compliment signore comandante but i wonder much as we enjoy ourselves tonight as well as we fare what do you call it the short commons si short commons grazie the poor people of the riviera do you believe they enjoy short commons tonight signore what hope do they have of ever eating half as well as they did before as when you began your embargo uh oh lewrie thought casting his eyes about for drake nelson or a senior officer but they were too far away from where he had been waylaid to aid him sandwiched in between lashfluttering ladies three tables or more off damn this bastard lewrie snarled to himself he did this o purpose raised his voice by design to gather a crowd and claudia mastandrea was gazing at him quite coolly waiting his reply and how hed handle himself bitch he accused in with the smarmy shit arent you enjoying yerself hmm signore di silvano he began carefully civilians are always the sufferers in wars especially those occupied and enslaved by the plague of locusts we call the french do they ever hope to enjoy the fruits of their own harvests theyd best do something to help beat the bastards and pray god general de vins and his austrians crushes the french soon so theyre no longer saddled by a pack of robbers yet what may they do signore lewrie di silvano posited in a handwringing gesture of seeming concern the little people those paisans aye hed gathered a crowd of sycophants lewrie noted there certainly by design is their suffering their starvation the only thing you wish of them to be supine and waste away perhaps arise like cincinnatus called from his plough sir lewrie suggested resist like like robin hood did against prince john in sherwood forest i cannot pretend to know english folklore signore his host said with a dismissive air as if it was an irish tale of fairy circles but i do know the fate of the huguenots of la rochelle the fate of the royalists of toulon the armed resistance offered by the vendee against french revolutionary forces slaughter extermination he declared switching to italian to share the pith of his argument among the onlookers who were properly outraged and horrified then pray for an austrian victory to liberate them from neath the tyrants heels signore lewrie rejoined though tis said god helps those who help themselves were genoa he bit the rest of that off genoa would never take up arms too terrified of failing ah the austrians di silvano sneered you are a student of history comandante to reach back to your own past somewhat sir lewrie answered though his school days had been a trifle spotty are you versed in italias past di silvano queried with us it has always been the germans teutons against marius goths then huns lombards and vandals who conquered the old empire made us broken pottery so many little feuding kingdoms unable to resist oh much like the holy roman empire in the germanies sir lewrie pointed out quickly so fragmented and weak score one for me he thought happily seeing di silvano almost wince and grit his teeth in a toowide smile si the senator allowed grudgingly and like our empires last decadent days we must call once more upon our goths to rescue us summon the barely civilized barbarian legions accede to whatever they demand of us to save us but signore do not even you deem what it is they do so far a very slow sort of rescue how long i ask you first of all your excellency lewrie interrupted quite full of himself by then feeling able to hold the british end up our mister gibbon writes that rome was christian hardly decadent when she fell your gothic legions and generals prevailed because no one roman cared to soil his hands with combat any longer the austrians i am certain are quite civilized enough these days does their campaign against the french go slowly it is only because a successful campaign takes time to marshal and amass signore di silvano there that was safe enough without implying criticism of an ally general de vins barely made halfamile a day and that mostly shuffling without actually advancing mostly sitting on his hands and decrying how badly he was outnumbered by the frogs hed heard alan was quite grateful though to espy mister drake conferring with nelson pointing in the direction of the senators diatribe and loud questions aid was in the offing he sighed besides your excellency lewrie went on basking in the intense regard of signorina claudia mastandrea who was following their wordplay closely one must recall that do you fear a barbarian invasion into italy again the mostrecent invaders who are sworn to conquer you and annex you to their new empire of the common man if i may so style it were originally franks a germanic tribe who came late to the party and like scavengers took what they could the leavings of those who preceded them franks and gauls julius caesars bane sir gauls i should think any italian be he genoese savoian or tuscan piedmontese or neapolitan would prefer the whole of italy be left alone free of tyrannical franks and gauls signore oh well shot look at him squirm lewrie exulted senator di silvano had gone as stern and choleric as a hanged spaniel his tanned complexion suffused yet of a sudden he got a sly look hurry up damn you lewrie urged drake and nelson we do signore comandante di silvano assured him turning suave once more almost as much as we wish the north of italia free of austrians hmm yet how may we do this how may the many states in italy resist or cooperate as you said so fragmented and weak well perhaps what you need do signore is to find yourselves another marius another julius caesar to beat back your invaders he breezed off better to stand up and fight like horatio at the bridge than cringe and wring your hands throw your lot in temporarily with the coalition they were despots dictators signore comandante his host reminded him once in power they became oppressive tyrants better the temporary dictator signore from the old neighborhood lewrie said with a grin than the eternal conqueror from france ah ha di silvano barked of a sudden hands on his hips and seeming terribly pleased with himself have i stepped in the horse turds lewrie thought again hes too damn pleased for my liking i must have fallen into a trap hes laid some subtle debaters ruse or when hed sailed to naples hed been presented to king ferdinand in his friedfish shop told him a tale of british derringdo that had bucked him up gotten naples and the kingdom of the two sicilies into the coalition well thatd been arranged sub rosa long before but he had added the last straw to the camels load hadnt he perhaps tonight he could cajole genoa i mean what could a united italian army not do were their kings and princes of the same mind sir lewrie added quickly with a view to backing off perhaps signore lewrie rid ourselves of germans at last the senator hinted rid yourselves of a plague of frogs first sir lewrie said then were you of a mind even though our days of glory are long gone signore you say cincinnatus at his plough yet our modernday cincinnatuses will not leave their fields to defend the soil they wish to rest his host almost sneered a man of his hands and of his head si a modern marius or caesar is what we need but where are we to find him well thats pretty much up to you sir lewrie allowed up to me di silvano replied turning almost teasing up to me personally signore well you and your fellow senators signore di silvano alan shrugged reaching for another shrimp on his plate at long last with a generous dredge through the kaitsap id expect youd know your fellow italians best you surprise me signore lewrie the senator beamed elatedly you really do i would not think an englishman ah your excellency drake bellowed finally coming to alans rescue through a purposely maddening maze of strollers and winebibbers have you and the commander been having a good chat a most excellent one signore drake di silvano assured him with a pleased purr though he gives me no reassurances for the poor people of the riviera my fellow genoese but that but that marcello claudia mastandrea interjected with a moue of boredom and a sulky tone is best taken up with the good signore drake or his ammiraglio piccolo politics marcello she pouted they bore me and you must argue with comandante lewrie a guest our squadron commander you mean signorina drake amended signore nelson she said turning to him with a sly expression si he is piccolo a very little ammiraglio lewrie coughed some kaifsap up his nose as he snorted in appreciation of her wordplay piccolo he thought have to remember it horatio piccolo haw haw scusa signore lewrie di silvano offered reaching across to shake his hand right manly and gentlemanly my enthusiasm my concern we must speak again of rome and its past glories of a new rome and its possibilities most intriguing i should be delighted your excellency lewrie beamed glad to be free you will allow the comandante lewrie to escort me marcello signorina mastandrea cajoled he is in need of more wine as am i but of course cara mнa of course di silvano said magnanimously you will be in the care of a fine english gentleman thankee jesus alan exulted no wait maybe not theres well oh to hell with it he put down his plate offered the crook of his arm to her once around the table upon which she could rest her forearm and hand i apologize for marcello signore comandante she said with a delicious tilt of her head in his direction an intimate conspiratorial tilt revealing strands of strawberrygold blond hair peeking from beneath her highpiled white wig huzzah she is a blonde he smirked he must be seen concerned you know he has many estates now taken by the french many paisans depending on him as their protector he cannot help until the french are driven away but he must show concern for the welfare of all of the people of the riviera since none of this was genoa s doing your embargo or the french occupation i quite understand signorina though it was a bit touchandgo there for a bit lewrie decided to shrug off i still dont understand why though your senator and his fellows wont take steps to complain against you is all they can do signore lewrie she shrugged all marcello can do for the moment he is of a mind to resist he alone of them but what may one out of many do you are from the riviera yourself signorina lewrie asked as they got to a spumante fountain oh pooh signorel she pouted again claudia i allow you signorina claudia thankee he said with a short bow no i am not from the riviera i am from the north bergamo pardon me but lewrie snickered wouldnt that make you one of his detestable germans marcello has forgiven me my blood long ago signore lewrie claudia whispered close to him leaning toward him as a waiter handed them their glasses of sparkling wine husky breathy a rare and costly aroma exuded from her shoulders and bountifully filled bodice a seductive citron and sandalwood he assures me that many clans of the republic and early empire were rufios mixed with the original celts alexander the great of macedonia was of the celtoi so you see he is so forgiving of almost anything i do she promised him with another husky chuckle her eyes hooded er alan croaked wishing he could bite a knuckle to fight his urges bite something even when you tell him hes boresome he japed striving for flippancy she tossed back her head and laughed a deeptoned guffaw not a simpering twits titter or giggle you struck a chord signore alan lewrie i call you alan as you call me claudia si grazie a very roman chord come walk with me while we sip our wine he offered his arm again and they began a languid stroll toward the far salon wing against the tide of guests drifting into the salon readied for dancing circling the rotunda counterclockwise marcello is of very ancient family you see claudia imparted walking so close their hips brushed sending a shock through him of a patrician senatorial family since the days of rome s first wall so what is more apt that he is a senator now the di silvanos come from the silvanii a prominent roman clan many senators tribunes and generals pagans even after the reign of constantine or so he tells me you will see how fond marcello is of rome s ancient glories statuary the picture gallery the armory that holds so many things he has had unearthed or purchased from others perhaps the library at the far end she cooed as promisingly as a new bride after the last of the wedding guests had been shooed away dear christ im trying he groaned some credit in that hey so he surely must be upset that italy is fragmented controlled by austrians not what it once was or could be lewrie temporized and he wishes there would come a new caesar himself perhaps ah no he is not a professional soldier claudia pouted quite prettily as they neared the first massy double doors leading from the rotunda to that dimly lit far wing but he believes he might be the new cato the one who might arouse the passion for a unified italy a new republic in peoples hearts a liberated italy a power to be reckoned with there is a map in the library you must see it do you wish to see it alan a map of what might be should be she had come around a little before him looking up in his eyes no longer veiled in her meaning or her carriage uhm the dance signorina alan flummoxed isnt it just about to oh pooh she breathed in a sultry silken mutter you are more interested in a silly dance or two than in allowing me to display marcellos mostprized treasures to you he looked down at two of em in a hellish quandary firm and big as bloody pineapples or coconuts shifting up and down along with her every deep breath larboard or starboard as she swayed sideways as if keeping time with her own dance christ on a cross he begged just a little help here didnt bring my cundums ashore o purpose just in case some mort was just too temptin oh my god look at her the intricately pleated and ruched folds of her already strained bodice wnpleated as two proud nipples hardened and puckered behind a single layer of clothall that stood between him and bliss lewrie tore his gaze upward to her face to a smile that seemed to promise everything those amber eyes going so wide perhaps uhm he coughed unable to look away mesmerized tis been so long since ive danced dye see enjoy it rather and two years or more in active commission and a short refit back home the wife and i ah hmm didnt hurt so much to say by god i do have selfcontrol he exulted lookit im turnin down the bounciest quim ever i did see see god morals we had no chance to dance at portsmouth and with our kiddies along he felt emboldened to add i would request you save me at least the one turn around the floor signorina for a wondrous memory of genoa but perhaps we should enter the salon and dance so honorable she whispered so softly he had to lean to her to hear so decent an english gentleman claudia crooned eyes wet in wonder she glided a half step to him her breasts brushing at his shirtfront and waistcoat buttons her lips open in a half smile her eyes going even wider and more besotting within inches of a first kiss her lips opening and lewrie knew he was a lying hound after all god just a dab o backbone he pleaded ready to succumb in spite of his best efforts im a cuntstruck cully always was always will be im tryin thelp meself so wheres yer ahem commander lewrie a very welcome voice intruded behind him a very plumby cultured english voice thankee jesus alan thought whirling in alarm and an immense relief which turned to wideeyed amazement seasoned with just the slightest dash of terror when he beheld his rescuer how the devild he get here he gawped and should i be glad or not allow me to name myself to you sir the impossibly tall and skeletally lean old beak blathered on quickly stalking up to offer a hand to be shook thin hair brushed back severely above a weathered face that was all angles and hollows in the cheeks temples and eyes agatey buzzards eyes that glinted hard and merciless as gunflints over a long hawks nose simon silberberg sir your servant sir from couttss bank in london he purred as he shook alans quitenerveless hand mister silberberg sir lewrie continued to gawp clapping his astonished mouth shut agent of the bank sir silberberg rattled on in genoa on business dont ye know commercial interests well when i heard we were both invited to the same ball commander lewrie i took it pon myself to make my acquaintance of you hoping we might meet your solicitor mister matthew mountjoy mentioned you to me just before i sailed wished me to convey his greetings do you have a moment sir just the one triflin moment took it pon myself sir to list evry bank customer in the mediterranean make them familiar with me impart details of new services for serving officers on foreign stations the lean old fellow in his ditto suit of somber black almost whinnied in shy urgency playing the perfect overeducated underemployed fool of a tradesman cant hope to rise in couttss sir less of course mister silberberg lewrie allowed this wont take much time though will it the dancing dye see of course not sir wont interrupt yer pleasures silberberg promised casting a sidelong significant glance at claudia mastandrea you will excuse me signorina lewrie said to the mort do save me at least the one dance i pray you until later hmm the night is young signore lewrie claudia huffed a bit beyond cooled from her ardor downright snippy in fact perhaps you will accompany me later ciao signore should i escort you lewrie offered but she swept away up to your old tricks are we lewrie silberberg sniffed in aspersion his lips suddenly hairline thin and cramped together and suddenly not half the handwringing senior clerk hed seemed up to yours are we twigg lewrie scowled back yes the spy from the foreign office the coldblooded manipulator lewrie had known in the far east as zachariah twigg drawled in a toplofty sneer in point of fact i am chapter silberberg lewrie sneered softly however did you come by that and aint you slightly out of your usual bounds sir a halfaddled banking clerk of the hebrew persuasion may be an object of amusement lewrie of some derision twigg replied with a conspirators mutter though sounding pleased with his alias hardly one to suspect as a spy though we after all finance their wars for them apolitically mind with suspected loyalties only to the bank the guinea and ones tribe as for my presence the far east became more a military or a naval problem of the overt sort and too our last escapade made me too wellknown there with french influence limited to pondichery or their indian ocean islands their trade dried up and with trade their hopes to service informers agents provocateurs pirates well twigg shrugged expressively then with the dropping of his arms he seemed to fall back into his assumed character they paced toward a wine table twigg all but fawning and bobbing anxious to please you will remember it is silberberg not twigg from now on i trust sir he wheedled in a whisper laying a finger to his fleshytipped nose the endpad of which would have made a walrus jealous a louder voice for his next statement so very sorry to take you from your amusements commander lewrie but since youre so much at sea i have so few opportunities if not tonight sir perhaps you may do me the honor of allowing me to call upon you aboard ship before jester departs oh my sir your account prospers indeed it does prize money the four percents though you are aware there is talk of a tax on income sir hideous notion truly hideous but there it is now had we a moment commander lewrie i believe i may make to you such a proposition of investments to safeguard your farm income making less of it subject to any future levy as would warm the very cockles of yer heart a glass of wine with you sir a true nautical hero one such as i have so few opportunities dine out on it for years i could oh for gods sake lewrie whispered frowning crossly bit less of it hey the waiter turned away after pouring them each some claret run in from france of a certainty your ship instanter silberberg hissed softly as twigg a finger to his thin lips we have so much to discuss sir oh my yes he gushed for the waiters benefit as silberberg but lewrie protested as the opening strains of a gay air soared from the far salon to the rotunda he knew there was nothing he could say or do but go along with twiggs dictate again your fathers well sir twigg told him as they tossed their hats and gloves in his greatcabins made a brigadier imagine that hell know of it soon enough this come from leadenhall street with me your brotherinlaw burgess chiswick will become a major thats gratifyin lewrie sighed opening his wine cabinet so sorry to spoil your fun twigg posed one brow lifted in amusement as alan grudgingly gave him a snifter of brandy and such bountiful fun it would have been too didnt think a cypher such as youd notice twigg alan spat au contraire lewrie i have always had an eye for the ladies twigg chuckled though i may hardly say that my face or my choice of career has ever stood me in such good stead as yours in that regard such a splendid run of luck youve had though a lovely wife truly lovely is your caroline as is your corsican doxy the uhm shall i say the confessa aretino now why would you wish to know so much about me twigg i know a lot about everybody lewrie thats my job so you can use em i spose and that most cynically alan accused leave my wife and mistress out of this twigg only if you will sir twigg shot back even more amused with lewries sullen truculence his past grievances i will not use them cynically or otherwise i leave that to you lewrie no matter now sir might you summon your clerk mister thomas mountjoy i confess i was quite struck by your clandestine report to nelson in which mountjoy played so prominent a part ive gotten little from our frenchman you captured and i wish to go over that report fleshing out the sparsity of the written account with both your recollections sentry lewrie called to the marine at the door pass the word for my clerk come at once tell him aye aye capum sah the muffled voice shouted back inconnu my god twigg mused slouching in the sofa cushions how dramatic how french fellow could have put on a fools face and gotten clean away since hed purged his own chest so thoroughly that partner of his hes the same stubborn sort all fired with adoration for his revolution might as well make a hindu kill a cow as get him to talk bloody amateur in his own theatric what did you learn of him lewrie asked wincing as he remembered twigg on a captured lanun rover prao with a wavybladed krees at a pirate prisoners throat which twigg had most dispassionately cut after slicing and torturing what little he could from him and how up to all your old tricks mister twigg and why not now and again sir twigg allowed coolly i find they more than suffice no lewrie he lives shaken one may hope but no permanent harm done an amateur as i said marks on a pile of dirty linen with several aliases from several cities some of them most embarrassingly french and caught redhanded laden with gold in a ship laden with military goods should have taken another vessel traveled separately from his dead compatriot that unlamented romantic inconnu secret writings the lemonjuice variety tween the lines of innocent correspondence smell it by god a dead giveaway everytime no a more elaborate cypher would have served them better but i doubt the poor fellow in charge of french spies in the region has much to work with yet and hes no richelieu himself exactly learnin give him that much twigg shrugged again and took a sip to toast his worthy opponent fellowll be turned off in a fortnight though hung for spying soon as a military court at corsica has him in and the french midshipman that clumsy lout god no lewrie hes to be exchanged too many of our squirearchys slackjawed sons aboard berwick those with such a lot of interest are festerin in france midshipman hainaut will be reporting back to his masters and the less said about me the better best he suffer an accident on the way he knows too much already seen too much but twigg sighed as if to say what can you do knows who you are lewrie he does not as thickheaded a peasant as he looks scrub him up dress his hair a proper uniform and the skys the limit for him his die narbe will take care of that i assure you yer clerk mister mountjoy sah the marine shouted of die narbe more later twigg promised smugly rising for his introduction mountjoy as usual disappointed hed risen from a deep slumber dressed haphazardly and presented himself in a pair of bearhide carpet slippers bare ankles and darkblue slop trousers into which hed crammed the tail of his kneelength nightshirt with a ratty old drabbrown wool dressing gown atop mountjoy still wore a tasseled sleeping cap over his unruly hair too you sent for me sir he said yawning and blinking from the sudden change to lanthorn light in the greatcabins scratching a bit too it must be admitted good god whats that twigg growled stiffening mountjoy my clerk lewrie puzzled no i mean that lewrie twigg grumbled pointing that sir is a cat lewrie enlightened him you know fells domesticas names toulon hes the same sort o disaster i despise cats twigg glowered hellishblack we wake you up from a good nap sweetlin lewrie asked of toulon bending down to scratch the top of toulon s head concealing a small smirk of sudden pleasure mister mountjoy the name that you are to remember on pain of your life sir is silberberg simon silberberg twigg began and riveting mountjoys attention turning the beginnings of a yawn into a gape of awe from couttss do you follow a representative of your captains bank do you understand sir but and this you will forget immediately im gone damme toulon following the perverse wont of his tribe had gone for twigg immediately purring with secret malicious delight to discover a cathaterto twine around his ankles sniff at his shoes and silk stockings which were new fascinating and perhaps might require a sprayed marking or a few clawed snags to make em simply perfect get that that beast away from me lewrie mister twigg demanded skittering as if he were going to do a dance to saint vitusor hop atop the sofa like a lady whod seen a mouse here toulon mousey lewrie tempted fetching out the wool scrap toy on a length of smallstuff leave the bad old man alone he singsonged to his ramcat which was a perfect excuse to expose a childlike smile of fiendish glee think i really love you puss he thought quite warmly twigg in his guise of simon silberberg from couttss had been in leghorn and porto especia with an occasional jog inland to florence as a commercial representative ought when mister drake had sent a messenger to him regarding the seizures of ii furioso and ii briosco hed not found ships registered as tuscan under those names indeed had not discovered any public record of a trading company calling itself the compagnia di commercia mare di liguria no public stock offer on what passes for their exchange sirs twigg silberberg told them over an eyeopening glass of brandy nor any articles of corporation filed with their government pretty much the same murky situation as obtains here in genoa that so puzzled mister drake it was helpful in the extreme though mister mountjoy to receive a fairhand copy of the entries in that small ledger book you found cryptic as the headings were still i was able to form an educated guess as to the identities of the principals guilio gallado sir mountjoy inquired eagerly quite awake by then though theyd been at it for at least an hour to the tee young sir twigg replied quickly with an admiring smile though a damn thinun as was his wont unfortunately i cannot front him in any fashion and hes much too prominent for me to uhm spirit away for a probing interrogation though im told he was quite upset and shaken by his capture so early on in the life of their venture i have arranged for his correspondence to be intercepted and read more of the vinegar or lemonjuice secret writing as i mentioned earlier you recall lewrie uhm alan commented feet up on his desk and slouched down in a padded chair with toulon now quietly napping in his lap unfortunately too twigg went on as if he and ergo them had all the time in the world though it was growing quite late i cannot substitute correspondence either overt or covert to cause confusion indeed until we are certain of all the principals we cannot strike at any of them there is the niggling problem that theyre neutrals citizens of a sovereign tuscany lewrie pointed out but that never stopped you much before my lord this is fascinating sir mountjoy cried wriggling in his chair with excitement you do me too much injustice lewrie deed you do sir the old spy carped why were i a passionate man id take a grave exception to it though fencing words with you is amusing at times he tossed lewrie a beatific smile another damn brief un no i fear i can do little for the nonce it will be up to you and your nelson to how did captain ayscough put it lewrie that i should hold his coat and let another batsman have his innings no to lop off conspiracy at the root may be beyond us but i shall be quite content should your squadron take as many of their ships as possible cutting profits to nil and disabusing the conspirators of the notion that they may aid france and prosper or that france will aid them in their plans so it goes beyond profit sir mountjoy gushed indeed it does mister mountjoy lewrie im told you have a wager with captain cockburn hell buy you that shore dinner may i suggest roast crow for him no sirs this exceeds humanity or care for their fellows from the genoese or for the neutrality the very sovereignty of tuscany pignore gallado i have learned is part of a salon group of likeminded progressives quite taken with the american revolution and with its ideals overeducated overwealthy dilletantes and intellectual wastrels idealists some of them perhaps they see in french occupation a new order sir alan asked reminded of his talk with senator di silvano earlier or with his besotting mistress at the least mean to say surely there are some benighted fools who believe all this democratic mobocracy cant liberty equality fraternity the franchise given to just anybody granted lewrie twigg allowed rather perceptive of you i must say yes sirs even at home well priestley and those of his ilk the gimleteyed reformers fortunately theyre not rich enough to afford private armies and mobs of thugs nor do they possess constitutions of an active nature that might allow them to conspire beyond printing a few odd penny tracts and weve shut all that down quite successfully in ireland there are more worrisome combinations but then in ireland there bloody always are gallado is for his rather advanced age very active in certain societies so do you know his associations mister silberberg thomas mountjoy interrupted you may discover the principal conspirators in tuscany and i suppose you have already done that or are in the way of doing it quite so young sir twigg said with relish though it is rather like playing a good hand of whist with no cooperation from a partner youve never met right after the first distribution of the cards knowing the deck has been arranged beforehand but in whose favor hmm one discovers information as to who holds what one bid or laydown at a time an intellectual passion rather a most cold and logical dispassion but hugely enjoyable even so i should quite imagine it is sir mountjoy enthused so you know who the others are some of them i fear i must play my cards close to my chest mister mountjoy twigg said disappointing him though i have found the identity of another large financial risktaker the others i suspect are talkers rather than doers in tuscany there was br do you recall aye sir br was owed twenty percent do we believe what was in the small ledger and not the captains bruno randazzo a very prominent young fellow educated in paris not so long ago travels widely twigg ticked off was in the south of france overland about the time of toulon from what i believe to be correct three other sets of initials belong to men from tuscany fivepercenters they fit they match the names they are in randazzos and gallacios social circles a few however conform to no one those you believe are genoan i take it lewrie said as his cat shifted about settling back to sleep with a little grunt which is why youre here that sir twigg said turning in his chair to face him and the fact that as you suspected this combination of ships owners and ardent conspirators have good intelligence of our squadrons arrival in the first instance and of its movements in the second three of the sets of initials i have come to believe reside in genoa two of them are fivepercenters while the last commands thirty percent sir mountjoy announced the lions share he must be a player even bigger than gallado a richer man perhaps or one more devoted to genoa s conquest and the coming of a frenchenforced new order or a cabal of three or six or thirty lewrie shrugged and i suppose our captive frog spy told you nothing in that regard absolutely nothing im afraid twigg sighed massaging the bridge of his nose theres a very good possibility that the wretch never dealt facetoface with any of the larger principals at all i strongly suspect it was done through anonymous representatives agents or ships captains solicitors or mistresses that sort of thing a good conspirator never tips his own hand when he may use some poor cully more expendable as a gobetween i had hopes my noble opponent being so new and unused to the trade might not have developed the sophistication as of yet but it appears he has the french have always been good at spycraft in their damn blood worse than italian schemers it may be sir that one of the fivepercenters from tuscany may be more important to their plot than signore gallado mountjoy posed with a puzzled look gallacio may be in full sympathy and in complete accord with one more political and is throwing his wealth his ships and money into it the same may obtain in genoa oh very good sir yes id thought of that twigg complimented but one must consider that for a wealthy man to expend a considerable part of his fortune pon a conspiracy against his native people hed wish more say than the rest in the outcome more so than a coffeehouse schemer or a streetcorner ranter there are revolutionaries with scythes in their hands and there are the political animals who pull the strings of the puppet show the ones who end up top dog when the others have faded back to their ineffectual ditherings once the revolutions accomplished so who do you suspect mister twigg lewrie asked yawning the initials in the ledger as your mountjoy could have told you lewrie are ur twigg announced though barely above his most ominous whisper our french spy knew no one by any name which might coincide hes not a practiced liar but intractably mute upon almost every subject nor does our mister drake who is familiar with all the merchant class or ruling class who might have a deepenough purse to be our ur nor do any of the romantically idealist young men of genoa match he has suspicions among those as to the identity of our sardines but nothing of the biggest of fish whom we seek nor do i but i shall in time twigg prophesied with a cunning leer of eventual almost foreordained triumph with the great pleasure it would be to see this mysterious ur ruined once he was revealed now as to the matter of the french knowing our ship movements so quickly lewrie twigg snapped turning brusque once more easily solved sir lewrie yawned again recrossing his legs so one foot didnt fall asleep too every bloody genoese would sell his mother for a groat might as well try to eradicate cockroaches as dam up the flood of information i expected no less sir twigg glared tis not the first time ive been in this part of the world dye know what i was about to say before your blithe dismissal sir was that while we cannot hope indeed to limit much less totally eliminate the many informers along the riviera who do it out of spite for our embargo love of frog radical republicanism money or a love of intrigue we may turn it to our advantage this midshipman hainaut for example whos to be exchanged mister mountjoy might be quite useful in planting with that young man some false scents some superficially convincing truth along with a hard kernel of falsehood to confuse them feel up to playing a part mister mountjoy aye sir sounds intriguing mountjoy replied barely able to contain himself at the prospect of being useful mister drake and i have some uhm associates twigg said his death skull of a face creasing in malicious good humor we are privy to certain information about the french as well for instance there is to be a convoy soon the presence of this squadron has cost the french the ability to supply their army with coasters sailing independently youll know it when you hear it not before lewrie we are told that several small warships of a counterpart french coastal squadron will guard them to their destination but were the frogs to believe that our squadron would be off at sea under the horizon out to stage another raid such as yours on bordighera to descend upon a larger savoian port well there you are then a weakening of the convoy escort a dispersion of force to the wrong place at the wrong time yet an important convoy full of supplies taken and the french unable to trust in the complete accuracy of all they hear in future i take it mister tw silberberg mountjoy exclaimed with a giggle hes smart lewrie smart as paint as you sea dogs say mister twigg beamed again i will give you the particulars mister mountjoy hainaut will carry it to his master i will arrange for his immediate exchange to speed things along since they do need speeding given the timing of the convoys arrival wherever lewrie gathered that and a few more important items twigg agreed i am at your complete disposal sir mountjoy volunteered then let us repair to yon dining area for a moment or two twig decided so i may coach you on what it is you need to say for hainaut to repeat and how it might be best discovered to him may i prevail upon you lewrie to borrow your dining room and your clerk for a further time have at it sir lewrie said unable to say much opposed he was certain twigg had risen considerably in the foreign offices secret bureaus since the far east and had the ear and patronage of people who could crush a pipsqueak naval commander if twigg wished it there was spite enough of the lingering kind between them already and i will thank you on your honor sir twigg cautioned him with a sternly risen finger to go aft there are matters you are not to know yet or at the least be able truthfully to deny knowing you lewrie spluttered getting to his feet in anger i swear youre too full of yourself sir to row me in my own cabins our sovereigns writ allows me sir twigg cautioned though he showed all signs of relishing lewries embarrassment there done now lewrie snapped once mountjoy had been told what to do and had departed for his cot how dare you twigg there is the matter of respect from my officers and crew that a captain cant allow to be trampled by a goddamned civilian an outsider a oh do sit down and cease your pious rant commander lewrie twigg sighed wearily making free with alans brandy bottle i know you of old sir perhaps a great deal better than you shall ever of yourself one more word and i might decide in the kings name twigg left his full threat unspoken but he had invoked enough lewrie shut up and sat down first of all sir you know how impatient i am with the custom and usage of naval or military blockheads you made that perfectly clear in the pacific sir secondly sir twigg went on ignoring lewries bile your use of my true name after i cautioned you to not and in that rather loud voice too tsk tsk were it to result in my death sir should one of your crewmen blab inadvertently well that is one thing but the utter confusion of a great many schemes should the enemy come to know of me or my involvement were they to begin to suspect that im a spy would unravel more enterprises than this and result in death or torture for a great many others so i will instruct you this one last time to keep your wits about you in spite of your resenting me and kindly refer to me even in your dreams as simon silberberg the harmless bank clerk too gooseberry ineffectual to be any harm can you do that lewrie aye sir alan glowered good sir twigg mocked you may not believe this lewrie but i rather like you i have a great admiration for your qualities as a sailor and a doer as a commission sea officer oh bloody alan groaned pull the other one no i do twigg smiled cadaverously whatever made you the greedy grasping opportunist youve become so much more dangerous and useful than the usual sea dog i know not but when youre of a mind to put your mind to a problem stead of loafing or muddling through like the rest youre bloody inspired desperation perhaps its no matter i value you men like you lewrie theyre damn rare damme bordighera caught em with their breeches down and buggered em as deep as a mop stick would reach my word and ii briosco how many of your contemporaries would be that clever sir that devious youre pissing down my back mister silberberg lewrie smiled back a wickedly mirthless smile of illhumor sounds like im set up for something know you of old i do you use people aye i do twigg most amiably admitted now you think youre going to use me again of a certainty twigg chuckled theres even a possibility youll enjoy it this fellow hainaut will be rejoining soon his mentor and patron this french senior officer know who he is die narbe captn scar lewrie shot back happy to have a bit of knowledge that twigg perhaps didnt for once early on last summer we heard he also went by ugly face or hideous ran convoys to corsica too before it fell and do you know many french naval officers lewrie personally i mean know any of past acquaintance who might fit those frightening sobriquets twigg posed happily think back sir do we dont run to the same clubs so lewrie began to sneer then got an icy chill of dread felt his stomach contract oh bloody alan gasped as the shoe finally dropped he leaned back in utter astonishment his face paling for a second no couldnt be didnt we do for him they cashiered him surely guillaume choundas his horrible little self twigg cackled softly twice as mean and thanks to your efforts twice as ugly cashiered yes pensioned off as a cripple not the sort of face one wishes to see in ones wardroom hmm not handsome enough to wear the uniform of an officer always did hate aristocrats though recall a peasant father a breton fisherman out of saint malo forever going on about the veneti those godlike celtic sailormen of his educated in a fashion jesuits i learned thatd make him twisted as an irish walking stick who best to volunteer to espouse the revolution twigg asked one of the first to the barricades and all that and deeply truly in love and league with everything the revolution in france means active service again as an officer a chance to shine again a chance for choundas to take revenge on every petty frog who ever even looked sidewise at him to lop off a hundred aristocratic heads a thousand and hes here in charge against us lewrie spat with weaiy and bitter amusement well im damned we should have killed him long ago when we had the chance he was damned good might have gotten even better youll soon find out lewrie twigg informed him with a knowing leer once hainaut tells him who it was stopped his business at bordighera as i intend for hainaut to do hell come looking for you personally im counting on it knew i should have become a bloody farmer alan thought pimp in london my early aspiration safe as houses that considrin sir lewrie glowered are you trying to get me killed on purpose you scheming old not at all lewrie twigg was quick to assure him simpering though which didnt sound like much assurance at all as i say i do like you professionally speaking your sort arent worth a tinkers damn for much beyond war and well you know it neither am i i must confess but then my sort of war is eternal back home in peacetime i expect id find you boringly conceited and unscrupulously smarmy an idle wastrel and lecher as i expect you did too tween commissions hmm but thats what makes you so valuable at war laze your way into idle foolishness then shovel your way from neath a wagonload of manure and come up smelling like a rose with guineas in your fists do it quite ruthlessly cause youre too impatient or desperate to play by the rules the proper sorts believe in im counting on that remarkable ability of yours should you two actually meet again so youd sport a small wager on the home side alan snorted stake my last shilling on you sir my entire fortune had i the chance twigg snickered for a moment before turning forebodingly dark and somber choundas is clever but hes much like you lewrie hes ultimately ruled by his heart not his head no matter how clever he is i play my game dispassionately but oh lewrie what a marvelous diversion it is a personal involvement that misdirects could be fatal for me so rarely do i allow personal motives to intrude or allow a motive or those who would fulfill it to become personal believe me sir lewrie sneered heavily ive noticed in this instance though twigg said with a frown i do not think that i err in allowing myself to feel just once had i been on that beach with you when you chopped choundas to flinders id have ordered you to complete the work had you not id have broken you then scragged him myself knew the work wasnt done even though it looked that spanish officials would hang him as a pirate even then i felt a gnawing suspicion that ruined as he was hed cause us mischief in future so you want me to kill him personally lewrie blanched i most passionately most eagerly wish his death lewrie mister twigg said with unwonted heat even as a legless cripple holed up in some noisome paris cellar with others to do his bidding i fear he would still be dangerous you personally more than likely not sir i wish to unbalance him distract him with rage as i did in canton after he had my old partner thom wythy murdered youre my chink into his armor lewrie knowing youre near the man who maimed him hell be more eager to hunt you than do his duty his cold and evil logic all confounded and diverted youll be the bait my bait which oh just thankee so muchl lewrie whispered draws him to fatal folly twigg pounded on and should he creep to my trap he will die at last no matter who does it but should he find you should the chance arise i count on you being the one who kills him dead in fact should you two meet again then i insist pon it you are to kill him dead chapter signal is down sir spendlove shouted maintain course quartermaster lewrie ordered and god help the french its going to be a lovely day what little joy of it theyll have buggered em by god if only we were in on the buggering sir knolles laughed it was indeed a lovely morning for late august in the ligurian sea there was a noticeable swell now and then the hint of some foamy chop to the folding wave tops and a decently brisk breeze for a change all under a brilliant blue sky wisped with benign clouds fremantles inconstant led breaking away westward accompanied by the tartar brig to cover the westernmost small town of languelia in the bay of alassio meleager and speedy went more easterly to tackle one of the warships at anchor what looked to be a french corvette while nelson in agamemnon being handled like a frigate instead of a tired sixtyfourgunner southampton and ariadne charged directly for the clutch of merchant ships jester stood on tail end of the informal battle line that had approached the coast to remain offshore as the seaward guard for the rest as they achieved their victory she stayed on course alone least well be insight sir buchanon grumbled share in the take there is that mister buchanon lewrie smirked though we could wait till hell freezes over before the prize courts approve those shares easy money today ah well no sign of guillaume choundas either lewrie was more than happy to note which partly explained his sense of content rumor had it that le hideux had a corvette as his flagship and there were two of them anchored in alassio bay this moment caught napping and facing the heavier twelvepounder guns of southampton inconstant and meleager those crushing heavy guns aboard agamemnons lower deck if he was there in alassio bay and someone else stopped his business then facing the wily frenchman whod had the devils own luck was someone elses joy and lewrie wished them well of it ever since twigg had come aboard with his disturbing news lewrie had felt a distinct twanging of nerves only sheer dumb luck had saved lewries bacon in the far east when hed gone up against choundas before only desperate derringdo and neckornothing chance had kept him alive why the bastard would have slain me if i hadnt kicked him in the wedding tackle lewrie thought with a queasy feeling could one divide a single second that was how close he had been to being spitted on the mans sword a normal foe now but choundas again he shivered sorry but the navy dont pay anyone near enough to tackle that clever fiend he raised his telescope to watch glad to be an observer as the squadron stood into the bay creating as much confusion and fear aboard the french convoy as a fox might among the chickens his lips curled in silent delight theyd made it to alassio the destination twigg and drake had discovered dropped their hooks and prepared to carry their cargoes ashore certain that the british squadron was far away to the west on that shore he could see tiny antlike figures in the dark blueandwhite uniforms of the french army the colors adopted from their old secondline national guard thousands of frogs foot horse and perhaps some light artillery rather a lot of cavalry he surmised or draught animals assembled to tow the heavy wagons that the convoys goods would have filled cannon fire now blooms of smoke staining the oaken sides of agamemnon and the rest even upwind the slamming and drumming boom of artillery was lungrattling some scattered return fire from shore or from the armed ships that had escorted them in for show lewrie thought smugly a broadside or two so their captains could claim that resistance had been offered but then neither of the french corvettes appeared to be trying to hoist sail or save their anchors the dull glint of iron upon their forecastles cutting cable yet so slowly so raggedly hes not here lewrie muttered lowering his glass and gnawing on the lining of his mouth in disappointment that choundas had not been caught with his trousers down and worry that he was still out there somewhere and that twigg would arrange for him to fight him damme i could have thought let this be a lesson to you hainaut le hideux grumbled as he awkwardly paced his quarterdeck in bleak fury never believe what is offered to you too easily citizen pouzin thought it was authentic so the lanky midshipman shrugged he looked a little better the british had been so good as to present him with a pair of slop trousers which fit better than his old castoff breeches a gift that civilian clerk had told him ah citizen pouzin oui choundas scowled lifting the good corner of his mouth in a brief grin so easily gulled that one i will make sure paris knows of his gullibility should he have gotten the timing wrong we sail for nothing but if this is a ploy to expose the convoy then he will pay for it so many places to cover nice sam remo cagnes antibes and cannes martin had yet to send him his needed ships so he could not hope to cover them all nor hope to stand out to sea but not so far out that he could not espy signal fires to alert him where the british might strike nor hope to confront them in equal combat ship against ship either he glanced at hainaut wondering never believe what is offered me too easily either guillaume choundas frowned so quickly exchanged bearing his cunningly gathered information about the british squadron and the greatest news of all that jester and that bastard lewrie whod maimed him were one and the same when the british did not appear on the horizon where hed been assured they would hed begun to fret first in anger that a chance for revenge was delayed that hed have to wait to capture jester and carve her smirking bastard englishman into stew meat as he had lusted to do these past nine years so close at hand yet anger had cooled replaced by trepidation that hed been told a lie a cunning english lie that someone was in league with them and had passed the lie on who would wish him humiliated pouzin yes that could be it hed seemed so anxious to know the date of sailing so he could make his arrangement hed said but that could have been his way of getting what he needed to know which hed told the enemy there might never have been a smuggled letter from genoa at all it could have been pouzins fabrication alan lewrie though choundas fumed in silence clumpshuffling about the deck oblivious for once to his crippled state lieutenant alan lewrie commander alan lewrie lewrie lewrie lewrie hate him in the days since hainaut had returned with that startling revelation of who his foe was how close he was to vengeance that name and what he wished to do to the person bearing that name had become almost a litany like what he had once mumbled in rote duty over rosary beads but now at sea where a cooler head could prevail he had begun to wonder about the timing of that revelation why now just before a convoy a vitally important convoy it was late august almost september soon the weather would turn the gales arise cutting seaborne supplies by half even without a british squadron on the riviera the first snows would fall in those mountain passes and soldiers of both sides would go into winter quarters unable to wage war until spring bogged or snowbound to use me he sneered at last when a blinding epiphany struck to delude me disarm me to blind me with the brightness of revenge someone on the opposing side someone incalculably clever had revealed this to me through hainaut and perhaps even through pouzin waiting watching being fed information by traitors and greedy shop clerks biding his time until this could be used against me la vengeance now stood on east racing with every scrap of canvas spread aloft bounding and soaring cleaving foam with a sibilant spiteful hiss like an adder aroused and dangerous warning everything in sight to get out of striking distance she stood on alone though the rest of his patchwork squadron was too weak too slow too thinscantlinged for what she might discover the winds had not been that good the last few days the convoy and escort force could still be caught up if theyd found scant winds or foul there was a chance that capitaine de frйgate bayard the toohandsome beast would use his innate cleverness and put in each night in a snug harbor not daring an evening passage on the open sea would he be that clever choundas devoutly wished one of the rare ones clever and pretty was bayard yet how many tiny seaports had they passed getting closer to alassio and no sign of them it didnt mean that they were really a target choundas could tell himself perhaps the british didnt know of their presence that everything would turn out fine diano to larboard and now astern only a few miles more once around the headland that formed the spine of the western heights of the bay of alassio no sign of any enemy warships further out to sea a thought did cross his mind that it was a trap that whoever that very clever fellow was in the british camp theyd passed the tale knowing he would do thisrush to the scene to assure himself it made the right sort of sense to choundas who was more important to the war effort than he with all modesty he could not think of anyone else whose loss would do more harm to the cause of the revolution it was not hubris that awareness it was merely his studied opinion after coolly weighing the facts and the rest of the participants lewrie would lewrie be there would anyone as bait or artillery sang out a watch officer i hear gunfire hй merdel choundas groaned biting his lip in anguish sail ho sang out the foremast lookout dead on the bow he could hear it himself now stuttering dull brumbies a single flat bark an irregular cannonading around the headlands his convoy the langlaisthe bloodieswere in alassio bay sail is shiprigged the lookout cried again standing out to sea larboard tack her flag choundas howled aloft cupping his hands corvette the lookout shouted warship her flag her damned flag choundas screeched again cest langlais timonier helm down a point alee choundas snapped turning clumsily closehaul to windward brail up courses and chainsling the yards we will fight her drum us to action sail ho where away one point off th starbd bows lewrie scaled the mizzen shrouds on the starboard side telescope in hand so he could see for himself a ship a proper ship he thought not one of those lateenrigged locals she was bowson to jester aiming directly at her under a press of sail flinging a great mustache of sea foam about her forefoot and cutwater her arrogantly thrust bowsprit and jib boom cocking up and down as she rocked no more than a league to leeward standing on noreast closehauled and about four miles offshore the strange ships courses topsls tgallants and royals were cusped to the wind their leaches almost edgeon to him something diff rent though even as he watched the greater drumtaut billow astern of her forecourse went slack winging out alee brailing up her main course lewrie shouted down to his deck officers to fight shes a french warship mister bittfield run out the starboard battery now hoist signal enemy in sight he clambered down to hop the last three feet to the quarterdeck and stride to the nettings overlooking the waist he lifted his glass again should jester stand on shed keep the wind gauge above the foe but allow her to slip astern that french ship a frigate perhaps was as close to the wind as she could lie already and would slide aft as she stood on unless she tacked and bore away south to offer battle has to be a frigate alan frowned a lesser shipd haul her wind and not be confident of the outcome but shes so close inshore i think i like her there i allow her to tack out to deeper water shes all the maneuvering room in the world then aye stand on as we are for a bit more but then haul our wind and wear down to her then if her captain feels hes trapped himself hell have to come about tack cross the wind but ill still have the wind gauge of her and rake her bowson to me and helpless shed have to haul away west brail up the main course mister porter rig out the boarding nets loose sloppy bights mind lewrie smiled quartermaster half a point to weather without the force of the main course jester slowed sailing off the wind toward the souwest the beginnings of a levanter an easterly on her larboard quarters altering course making it more of a run downwind which took away the apparent wind making her seem slower still as she moved no faster than the breeze itself fullrigged ship right enough captain mister knolles stated small frigate or large corvette about our equal unless shes a thirtytwogun frigate with twelvepounders mister knolles alan speculated with a cautious growl two points off our bow and a mile nearer shell shave the western headland by at least two miles should she stand on as she is he cast a glance to jesters rear back toward the bay that lay off her starboard quarter surely there was enough noise coming from there enough highpiled rags of gun smoke to tell this frenchman that there were other british ships about he rather doubted that shed be foolish enough to go much further east than the headlands tip or risk being trapped between jester and the rest of the squadrons guns let her slide aft to about four points almost but not quite abeam before we wear mister knolles lewrie decided aloud perhaps half a point less than four then shell be betweenhe felt the urge to snicker between jester and the deepblue sea lets prepare hands to stations for wearing ship aye aye sir mister porter lieutenant knolles bellowed causing a stir a chorus of piping a stampede of bare horny feet three point off th starbd bows a lookout cried over that preparatory din as hands hauled taut on braces and sheets tacking another lookout shouted followed by the others in a reedy chorus of alarm avast mister knolles lewrie snapped countering the order quartermaster up your helm course due west ease her onto a run wind fine on the larboard quarter it was just possible that the frenchman had the slant around the headlands tip to see all he wished to see and had spotted the powder palls perhaps one or two more british warships the french ship came about across the eye of the wind slowing and luffing beginning to present her larboard side to jester wellhandled sir buchanon noted with professional interest none o at lubberly cockbillin an noggin youd expect aye she is mister buchanon lewrie frowned feeling a sudden foreboding a taut ships company a rarity among the frogs from what theyd seen so far a captain who acted with alacrity and pugnacious aggressiveness an eagerness it seemed for a standup fight another rarity that the frenchman had come about due south closehauled hard on the wind once more as if to claw himself up and take the wind gauge from jester less than two miles away now but they were approaching each other quickly mister knolles well harden up a mite quartermaster put yer helm alee lay her head westsouwest leadin wind sir seed er afore sir seaman rushing high aloft on the foremast cried corvette toulon there aye it was the pretty corvette that had fired the insolent challenge off cape sepet lewrie eyed her in his glass what had they determined twenty or twentytwo guns french eightpounders moren like which were the equal of his rated as ninepounders her pale goldenyellow upperworks had gone to seed since shed faded and dulled turned darker as more linseed tar or paint had been slapped on to control the ravages of exposure her white gunwale was still bright though and the black chain wale damme lewrie shivered lowering his telescope feeling real fear at the prospect of a fight for the first time instead of the taut nervousness he usually experienced the nervousness that had almost come to be a highstrung but manageable alertness poisson dor sir knolles queried you know her captain just like his old ship alan muttered feeling as shuddery and weak as he usually did after a fight was ended he slammed the telescoping tubes of his glass together striving to disguise the trembles in his fingers painted tartedup just like his old it was him no mister knolles lewrie told him trying for a grim amusement but i think i know her captain were in for a real scrap he looked astern again back into the bay of alassio had any ship read his hoist yet come about to sail out to aid him it didnt look like it jester was on her own against the devil choundas think he warned himself whatll he do once we close to gun range i can go closehauled upwind of him headed south else hes a chance to bowrake us hes french hell fire high chainshot multiple barshot to take our rigging down and cripple us he wears he exposes his stern to my guns he tacks again though after first broadsides itd be our stern wide open to raking what to expect he was always so clever so beastly good at it unpredictable its her capitaine hainaut exclaimed jester then god is good to us guillaume choundas nodded his caricature of a human face made even fiercer by a smile of feral pleasure sextant hainaut capitaine choundas demanded lewries jester had once been french he could measure the height of her mastheads above the sea and determine when his guns might reach not quite yet he sighed with impatience willing himself to wait but soon my brutal english beast soon so swaggering that lewrie so conceited and cocksure of just how gently life should treat the handsome and wellformed the landed aristocracythe son of a british knight money servants the best schools best of everything dissolute a randy rabbit and a wag hed learned of him thought himself infinitely clever those informers reports told him once hed regained access to ministry of marine files after so he could begin seeking his tormentor but never quite as clever as he believed again just like the english who depended upon luck fate and breeding to muddle through instead of applying themselves diligently they threw money at problems as if that would keep them safe hired others to do their dirty work like dismissing pregnant household servant girls never really tried in the fire never a bit more and his guns would reach at extreme elevation with mastdamaging shot he concluded a precious minute more in which to enjoy the taste of success at meeting him face to face stand on my dimwitted beast stand on pretty one be so very english and expect me to be conveniently clumsy like the other shop clerks do you know who you face yet this time i will beat you ready about lewrie cried of a sudden after long thought give her the wind gauge sir knolles wondered damn the wind gauge sir lewrie roared stations to wear mister bittfield doubleshot the larboard battery now for later he was too fearful covering it with bluster too impatient and edgy with frightful expectations of the unexpected he had to do something even if it was wrong besides wearing jester north would sail her back to the headland able to flee into the bay should guillaume choundas cripple her aloft and it would force choundas to maneuver might upset the careful aim of his gunners with their first broadside of disabling shot hands at stations sir hauled taut knolles reported mile and a bit i make it lewrie muttered twining fingers nervously rocking on his feet unable to stand stolid a long shot but his and ours mister bittfield well engage with the starboard battery at extreme elevation ready sir the master gunner replied sounding as dubious as his first officer mile just about lewrie sighed rising on his toes with anticipation wait wait mister bittfield fire on the up roll firel a broadside from the long nines the greatguns crashed out in angry roars and a sudden fogbank of smoke and sparks erupted from her starboard side with the wind gauge jester was heeled too far over for her solid roundshot to score crippling damage aloft the disadvantage of firing from upwind fall short perhaps skip into the enemy secure the starboard battery at runin ready about helm aweather new course norwest quartermaster wear ship he could feel his vessel wheel her decks coming level the wind coming stronger on the nape of his neck as she pivoted within the pall of her broadside which was hazing and misting as it expanded thinning to show him the french corvette which was firing moans warbles eldritch screeches wailing higher and higher in tone even as choundass ship was suddenly surrounded by feathers of spray as his own shot arrived fired high elevating quoins fully out and breeches resting on the carriages and her decks angled upward to the force of the wind on her fullandby course to windward crashes aloft crashes and bangs the royal mast and yard upon the main was shattered at the doublings bringing down the commissioning pendant sails and ropes in a blizzard the fore tgallant twitched as it was punctured by barshot and starshot punctures ripping open from luff to leach in an eyeblink forestays snapped and the outer flying jib lashed out to leeward shivering like a spook norwest sir spenser called easing his helm watching the main topsl for a clue to his luff and winds with the pendant gone ready larboard battry sir bittfield reported mile or less lewrie judged glad to have drawn first blood or first honors at the least better shootin range fire mister bittfield he urged gripping the railing with one hand chopping at the air with the other as if it held his sword cripple him bittfield he thought grimly save my poor arse sure o yer aim now wait for itt bittfield cautioned his gun captains still not trusting rahl to scamper about and train those barrels inward so their shot would converge amidships of their target following along behind quickly sensing how jester rode the sea when shed rise up decks almost level pent on the uproll waiting for a good one perhaps a convergence of wave and counterwave come on you perverse bloody perfectionist alan wished to yell ready on the uproll firel a stunning blast of sound explosions and the scream of truck carriages running inward axles and wheels howling breeching ropes and restraining bolts juddering bartaut making thick cable squeal forged iron moan eat it you bastarrddd lewrie howled too jittery to remain stoic and captainly he never had beennever would beany good at stoic at least fear had turned to something useful now that he was getting into a battle fever the insatiable kind that would leave him wringing wet spent and gasping the french corvette returned the favor again slightly later just as jesters doubleshotted barrage reached her there were more crashes aloft the foremast fightingtop seemed to explode into dust as a solid shot smashed into the upper mast bringing down the topsl and tgallant together cleaving away stays for both the inner jib and foretopmast staysl topmen aloft swivel gunners and marines in the top came spilling out and down riding the wreckage or flung bodily by the force of the strike two massive flashes of sparks and oaken splinters erupted alongside amidships as the main chains and stays writhed like disturbed asps and the entire upper mainmast groaned and creaked and supporting lower shrouds let go under the suddenly unequaled tension popping as loud as musket fire hullin her sir knolles cried hullin her twixt wind and water he hooted as he pointed to larboard at their foe plumes of spray skipped in lines toward the french ship some almost on her waterline bursts of dust and wood splinters as she was hit above the water around her midships gun ports half a mile sir buchanon adjudged more calmly runout bittfield was screaming his voice breaking on all the reeking smoke and his emotions point yer guns carronades as well stand clear ready jirel whoohoo he was gundrunk thats the way thats the way lewrie snarled pounding his fist on the railing just as caught up in the stink and roar of those monsters his beautiful reeking but beloved guns as the smashers on the quarterdeck came reeling backward on their slidecarriages in a bitter cloud of spent powder quartermaster steer half a point to loord close her he cant come up higher to the wind on me all he can do is haul off he thought with scintillating but frenetic crystal clarity well rake his stern unless he wears away or tacks twigg made sure hed know i was here availablehe cant scamper off thout trying to do me in moanings and warbles dire humming and this time roundshot hit lower jester reeled like a punchdrunk boxer as she was hulled shuddering with each savage blow taken a portion of the larboard gangway bulwark caved in scattering waisters and bracetenders splinters and shards from shattered iron shot keened amid the sudden screams of pain and fright men were down lucky jesters lucky people were bleeding dying hes tacking sir hes tacking spendlove wailed from the larboard side swinging soueast into wind broadside mister bittfield now aim high lewrie ordered take her rigging down while shes busy comin about knolles ready to wear about to eastnoreast er ist vounded zir rahl cried up from the waist i send to herr crewe even as crewe boiled up from the midships hatchway ladders still in his white apron and list slippers from the magazine the stays sir knolles panted beside him smudged with soot and smoke his hat askew might bring all the main topmasts down if we come about the windward stays are sound sir might ease the leeuns if we wear hands to the braces ready to wear sir lewrie retorted run out yer guns mister crewe intoned more calmly prime yer guns cock yer locksl porter hands to the braces ready to wear noreast knolles bellowed into his brass speaking trumpet point yer guns quoins half out ready fire no dammit lewrie groaned to himself you rushed em theyll shoot too low and in they lurched all but number five larboard ninepounder which had been struck dead on the muzzle and blown backward off its truck carriage trunnions ripped from the capsquares and its crew savaged brutal noise and a hellish reek of the roasting damned jester shaking and rattling under lewries feet and hands the enemy blotted out by the massive gush of burned niters ready sir knolles gasped wear ship helm alee he snapped soon as he heard scampering to the larboard side so he could see pressing up against the bulwarks to peer out through all that smoke to see if hed hurt choundas being flung backward thrown off his feet as a ball blasted in just above the gunwale splinters and shards flying upward an erose chunk carving the face of the bulwark down to the thickness of a single plank feeling his ship being pummeled and punctured beneath him her stout scantlings wailing in agony sah you kilt andrews demanded looming over him filling his entire vision lewrie blinked and kept on blinking to clear the red haze that kept blinding him blind he gibbered wildly blind as nelson oh the bastard hes done for me he flailed his arms and legs found that they still were attached and obeying rolled to his side and retched the coppery taste from his mouth knowing what blind fear tasted like at last a crumpled calico handkerchief smeared his face mildewy and redolent of tobacco blinking mindlessly panting and gasping air in terror of what bad news might be coming but his sight cleared with andrewss ministrations a firm hand clasped the handkerchief to his scalp carry on mister crewe he heard knolles rasp people were walking around him as uncaring as if he were a misplaced hammock roll he felt the guns go off the deck on which he lay shiver as the ship was punched sidewise by her own recoil there was a regular beat of juddering coming from her hull even more insistent than his racing heart god thered be another broadside in reply soon you tell me andrews am i killed got yah scalp shaved sah blood in ya eyes but help me up best hold dat right dar sah firmlike staunch de blood he held the cloth with his left hand clung to the railing over the waist with his right and almost swooned and saw double the pain was coming and he sucked air between his teeth as the first wave hit going crosseyed with it he swabbed his face his eye sockets with his right sleeve forever staining that fancy goldlace slashcuff but he could see with both eyes ooh law andrews flinched for both of them as a broadside came inboard more smashing timbers more screaming side planking as french carronade shot joined their long guns that juddering got noticeable became a deep plucking hum instead of an unnatural motion through it all the gun crews slaved away swabbing and overhauling tackle rushing up cartridge and shot ramming it home and pricking the vents run out yer guns crewe roared not so calm anymore and caught up in the madness alan took another suck of breath there lay choundass vessel not one cable to leeward of jesters left side just a little ahead and sailing parallel to them her own side looking gnawed at stovein here and there her pristine white gunwale turning gray with spent powder stains on the uproll fire mister crewe bugled a ragged broadside crashed out stuttering up and down jesters ports the enemy corvette lurched and seemed to wince as she was struck again by a hailstorm of shot delaying the runout of her own guns a precious moment payin off sir spenser called from the wheel no jibs jester could not lay close to the wind without them and slowly swung leeward in spite of a large portion of leehelm she and that corvette would angle together slowly closing the range if choundas held his course lewrie groaned as he saw that the wind would let her pinch up to weather at least one point or more choundas could throw his ship up so close to luffing that he could bowrake jester at nigh musket shot in another minute mister knolles ready to haul our wind course nornoreast lewrie snapped the effort of shouting making his head seem to explode with fresh pain mister crewe one more broadside then switch over to the starboard battery well rake his stern oh lord someone whispered in awe as choundass corvette lit up in flames flinging long thrusts of smoke at them she fired another broadside jester was pummeled sent reeling as iron smashed home aimed at her midships there was a tremendous pillar of spray alongside then a second the shuddery twist of the hull as it was struck down low by a graze then a direct hit and a mighty thonk of rupture a groan aloft that juddery humming ended suddenly replaced by a wail of pine and fir as her mainmast began to toppleeverything beyond the fightingtop swayed over the larboard side coming down like some sawn tree the main chains had taken another hit and everything was shot away that held it upright all they could do was duck and pray as it collapsed crashing down into the ocean in a rats nest of torn sails tangled rigging and broken yards to dangle on the gangway or bulwarks further tangled with the collapsed boarding nettings blinding the guns a discharge from one of the ninepounders might set alight the ruins jester was disarmed and powerless mister crewe starboard battery waisters and idlers alan cried in despair chop all that away now mister porter spenser steer due north best youre able with all that dragging hurry there was nothing left aloft for drive but the mizzen sailsspanker topsl and tgallant and theyd be lucky indeed to be able to steer effectively if at all with all that force so far astern spare stays juryrigged from focsle to the foretop knolles was shouting forward tc the hands digging free of the ruins jester had slowed drastically dragging herself almost to a stop bereft of wind power beyond crippled almost conquered hes going to win damn him alan felt like weeping his ship turned to scrap lumber defenseless against whatever might come he suspected choundas would close and board to take her as prize take his ship in a sea of bloodshed take him prisoner and what he felt like inflicting on him once they were anchored in a french port he no by god you want me youll have to kill me you want jester then youll have her over my dead body lewrie drew his sword and let it glisten in the sun starboard battry ready sir crewe rasped he looked down on his gun deck on his people the ports were open the artillery runout grimy bleeding from cuts and splinters mouths agape with terror and some of them shivering amid the carnage the dead theyll not have us lewrie roared theyll not have herl if they try well kill every last motherson of em close shooting and make em pay mister crewe and he was amazed that they could raise a cheer a weak one aye but an angry defiant cheer for their ship choundas had slipped ahead of course his rigging mostly free of damage and his sails still drawing power headed eastnoreast on the wind but even then easing her braces and sheets to fall off and employ her larboard guns and her stern her vulnerably thin stern fire as you bear mister crewe hold her spenser nothing to loord for just a minute he pleaded aye aye sir spenser grunted as he and brauer and two more hands threw all their weight on the spokes to hold full leehelm the rudder jammed hardover point crewe ordered as you bear fire from the focsle carronade then aft to the quarterdeck some swivels firing too a controlled steady tolling the guns so hot by now they leaped off the deck with recoil titanic crashes and bellows of rage deafening thunders and harsh ejaculations of gunpowder all dun gray and brown shot through with embers and flaming bits of wad the range was little over a cable and the results were immediate the corvettes stern was caved in glass sashwindows blown in both quartergalleries shattered her taffrail and flag lockers blown skyward the name board and dead lights to the officers wardroom all were smashed beyond recognition her transom post was whittled by shot and her rudder twitched like a hounds ear and there would be carnage further forward as hard ninepound shot caromed down the length of her open gun deck breaking into hundreds of jagged shards on gun barrels and carriages creating a maelstrom of wood splinters to quill her crew to rip and rend they could hear her and them wail they imagined cant old er sir spenser gasped sorry but theys too much drag tlarboard payin off again make due north just reload mister crewe alan demanded one more time tackin knolles countered shes going over to larboard sir now shell rake our stern lewrie groaned once she gets settled down on larboard tack shell make souwest easy he thought get that raffle chopped away porter hurry with that stays and rig the main topmast stays from the maintop to a focsle ladder if thats all you have i need jibs any sort o jibs now close as choundas was hed get a quartering slant across hms jesters stern at about the same range as the shot shed delivered lewrie paced to the larboard side to see the last of the mess going over the side the last raveled stays and braces cut with a great splash the last of the upper masts hit the water to float away aft better sir spenser encouraged spinning the spokes due east lewrie asked him mebbe sir spenser allowed chomping on his tobacco quid in a frenzy noreast at best i think capm were so slow good enough then ready mister crewe were coming about to weather some more for you well be ready sir crewe stolidly assured him give him a broadside while hes tacking then then load and run out quick as you can soon as hes in arcs choundas was standing away southerly already on the eyes of the wind sails rustling and luffing and jibs just beginning to fill and draw his ship would heel over as she felt the force of the wind upon her bracedaround square sails delaying that raking broadside a little until she was more in control her decks more level and then meleager sir hyde crowed signal sir do you require assistance hoist affirmative mister hyde lewrie yelped in relief youre goddamned right we do and there she was about a mile off and coming hard beating to windward with a bone in her teeth guns run out and ready shed clear that western headland by miles pass ahead of jesters bows even if she managed to attain noreast and chase this foe away lewrie went to the starboard side of his quarterdeck wincing in agony with each step left hand still clamped atop his skull choundas was there he was certain even at yards he thought there was a man on that opposing quarterdeck a slight man with pale skin and dull reddish hair a man who wore a large black patch a man who was shaking his fists at him his mouth open to howl curses at him got jibs sir at last buchanon told him come aweather close as shell lay aye mister buchanon alan replied with the shuddery sort of giggle a condemned felon might essay right after a hanging rope snapped and dumped him alive in the mud under the gallows jester came up toward the wind struggling to lay noreast as choundas heeled over and stood out to sea bearing souwest men were aloft letting the corvettes royals fall sterntostern they were separating no guns able to bear choundas had been driven away not able to deal with a frigates fire jester had been saved would go on living it was over for the moment lewrie thought wearily thered be a next time twigg would see to that damn his blood pray god cockburn catches him up and shoots him to toothpicks spares me the spares me we continue on this course sir well block meleagers course buchanon cautioned close by his side buchanon put a steadying arm to lewrie as he swayed and sagged utterly spent aye come about again mister buchanon due north steer for the western headland so cockburn gets a clear passage to seaward closehauled unless he wishes to come inshore of us cut the corner too tired to think as if hed gone fifteen rounds with a bullybuck at a village fair it always was this way after a hard fight with him he leaned on the bulwarks tried to sheath his sword mister hyde hoist submit followed by pursue the enemy more closely vast coming about mister buchanon well stand on cockburn can gain on the bastard if he cuts inshore of us stand on lewrie decided hed wait until meleager was abeam then come about into the shelter of alassio bay jester would need quick repairs perhaps even a tow to get back to safety at vado shed never crawl there on her own porter he shouted wincing again pipe secure from quarters then lets see what needs doing we can do for ourselves er aye aye sir will cony shouted back he shrugged and pointed to a broken figure being borne below by the surgeons loblolly boys on a carrying board bosun porter was groaning and writhing over several large jagged splinters his right arm ravaged and soaked with gore ill tend t hit sir cony assured him beginning to rouse stunned hands back to their posts fancy a sip o sometin capum andrews tempted offering a small pewter flask on the sly neat rum sah put de fire back in yah belly thankee andrews lewrie sighed taking a small sip and wondering what thanks hed have to give cockburn for saving his bacon he grimaced at the sharp bite of the rum and how even more insufferable captain cockburn might be in future or how low hed be groveling in gratitude pretending to like the taste of boot polish grateful aye alan realized with a small mournful groan of relief he takes him or kills him stead of me ill buss his blind cheeks i dont ever wish to cross that bastards hawse again ever chapter a desperate action sir nelson told him in the privacy of agamemnons greatcabins gallantly carried he added a bit more praise very similar to their last meeting though thrown out rather offhandedly not quite so congratulatory and bitten off delivered in a moody frownful snappishness five dead a dozen wounded i am sorry for your losses the only losses the squadron suffered in our cuttingout expedition not a single man even hurt aboard the rest my condolences the rest of the squadron didnt have to contend with choundas sir alan told him a bit put off by nelsons less than charitable air wondering if the killed and wounded had ruined what might have been a fine report for nelson to submit to admiral hotham youre quite sure it was him i take it nelson demanded of him my opposite number this willothewisp choundas no error sir saw him with my glass as he hauled his wind to break off the action sternto to us a mite uglier than last i saw of him in the far so this mister silberberg wrote to me lewrie captain nelson grumbled his long dainty fingers fretting papers on his desk still standing and looking down distractedly i do not very much care for spycraft nor for those who engage in it valuable though their information may be at times they some of them put far too little emphasis or value on the fighting man take too much upon themselves and too much of the credit it sounds as if mister silberberg is now attempting to dictate to you as well sir alan scoffed offering a commiserating grin and thinking twigg had a challenge on his hands for once that is of no matter sir nelson grunted vexing his mouth in annoyance or a bad memory he looked up at last as if resolved to the solution of a matter that plagued him there are before me commander lewrie at least three grave items anent you and your ship items most vexing i thought it best to discuss them with you here in total privacy before they become formal complaints answerable to higher authorities perhaps a court what a court lewrie gawped he creased his brow in utter puzzlement which caused pain in his shaved and restitched scalp wound and wriggled in his chair recrossing his legs in defense the first sir nelson bleakly intoned perhaps even with some anger which was something new about him for alan to discover concerns your raid on bordighera theres a letter of complaint just given mister drake from the savoian government that your ship cited by name fired upon the town center their fishing fleet and homes and shops along the eastern shore resulting in damage and destruction and in some civilian injuries and deaths i am told that mister drake is on warning that their former masters our sardinian allies also contemplate a formal diplomatic grievance the genoese have also formally demanded an explanation as to whether the charges are true and if so is this the way we mean to enforce our embargoby the indiscriminate slaughter of innocents and the destruction of civilian property now sir for the record did you engage in any indiscriminate firing he coldly demanded what the no sir by god i did not sir lewrie countered quickly outraged you have my report we fired shoreward just twice once wed silenced the battery and entered harbor first to eliminate the french troops so my lieutenant knolles had a free hand our aim was those soldiers with canister and grape not solidshot to level buildings a bit of damage might have been done i grant you sir windows smashed and such but we never fired on the town proper never fired upon the beached fishing boats since they were bordigheras livelihood our second was a single roundshot over the heads of the looters to dissuade them pillaging the french dead and wounded sir far over sir fallofshot was beyond the town in the eastern hills we were about two cables off the beach sir and fired at maximum elevation quoin out so theres no way any civilians could have been harmed sir a bit unfortunate though perhaps unnecessary nelson said gloomily the specific charges are replete with eyewitness testimony that you loosed a full broadside not a single round killing or wounding many of those whod come out to succor the wounded succor mine arse sir alan spat that sir is a lying packet concocted by the frogs they were looting pure and simple i put a stop to it french soldiers or no sir they didnt deserve that pawing and stripping as they were dying besides sir the savoian governments a pack of toadies and bootlickers to their new frog masters one witness purports to be a french midshipman jules hainaut nelson informed him the prisoner you took just exchanged how convenient sir alan griped a toady to choundas he is consider the source sir do you ask mister silberberg i have lewrie i know of your past association with this man and the reasons choundas might have to wish to see you ruined nelson agreed albeit reluctantly and the good use he made of returning this hainaut to him the problem though well there you are then sir alan grinned relaxing you will not interrupt sir nelson burst forth mottling with sudden rage clap your goddamned mouth shut and listen sir aye sir lewrie mumbled in astonishment to hear the minnikin ammiraglio piccolo nelson shoutingcursing of course its a lie lewrie nelson fumed lowering his voice from a quarterdeck bellow a damnable lie but one the genoese and everyone else will believe the city mob takes it as bloody gospel and it doesnt help that their own governments letter in question has given it an official stamp whatever your reasons for firing that shot you did it and i cant deny it cant refute the whole damned thing just quibble bout the particulars and do you know how lame that makes us sound god almighty lewrie this might undermine the embargo tie my hands result in correspondence back and forth with admiral hotham perhaps even london it might result in our sudden withdrawal under a cloud and make this squadron the royal navy and his majestys government a foul and clumsy jape a laughingstock alan opened his mouth to make a contradiction just what he didnt know right off but nelsons steely glare shusshed him anew making matters worse sir nelson hammered onward relentlessly there are flyers making the rounds in several italian cities adverting this incident as well as captain cockburns seizure of il furioso as a continuing compendium of british atrocities but those were successfully answered and settled sir all a packet of lies start to finish i grant you but what recognition genoa made of their own breach of neutrality and their acquiescence pon the matter is not recorded so it becomes another nail in our coffin another victory in a war of words and opinions which we are losing nelson almost snarled half at lewrie half at a form of war conducted by cowardly faceless innuendo and lying also cited in these flyers lewrie though of yet not mentioned anywhere official is a further even more serious charge gainst you and your ship sir dear christ what else lewrie quavered you told me last year bout being off ushant at the glorious first of june battle lewrie nelson posed solemn again as another example of englands supposed perfidy the flyers allege you and your ship mentioned both by name entered combat flying false colors that you engaged a french frigate under their flag may we at least be able to successfully refute that sir and in so doing cast doubt pon the whole uhm lewrie squirmed innards icing up in fear well not exactly sir what nelson bellowed goddamn you for a codshead sir oh christ im in the quag for certain now alan thought to my best recollection sir he began to explain again most carefully we hoisted french colors as we neared the lee side of the french line of battle so their seventyfours at the hindend which we had to tack around wouldnt riddle us sir i hoped it might fool the frigate that had been pursuing us since daybreak but he wasnt taken in he opened pon us sir first we put the ship about to shave the end of their line and had to return fire if we wished to escape we opened fire under their tricolor sir which fact my first pointed out to me at which time their flag was lowered and the red ensign hoisted we began under french colors but concluded several broadsides properly declared just after tacking sir but not yet flaked down or belayed and that quickly done sir and thats the truth isnt it he asked himself where had that come from of a sudden and does he believe me nelson glared at him silent his fine sense of honor outraged beyond all temperance breathing high and shallow off the tops of his lungs his lip beginning to curl in disdain i wrote a report of it sir lewrie explained further gave it to admiral howes captain of the fleet to be sent to the admiralty ive received no reference to the event since that he was certain was a true statement but then after such a glorious victory whod mar its odor with even a hint of a sanction or sully the navys worldwide good opinion by even mentioning it christ one tiny slip a quarterminutes inattention out of a fifteenyear career and im to be ruined he gasped to himself courtmartialed and cashiered as dishonorable in shame a lucky ship hey a lucky captain mine arse and wheres bloody lir when you need that bastard mine arse on a bandbox i promised all my captains id uphold them lewrie captain nelson muttered more softly though aflame with righteous anger as long as they did their duty as best they saw it you however make that vow rather more than difficult to fulfill damn you sir whether you were half sunk on your beamends in the middle of a hurricane or pissed as a newt honor was breached sir no matter how briefly no matter how momentary your hairsplitting explanation may excuse it of all the blockheaded slipshod things you ever thought of doing accident or design it doesnt signify it casts the foulest asperions on navy king and country and at a time when i indeed england and what is left of the coalition can least afford it made our task here even harder and at the worst possible time do you see that lewrie aye sir alan groaned sure he was a goner perhaps its of no matter nelson sighed heavily i cannot print flyers of mine own to counter any of these charges without giving them greater circulation to deign to notice them is to show fear which gives them even further veracity and sir i cannot stoop to rebut this compounded slur in good conscience that would be creating lies to counter lies to then be caught lying later thats what mister silberberg is paid to do sir alan said with a miserable shrug but a touch of gallows humor in spite of all the admiralty took no notice of it nelson inquired with a very small sound of hopefulness no sir not a word nor have the french complained nelson glowered sitting at his desk at last now its public knowledge here though there is a chance paris might find it useful against us throughout europe as soon as this choundas person or his superiors gloat over what theyve gained by local exposure good god almighty he brooded lowering his head and massaging his injured brow admiral hotham must be told do you see lewrie loath as i am to communicate it to him this is a matter we cannot sweep under the rug he may assemble a court at san fiorenzo i see that sir lewrie sighed just as morosely thought better of you i did sir nelson declared softly turks island the way you spoke so movingly in your captains behalf when he was wounded way he spoke so well of you toulon taking jester just after saving all those refugees knew you were reputed to be a trifle rakehellish one whod tiptoe right to the edge the hamiltons in naples spoke well of you too lady emma especially i have found her to be a shrewd judge of character in the main lewrie bit on a knuckle diplomatically wondering what nelsond think if he knew hed got the leg over lady emma back in trouble is though lewrie youre slipshod slapdash more so than a proper captain ought be nelson accused given your previous good repute though i am given to believe your explanation your actions at bordighera were honorable give me copies of all officers journals log entries and such concerning ushant so i may satisfy myself one way or the other before i communicate it to admiral hotham there is always the possibility that he will deem it unworthy of note or given the circumstances that obtain of late he may consider it inexpedient to notice do you follow sir aye sir lewrie nodded hopefully hotham had trouble with recalling what he had for breakfast his bloody hat size or dither so long in making up what passed for his mind hed soon forget it in the meantime i may perfectly justify sending you away then though i am already badly in need of reinforcement nelson stated sent away sir i see lewrie stammered your ship took damage sir nelson said brightening a trifle i believe youve been eighteen months without a rent as well leghorn is the place for you lewrie with jester away out of sight out of mind the rabblerousers who spread these filthy lies will have to cut new ones from whole cloth to inflame italian resentments you will perform such limited repairs as you may here at vado bay then go to leghorn to complete them and do a proper refit take your time there no need to rush back once back i may find you useful again perhaps well offshore still out of sight and operating under a set of orders and cautions which i pray will spare us the risk of future embarrassments i see sir lewrie said even more gloomily well id best be about it then was that all sir you said three ah nelson frowned sternly again getting to his feet with his hands in the small of his back yes there was god what bloody else alan sagged adultery it is captain cockburns complaint sir that you impeded his pursuit of choundass vessel an enemy then flying by the placement of your ship by not obeying his flag signals to give him way seaward further that your replies were preemptory and unsuitable for a junior to send to a senior officer well damme lewrie muttered quite nonplussed a closerun thing already i warn you sir nelson rejoined he asked do you require assistance sir lewrie explained feeling like hed been doing so his entire bloody life my signals midshipman mister hydes deck log will show that sir to which i sent affirmative taking it to mean did i need rescuing from choundas and i most heartily did sir he laid out his crippled state barely under control and unable to steer clear barely underway and almost dead in the water how he had sent submit meaning that cockburn should cut inshore cutting a corner off the pursuit we did manage to claw about northerly sir when he ordered us to haul our wind i had no intent to impede him far from it i meant no disrespect or wished to serve him sauce either sir were he to catch choundas up and murder the bastard id be the first one to sport him a royal fireworks and a concert that man needs killing more than anyone ever i did see sir and if captain cockburn got the credit for it then id be the last man on earth to complain had he cut inshore well he broke off his pursuit not an hour later so nelson cut off his blathering with a chop of his hand ive already sensed animosity between you before sir and did i not warn you both that i wished my captains to work together did i not make that plain enough sir nelson intoned harshly i cannot tolerate officers under me who cant put aside personal grudges so the greater good is achieved with due deference and mutual respect but i was trying to communicate to him how best my situation and his desire for a fight might coincide sir he may be young to your lights lewrie nelson pointed out may have attained a great deal perhaps an unseemly great deal in so short a time but i find him to be one of the ablest most honest and courageous officers it has ever been my pleasure to meet intelligent with steel in his hand and aggressive with a burning desire to close with and destroy the foe well of course sir alan wriggled how many battles has england lost sir nelson sighed gazing off in the middle distance half turned away from him how many opportunities have we let slip because of bickering and rancor when they might have resulted in stupendous crushing victories all due to the spite and jealousy of our leaders i tell you you were at the battle of the chesapeake in eightyone i believe sir nelson snapped turning to face him again hood and graves sir confusing signals i doubt it there was lingering animosity tween them and hood disgusted that his superior allowed de grasse to stand out and exit the capes in good order so he held his division back from engaging and graves left unable to prevail unsupported hard as it pains me to say about our mutual patron and as fine a sailor a gentleman and officer as we may ever know he is not free of human failings there must be trust respect and cooperation between us sir nelson cried a messianic glint in his eye we must allow nothing to get in the way of duty nothing mankind will never be free of spite never become so contented with their lot or with one another that they march in lockstep like some windup clockwork toys i cannot hope nor order that my officers love one another lewrie but it is not too much to wish that they are respectful of one another and the others individual talents like a houseful of goodnatured brothers and cousins might deal among themselves chaffer at home with no vindictiveness but ready to spring to the defense of each individual with as much alacrity as they would for their familys good name i will not tolerate an officer who cannot work cheerfully with his fellows lewrie nor one who would play the serpent in the garden of eden behind the others backs aye sir lewrie replied cowed by the vehemence with which nelson spoke his stubborn enthusiasm you will write cockburn and make amends to him nelson told him ordered him explain yourself and your signals and the spirit in which they were intended you might also thank him even though you have already done so for rescuing you at your weakest moment quarterhour more and youd have been forced to strike no matter how doughty a defense you presented isnt that what you wrote in your report it would not hurt to tell cockburn that perhaps it may mollify him were i to offer him my tender sir little bombуlo ill have no need of her at leghorn lewrie offered hard as it pained him i should think that would be received as a most welcome and a most gracious gift lewrie nelson replied with a tiny smile a first of a gruesome halfhours cobbing he offered his hand now theres a wonder lewrie thought rising to shake it taking it for dismissal at last thank god i will make the strongest representation to admiral hotham that weve been hoodwinked by a clever and malicious french plot a letter from that fellow silberberg of yours may be of aid as well that is should your logs and journals satisfy me nelson stated levelly aye sir lewrie flummoxed seeing escape from nelsons ire and his predicament assuming that mister silberberg is of a mind to be forgiving since i didnt kill choundas for him that was his intent nelson frowned pulling at his nose for someone to do it sir didnt matter whom i was the bait to get at him just didnt expect him to pop up where he did and so quickly crippling his squadron as we did sir that was only a part of it same with scooping up his convoy to alassio and barring the fight with choundas it had been a redletter day a corvette la resolve taken along with a small corvette la republique and two barbary piratetype xebecs threemastedarmed galleys plus a total of seven assorted merchant ships crammed with munitions and food now weve bested him sir lewrie dared to suggest with his first grin of the last half hour as well his superiors might turn him out and give you an honorable foe probably a man less dangerous do you see then itll be silberbergs pigeon poison in the mans soup or a knife in the back in a dark alley his stockintrade find himself an assassin who can this choundas may be a wily foe lewrie nelson objected with revulsion as large a monster as he is painted aye but i doubt that anyone is so vital to the french nor our fortunes grown so bleak that we would ever sanction coldblooded murder to bring him to book guntogun or with crossed steel is one thing but thats repugnant to me to any honorable gentleman or christian war to the knife sir as mister silberberg put it long ago you associate with the wrong sort of people sir nelson said with a sniff of disdain and dont i just alan thought fighting a rueful smile not exactly my choice sir alan told him hes very good at using people whether they like it or not by god sir he will not use me nelson declared which gave alan as much joy as could be expected given the circumstances book v aut tuam mortem out meam your life or mine hercules furens lucius annaeus seneca chapter lewrie had always been pretty sure that there were some quite positive things to be said for greed and lust for mammon positive things most likely said from the comfort of an expensive club chair though tuscany may have gotten some of those inflammatory flyers and a few of the merchants some few of the shipyard workers of leghorn may have resented perhaps even despised jesters presence at the careenage in the graving dock or moored sternto at a stone quay dago fashion they didnt allow personal grudges to mix with business or a chance to turn a handsome profit on her repairs and her refit one hellacious profit if mister giless ledgers old mister udneys receipts and conys stores lists were anything to go by there were other profits to be made ashore too and leghorns brothels and taverns food stalls and chandlers pimps and bumboat marketers were as apolitically avaricious as the rest when it came to shillings or gold guineas and the resulting claims for damages to taverns and brothels when those of jesters people reliable enough to be trusted with shore leave occasionally went on a high ramble and were sometimes fetched back alongside in the custody of the neighborhood watch certainly glum and ever unsatisfied mister howse their surgeon was prospering he legoff mister paschal the sailmaker and one of the loblolly boys whod been a glovemakers assistant were making a killing on manufacturing cundumsor administering the mercury cure for the pox howses purchases of mercury were beginning to rival what a small but thriving silver refinery might consume cant you put saltpeter in their food or something mister howse lewrie crossly inquired of him i mind a rumor around more than a few schools i attended that it was done regular to reduce the parish pregnancy rates blamed on students or faculty buggery i have no definitive proof that such an admixture is efficacious captain howse grumbled an old wives tale more like and should medical science admit it as a proper medicament i am operating on a strictly limited admiralty allotment per annum for the purchase of which seems to be going for sheep gut and mercury his much putupon captain sighed in frustration over another damned indenture form from his medical staff should you order the ship back into discipline sir keep our men aboard and away from the whores you would find my expenditures and the crews good health and their moral state much improved im certain howse said in that truculent edgeofaccusatory way hed perfected to allow the people to engage in such licentious manner to spend on whores their vital and precious bodily essences which weakens their bodies and minds renders them lackluster and feeble of wits incites continual thoughts of lust contributing to their perpetual moral decline well ill say no more sir i should certainly hope so mister howse lewrie snapped at his breaking point the reek of fresh paint being slathered on by the barricoe the din of hammering and sawing had had him in an ill humor for days that and their enforced idleness what would you have of me sir lash em below seal the hatches on em and let em free only when we need em sir would you be happier if they flogged the palms of their hands raw from boxing the jesuit or would you like a buggers orgy in the cabletiers sir by god sir you hired on as a naval surgeon not a hedgepriest sew their wounds cure their bodily ills not societys sorry your flock need to gambol like a pack of spring lambs mister howse get blinddrunk and put the leg over some poll now and then theyre men sir not your social experiment i can see sir that discussion at this point is howse sulked you take that tone with me one more time sir lewrie warned him glad to have someone or something to rant at for release do you dare look cuttyeyed at me when we suffer casualties doing our duty and ill bloody break you mister howse men get hurt at sea whether its peace or war men die im not your heartless monster to sneer at cause weve lost a few since you came aboard men i knew men who served with me long before you brought your disdain you lewrie turned away and took a sip of his coffee on the verge of being personally insulting of abusing a gentleman howse did deserve that distinction at least the coffee was tepid and it stank from paint tasted like cool enamel thatll be all sir get out lewrie ordered very well sir howse all but coughed in outrage but determined to be his captains moral and intellectual superior to the end goddamn him lewrie whispered tossing his coffee overboard out the opened sashwindows in the transom porter minus his arm and pensioned off discharged bittfield off in hospital at san fiorenzo sure to die of sepsis rushing atop the amputated fore topmast five dead a dozen wounded aye and four of those maimed so badly theyd be cripples and pensioners once they got back to england teenaged topmen firstvoyage marines too young to shave proper not too many of the petty officers thank god lewrie thought or the able seamen the ship depended on mostly the feckless young the worst slaughter was usually reserved for them the worst heartbreak dolorous as the crew had been when theyd anchored at leghorn lewrie had known as mister howse never would that sailors were a resilient lot beaten and terrorized as theyd been with choundas closeaboard theyd stood game ready to dare to the last stubborn pride courage fear of letting mates down revenge for the fallen friends or that ineffable spirit of english sailors that their ship would win that their jester their home would never strike that had been what kept them from falling apart then and what would save them now a great deal of physical labor beginning with stripping her down to the fighting tops and gant lines hoisting out artillery shot powder and stores to float her onto a careenage shore so they could scorch off the weed on her bottom chip off barnacles search for rot and missing copper physical labor took their minds off fell musings a longdelayed distribution of a portion of the prize money they had earned had helped that and the chance for a spell ashore while jester was uninhabitable and days out of discipline once she was back afloat so they could caterwaul and carouse their way back to feeling like men who were unbeatable poxed some might have been staggering dizzily with their teeth gone gray from the mercury cure which no matter howses lofty disdain fetched him fifteen shillings per sufferer but they were still jesters floating catamaran workstages alongside bosuns chairs or wood trestles slung overboard so they could paint and tar a perceptive ear could ascertain that they were working cheerfully fiddle and fife played to divert them hands near the greatcabins quarter galleries chatted and joshed one another cursing the bosun of course for putting them to such a messy chore for tar stains and paint splotches on even their worst old slop trousers which was about all they wore at the moment rolled to their knees the scuttlebutts were kept full and handy for all the amount of thirstslaking water unrationed for once mister giles with only mild objections to the expense supplied smallbeer in liberal amounts there was fresh food come from shore almost every day along with the tons of chandlers goods lewrie sat down to read it over again mindboggled that he had been allowed so much that udney and the local admiralty shore agent at leghorn were so prodigal with navy funds well almost prodigal alan thought with a rare grin the prices local chandlers charged were downright sinful and limited the largesse he might take aboard new canvas and thread new rope cable for standing rigging and running rigging new replacement masts and sparsall tuscan pine or levant cedarof the highest bestseasoned quality tar turpentine pitch whitelead and copper to pay the bottom with barnaclepoisoning weedkilling lead over canvas and felt thin sheetcopper to seal that so jester would be as smooth as a babys arse and slip across the sea like a thoroughbred once more timber and planking of the best adriatic oak to replace smashed or wormed hull members and blownin bulwarks and paint lewrie gagged again as the breeze shifted bringing the heavy odor into his daycabin he threw his quill pen on the desk and leaned back in his chair recalling what a captain outfitting back home in an english port had written the admiralty once hed received the usual meager ration of paint from hm dockyards which side of the ship do you wish me to do sirs alan asked the echoing cabins with a faint chuckle toulon came slinking in from up forrud low to the deck imitating a caterpillar with a distressed grumpy trilling yowl on a beeline for lewries lap where once ensconced he could make his strongest complaints over some new catgalling disaster rather loudly poor puss whats got you alan cooed his hand came off toulons hindquarters wet with dull red inboardbulwarks paint which was used to disguise bloodstains christ you clumsy litfun youve put your tail in the paint pot aspinall sir fetch a cloth fore it dries on him might need one dipped in turpentine too no toulon dont lick it god there was a pair of kerseymere breeches that had seen their last day watch lewrie sighed a good shirt too if im not ill ask mister cony sir aspinall vowed back in a trice mister cony with porter gone will cony had risen to bosun and able seaman sadler one of the old cockerels from the times at toulon had become bosuns mate just as mister crewe was now the acting master gunner yeoman of the powder room hogge was gunners mate and the prussian rahl was acting yeoman another cockerel preston had become quartergunner though lewrie wasnt sure that rahls eye for gunnery wasnt wasted below in the magazines capum clerk mister mountjoy sah enter lewrie snapped trying to hold toulon still and not get paintstained until aspinall returned letters come aboard for you sir mountjoy announced he coughed into his fist looking cuttyeyed to all corners more softly he added and this too sir from your uhm banker hes ashore and wishes permission to come aboard sergeant bootheby to muster his marines mister mountjoy lewrie growled opening twiggs note first no matter how he hated doing that it was official after all full bullock kit red tunics and pipeclay well execute him by musketry at the taffrail а la admiral byng can can you do that sir mountjoy gaped should i mean no but i can wish sir alan sighed futilely very well tell the devious bastard he may come aboard a tradesmans welcome do you inform the harbor watch no honors aspinall returned to take toulon from him and carry him off to the pantry for a cleaning with some dishcloths moistened with turpentine well im damned lewrie whispered as he opened the second it was from signorina claudia mastandrea hed gotten several supportive kindly letters from her and her keeper senator marcello di silvano hed sent the senator the expected thankee for his invitation with apologies for missing the ball that followed twiggs doing damn his eyes maybe just as well though claudias first note had been just before jester sailed and more than the usual social obligation to a new acquaintance so pleased she met him sorry we missed our promised dance do forgive the forwardness and blahblahblah but laden with so much double meaning that she might have rewarded him with more than one turn around the floor that he still must allow her to show him that map that collection those treasures that there should be perfect freedom between them hmm after the battle with choundas another brace of letters the one from signore di silvano so outraged that he was being smeared with such a scurrillous set of lies promises to get to the bottom of it and refute them in concert with drake and nelson how di silvano had spoken to his fellow senators and the doge would use his every good office to maintain genoese neutrality and independence that lewrie should consider him a friend with many mutual historical interests to discuss when he returned from leghorn claudias though it was almost tearful that a good and decent man had been falsely accused and her remorse that genoa was so ungrateful to him a stronger hint concerning her high regard her inability to get him out of her mind a wistfulness hmm now thisun patron travels to leghorn and florence on family and commercial affairs and i must confess i have conspired to accompany him though once in the city we will be too little together most days and a great many evenings for he will be much upon the town and so very busy while i languish many evenings he must attend the rich and prominent in their homes or at the theaters accompanied by their wives and children to which i am not invited though his hosts being substantial men covertly maintain their own convenient pleasing and similar fictions hmm hmm hmm lewrie harrumphed feeling a stirring in spite of himself in his nether regions though our acquaintance has been so brief thus far i am constantly mindful of you and struck by how warm is my regard how often i muse that after knowing you much better i could not form a more perfect appraisal and appreciation of your fine qualities marcello will invite you ashore soon to renew his budding friendship do please accept so you and i may renew our own further should the needs of your ship allow you will then be free to call upon me while we are in leghorn or inform me of a shore residence you may use so we may dine would it not taste pretty much like lead paint or turpentine he felt badly in need of a glass of something for dutch courage at that very moment to dine intime well well just the two of us alone lewrie brooded it must be admitted on his behalf on past error and they were legion whenever hed been so idle so out of sorts and so sunk in the blue devils so close to shore and all its allures betty hillwood dolly fenton lady delia cantner soft rabbit phoebe and a host of others whose names hed forgotten if not their charms more than two months since alassio bay staying aboard most of the time or in communal shore lodgings while jester had been careened and empty maleonly suppers park strolls the opera that was in italian and wasnt meant to be understood anyway or concerts where the music didnt puzzle overly much with knolles mountjoy buchanon or the midshipmen as unwitting chaperons then back aboard sober alone but what was good for the geese was good for the gander hed let the hands have their ruts so why not no damme in enough bloody trouble already aint i he told himself sadly turning her note over and over in his fingers should i start again ill make a pig of meself he did espy and quickly take to memory the carefully written return address however duty refit so little time well i have to write her o course to beg off fig pigletteatsbouncersgod stop me fore i tup again mister silberberg is without sir mountjoy interrupted have the vicious twofaced fart come in then mister mountjoy lewrie barked in a quarterdeck voice loud enough for twigg to hear beyond on the gun deck and slipped the tootempting note from signorina mastandrea into the middle drawer of his desk and fetch me poor old toulon soons hes paintfree th widdle darlin lewrie said with a sudden surge of spite how very clever lewrie twiggsilberberg whispered feigning amusement though pale with sullen anger so good to see you again mister silberberg and hows me shares doin hey alan chortled youll pardon me if i dont rise you press me too far sir twigg hissed but softly i vow youll overreach someday to your regret pretty much what i thought of you sir lewrie whispered in return after you damn near got my arse knackered four dead four crippled like the score so far do you mister silberberg press me too far someday and alan shrugged flashing a toothy grin we need to talk sir privately twigg instructed tossing his head to the pantry where aspinall hummed and crooned over toulon to gentle him you and i no others and what about him lewrie asked his notice drawn to a side of beef in a dark suit who had accompanied twigg aboard feel need of bodyguarding sir a fine oxcarcass youve hired i must say here e be sir goodz new i reckon aspinall announced as he fetched the cat back got all at paint off im i did sir he werent fond o th scrubbin though toulon was set upon the desktop fluffed up with insult tail bottled up and lashing he would have finished washing his flank all by himself but for the odor and the presence of strangers with a meanspirited growl and hiss ears laid backwhich made twigg pale even more and cringe far back in his chairtoulon leapt away to go hide under something where he could sulk in private carping to catgods of how abused his pride was how unfair lifes portion thatll be all aspinall lewrie said go on deck if you please well fetch our own glasses you too mister mountjoy yes sir mountjoy replied mournful that he wasnt included this time now sir what do you and i have to discuss private or otherwise lewrie asked rising to open the wine cabinet for them brandy was too good he thought let em drink this cheap dago red you failed lewrie failed me twigg began swiveling about to keep his eyes on him not for want of trying sir or have you not noticed how bad jester was knocked about didnt know youd whistle him up quite that quickly else i would have swallowed my pride and requested meleager to stay seaward with me then hed have never dared sir twigg snapped impatiently as he accepted a glass a pour and tossed his wine back he made a face lurching back as if hed been poisoned and eyeing lewrie hellishsharp as if he wouldnt put poison past him you sir lewrie asked of the hulking stranger so tanned and fit so martial in his carriage whoever you are yes sir thankee the apparition spoke at last taking wine and sipping at it showing no trace of disappointment with its taste one of my associates lewrie twigg grumbled a most competent fellow exhousehold cavalry allow me looks far too intelligent to be household cavalry alan said tongueincheek nor british cavalry at all and if intelligent then howd he come to be stupid enough to associate with you sir one should never kick strange dogs sir the dark fellow said with a faint smile yet an air of menace theyve been known to bite officer lewrie surmised by his squirearchy perhaps kentish accent exofficer abscond with the mess funds did you or your majors daughter enough of this rancor lewrie twigg warned as you refer to me pon your life as silberberg you will take as gospel that my man is ever to be referred to as mister peel or excaptain peel not john peel surely alan snickered reminded of the old hunting song no tis james sir james peel the fellow purred offering his hand which lewrie had to shake right then captain peel mister silberberg lewrie said sitting down regretting his choice of wines which he also was forced to drink thin too fruity and acidy and freshpoured already had a redolence of paint thinner so what is so important that you sailed down from genoa coached twigg griped shifting as if in pain as to that gruesome necessity more later what is important lewrie is killing guillaume choundas still is that really necessary sir lewrie frowned we buggered him and his reputation took his convoy at alassio and bagged four of his warships such as they were and in spite of serving us as good as he got we damaged his own corvette id think his stock was quite low by now can you forget the far east sir twigg insisted whenever we thought wed truly crippled him he wriggled free and came back to bedevil us twice as strong as before no sir it wont be over till ive his head in a sack for all to see when last we met mister silberberg you told me you prided yourself on keeping things coolly logical and objective lewrie said with a dubious look frankly i think choundas is become your bugabear it sounds entirely personal and revengeful to me what can he hope to accomplish with the few ships he has left with nelson commanding the riviera coast and with your connections alerting us to every convoy in the far east he was the only pirate privateer whatever that paris would sanction so eliminating him was important wartime though hes just another ships captain at the moment a commander of a minor squadron there must be a hundred men in france just as potentially troubling hes in my bailiwick lewrie twigg objected stubbornly in charge of the squadron that runs supplies to support the french army which will gobble up all of northern italy if theyre not stopped it makes him my preeminent problem no matter our past connection if he is killed i save another region the grief of facing him if he dies choundas rises no higher he gets no frigates no ships of the line to play with can you possibly imagine the harm hed do were he to become a junior admiral then why not have one of your associates lewrie wondered aloud stop his business with a knife under the heart told you he has a clear head peel twigg smirked suddenly in glee when he thinks that is yes sir peel agreed stonyfaced peering at lewrie openly judging weighing and balancing hes well guarded lewrie twigg complained petulantly as he sipped more wine made another face made no new friends on his rise with the original revolutionaries had damned few from before those still alive that is once hed culled em for past slights imagined slights half ofem stays sober keeps his wits about him of which i do not have to tell you he has considerable personal guard force a pack of breton pets including this hainaut fellow we returned to him as for vices goes for the windward passage even with girls lewrie stuck in so we learned from the filipina villagers and chinese whores the younger and weaker the sweeter aye twigg snarled with revulsion barring someone doing him in like marat in his bathwater hes almost impossible to get at our abilities so to speak are not that firm in provence or along the riviera too much fear dye see mongst adult women and his tastes run to the small weak and helpless recruiting a girlchild victim stands little chance either that hed choose her or that she could summon nerve enough to do the deed we have a better plan though oh christ and it involves me does it lewrie groaned we played that card hell not fall for it a second time hot as my hatred for choundas is lewrie it cant hold a candle to his hatred for you twigg cackled entirely too pleased with himself do you both survive this war id expect hed be panting to kill you when youre both pensioners some things abide hell bite and what if i refuse sir lewrie snapped youre foreign office you cant order a serving officer or his ship twigg smirked reached into his coat and produced two letters one from hotham one from nelson lewrie noted with horror not afraid of him are you sir peel posed with a barely concealed sneer name your weapon and place and ill show you afraid sir didnt ask were you afraid o me sir peel egged him on i asked were you afraid o him lewrie took pause considering reading those two sets of orders aye i most fuckin well am fearful of im sir lewrie said at last with bald candor anyone whos ever had dealings with guillaume choundas has right to fear him or should were you to render me a valuable service lewrie twigg posed his pencillong thin fingers steepled under his skeletal chin which i swear to you involves no physical danger to your ship your crew or yourself which helps bring choundas to book would you do it you say that now sir lewrie countered still seething from peels goading and suspecting that it was twiggs arranging for peel to put him off balance with his sneer his cocked eyebrow but things always have a way of going from a walk to a gallop with you once you get the bit in your teeth theres no stopping you and there id be clinging to your schemes tail half dragged to death my people right with me thrown into peril all unwitting swear it on a bible lewrie twiggs eyes twinkled no harm will come to this ship you love so much her hands nor you this will not involve artillery nor steel a single nights light duties means im the only one daft enough to listen to you you mean lewrie shot back topping up his glass or damme he showed them a sly grin you mean to use me as bait again here in leghorn we dont have to sail that sounds like choundas has learned where jester lies and has sent some bullybucks to leghorn to do me in coached to town did you you said you did to keep an eye on the assassins hes dispatched right did he come himself and you want me to trail my colors where you can catch him and kill him told you he was imaginative too peel twigg sighed in disappointment like a tutor bored and despairing of a pupils lack of wit though not always clever when he is no lewrie choundas has pressing work up north he cant abandon his duties to suit his personal desires you run no risk of assassination choundas will await your death until he can arrange it by his own hand a facetoface rencontre hell not be satisfied with a report i dont believe that youre in any danger your admiral and captain nelson would never have issued these orders for your cooperation with me else besides twigg leaned forward elbows on the desktop the cabin shadowed as evilly as a conjuredup companion of satan and he was snickering knowing you as i do i am certain youll find this duty to be rather enjoyable in fact now will you refuse me sir disobey orders from your superiors i must admit to you sir that there is no other person in the entire royal navy who may perform this task since it most vitally concerns you and you alone it may very well be the last thing i ever ask of you and well call it quits after enjoyable he grunted with deep suspicion then quits as enjoyable as the night in the brothel on old clothes street in canton lewrie twigg tempted like the hoariest pimp in macao what the night i got my head bashed in by choundass coxn lewrie griped hellish fun that was whats the chore then as i seem to have no say in the matter anyway why to allow yourself to be seduced lewrie twigg replied beaming in triumph of his small victory youre hellishgood at that i know seduced alan gaped rocked back on his heels in utter shock have anyone particular in mind then do you he pictured the ugliest fubsiest mostraddled and bewhiskered old mort in all creation who unfortunately possessed information just vital to twigg concerning choundass and french intentions i most certainly do sir twigg cackled again it is my wish that you rattle senator marcello di silvanos mistress lewrie signorina claudia mastandrea what he cried why her mean tsay lord youll remember its orders for king and country he pled though suddenly not quite so averse to the duty as he might have been because we have discovered that she is a french spy sir what he reiterated beyond shocked beg pardon you why else do you think shed ever be interested in you sir the old schemer hooted with joy of his revelation chapter tell him peel twigg instructed once lewrie had calmed you recall the ledger book sir peel began getting to his feet to make free with a fresh bottle of a much better wine from alans cabinet the enigmatic heading ur not the initials of a single person rather a corporate entity captain lewrie peel said with a military mans proper deference to a naval officers title as you commented to my employer he told me a group of three twenty even sixty quite right sir peel at least was crisp in his delivery the perfect soldier reeling off a situation briefing compared to twiggs infernally circuitous maunderings it has two meanings one for the inner circle one for the outer peel smiled it stands for ultimi romani that is to say the last romans it spans italy every kingdom or republic made of substantial men with what they deem progressive idealistic republican and patriotic sentiments a cabal of romantics quite infatuated with the unification of italy first and foremost like the early republican era of ancient rome secondly for the expansion of a unified italy on the world stage which will come to resemble somewhat the scope of the roman empire all italy of course all mediterranean islands all of north africa egypt the levant turkey and the ottoman possessions in their grasp again as well as the holy land and eastern adriatic coast with the austrians removed as occupiers to achieve this twigg interjected theyve entered into a devils bargain with france to drive the austrians out overrun the peninsula and topple every sovereign state using french occupation as the catalyst for revolution become a unified french possession for a time only until they may negotiate or take by force their later autonomy counting on the coalition sir peel went on once twigg had his nose back in his brandy to so weaken france they can play silly buggers in the mediterranean see france so weaken england prussia or austria that once they have autonomy by hook or by crook wed welcome them as allies at the proper moment and acquiesce to their greater ambitions which involve savoia the french riviera and provence maybe even a portion of spain they hold that eventually the entire mediterranean must be christian but most importantly roman and that the rest of the great powers wouldnt mind seeing moslem power kicked back across the bosporus and the red sea catholic christian o course peel chuckled with a raised brow so theyd get in bed so to speak with revolutionary atheists to gain it lewrie pondered indeed sir anything to further the cause mister peel smiled ur has an inner meaning much like masonry were fairly sure that it refers to a particular set of collaborators theyre quite cleverly compartmented so the exposure of one minor regional group would never expose the whole ur also stands for one man ultimo romano who may be in charge throughout italy or merely the pocket in this region the greatest roman of them all sir the last roman from this mans correspondence weve discovered a tantalizing clue to a larger cabal to which he seems to be answerable which goes by the enigmatic notation of peenumeral one either a higher council that pulls all the strings of which hes a member or a single person p as in pope or p as in papa peeprimo or the first one god only knows captain lewrie peel shrugged giving him the honorific title of his post by tracing correspondence from gallado and randazzo we have found the regional leaders identity signore marcello di silvano why that twofaced canting hound lewrie fumed hes written me so humble so supportive so politically astute twigg laughed whod be suspected of treason the least than the patriot who brays the loudest signore di silvano wears a halfdozen faces depending upon whom hes dealing with i expect he found gulling you with sympathy and friendship to be an amusing exercise no more just keeping his hand in practicing his pose of handwringin puppyeyed insincere mendacity so you want me to bed his mistress and somehow winkle information from her bout his plans lewrie frowned god no lewrie twigg boomed almost wheezing with amusement bless me but youre far too thick for that no sir you are the one to be winkled signorina mastandrea knows what shes about you let the professional do her work youre certain shes a french spy then lewrie had to ask no doubt about it sir twigg informed him a gift to the senator bout the time savoia was overrun like your corsican doxy shes of mixed parentage french and italian not from bergamo as she tells people but breil near the old french border got her marching orders from my opposite number to go to genoa and cozy up to silvano who had the means to pass messages and was already in contact with the french huge landowner do you recall estates all up and down the riviera estate managers and overseers goodscarts to and from those farms pass all the time even through austrianheld lands thats how she contacts her employers and how di silvano services his local roman patriots by land and sea intercepted a few of his found one from her and read it rather laughable encryption actually wouldnt think a woman was capable of mastering such but she did were she a man id have found a tougher code to crack i expect she doesnt work for choundas then lewrie inquired rather earnestly though he couldnt feature a woman so beautiful even being in the same province as choundas much less agreeing to do his dirty work even in his younger days scrubbed up and looking human her superiors have sometimes given her tasks that might serve his interests and his squadrons twigg allowed with a breezy wave of one hand but she is not in his direct employ and what is this concern sir sweet on her are you i forgot youve already contemplated topping her a most fetchin morsel aint she sorry that i interrupted your courtship in genoa might have been advantageous for you two to have an existing relationship but back then she had me fooled i took her as nothing more than a silly roundheeled slut too stupid to stay faithful to a rich and vengeful master all sheepeyed over the pretty young sailor there is a risk the senator might not enjoy her chore with you taken a fancy to her no matter theyve a working relationship she and the senator are on intimate terms i know for a fact so intimate and exclusive since he ditched tother mistress he had at pariss bidding that he dares to sport with her bareback do you get my meaning you might not even need cundums no lewrie your job will be to play her fool then let slip to her what we wish you to let slip once shes got you in the proper frame of mind and that is lewrie snorted still dubious and edgy no matter how pleasurable his duty might be how hed fantasized about claudia mastandrea twigg had dreamt it up after all so choundas of course twigg sniffed him and the austrians the austrians lewrie drawled now totally confused finest army in europe sir peel stated most drolly and the slowest we pay them a hideous sum of money to stay in the coalition twigg sighed wearily i do not know whether their emperor has ordered de vins to delay his campaign another season so they may touch another four million pounds sterling of ours or whether general de vins is a raging fool all their damned generals war is a germans trade sir thats when they earn their highest pay and get the most adulation so why wrap things up too early then go back to barracks and be bored to death or perhaps general de vins is much like our poor hotham too timorous and dithering to risk failure either way the nub is that we owe the austrians another installment in gold no way to ship it downriver along the rhine with the frogs at its mouth nor through hamburg overland it has to come by sea to vado bay which is de vinss only link to the sea a substantial sum of money lewrie and so lewrie asked getting suspicious again we have allowed certain information to be overheard by local informers that such a shipment was forthcoming twigg related going weaselly and twisting in his chair a sure sign of trouble that it was to come from london to gibraltar then to port mahon at minorca then up to san fiorenzo bay since it carried the coinage to pay admiral hothams fleet then it would put into vado bay to be delivered to the austrians should it not arrive austria might withdraw troops from the genoese riviera should france get their hands on it theyd be dancing in a positive shower of yellowboys enough to purchase anything they need and prop up their new currency at home restive the frogs at home dye see subsequently weve revealed the sum to be around ј the name of the ship to carry it and the name of the escort hms jester now wait a bloody minute you said it was that wed be easy sir peel suggested quickly youll burst a blood vessel keel over in apoplexy i swear what better bait can there be for this fellow choundas he was a pirate before the lure of gold is almost irresistible plus the hope that you are the escort two birds with one plus what a coup with such farreaching repercussions were he to weaken the coalition or lay all northern italy open to the french army with a single deed with his convoys so savaged recently and his repute in paris sinking he must do something to recoup his own estate there will be a ship at sea a ship much like yours painted in the same color scheme the merchantman though will be a twodecker th rate of fifty guns a naval vessel even does he fetch two corvettes to take her hell be confounded even does he escape a second time his fame will be broken and there are many french officers whod love to see him come a cropper it will be eminently plausible lewrie twigg explained with a sly look nelson has lost the services of resolution and speedy for the moment so he has nothing to spare hotham husbands every frigate or sloop of war at san fiorenzo and is already short himself jester is just refitted though currently unemployed and because of your supposed errors at bordighera and ushant youre not particularly welcome at either san fiorenzo or vado bay yours is the only warship to be spared as escort or dispatch vessel for the nonce while the real shipment i take it none of your concern sir twigg snapped the less you know the less you might blab by accident signorina mastandrea has already reported to her masters i know it for a fact know their orders to her verbatim shes to come to leghorn which she has confirm reports from local informers anent your ships state of repair what orders you might have and when jester may be expected to sail and arrive at vado bay do they know the ports of call when i could depart to meet the cargo ship at gibraltar and when i finish at vado bay lewrie surmised theyd have a rough idea of where wed be any given day assuming seasonal winds and seas within fifty miles or so two ships patrolling lewrie rose and went to his chartspace to fetch a largescale sea chart he brought it back to the desk and spread it out for twigg and peel to look at id expect choundas to be greedy lewrie pondered aloud using a pair of brass dividers to march off legs of a course and clever a little fillip sirs to not only rob the austrians but steal the navy pay chests sailors might be used to being one or two years in arrears in their pay but soldiers usually arent does he take the ship before she reaches san fiorenzo both the army and navy are cheated debts to local chandlers and merchants go unpaid troops and ships crews will be demoralized aye choundas would like that and so would his superiors might even turn corsican sentiment against us because of it very clever mister peel muttered though speaking more of this sailors shrewd calculations than of their foe and sharing a look with his employer with one brow cocked in reappraisal of all that twigg had told him of lewries wits you would expect him where sir west of corsica and due south of the iles dhyиres lewrie replied slowly stepping off distances were i choundas id patrol standing northandsouth along six degrees east down to the latitude of the straits of bonifacio around forty degrees north perhaps as high as fortythree degrees he told them sketching out a rough box on the chart with a pencil stub a ship from port mahon in the balearics onpassage for san fiorenzo or vado bay must pass through this area he was unaware of peels newfound regard nor of twiggs grudging hooded smile of pleasure too lost in speculation and in his own element two ships you think sir averageclear days each could see twelve miles all about from their mast trucks ten miles separation so they could read signals betwixt em say they could sweep a moving rectangle thirty to thirtyfive miles long northtosouth and twentyfour miles wide even at a slow six knots theyd scour the area twice over each day its too far west of corsica to expect interference from hothams fleet too far south of france for the escort to expect danger thats more likely near corsicas norwest tip around calvi before they get to san fiorenzo just as they enter the fringes of the ligurian sea he may strike sooner lurk off minorca but thats a long way away from his assigned region sirs lewrie said tossing down divider and rule looking up at last unless hes been reinforced lately taking two corvettes his best most like will weaken his squadron and hold up any planned convoys till theyre back he cant roam too far afield nor for very long does he wish to keep his head twigg said with almost a purr of pleasure so choundas may be best expected here in this rough area where i trust it will be he who is the biter bit where he will get the greatest surprise of his life and his last a good possibility sir lewrie shrugged hedging his bets now all thats wanting is for the signorina to get in touch twigg beamed hungrily rubbing his hands together so we may arrange your tryst with her ive taken the liberty of engaging shore lodging lewrie somewhere quiet refined where mister peel and i may hide ourselves stand guard observe and listen so were sure theres no interference that the bait is properly taken hmm oh you mean something like this sir lewrie smirked opening his desk drawer and dropping her note atop the chart why yess lewrie twigg drawled most contented that his scheme was well afoot something very much like thatd do nicely chapter it was raining that night in leghorn just enough to temper the days balmy warmth but not enough to cool the evening in the late october afterglow of the lion sun season a sullen persistent weak rain that made it feel almost as muggy as high summer just enough rain to gurgle off the roof tiles trickle down the tiled eaves into the gutters and sigh down the tile or lead downspouts or plash on the balconies and windowsills which made it almost impossible for twigg or peel to hear much of what was said in the adjoining rooms even with drinking glasses pressed to the thin lathandplaster dividing wall ears against the bases twigg heaved another huge sigh of grumpy frustration that a perfectly good guttapercha stethoscopic tube had been overpowered by the sluicing of the rain and sough of the wind that he was too old to be stooping against a wall in such a crabbed position and that he was far too senior now to still be doing a younger legman agents duties ah something sir peel began to say perking up sssst twigg hissed straining to hear damme just even without their improvised devices they could now hear what transpired in the apartment adjoining theirs not the whispery billing and cooing of muttered pillow talk which might contain the questions a woman spy had been tasked to ask nor the beginning of lewries replies in which hed been strictly coached to be tossed off casually feigning alcoholandlustinspired carelessness either my god mans a bloody stoat peel whispered rather in awe of the passionate noises coming through the wall both of em thrice in the last hour i make it he sighed enviously as he went to the table to pour himself some wine putting his listening device to a more prosaic use twigg remained sitting lumpish twiddling his long thumbs with a scowl on his face as the carefully placed bedstead next door up against the wall so they could hear better began to cry outslats side rails and ropes creaking he grimaced as names were whined or mewed between groans and muffled enthusiasms for impending bliss doesnt have to make a meal of it twigg carped get on what man wouldnt given the chance peel chuckled to himself wondering if there would ever come a time in his duty to twigg king and country when he was the actor in such a delightful bit of spycraftinstead of the listener or the arranger damn this rain twigg muttered sour damn him following your last advice he is sir peel commented a bit tongueincheek as he discovered a neglected roastchicken thigh among the supper plates lay back grit your teeth and think of england pahh twigg spat rueing that cynical parting shot of his a soft keening a frantic yowl of abandon arose as the headboard began to thump against the wall in rhythm with audible bulllike pants and quavery shouts of god claudia darlin you lovely and those si si alan dio miу si pahh twigg reiterated swiveling on a hard dining chair sounds as if shes beyond thinking of france and her revolutionary ardor too sir peel dared to snicker twiggs hugely unamused glower was enough to silence him to chew on the thigh as a framed picture on their side of the wall went askew with the last triumphant thuddings and half screams of mutual rapture followed by many groans and weepy shuddery sighs of content now get on with it you two twigg snarled impatient for intelligent speech again she really is a blonde alan thought most happily spent and so pleasantly nestled with her sprawled half atop him his hands stroking such a wee bottom a cunningly small waist and the tops of her thighs bouncers on his chest god yes big as twelvepounder shot but claudia was so exquisite a miniature thankee twigg never say another bad thing about ya he vowed alan claudia huskily whispered purring and sensuously catsoft alongside i knew moment i saw you we would be lovers mi amato but i never guessed so meraviglioso so uhmm cara mia he purred back hoping her clinging fondness her passion hadnt been completely sham her eyes going so dewy open caro mнo she chuckled gently after a long soul kiss you will have long in leghorn to be my caro miу my soul si and after we will both be in genoa to share this bliss alan she pressed her face to his shoulder hugging strong shifting a thigh across his loins at bloody last twigg whispered glued to the wall again peel remained standing to finish his wine so he could put his glass back to kings service the rain still trickled echoing in the spouts or plonking loudly in the collection barrels at ground level he went to close the balcony doors though it would be stifling without the faint cooling breeze the rain had brought another damned noise on a street chosen for light traffic after dark where carriage wheels on cobblestones wouldnt intrude now at the very worst time came the clopping millwheel grinding of a coachandfour in the street below close those twigg directed snapping his fingers at peel who shut the doors down to a tiny crack from which he could see back in the shadows of their darkened room hullo stopping here he winced warily he felt in his pockets for a pair of small doublebarrel barkers in case the coachs occupants were french bullybucks despite twiggs blithe assurances that there was no physical danger sir he alerted in a small voice stopping here sir not now twigg waved off too intent on listening a lodginghouse tiler emerged with a lanthorn in the small nimbus of torchlight before the doors and the postillion boy from the back of the coach alit to open the door and hand down a fashionably dressed young lady peel relaxed when he saw her pay off the driver that shed come alone no luggage to speak of either just the usual drawstring velvet purse and a small toiletries satchel shaped like a small chest a most beautiful young mediterranean lady with rich dark hair and eyes a faint olive hue to her high excited color most fetchin and handsome peel took note appreciatively quite young but dressed as grand as any titled london ladyperhaps better young heiresses had been excaptain peels downfall so he knew best when it came to appraising his womanflesh he thought her ј on the hoof peel bared his teeth and snickered thinking a wealthy tuscan father was in trouble if his daughter was off to sport the night with a caddish penniless lover no bother sir just a single lady peel whispered hmmph twigg grunted squirming as the coach clattered away drowning out his vigil you try peel youve younger ears peel replaced him at the wall while twigg stood and stretched to ease the kinks in his back and shoulders knowing he was definitely too old for this work he frowned suddenly turned to share a wary quizzical look with peel as footsteps sounded from the stairwell then from the landingthen in their hallway damme twigg sighed drawing one of his own pocket pistols and pulling the righthand barrel back to half cock he crossed to the door on catfeet to press his overstressed ear to the door he heard voices in the hall muffled italian light shifted at his feet through the gap above the doorsill he dared to open the door a crack to see who it might be hoping theyd pass on by to other apartments farther alongbut no he pulled the door open a bit more stuck his head around it to see a servant rapping on lewries door commandante lewrie he said and the young lady with him bouncing on her toes in excitement of her great surprise of her unexpected arrival no twigg gasped you silly slut why here why now he thought of rushing to carry her off but that would cause an even greater commotion and it was too late the door to lewries apartment was opening sir peel asked with a puzzled look of ignorance then peel flinched away from the wall almost dropping his glass in surprise as he had no more need of it there was sound and more than enough to go round basta came a loud yelp of outrage espиce de salaud good god from lewrie over the shriek of dio miу alan and the slam of a disturbed headboard che questo french italian english a gabble of curses mostly feminine voices raised in high dudgeon in three languages imprecations many slurs some huffy catyowlings then the sound of something heavy and porcelain shattering against the wall preceding a manly wheedling its his corsican doxy peel twigg growled why now why here in leghorn damn her to hell damn her blood i say shes gone and blown the gaff id like to something else quite possibly heavier and made of more frangible stuff such as a glass carafe hit the wall evoking a redoubled chorus of alarmed yelping from lewrie of a certainty quite possibly claudia mastandrea the other feet began to drum yonder bare feet as people were chased pursued by a constant stream of trilingual invective or weaker breathless excuses or pleas in return punctuated of course by a continual patter and clatter of things being thrown and broken like spear carriers in the opera from belowstairs there arose a contrapuntal clatter of shod feet on the stairs the shouts of landlord and servants to hurry up and shut the noise down discover what was happening the hired chorus singing under the principals trio utterly defeated twigg went to the table where he and peel had shared a surreptitious stag supper to claw a wine bottle to him and pour his listening device brimful lewrie he thought just when you counted on him hed always let you down hed always bungle his way to disaster well snatch victory from the jaws of defeat in the end the old spymaster had to allow quite grudgingly but eventual victory had a way with lewrie of being preceded by disaster he went to the double doors to the balcony to sip his wine to lean his weary old cadavers head against a cool pane gazing down at the slick cobbles the dispiritingly meager rainfall winking as drops fell on puddles or slick spots flickering with the light of distant torches or lanthorns all seen through the steamed and streaked condensation of the panes and wondering what to do next there really was a shipment of gold at sea the lure dangled with lewrie as additional bait to trap choundas had also been planned to divert him from the real vessel the real course if the austrians didnt receive it if choundas intercepted it then everything lewrie had surmised might come true twigg thought miserably careful as he had been he was sure word of that ship had reached the genoese then the french soon after two rumors which to believe which was the most plausible for choundas to follow and they had been so close by ear he could follow someones progress down the stairs at last until their footsteps were drowned out by the continuing battle next door which showed no signs of abating twigg perked up a bit stepped back into his proper elementthe shadowsas a lady appeared in the small nimbus of light before the lodginghouse entry claudia mastandrea whistling up her coach still nipping and tucking to complete dressing concealing her hastily donned state with a shawl and a large saucy hat she looked up at the balcony and twigg went rigid with fear that hed been spotted hullo he muttered though she wasnt looking at him she was looking to his right at the lit windows of the apartment she had just fled rather forlornly he thought in amazement even at that distance in that dim light her face appeared flushed she spoke to the ostler who trotted off to fetch her waiting coach twigg slid sidewise to peer out the crack between the doors to have a clear unmisted view of her still well back in the shadows claudia mastandrea he could see was dabbing at her eyes her breathing still deep and hitched she opened her small stringpurse to fetch out a lace handkerchief and and dry her tears poor little bitch twigg murmured as the entrancinglovely mort allowed herself a shoulderheaving sob and buried her face for a moment in the handkerchief damme was he that pleasin she seemed to shake herself into composure stiffen her back and throw up her head as her coach arrived with a clatter almost archly with what was left of her dignity she was handed in but just before the coach rocked and began to depart there was one last mournful and almost wistful gaze aloft to that beguiling windowglow then away she went into the night and twigg allowed himself a smile after all and a deep breath of satisfaction blieve our boy lewrie came through after all mister peel he muttered going back to the center of the room for a topup and a long sip of a rather good red how do you come by that sir peel sighed thought it was a cockup the signorina departed in tears peel failed sir make anyone weep peel snorted and with that aretino creature about no more access to im mores the pity in tears mister peel twigg pointed out had she failed i would have expected an aloof stiffness of carriage a sowhat flouncing you know women peel you know how much cross they can put into the swish of their skirts she didnt leave angry or disappointed i tell you heartbroken more like embarrassed to be caught but i think she got what she came for and a great deal more besides we will know soon as we put it to lewrie twigg mused almost humming with glee but i daresay we may bank on it now hmm her last letter we intercepted gave no hint peel complained of the fickleness of women whyd she sail from san fiorenzo now at the worst possible time less shes a french agent too sir halffrench and all working for choundas not pouzin or someone else no no peel twigg poohpoohed sweet amusing but hardly bright enough for this just damn bad luck and timing missing her pretty sailor too much i suspect damn her eyes so what do we do about miss aretino now sir peel queried his brow still creased in concern he cant explain this away without he tells her too much and can we trust the little mort to keep mum after sir ah hmm twigg pondered heavily there came another gust of shrill shouting the vituperative accusations of a woman wrongedand the gay tinkling of something else going smash does miss aretino love him half as much as it sounds mister peel there is the possibility that shed believe us and keep mum for him after all a few weeks will expose di silvano and signorina mastandrea and net us choundas after that well its up to them to reconcile or not make her recruitable sir peel suggested with a leer no not her mister peel twigg grunted consider her former trade and estate entering our trade mademoiselle aretino would be right back where she began on her back shed never do that even at lewries bidding hed have to be the one to run her and neither could abide the thought of sharing hed warn her off in any event to spite me dye see to protect what shes attained i gather that lewrie really is fond of her mister peel in for the penny in for the pound is our lewrie hes never lukewarm when it comes to his doxies damn fool now on the other hand there is claudia mastandrea sir peel frowned again in puzzlement a picture to conjure with peel twigg simpered with amusement nothing feigned there more attracted to the lout than ever we could wish him for her so it wouldnt be exactly armtwisting to get lewrie to playup again do they have a rencontre before shes forced to go back to france once shes exposed and di silvano cuts his losses the possibilities of a continuing connection hmm a chance for us to turn her doubledback gainst her masters hmm well possibly sir peel nodded in understanding amazed all over again by mister twiggs ability to consider every possible advantage every possible use of peoples weaknesses making notes for his career the sounds of tumult had died down next door with his glass to the wall twigg could discern weeping noises some muffled explainings then a response from phoebe aretino a hiccupy louder cursing wail poor bastard peel said softly yes mister peel poor bastard twigg sighed though with a wee grin on his face it is possible that we have laid their affair and their mutual happiness pon our sacred altar of secrecy oh well well uhm peel shrugged should we go rescue him then sir let her in on our doings and lewrie off the hook such a verisimilitude miss aretinos arrival gave this nights work mister peel twigg chuckled now claudia mastandrea knows what a total cully he is over women she may even be considering what use she may make of him in future rescue twigg thought aloud as he found a heel of bread and some sliced provolone to savor from their pickedover repast yes i believe we should at that but sat down at the table and began to root about for something else to nibble on making a second cold supper and pouring himself more wine sometimes cocking an ear to the ebb and rise of the angry heartbroken slanging match going on next door uhm peel prompted after several long minutes had passed will we be rescuing him anytime soon then mister twigg soon peel soon twigg said airily no rush after all my dealings with the brute peel i must confess to enjoying the sound of it quite relishin in fact music to my old ears my lad music to my ears chapter reduced to tgallants and jibs jester stood into vado bay at the tail end of november after a pointless but necessary transit rushed from leghorn southabout sardinia to port mahon on minorca and then sent off to gibraltar and back as an errand boy bearing a heavy packet of dispatches some pensionedoff soldiers and marines and the sea chests or campaign chests of officers who had perished so they could be sent home to england there had been at least one tiny satisfaction awaiting them at gibraltar had been a set of orders left with the local navy officials to allow jester to make good her complement from the pick of hands newly arrived from england in the receiving hulks twiggs way of making some small amends lewrie had discovered though there was little joy of it little joy to be found in much of anything at the rate things were going he thought phoebe an i sink you are not like ozzer men had been her parting wailed shot no matter what twigg and peel had tried to say to her no matter his own attempt and pleadings i sink i trust you alain mon coeur but hoist by mine own bloody petard he thought to himself feeling a bit disconsolate still oh hed always known their affair was just temporary an amour eventually doomed by circumstances but that didnt mean it hurt any less to have it over quite so soon or in such a messy way so shamefacedly or painfully for the both of them that long independent cruise had at least provided enough peace and quiet and an isolated time to mend and ponder bout here sir knolles prompted aye mister knolles lewrie nodded in agreement round up to the eye of the wind quartermaster back the fore and main tgallants and make ready to slip the best bower sir as jester slowly came about he had time to survey the harbor and the wide roadstead of vado bays anchorage there were still some halfdozen prizes moored there identifiable by being the only vessels stripped of all their canvas so their crews couldnt make any escape attempts nor could a french raid from seaward cut them out and sail them away there were a pair of austrian supply ships another brace of british though little sign that any cargoes were being moved one small austrian brig o war was anchored with her sails hung slack for airing seemingly along with her crew who had what looked to be an idle rope yarn sunday going only one royal navy warship was in the roadstead close inshore the tartar brig the rest were probably out at sea farther west along the genoese riviera lewrie eyed the hills and pyramids of provisions and munitions for general de vinss army a sign his commissary troops and garrison had grown some since signal sir midshipman hyde called out board tartar i make it have dispatches urgent she shows submit next is close me send boat no thats i am sending a boat sir does she by god lewrie growled irked by the presumption of a junior lieutenant or a commander farther down the navy list than him trying to order him about so pretty much what got me in the mess im in he found wryly amusing after a moment though bout half a mile alee too far to row vast anchoring mister knolles back jibs to larboard brace the fore tgallant to starboard tack well anchor close to tartar aye aye sir jester came around slowly falling off the wind again to ghost across the roadstead to within a cable of tartar before turning up to fetchto but there would be no need to anchor since one of tartars boats was already down and stroking hard for her side lewrie opened his telescope to eye her bowman eight oarsmen midshipman in the stern sheets at the tiller and damn ah he said his face stony hmm he almost moaned as he slammed the tubes closed and feeling an urge to spit to cleanse his mouth of a sudden foul taste it was excaptain peel in the boat clinging to a tall hat with a small clutch of traveling bags at his sides on the thwarts peel no sign of his master twigg but that wasnt cause for much joy peel at vado bay as twiggs urgent emissary was bad news enough bosun man the entry port lewrie directed well not drop anchor after all mister knolles till weve sorted this out uhm trouble sir do ye think knolles simply had to ask you might say that mister knolles to lewries great disappointment peel was an agile brute just as spry as a seaman when it came to departing the boat and scaling the battens to the gangway alan had rather hoped hed slip and break his devious neckor at least get a good dunking to wash the spystink off mister peel sir lewrie grumbled doffing his hat as peel doffed his in greeting feeling most uncivil though commander lewrie sir peel rejoined just as stonily i am required to give you this at once to be read at once sir peel produced a square of vellum folded over from the corners and sealed with a large blob of candle wax lewrie took it and turned away took a few paces to larboard for privacy wondering what new vat of shit hed tumbled into he peeled it open well damme he frowned in puzzlement it was from captain nelson in his own hand not his clerks lewrie and jester were to consider themselves under his orders again but the next paragraph instructed him to place himself and his ship at mister peels service until further notice and to render to him and his superior mister twigg any and every service and assistance they requested shit he whispered hoping hed seen the back of them that twigg had told the truth for once that his duties ashore at leghorn had been quits hed lied o course again and what else was new very well mister peel sir lewrie drawled stalking back to the man what assistance do you require from us that i am only allowed to tell you in the strictest privacy sir the stolid excavalry officer replied rather guardedly muttering only as loudly as necessary as if sharing even a cryptic conversation with lewrie was too much to bruit about in public might i be allowed to urge you to do whatever it is you do to return to sea though sir get underway lewrie hinted with a faint grin if thats how sailors phrase it sir yes to where sir lewrie inquired uhm peel darkened clamming up point if you cant say it alan suggested resignedly east is it very well sir that wasnt so difficult now was it mister knolles secure the anchor party and make sail well stand out to sea get way on her and ready to come about to larboard tack once we make an offing come back to starboard tack course due east aye aye sir bosun hands to the braces topmen trice up and lay aloft make sail knolles bellowed it took half an hour to work jester back to sea to scoot along inshore rounding up and gathering enough speed to tack to stand away from the coast until it was about six miles astern then come about to the east once assured that jester was secure lewrie could head below at last his simmering anger and his dubious curiosity both at a fine boil by then so where is it you wish to go mister peel lewrie asked as he opened the wine cabinet after shooing his steward and servant out genoa sir peel announced finally but didnt you just come from there i did sir to await your arrival and deliver those orders to you peel admitted accepting a glass my employer said to extend to you his compliments commander lewrie and his apologies for the uhm upshot of leghorn and for not being able to fulfill his word to you that he would pester you no longer but its quite urgent that you assist us just this one last time sir so lewrie snapped its a total bloody cockup commander lewrie peel confessed his shoulders sagging in defeat the trap we so carefully laid went amiss choundas never even went near em they didnt see anything on their voyage put in at vado then had to scamper back to san fiorenzo to rejoin hotham so i am still your bait lewrie fumed no sir were a bit beyond that i fear peel groaned as he took a seat looking as if he needed one the real ship the vessel that was really carrying the gold for the austrians well sir its been taken that choundas bugger outsmarted us after all well damme lewrie exclaimed in surprise though he really didnt think it much of a surprise that choundas had once more shown himself to be fiendishly clever where and how sir and how muchd he get away with he demanded suddenly all impatience as to where captain lewrie peel sighed soon after she left san fiorenzo bay least the solid coin for the navy and our garrison on corsica was safely landed perhaps within a hundred miles of vado bay as to when five days ago we think at any rate four days ago a french privateer put into genoa sailed right into genoa itself i tell you sir put all the gold and silver ashore as for how much nigh on ј which is now being used sir to pay the recruiting bounty and to purchase boots and smallclothes at least to raise volunteers to serve in the french army theyre drilling and mustering on the main plazas all over the city lewrie swaggering and swilling as bold as brass singing their version of la marseillais damn em but they cant do that genoas neutral thatd the bloody genoese colluded with the french to take it sir peel snarled back still siurmmering with anger and chagrin days after senator di silvano and his cronies were certain the senate allowed the privateer the right to anchor and unload and theyre claiming she has a right to stay as long as she likes stead of enforcing any time limit on a belligerent since she isnt a french national warship formally commissioned they say sir but do we do anything to take her theyll scream bloody murder your nelson sailed in to see what the hell was going on but he was too late and theres little he can do about it but complain theyre shamefaced enough to not demand that he treats the port as a neutral but does he do anything to seize the privateer itd be just the sort of incident the traitorous faction wants we dont have the force to make genoa cooperate with us either bloody devious twofaced peel sneered and took a sip of winewhich gave alan time to sardonically muse that for peel to deem anyone devious and twofaced was a rare irony after all hed been up to so what does twigg think i can do about it mister peel he pressed things are coming to a head sir peel insisted anxiously general de vins has finally stirred himself and his army into motion like the gold was his personal took from his own quarters before i left with the hope youd be returning soon hed thrown his outpost line right to the gates of genoa to show them whos in charge we may suppose and marched his forces west of vado at last into contact with the french outposts hes going to fight finally before winter you still arent telling me lewrie huffed its choundas sir peel announced suddenly stonesober and bitter it was he took the gold himself hes aboard the privateer at genoa he shows no sign of coming ashore so theres no way for us to get to him nelson cant get at him since genoa wont tolerate any belligerent action in their bloody neutral harbor we can expect to be held to the convention that nelson cant sail for twentyfour hours after he does though the genoese can turn a blind eye to choundas going out anytime he pleases once nelson sails which he was going to do mister twigg told me sir the only problem is i was also told not to expect too much from captain nelsons ship that she was so slow and badly in need of a refit practically held together with rope a foul bottom youd know better what they were talking about sir i will never understand naval matters but the rest of our ships the frigates mister peel lewrie inquired surely all far to the west sir to keep an eye on french ports where rumor has it that they may be preparing a landing from the sea peel shrugged again take a day or two for a tender to gallop off to find them and a day or two for them to return and choundas might be away by then dye see meleager left for leghorn for her own refit put in there a week after you left speedy and this tartar are too weak to deal with the privateer your nelson thought speedy is the one rushed off to whistle up the frigates anyway so his ship against mine again then lewrie frowned hesitant to cross swords with choundas especially after the last drubbing my sloop of war gainst his twentytwogunned corvette no sir peel exclaimed with a small sign of glee not his flagship la vengeance we think shes named maybe she was used for taking the merchantman with the gold but he came to genoa board a privateer what they call a xebec fast as the wind i heard aye they are lewrie nodded feeling a little surge of hope threemasted lateenrigged much like a pirates galley long lean and very fast fairly low freeboard and bulwarks though tell me mister peel have you seen her well yessir peel allowed cautiously though i know nought of boats and such i was told what choundas now looks like mister twigg had me boat past his ship to confirm he was there and he is captain lewrie seemed to know who i was too damn his eyes eye rather peel snorted with faint amusement christ what an ugly bugger carve damn well you do sir i must say how he knew to go after the right ship we still cant understand when the bait was so temptin ignore what the signorina gathered for him too tempting perhaps lewrie sniffed once bitten and all that a mite too convenient and overly clever a ruse were supposing choundas was forced to depend on mister twiggs opposite number a civilian spymaster peel admitted softly and they do not get along weve heard suspect each other no matter now lewrie snapped opening his desk to fetch out a chartpencil and a blank quarto sheet of paper since youve seen her closeaboard could you sketch her recall how many guns she carried and an idea as to their caliber spose so sir peel shrugged again bending over the desk to begin drawing bout as long as your ship i think not as tall i think i saw only five or six openings along the one side for guns one was open fairly goodsized stuff at either end though big as some siege artillery i once saw at woolwich hellish good weekend that short barrels like mortars no i dont think so captain lewrie peel frowned cocking his head as he bent over his sketch looked averagelong barrels to me lewrie went to the wine cabinet to refill his glass riding the easy motion of his warship as she tore through the sea sails set all to the royals in her haste for once there was enough wind aloft in the fickle ligurian sea to make speed when speed was vital he could be off genoa mole by sundown a xebec he pondered about jesters length shoaldraught she could stand much closer inshore oн jester should they discover her to escape draw about three feet less perhaps long and lean built low to the sea and very wet along her gunwales and gangways sailtending was done amidships foreandaft on a central walkway and some xebecs were oardriven still spanish venetian genoese barbary pirates they still depended on them as armed oared galleys with guns mounted on their forecastles and stern platforms primarily nothing more than twelvepounders he thought anything elsed be too much end weight why had choundas come himself he fretted lets say he already knew that de vins would take action that the french army was ready for a battle too and that stealing the gold would precipitate it wasnt his prime responsibility with his squadron wouldnt that be where any diligent senior officer would be if things were indeed coming to a head rub our noses in it he muttered what had peel said it was as if choundas had known who he was already might even have known that twigg was in the area and no wonder hed failed to take the best bait but why do the dirty work himself alan still puzzled when that would isolate him from his squadron get him penned in at genoa for days even weeks and not bring his own ship rely on a privateersman not under naval discipline unreliable untrustworthy sure to pocket here you go captain lewrie peel interrupted rising to go for the wine cabinet himself dusty work sketchin from memory do ye mind i cant get it out o my head though that those guns along the side well looked no bigger than galloper guns four perhaps sixpounders bout like horse artillery not carronades not squat and stubby pestles lewrie pressed as he regarded peels handiwork like those on my quarterdeck nossir peel rejoined certain definitely long barrels too few french copies of carronades to go around yet lewrie said feeling even more hope nothing theyd sell or share with the warforprofit mob peel had produced a fairly good drawing complete with arrowed notes regarding the xebecs paint scheme dark green hull with red gunwales and upper works shell be fast but jesters quickwork is clean and newcoppered with a good slant should she sail we stand a good chance of bringing her to battle if i stand off genoa to the souwest about five or six miles inshore he has to sail soon to the west if he wishes to rejoin his squadron he cant be absent when the big battles about to come off cant count on his army taking the city right off either one warship could bottle him up for a month unless he does something else clever sir peel griped moodily im coming to fear just how clever he really is abandon the privateer and go overland in civilian dress perhaps senator di silvanos farm carts and estate agents could smuggle him out then should this ship aye should we close her and take her hed be ashore laughing his bloody head off lewrie sourly agreed i assume mister twigg has already made arrangements against that he has sir peel assured himsort of though were thin on the ground when it comes to people we can trust besides the pair of us mister drake and a few of his hired agents the austrians im sure their army has spies in plenty lewrie gloomed in business with italians all this time some bad habits must have rubbed off by now surely unless the rumor of a large french invasion convoy was another sham captain lewrie peel pointed out it was a goodenough rumor to draw most of your nelsons ships off to the west to counter it if the french are just as ready for a decisive battle as the austrians it may be possible that choundas doesnt expect to have to go very far to rejoin or wait a week till genoa is theirs he knows something that much is certain this choundas something we dont yet large crew this privateer of his lewrie asked about a hundred or so that i saw sir peel told him had to have promised half the booty to them else theyd never have taken the job on lewrie sighed why should they risk all that to sail out at once they could wait for genoa to fall doesnt mean choundas would fearsome as he is he couldnt count on a crew of mercenaries to protect him and shes not a proper warship disciplined did you see any uniformed men aboard any soldiers their versions of marines any naval officers besides him nossir peel replied though what might have been hidden not much depth of hold in which to hide anything aboard shallowdraught vessels such as xebecs lewrie interrupted impatiently no i expect what you saw was all they had hired for the one job perhaps but only to transport the gold not take it dye see peel lewrie enthused choundas couldnt use his flagship to fetch it to genoa i hate the man but i understand him a little i think hes a sailor la vengeance dye say wager he named her himself chose her paint scheme so shed look just like his oldun the one he lost in the far east in eightyfive lost her and two others too the greatest shame any captain can stomach no hed never risk her never take the chance of losing another command especially to me or your mister twigg this privateers expendable now shes done his chore for him shes civilian not navy does she sail and we take her ill sport you any odds you like hell not be aboard shell swan off soueast paid to lure us on a false scent while he takes passage west close inshore on one of senator di silvanos fishing boats or coasters more like well im damned sir peel breathed out the victim of twice the surprise that choundas could be that clever or that lewrie for all the deprecating things his employer had said about him was showing signs of being just as discerning and quickwitted o course it makes eminent sense once he gets to genoa he knows hes a quick way out thats what he had up his sleeve that we couldnt hope to know hes a sailor lewrie reiterated wasnt born to frog nobility mister peel brought up in the coastal fisheries not many good horsemen spring from that lot he wont go overland less forced to and you knackered his leg sir long ago make a ride that far all but impossible for him though a cart or coach a sailor mister peel lewrie laughed hed feel lost on the land no matter how he goes but he knows the sea with a small crew of experienced genoese supplied by signore di silvano seamen just as dedicated to the conspiracy as their master is hes still in his proper element a fish in the water so to speak captain lewrie peel japed exactly though peel sobered that would mean were only one ship and wed have to stop and search every bloody rowboat tween genoa and vado and intercept the privateer if she comes out that too exactly mister peel lewrie snapped losing every hope hed conjured up needle in a bloody hayrick damn chapter agamemnon was already at sea lurking a few miles south of the harbor approaches to genoa like a reunion with a parent after years apart lewrie was shocked at how shed aged in the months that jester had been away paint faded and streaked her gunwales gone filthy and her sails turned weary brown and much patched worst of all thighthick anchor cables had been bound about her hull to keep her together a quick shouted conference with nelson across the fifty yards that separated them after jester came under her lee both captains too impatient to waste time transferring from ship to ship so they could lay their plans in the idle comfort of the flagships greatcabins nelson had to admit that agamemnon was too weeded to catch the privateer should she come out he would take her to vado bay at once send tartar out to watch the coast closer inshore east of vado rearm little bombуlo which had been swinging idle since meleager had abandoned her so she could go off to leghorn for her refit put a crew in her and reinforce tartar the privateer would be lewries pigeon when or if she left port to aid his own search nelson gave lewrie the use of his barge a thirtytwofoot tenoared boat which could be rigged with two masts and carry a twopounder boat gun and a pair of swivels with an admonition not to scratch her paint agamemnon departed leaving jester to stand guard at genoa by herself until tartar and bombуlo could join her a day and a night perhaps before she was reinforced speedy would have encountered at least one or two of the frigates by then and summoned them back from their wildgoose chase to the west with all the luck in the world theyd then sew a net so snug about genoa and its approaches that choundas would never get out the first use lewrie made of the barge was to man her and send midshipman hyde inshore with her to cany a message to twigg or drake to keep an eye on the privateer hire a swift local boat and send out an alert if choundas transferred to another vessel and its description and course then five miles souwest of the mole he could do nothing more except fret of course as jester continued her pacing standing off and on that coast as the evening gathered lewrie paced his quarterdeck on the windward side back and forth from the hammock nettings overlooking the waist to the corner of the taffrail by the night lanthorn fretting a safe and swift return of the barge mister hyde and its crew though he doubted the genoese government would be silly enough to delay her or seize her they were in enough bad odor already had practically thrown in with the french fretting the delay of fresh information from twigg which hyde would surely have for him that choundas would confound them one more time and stay snug and safe aboard the privateer after all or take the overland route disguised as a misshapen gypsy or something but mostly fretting that choundas would realize that agamemnon had departed and make his move before any reinforcement arrived had choundas planned to sneak out aboard a nondescript fishing boat rush back to his beloved corvette and his neglected duties flush with new triumph hed have to do it soon surely hed feel the noose drawing tighter the bastard had the survival instincts of a breadroom rat and was just about as hard to kill for certain depart just after twilight lewrie pondered hands in the small of his back glaring down at the toes of his fashionable boots pacing almost hunchbacked with impatient gloom show no lights maybe a wee lanthorn one fishing boat mongst a fleet of em speed though has to get back soon dash along the coast to be west of vado bay before tomorrows dawn french lines begin where cant count on anything tubby as bombуloshes typical of boats hereaboutsto get him through the area where hed be most vulnerable a larger vessel then longer waterline schoonerrigged a tartane or pencilthin he might try with the privateer shes armed and fast enough does that damned senator have himself a yacht he looked like the sort to afford one ruddyfaced hunting i thought owns ships and such so he must do some sailing maybe it comes from damn he stopped to scrub his face with dry hands and peer shoreward jester was on the easternmost leg of her patrol line barely two miles off the harbor entrance there were few signs of activity some small fishing boats about bombolos size working their way back into harbor few sail visible at all save for them and some even smaller with one lugsail or lateen little bigger than jesters jolly boat or gig all heading in as sunset approached or idling barepoled close inshore for a final cast of the nets and a twomaster heading out he crossed to the binnacle cabinet by the wheel to snatch his telescope and inspect it the elegant barge at last within half an hour shed be alongside with news then he could arm her before full dark put more hands into her and double his patrol helm up a point quartermaster he snapped thatll be our mister hyde returning well stand down to her aye aye zir brauer crisply agreed feeding spokes aweather a note from mister drake sir hyde offered once he was back on deck his compliments to you captain and said for me to inform you that he already had the privateer under close scrutiny of yet theres been no sign that anyone has left her though he also bade me tell you that theyd hoisted an easy pendant this morning and allowed traders bumboats to come alongside rather a lot ofem sir hyde contributed saw em myself so many its hard to keep track that mister drake also said to say sir do you carry any message for me sir mister peel asked from the side aye sir i do hyde nodded reaching into another pocket for a waxsealed note mister drake gave it me from some banker fellow kept in the dark so far hyde could only raise his brows and wonder why a commercial letter was just as important as one from the consul representing hm government at genoa having this stranger peel aboard with the right of the quarterdeck and put aboard so urgently had hyde and the rest totally mystified any vessels follow you to sea sir lewrie asked quickly a vessel of any kind that looked in the way of readying for departure none that i took note of sir hyde frowned very well mister hyde lewrie sighed deflated mister buchanon sir well arm the barge before dark i wish you to take charge of her mister crewe a twopounder with roundshot and canister in the barge with two swivels and ammunition four extra hands besides boat crew mister cony the sharpeyed and some decent gunners ill want a pistol musket and cutlass for every man as well mister peel with me for a moment if you please sir let us compare notes they stepped aft to the taffrails for privacy peel had already perused his and crumpled it up to toss overboard astern my employer has contacted the austrian headquarters theyre to keep a close watch on all roads looking for a scarred man with a limp theyre to particularly inspect any wagon or cart going to one of our senator di silvanos estates mister silberberg has also placed a watch upon the senators mansion should choundas be spirited there but we dont have the willing agents to follow every coach coming or going to his house the rest of the conspirators houses arent covered even with things coming to a head mister silberberg doubts di silvano will tip his hand that directly im sorry to say captain lewrie i doubt wed be able to watch close enough should this be happening in london mister drake says thereve been so many bumboats alongside the privateer coming and going that its impossible to say if choundas was in one of them disguised either lewrie groaned shes her sails harborgasketed and her crew rantipoling with the local whores as drunk as lords shes not coming out tonight at any rate or in the morning either the way he says theyre celebrating their new fortune he crumpled up his own note and tossed it over their headsll be too thick lewrie chuckled without amusement the senator does have a yacht but then so do almost all of the other conspirators its a local sport yachting those we know about sir peel cautioned in a covert mutter and them we still cant link to the plot direct a fishing boat or a yacht by dawn there could be hundreds of em out here does choundas come out tonight mister peel lewrie schemed trying to put himself in the wily frenchmans head itll most like be around nine or so after full dark combined with us being close off the approaches i should think well be turning away to stand west on our leg he could idle just off the mole no lights showing and follow us damn his eyes close inshore with a local pilot who can smell a shoal or rock not much moon to speak of him black against a dark coastline trail us as far as voltri thatd take a couple of hours then wed have to turn back east and he could scoot along the twenty or twentyfive miles to vado bay and be just a few miles west of there by false dawn tomorrow morning a fishing boat bout the same size as yon barge would be too slow for him he must know that vado bayd be wellpatrolled theres a decent wind tonight and night winds are fairly steady in strength and direction from the noreast for once a perfect wind to ghost out on and broadreach west on hell want a longer faster boat for that i would if he doesnt make it to vado he cant expect to lay up for the day along this coast not with austrian troops about where are the french last report how far east east of the inland road that comes down to finale sir peel shrugged how far east i of late i have no way of knowing he gave lewrie a quick grimace before turning bland again hating to say i dont know as bad as any secret agent along the coast road we must assume theyve advanced closer to vado other side of the headland lewrie grumbled in surprise when peel told him that thatd be only ten miles west of our anchorage its possible sir sorry i cant enlighten you further forty miles at most then lewrie puzzled genoa to finale or thereabouts seven hours to safety at six or seven knots damme if ill play his game but not knowing how he was going to accomplish that yet that barge could never catch up a larger faster vessel once she got to sea with a bone in her teeth hed have to place jester more to the west if he hoped to get a decent slant at interception with his ship tied too close to the harbor entrance though choundas might gain a precious lead that he could never make up once choundas slipped past them close inshore yet to remain far enough west to counter that jester couldnt guard the entrance could not spot any vessel leaving in time to overhaul her and inspect her or could he mister buchanon vast your packing sir lewrie called out i apologize but ill need you aboard after all mister hyde youre still in charge of the barge aye sir hyde grinned proud to have a temporary command pass the word for mister crewe to come to ere sir crewe replied from the gangway above the tethered barge which was still being loaded and armed mister crewe youre familiar with firearrows dardeaufeu well aye capum the gunner replied creasing his brow dont ave no springiron tmake th arms tcatch in sails though forget the springarms mister crewe lewrie countered with a leer on his face just make me up a half dozen that can be shot up high in the air that we can see for oh six miles at night shot at extreme elevation from a swivel gun like a signalfuzee that mister hyde can light off like a fireworks oh like a roman candle sir crewe beamed i can do that sir half dozen no work atall capum pass the word for mister giles my compliments and he is to supply the barge with two days dry rations and water biscuit cheese and smallbeer and enough wine for two days clear decks and up spirits youll not be splicing the main brace mister hyde till i tell you youre to loaf about just off the entrance showing no lights of any sort stay furtive as mice till any vessel leaves larger than a rowboat youre to fire off one of mister crewes fuzees from a swivel soon as one does almost straight up but in the general direction of her course anything heading west is what were interested in aye aye sir hyde agreed though not sure what it was he was agreeing to the captain of that corvette we fought mister hyde thats the bastard we want he captured a commissary ship full of british gold and he now thinks hell slip away and go back home to crow about it lewrie told his senior midshipman first before he explained things to the rest of his crew before dark i want him mister hyde and with your help i mean to have him this time chapter a hot supper for which he had little appetite almost uncivil a host to mister peel and lieutenant knolles who dined with him talking shop for once and so eager for news that most of what he heard wasnt an awkward conversation but the loud ticking of his chronometer in the chartspace on the starboard side of the greatcabins then back on deck wondering if choundas had made a total fool of him of them all no matter how cleverly theyd schemed alan had always come a cropper whenever hed thought himself especially slydidnt matter at what hed always tripped over his own witshoping against hope that just this once events would prove an exception a gelatinous crawling of time an age between the halfhour watch bells nine oclock then three bells at ninethirty four bells at ten signall a lookout screamed as a tiny phosphorescent spark leaped into the inky night sky trailing an amber train of embers at a fiftydegree angle lewrie estimated pointing toward jester four miles offshore and ten miles down the coast near voltri pointing to the west got at bastid sir weuns got im a cheer rose from the decks the duty watch and the gunners standing idle in the waist ferociously satisfied their blood up for the hunt a kill sure that jester would avenge herself prove herself a lucky ship once more by god wed better lewrie thought but not a very good night for it perversely the winds had risen a trifle the sea was surging and creaming now and then in tiny whitecapscats paws and horses what there was of the moon was occluded by scudding clouds coming down from inland some storm rushing downslope off the alps their view of the coast was only a black smear against a coldashes evening merely a matter of degree fetchto mister knolles lewrie commanded we go galloping off east hes sure to slip past us aye sir duty watch hands to the braces and sheets a quarterhour later riding cocked up into the wind bows almost due north the ship making no headway still nothing to be seen signal another fuzee skyrocketing into the night pointing west a bit closer to them as hyde sailed in pursuit of whatever had aroused him no hope of catching his chase of course whatever she turned out to be safe enough for hyde and his men lewrie thought relieved choundas did not have night enough to turn and make her pay for alerting the blockade hed have to thread assuming that sofar unseen vessel was his if it was hed gotten a late start and lost a precious hour already well begin to stand inshore mister knolles lewrie said with impatience after another quarterhour had passed slowly at first aye sir another half hour hydes barge making no more than five knots at best even with that stiff broadreaching wind on her quarters an hour so five miles closer to us hes come lewrie plotted almost frantic but concealed by darkness on the quarterdeck as jester prowled without even a single glim burning a tartane lateenrigged he thought shed go around seven knots off such a goodly wind two miles closer to us than hyde yet not a whiff of her not hide nor hair another fuzee this time fired slantwise as if mister hyde was firing a very long upthestern shot as a miniature comet arced up and down like the trail of a burning carcase shot from a mortar within two miles of jesters bows so the chase surely must be in smelling distance haul our wind mister knolles time to stand in directly due north quartermaster sail ho from a larboard forecastle lookout one point awrf th larbd bow gainst th towns lights dye hear there lewrie dashed to the larboard side leaned out over the bulwarks to peer into the gloom as jester swung the town of voltri was three miles north almost dead ahead by then they might have been holding aesta to celebrate the recent harvests or some saints day for the waterfront and main streets were lit with torches lanthorns and a big bonfire producing a pencilthin smear of light and suddenly there was a ship a quick eyeblink glimpse of a ship atop the amber scintillating fireglade of the towns lights stark and black in a second of silhouettehighpinked stern sharp bow and three crescent moon sails low to the deck two large lateens and a long lateen jib haul our wind mister knolles come about to west by north he howled a tartane no error and shes already west of us hellishfast too lewrie shivered as the night wind went cold fearing hed left it too late seven knots mine arse she had to be going eight or nine or im a turk in a turban by the time we get turned in pursuit and settled down she could have a mile lead on us six bells of the evening watch chimed up forrud eleven oclock on a dark filthy night jester was quick with the wind on her quarters he knew but this tartane would be fast as a witch he rolled his eyes to peer without straining or staring for a glimpse of her but blackness had swallowed her up once more he looked astern as jester came around on her new course the sea swashing down her flanks the babble of water neath her forefoot under her transom an urgent mumbling hyde was to return onstation till daybreak then come west to safety in vado bay pray god there were no more signals from him had choundas sent a first vessel out as a false lure to test the waters and draw any watcher away there was little he could do about it for better or worse he was now committed we escape her the captain of the tartane crowed to his crew to his lone passenger the brutto faccia francese huddled deep in his warm boatcloak barge signore pretty barge of a capitano i say i see her before ahgahmemnon he pronounced carefully in a poor french mingled with quick native italian she was only britannici i see off genoa and she is slow big and slow signore you are quite certain his passenger demanded unused to being an idle commodity to be carted about fretful that he had not been given charge of the saucy yachtlike coaster by pouzins cabal of plotters but was now at the mercy of this filthy unshaven brute with his dark liquid eyes olive complexion and harsh arabic face mongrels he thought them all unwanted persian turkish egyptian polluters of the ancient etruscan celtic blood of the first latins only brittanici we see days and days signore the tartanes commander insisted barge come in today then go back out watchers in fishing boats see ship of this nelehsoney go west meet another but do not return we are safe now signorel he boasted thumping his chest i sail circle around big slow shipofline ecco we go out to sea coast come down to us at vado there are brittanici patrol we reduce sail too no one can catch us no we should press on guillaume choundas curtly replied he almost felt a mythic prickling in his thumbs an unease that would not be stilled until he was ashore or back aboard his ship i order no one order me the other barked i am capitano you are the passenger we reduce sail it is blowing almost too good we go out from the coast we get to finale before sunrise we go so quick and cannot land you on that coast in the dark lay still off finale and wait till the dawn we meet brittanici patrols you see if more wind comes we are safe out at sea not on rocky coast you want to live signore we do what i say angle out stand back in go fast all the time but not too fast si shut up and drink some wine signore i am best capitano in all of genoa the senatore he knows this why he hires me to carry his letters to you francese i command his yacht if he did not give me so many orders i do not like orders whether you like them or not choundas protested your employer told you to get me to a frenchheld port if were making such good time then it could be loano even alassio it doesnt have to be finale stay inshore keep up your speed and land me at the port where dawn finds us too far for us the captain objected turning surly there is too much risk coming back to genoa i do not ever see ships of you francese to protect me signore you are capitano importante in such a little navy there are ten of us one of you you do not tell us what to do capitano grande with that he turned away to shout orders to his crew to reduce sail and went to the tillerbar aft to direct the helmsman to wear out to sea the tartane slowed began to slough and rock lateen rigs were horrid when it came to sailing so fine downwind a square sail off the wind would belly full strain equally from corner to corner and reduce the excess wallowing motion which robbed a ship of speed shop clerks choundas was forced to fume in silence eager for their own beds tomorrow evening no stomach for a long voyage working for the gold the excitement but with no sense of discipline purpose or loyalty mongrels he added to the list of their sins just as bad as those swaggering cockscomb mercenary privateers all bluster and brag once genoa was theirs choundas vowed and the guillotines came to winnow out the aristos the usurers those opposed to the new regime he would be sure that this captains name was found in the book of the damned mongrels he thought squinting his eyes in fury so dumb they cling to barbaric arabian lateens when even the most famous man of genoa christopher columbus knew to change over to square rig an ignorant mongrel race id not be pressin closer ashore sir buchanon warned him too dark tsee what were about nor whether were still chasin yon tartane theres depth enough mister buchanon lewrie countered a noreast wind to drive us offshore for once not a lee shore but th coast trends southerly sir buchanon insisted i suggest we come t west by south captain een does our chase stand inshore o us durin th night the coastll shoulder her out its the coast he wants to land on mister buchanon lewrie spat as two bells of the middle watch chimed at one am which hed be a purblind fool tdo with such a sea runnin buchanon countered he cant close it till dawn samez us sir very well mister buchanon west by south it is mister knolles well haul our wind a mite more to west by south hands aloft take in sail first reefs in the main course mizzen and maintopsls i dont wish to shoot past her in the dark nor be blown too far loord of the coast by sunrise by this noreast wind should there be a wind shift which usually happened along such a coast should it moderate or clock northerly hed be headed robbed of power when he needed it most and badly placed for pursuit assumin theres somethin tsee at dawn he sighed frustrated jester had logged a steady eight knots since espying their chase around voltri three hours later and they were almost level with vado bay at that speed and still had no further sighting of that spectral tartane he had to admit that buchanon was right to be cautious rocks aplenty inshore the sea not so boisterous theyd be warned of risk by white foam breaking on them the moonlight too weak to give them first sight to steer clear stout as the wind had blown hed expected some rain with it such a pall of storm cloud overhead that what poor view the lookouts had would be blotted out entirely but that hadnt come the solid black of the shore could still be guessed at if one didnt peer too long or hard at it whitecaps could be espied all about by the faint moon but no sign of that damned tartane jester slowed as her sail was reduced even with the wind fine on her starboard quarter purring now as three bells chimed solidly surefooted and ploughing but to where chapter sir knolles prompted a little closer to lewries ear and giving him a gentlemanly nudge sir im awake sir lewrie grumbled rising from a treacly sleep from his woodandcanvas deck chair he fought the constricting folds of his boat cloak sensing immediately that the weather had changed winds died out sir knolles reported fighting a yawn himself the last five minutes it went scant then nothing jester was rocking and heaving her timbers and yards groaning in protest and her sails slatting like flapping laundry amidst all the squeaking of parrel blocks and pulleys lewrie marveled that he could have slept so soundly through all that whats the time he asked two bells of the morning just went sir knolles informed him i make it about a quarterhour to false dawn sir sorry sir but as we kept both watches on deck all night i held off on pumping and swabbing and let the hands caulk for a bit do you wish me to no no you did quite right mister knolles lewrie shivered wrapping himself in the boat cloak again galley fires going soups the thing soup and gruel cold but clear remarkably clear sir knolles grinned or fought a yawn it was hard to tell the seas moderating too just what i feared lewrie groaned good as stranded much too far to seaward northerly or a levanter easterly to come after sunrise proper beat for hours to get back inshore against the land breeze i spose theres no sign of our chase uhm not yet sir knolles had to admit but we can see a bit better now the moon had set but their world was a nebulous charcoal gray disturbed only by an occasional whitecap the coast was definable just barely about ten miles off that solid blackness he thought off which a mornings land breeze would flow dammit to hell maybe a norwester to begin with before the ocean heated and countered from whatever capricious direction the ligurian sea had in mind today if the galley fires are going id admire some coffee lewrie said and an idea how far west we were blown during the night ill send a messenger down to roust your steward sir lieutenant knolles offered but aspinall clomped up the larboard ladder from the gun deck having already made a trip to the galley for a warmup if nothing else lewrie thought uncharitable that early in the morning he cradled a battered old lidded pot and bore some tin mugs on a string coffee sir coffee mister knolles sir he beamed got enough fer all sir thought th gennlemend relish a spot o hot toulon had gone with him on his errand for a bite of something from the cooks who ever would spoil him now he came prancing up the ladders to the quarterdeck tail stiffly erect and maiwee ing for a goodmorning rub he leaped atop the hammock nettings to greet lewrie with loud demands for attention after a warming sip or two alan went to him to give at least a onehanded tussling and stroking he stiffened suddenly stopped his frantic purring and turned to look to the north his ears laid back his back hairs and tail got bottled up and he craned his neck whiskers well forward a faint whicker of wind came from there the worst direction of all to lewries lights just as knolles extracted his pocket watch to state that it was now time for false dawn sail ho a forecastle lookout yelped four points off th starbd bows due north lewrie gulped due north of us he looked at the cat wondering whether hed sensed the winds arrival or caught a scent of that ship toulon was now busy washing himself intent on a paw and the side of his face that lewrie had tussled what sort o sail knolles bellowed back tartane sir came the quick reply closehauled tth noreast tis her dye hear there get us underway on starboard tack mister knolles sheet home and brace in fullandby to weather lewrie demanded coffee mug in one hand telescope slung open in the other and laid on the mizzen shrouds to starboard he espied her aye a twomasted tartane about three miles off showing them her stern as she ghosted against a faint land breeze pointing higher than jester ever could but riding so slow her decks were level even with her bows as close to the winds eye as she could lie with her lateen yards braced in almost foreandaft slowly just as painfully slowly as the tartane crawled jester began to gather headway to pinch up point at a time to the wind her bows at last aimed westnorwest as close as she could lie two knots were reported then three when the log was cast astern good mornin sir buchanon reported to the quarterdeck im happy someone can find something good about it alan said as he finished his coffee do you give me a rough idea of position i would be much obliged mister buchanon aye sir buchanon replied crisply cheerful as aspinall gave him a mug as well but i make at cape off th larbd bows tbe th one guardin finale at isle tth northrd atd be sousouwest o vado bay sir bout ten mile offshore we are didnt get blown half so farz id thought capum at our chase at last th poor buggers on th wrong tack dont ya think sir shes three miles ahead sir thats what i think lewrie shot back up to windward safe as houses on a hugely diverging course too the tartane was beating to the noreast but had bags of room in which to tack safely two miles out of gun range she could turn norwest for the coast between the island and the western headland and there were inlets aplenty for a beaching in shallow water where jester could never dare go four knots four knots tthis log the best lewrie could hope was to stay on this starboard tack gain speed as the wind rose as it seemed to be wanting to to deny her a shot at tacking further west it wasnt over yet there might come a patrol from vado bay but so far though they had the morning sea to themselves five knots sir spendlove shouted well tack sir knolles asked theres wind enough no not yet sir lewrie decided feeling an urge to chew on a thumbnail wed lose ground on her shed tack once we were on a new course and force us to do it all over again wed fall even more behind hands aloft and shake out the night reefs lets fill every sail bellyful aye aye sir six knots then seven at times nothing to write home about with pleasure but jester was increasing her speed two miles nearer to that coast pointed just east of finales headland now and then the winds grew a tiny bit stronger backing a little east of north and spenser and brauer luffed her up into it to wring every inch of advantage from the puffs deck there a foremast lookout called down once the dawn had come men could be posted aloft once more chase is tackin had to sir buchanon opined she stood any more eastrd shed end up in vado bay she was aready level with th island were at westnorwest shes making norwest two points higher to windward though mister buchanon but closin th range sir closin th range lewrie eyed her again with his telescope the tartane was hard on the wind on starboard tack now her decks were still fairly level though which puzzled him jester was beginning to heel as if being two miles farther out at sea theyd caught a suffer wind than what it might be like closer inshore under the shadow of the rugged coastal heights run out the starboard battery runin larboard lewrie barked sevenandahalf knots sir spendlove shrilled jester was really moving now no matter how average the winds with her longer waterline and greater weight once she got a way on she tenaciously held it in even the lightest winds as the tartane could not for once she was the shorter vessel the one more prone to fall off to slough and slow as she did even as he watched to sail as fast as she needed to shed have to fall away from closehauled let the wind cross her decks a little more abeam on a close reach slow to gather way and quick to lose it beating to windward could result in her crawling at a snails pace cocked up but going nowhere was it his imagination did she appear to be falling off to the same compass heading as jester westnorwest and trending aft jester was outfooting her to the coastal shallows which were now only five miles off abeam lewrie said with satisfaction a half hour later now within two miles of that rocky shoreline the chase was almost abeam and closer to jester as shed pinched up and luffed to weather every opportunity at least a half mile nearer though still tantalizingly a half mile outside the most optimistic shooting range shell not get to finale at this rate if thats where she was headed had the tartane been on starboard tack when the wind came back had she tacked immediately shed have been gone long since but itd still be a closerun thing the closer jester got under the lee of a tall range of coastal hills the more fickle and weak the wind was for her too his telescope revealed no shelving beaches ahead no inlets in which to flee behind the island yes there was a deep inlet but theyd have to tack soon if they wished to get back to it deck there chase is tacking reading my bloody mind lewrie grumbled now shes able to steer noreast by east run along the coast to pick her spot mister knolles we willat lasttack ship aye aye sir around jester came thrashing and flogging carrying her way into the turn smoothly pivoting it seemed almost in her own length it was so quickly done by a welldrilled ships company slowing as sails were laid aback of course as foreandaft sails flagged and fluttered lift from themselves but surging back to seven almost eight knots within a scant couple of minutes now the chase lay just one point off their larboard bows and within a mileandaquarter run out larboard battery runin starboard to the centerline lewrie shouted once jester was stable that made a tiny difference though the tartane still pointed about ten degrees higher to windward even sailing a point free of closehauled for more speed lookit th sea capum buchanon shouted suddenly pointing ahead lookit th sea meet her spenser meet her lewrie warned as the wind laid a brush on his left cheek there was a rising zephyr one which backed a point or more with which they could luff up to claw at least a cable of advantage to windward there were ripples on the slowheaving wave tops around jesters bows out ahead and inshore of her there were not out where the chase lay there the sea was oilysmooth glittering with many small inshore chops but the tops of the wavelets were undisturbed beyond tempting but unreachable yet the winds rippled the waters but the tartane had staggered into a flat limpid circular pool of calm i see it mister buchanon lewrie almost laughed with glee the tartane would take a long minute to coast through the calm patch of water slowing all the time her shorter waterline shedding speed while jester stood on through it she could tack but tacking might slow her even more and did the winds return to that calm patch they might be perverse and head her more westerly than she wished i make her no moren a mile off now capum buchanon said after taking her measure with a sextant almost gun range an th shore maybe a mile and a half off the tartane rode it out coasting through the calm with jester marching up her stern relentlessly then caught the edge of the wind beyond her sails luffing as it took her bowson headed by god knolles cried out with delight she fell away crossing to dead on jesters bows poised over a rhythmically rising bowsprit and jib boom having lost at least a halfmile lead and forced down more easterly unless she tacked shed be thrown below and east of the island toward the western headland that marked vado bay shed shave the island on her present course mister crewe lewrie shouted fetch mister rahl from the magazine and try your eye with one of the focsle carronades upwind of her so she wont tack inshore on us aye sir winds veerin ahead sir spenser told him from the wheel ave t ease her a point very well mister spenser lewrie chuckled thatll keep us honest and from running ashore on the island bowson at it will sir spenser snickered easing his spokes rahl marched almost stiffbacked like a grenadier guard to the forecastle still in his list slippers and powder yeomans apron keenly aware of the crews eyes on him he fiddled and fussed weighing a charge turning a ball to check how perfectly round it was tinkered with the elevation screw the compressors bloody hell knolles groaned as he stood back at last with the firing lanyard taut awaiting the perfect moment sailing a point free rahl had a good portion of gun arcs to work with instead of firing right over or through the forestays or jibs up jester rose a trifle then sagged bowdownward then up once more poised and boom as rahl jerked the lanyard he stood ramrod straight to spot the fallofshot one hand shading his brow a pillar of ricochet spray leapt into the sky tall and so prettily symmetrical it resembled the finest white goose feather within a short pistol shot of the tartanes windward side his fellow gun captains gave rahl a lusty cheer as their chase veered off the wind as if recoiling from that strike to duck down to deadahead of jesters bows where no more roundshot could be hurled at her but that forced her to leeward just a little farther from shore and safety well shot mister rahl lewrie shouted man the starboard the lee carronade spenser back on the wind closehauled quickly as rahl and the forecastle gunners readied the other eighteenpounder jester clawed back up to windward a full point right on the razoredge of luffing to put the tartane almost two points alee of her to claw jester inshore of the chase boom another shot soared out raising a second feather of spray again closeaboard the tartane which ducked back up to windward this time to escape weaving an essshaped wake before jesters bows boom went the larboard carronade once the tartane had ducked upwind enough jal rahl shouted in triumph eine schцn gottdamn hit im surrounded by fools choundas raged incompetents filthyarsed mongrel defectives goddamned farmers who havent a clue to the sea forced to remain silent forced to depend on a leering cretin who should have known a night wind off the land would fade and stranded them too far from shore failed to tack once they saw that bloody ship and didnt seem to know that the heights would muffle what breeze there was chances for an escape looked rather bleak at the moment but they had one shot leftto tack at once and run inshore get into shallows where the bloodies couldnt go brave their guns and flee the impact of the shot took him by surprise muffled in his boat cloak on the weather deck below the highpinked quarterdeck cold made his ravaged leg throb with agony but he was about to fight it back as hed done for years mount the quarterdeck and take charge the aching delayed him a fateful second as he rose to stand to mount the ladder the tartane shuddered jerked and rolled as if shed run aground men were screaming even men on the weather deck around him who werent even in the line of fire there was a frightful smash of shattered timber the parroty rrwawrkl as the taffrail and upper stern transom and a portion of the larboard rails were ripped away in pieces and whickerings as footlong wood splinters of the transom and quarterdeck planks whirled in the air choundas forced himself up the first step to peer over at nose height as the lateen above his head was quilled with splinters and spattered with gore serves you right he sneered that boastful arabylooking nasty of a captain had been slain along with the helmsman on the tiller and the other two on the quarterdeck had been blown off their feet silence he boomed almost crying out at each step as he went to the quarterdeck listen to me i am captain now and i will save you do what i say and you will live lose your heads and you all are dead men as dead as your fool of a captain is that stopped them in their tracks as he took hold of the tiller sweep and began to force it leeward again to hold them closehauled on the wind trim us in to beat then hoist the rowboat over the side the lee side where the bloody ship cannot see it choundas roared he used his free hand to sweep back his boat cloak to reveal the pistols in his waist belt the hilt of his sword once around the island we are out of its lee there will be wind there we will tack and run into shore then we will get in the boat and row in with this ship as our shield they will not see us doing this until it is too late do you understand me bien trиs bien now do it out of desperation with no other option they could agree to in their fear of capture and death they obeyed choundas forced himself to smile which made him look malevolent but competent enough to save them though some made the sign against the evil eye as they crossed themselves for luck feral brutally ugly but he looked like a real officer who knew what he was doing they obeyed him too bad i didnt have hainaut with me choundas thought leaning his hip against the long tiller bar with four pistols id have killed that idiot and done this hours ago chapter helm aweather mister spenser lewrie was forced to say ease us two points off the wind the shore of the island was coming up fast and hed have to bear away to avoid its shoals the tartane was only a half mile ahead of him now but she was able to shave closer inshore still hard on the wind and brush jester off recapturing the windward advantage hed have to cede her the inshore route mister rahl he shouted through cupped hands grapeshot and scrap to damage her rigging cripple her sir rahl tried firing at extreme elevation but it was too far for grapeshot and jester had no starshot barshot or chainshot for the carronades that could whirl across the halfmile gap rahl could hit her evident by the multiple froths of small hailstorms in the waters around her but it was too light to do crippling damage and she wasnt ducking high and low anymore either but was being unflinchingly steered as close to the winds edge as she could be and beyond the island there was a narrow channel that led to a deep inlet winding back west the tall headland at the western edge of vado bay there was a village at either place a beach below the headland where fishing boats landed where the pounding of surf had created a gravelly shingle more rocky would be the narrow channel with few places to land safely herr kapitanl rahl announced in a paradeground bark i go back to der solitshot ja zir aye mister rahl lewrie shouted back weve almost got him mister peel said if hes aboard after all that is captain lewrie thankee mister peel for reminding me what fools we might yet be lewrie groaned most happily unaware of peels existence for the last few hours i borrowed lieutenant knolless telescope sir peel told him the last few minutes theres been a fellow steering her whos wearing some sort of uniform it could be thats part of a deliberate sham but i rather hope not no moren me i assure you mister peel lewrie yawned badly in need of more coffee though the galley fires had been extinguished once theyd opened fire oh well shot sir serve her another rahls roundshot from the larboard carronade had slammed into the sea so closeaboard the tartane that she reeled leeward her masts shaking and her deck heeled almost a full fortyfive degrees for a moment but she came back upright slowed by the drag of the knockdown but sailing doggedly on not turning for the narrow rocky channel right shes for the beach on the headland lewrie exulted as the island came abeam and he could see the wrinkly cats paws stirring the waters beyond it a fluke spiraling off the headland the town mister peel know it who holds it now genoese troops i think sir dont think the frogs have come over the heights this near vado yet peel perked up inland might be a different story but deck there chase is tacking damn him damn him lewrie groaned jester had to sail more than half a mile farther before she had enough clearance from the coast to come about the tartane was just a little east of the tip of the headland and could come back to norwest by north and run in winds backin sir spenser exclaimed feeding spokes alee to keep jester on the winds edge as hed been ordered hes tacked right into a shift knolles screeched headed again by god sir stand on and ready the larboard battery lewrie ordered the tartane had run into an invisible wall almost coming to a full stop as she met the wind change headon forced to bear away more and more westerly to find the proper angle fall away at a huge angle even beyond that to get some speed up before she could come back to a beat the wind was now out of the norwest and jester could turn up noreast to run in much closer to the headland and the beach and the struggling tartane chases were like that sometimes lewrie realized plod astern of a ship for hours never fetching her a yard closer but all along gaining slowly and suddenly ones ship seemed to leap forward and there she was close enough for pointblank broadsides as if someone had conjured the chase to reappear within spitting distance within the blink of an eye there she was not a quartermile off just back to speed but set too far west of the nowvisible beach to ground upon it and forced to tack again to the noreast slowing her even more theyve a boat alongside sir knolles shouted as he lowered his glass starboard side its him peel cried looks like choundas at any rate lewrie raised his own glass yes so close now he could fetch that antfigure on her quarterdeck to almost fill the ocular headtotoe he could recognize his foe of old in the red breeches and waistcoat the goldlaced blue coat and boat cloak of a french navy officer mister crewe run out the larboard battery and open fire it was rushed too rushed with the range closing so quickly it made accurate aim impossible going from a quartermile to two hundred yards in a trice roundshot went whizzing far overhead splashed too far short and too steep to ricochet only a few ball struck the tartane and missing the rowboat completely men were tumbling down into it choundas among them just as it was cast off to wallow astern the tartane bumping and grinding alongside as it fell away with no one at the helm falling down toward jester and just big enough to present a danger of collision and mask her fire shift fire to the rowboat mister crewe lewrie howled hot for murder cony hands forrud to fend that damn thing off mister spenser your eye sir to match course with her wheres andrews heah sah his coxn answered leaving his lee side carronade go below and fetch me my ferguson rifle the one with the screw breech lewrie snapped theres a shot pouch cartouche box and a powder flask stowed in my smaller sea chest in the bed space before that bastard rows out of range hurry crewe got off another ragged broadside rushed again but a lot more accurate feathers of spray flayed the sea around the rowing boat short wide a little over so closeaboard they skipped once caromed over the oarsmen to second graze near the headlands shoals but nary a bit of harm could they do luck of the devil thatun peel spat uncanny aint it gotta fall off sir spenser announced as the tartane came careening in toward their bows jester was doing about six knots and the tartane no more than four her closetrimmed lateen yards strained and her sails flatbellied the way her crew had left them scudding to a beamreach by then heeled over by the unnatural press of wind cease fire mister crewe lewrie groaned in defeat the guns were masked as jester had to turn away from the coast out of range of even his rifled ferguson hed kept since his escape from yorktown it came up from his cabins with andrews just a half minute too late gun crews leapt from the waist to scramble up on the gangway as the tartane fell alongside there was a shiver and scrape a thud as the hulls met but spenser and brauer had judged it to a nicety laid jester parallel to the collision and falling off the wind had slowed her to almost a match hes going to get away lewrie griped again sir you recall the orders you received peel snapped stony and crisply military again and fearfully impatient to complete mister twiggs bidding to him to render me every and all assistance to take or kill captain choundas christ yes mister peel but cant count on the genoese holding him sir peel rapped out cant count on him runnin into an austrian cavalry patrol and being took sir the village may have horses he could ride west till hes in the french lines you must land me at once sir me and any men of your crew whore horsemen to pursue him this minute sir sailors who can ride my god lewrie sighed looking about the deck knolles being a country gentleman had his hand up so did his clerk mountjoy cony could but he couldnt spare the bosun this minute sir peel demanded theres not a jot o time to waste mister knolles you are in command sir lewrie snapped taking the ferguson and its accoutrements from andrews mister mountjoy i hope you ride better than you scribble country hunts and steeplechasing sir mountjoy swore andrews fetch my pistols both pair for me and mister mountjoy lewrie decided my hanger and the frog smallsword bring em to the larboard gangway midships cony grapnels keep the tartane alongside for a minute you have money to rent or buy mounts mister peel some sir got me purse on me sir buchanon offered bout twenty or so pound an change god bless you mister buchanon lewrie smiled mister knolles you will stand out to sea to clear the headland then enter vado bay to report to captain nelson hyde should be along sooner or later you should recover him and his crew and wait our return well lets go then board the tartane shes trimmed for a beat and thatll take us ashore spare hands sir knolles asked not for what i have to do no mister knolles lewrie smiled grimly trotting to the gangway entry port to scramble down the battens to the main chains god speed sir and dont muck up my ship god speed to you too sir knolles replied suddenly feeling a lot older than his years chapter the tartane dribbled down jesters side as she got a way on her with lewrie alone on the quarterdeck shoving the helm hard over to the starboard corner alee to force her back onto the wind mountjoy and peel sorted out weaponry below the ladders amidships a souvenir from lewries florida adventure in a longbarreled cal fusil musket and a french cavalry musketoon six brace of assorted dragoon pocket or naval pistols and their various reloads finally clear oн jesters side falling astern and turning up to use the wind instead of being wafted aimless by it he eased the tiller sweep as peel came to the quarterdeck complete with a batteredlooking saber and scabbard at his hip they both gazed shoreward as choundass rowing boat cocked and surged over the beginnings of feeble breakers within fifty yards of the beach another quartermile inshore hell of a lead on us peel grimaced baring his horsey teeth village around the point bout another quartermile i recall well sail around and put in there i take it thought wed do things direct mister peel lewrie said with a humorless laugh hes lame he cant scamper too far or quick lewrie swung the tartanes bows a touch off the wind her decks canting over a mite more but making more speed as if he was aiming to shave the point by the thinnest of hairs east of where choundas would ground ah land us twixt him and town so he cant get a horse mister peel supposed aloud something like that lewrie agreed but uhm peel demured we dont have a rowboat they we have a boat properly speaking sir lewrie beamed humming to himself why i didnt want any extra hands along bit iffy this but you said this instant so this instant itll be looks steepto around there not so much sand in the shallows so wed not reach the shore yon rocky notch maybe six feet of water within musket shot of the shingle remind mountjoy to keep his powder dry sir when we hit and when we go over the bow good god you peel went quite pale i cant swim that mister peel i cant swim at all lewrie hooted grinning at him maliciously happy to be getting some of his own back just lie back grit your teeth and think of england hey youre daft youre peel gasped lewrie put the tiller hardover for the shore he looked about for the rowboat it was already ashore abandoned bows grinding upon the strand a flash of white shirt on a rocky path above the beach was the tail end of the escapees scrambling around the point to the village where they could blend in with their fellow genoese perhaps prop their feet up in an osteria sip some wine and pretend to be simple fishermen choundas though he hadnt a hope except to find a way to hide or flee and if there were troops in the village as peel seemed to recall they might persuade them to remember their neutrality and hunt for the french officer who violated it dear lord sir mountjoy screeched as he learned what lewrie had in mind as the tartane arrowed in toward the beach hang on alan warned they were back up to at least five knots rocks were visible underwater to windward as she went in at a sixtydegree angle there was a shudder as she scraped over something a slither of sand then a thunderous roaring and groaning as her bow and forefoot planking tore away as her keel shattered forrud and stout ribs of her hull timbers almost exploded into kindling her bow pitched high then came crashing down again she canted to starboard amid the shrieking of her masts and yards stays taut halliards and sheets twanging and snapping loud as gunshots as everything came down in ruin her motion came to a stop in an eyeblink throwing everyone off their feet lewrie fetched up at the forward edge of the quarterdeck rolling over to get back upright and regretting his precipitate action just a tad after all shed been a pretty little thing worth a pretty penny at the prize court for all the good that would have done him if his previous experiences with those thieves was anything to go by the tartane was firmly aground canted hardover to starboard and wrecked beyond repair her forward third splayed open and her back broken with her long outthrust rectangular dagofashion bowsprit platform hanging over the top of the surf line and some shallow rock pools when the wind did come from seaward later in the day shed grind and pound to death until she resembled a dead whale all spine and ribs well lets go ashore lewrie urged trotting forward to find some loose bights of line to ease their scramble down the starboard end of the sprit platform to shindeep water there were no troops in the village peels and mountjoys fluent italian gathered that much from the locals theyd ridden off a day before no no smugglers had come ashore signores they were assured only honest fishermen and herders here though more than a few tarry sorts eyed the heavily armed trio nervously from the lone taverns windows or doorway a uniformed man si si signores and very ugly hed come but he had gone quickly hired a horse and ridden off too their village didnt attract many visitors and they rarely stayed for long in any event horses si signores there is a man who has horses to buy they are molto costoso very expensive they were told with many villagers rubbing their fingers together in a universally understood sign bloody rejects peel said as he pawed a chocolate geldings chest for defects austrian genoese maybe french soundenough once i spose girth galls and saddle sores almost healed cavalry remounts stolen i shouldnt wonder maybe this bastards fattening em up to sell back later no matter lewrie snapped impatient for a gotcheyed gangly ostler lad to put saddle and pad on the likely dun mare hed picked he admits he sold a horse to choundas he recognizes our description yessir best of his lot peel replied doing his own saddling our boy brutto faccia was here right enough paid in gold didnt quibble didnt wait for change either now price he asked for ours youd think wed just bought blooded arabians stead o these in the household cavalry wed deem these welsh coalpit ponies i had a pony once mountjoy crooned to his choice to calm her as he sat her back already mounted bit me rather often he did paid for information too this brute tells me peel went on kneeing his horse to tighten the girth dont hold yer breath damnye so we had to as well theres the coast road east to vado or west to finale pick it up bout a mile inland another road at the junction goes inland northwest peel swung up into his saddle and leaned down to adjust his offside stirrup which did he take does this fellow know lewrie pressed as he swung a leg over his ferguson rifle muzzledown across his back asked about austrians peel said sitting upright i doubt this man really ever knew but he told him there had been austrians on the finale road to the west that much gold gettin slung about he told him anything he wished to hear more than like but i cant remember reports of austrian patrols this far away from vado i wager he took the northwest road inland for certain the french army is that way lets go catch him up before he finds them they set off at a brisk trot posting in their saddles finding latin saddles high pommels and backs awkward the horses were awkward too too long unexercised and fractious taken too soon from their period of recuperation to be strong the road junction was uphill all the way less than a mile but their mounts were already breathing hard a quick halt for peel to study clues in the wheel ruts and hoofprints that went in every direction those partly obliterated by boot marks of the soldiers whod left the village sir mountjoy yelped having ambled down the finale road for about two musket shots distance he came cantering back waving something aloft tricolor cockade sir just lying in the middle of the road off a frenchmans hat do you think mister peel yessir i do peel squinted down the road you stayed in the middle or on the verge sir middle sir mountjoy groaned did i err well see you wait here for a bit peel walked his gelding down the left side of the road peering at the ground he stopped where he saw fresh shoe prints that mister mountjoy had made when he dismounted then crossed over to the righthand side kneed his mount through the brushy undergrowth and disappeared minutes later though he emerged on the northwest road clever this choundas peel laughed waving them to join him for a sailor id not expect it tossed his cockade to lure any pursuit down the finale road then doubled back through these woods to hide his prints with that uniform he wears under a cloak he could almost pass as an austrian artillery officer or genoese piedmontese as little as most have seen of em yet heres his prints leading right up this inland road theres still a chance must we kill our horses so be it but we can still catch him follow me capitaine de vaisseau guillaume choundas was not a horseman he had never owned one his father couldnt afford one when he was growing up even if their principal diet came from their catches at sea grain for a horses nourishment was better put in the bellies of the choundas family than such an extravagance yet a man whod aspire to the level of the aristocracy or those untitled rich as his father had schemed for him to do the brightest of his sons must ride thered been a retired norman cavalry officer whod drilled him hours and hours in a paddock or the countryside of st malo for a small fee but young guillame had never taken to it as he had the skill of the sword pistol or mathematics what need had a naval officertobe with a good seat except to impress the ladies equipoise was nothing to him but a regrettable means to an end an onerous task to perform until hed been deemed reasonably competent and quickly abandoned as he focused on the knowledge necessary for a naval career his time at the jesuit school as an impoverished charity student pretending to espouse their vows of poverty chastity bretons made the worlds best seamen perhaps stout infantry let the rest of the franks normans and effeminate gauls who had come to dominate the ancient original pure breton race have their love of horses let the other lads prate and pose on their expensive living toys he would be a breton with his feet firmly planted on the ground or an oak deck so he sat his horse lumpishly his crippled left leg too weak to tolerate a trot he could post with his overdeveloped thighs but a few minutes work with his calf created a burning engorged numbness before it went slack and nerveless a canter or lope was much better but even a poor horseman such as he could see that this horse was not up to a fast pace for long after the road junction hed rested his gelding gone down the finale road and torn off his republican cockade to leave a false scent as hed read that rousseaus noble savages did hed then loped for threequarters of a mile inland until his horse began to toss its head and slowed to a steady longlegged distanceeating walk once on the northwest road the going was more level and easier the inclines gentler among the rockbound pastures filled with goats and sheep the gleanedover fields of stubble the orchards and patches of forest easier on the horse and him maniac choundas whispered in uneasy awe recalling again the tartane driving ashore with that madman lewrie at her helm choundas had recognized jester after their first tack from three miles off and had known at once who it was pursued him but hed bested lewrie one more time in spite of his best efforts hed gotten ashore and then gotten away but why he asked himself would such an idle rakehell turn manic insane was it possible that lewries hatred was just as hot as his own for him even though it had been guillaume whod suffered at his hands no someone must be ordering him driving him to chase me even at two hundred yards he had smelled defeat and fear the last time their ships had dueled off alassio but for that damned frigate hed have had him at last lewrie would not come after him so lustily unless pressed to it for at heart he was surely afraid of him by now a cowardly english gentlemanaristo weakwrist british agents how pleasurable it had been to send pouzins spies off on a false errand knowing from the first which ship carried the gold his next report would damn pouzin for being led astray by a bloody plot for failing as he had concerning alassio and the loss of the convoy and warships choundas suspected british agents and a vague description of a jew from london a bankerhe sounded like a cadaverous butcher whod confounded him in the far easttwigg it was more than possible and with pouzin gone himself installed as a replacement he could recall that whore claudia mastandrea to franceto answer questions lewrie had had her so he must then lure lewrie to his death with her the bait this time his bait but that death would be a long time coming choundas vowed to himself oh yes first he must scream for mercy for forgiveness that hed maimed me and made me so ugly months it could last no torment no agony too great then leave him just as ugly crippled and abhorrent a slug trailing useless legs behind him so ugly his pretty english wife and adoring children would shriek to see him and that handsome cocksure swaggering brute slashed and carved into so hideous a creature hed be as repulsive as a leper his whore from corsicamastandrea toohave them in front of him make lewrie wail and gnash his teeth in impotence was death too good for him choundas was so intent on his revenge so rapt in savage dreams that he missed the fact that the road began to curve north as it wound through a stretch of wooded hills and did not wind back but kept on trending more to the east following the path of least resistance only one horse has been along here this morning peel stated with certainty as they took a rest at the northern edge of a copse of wizened trees so interlaced and convoluted they looked woven together before them stretched about a half mile of small woodlots and orchards some small grain fields to the beginnings of a series of winding hills covered in tall pines were i out on vedette id say some guns were along here yesterday perhaps a troop of cavalry yes but whose lewrie asked beginning to question what he was doing away from his ship this far inland playing at soldiers with the french army in the offing as far as he was concerned if choundas wanted to keep on riding hed be more than happy to let him as long as he never heard from the bastard again well now thats the question isnt it sir peel chuckled another goodun would be where does this road go sir mister mountjoy muttered sounding as if he was experiencing his own reservations about their little outing perhaps your captain might know mister mountjoy peel hinted after all hes been staring at more maps of this coast than we charts lewrie corrected shifting his saddle to ease an ache it had been two years since hed been astride and his inner thighs and buttocks were reminding him of it rather insistently sea charts do you see peel prominent stuff to steer and navigate by but whats behind em out of rangetorandom shot dont signify i havent the faintest clue where we are much less where this road goes frankly i was hoping you did well all roads lead somewhere peel frowned if its good enough for choundas to follow its good enough for us he heeled his mount and clucked and they lumbered into motion once more working their way back to an easy lope for those far woods chapter guillaume choundas emerged from the woods at last after a serpentine journey in the shadow of the pines the day was warming up and he threw his boat cloak back over his shoulders before him was a wide valley with low hills to either side covered with broader grain fields and shrouded on three sides with bushcovered boulders with more woods to the north and east the road led straight on wary of being out in the open he checked the priming of one of his three pistols then rode into the sunlight about yards off there was a wayside shrine at a crossroads he rode to it warily looking about but he was quite alone the shrine was footed with a stone watering trough but it was dry filled with crumbly leaves and a greenbrown rime his horse nuzzled it snuffling disappointedly a tapering stone column at a list as it sank into the ground a small altar covered with brittlely dry flowers surrounded by fluted columns and topped with a steepled roof it had a cross but that was a recent addition he thought for the mossfilled inscription was roman like some legionary burial sites hed seen in his childhood brittany the figures though on the original stele much effaced by time were far older they were celtic he gasped with pleasure he took that as a good sign till the raven came the raven glided in from his right flared its wings and alit atop the steepled roof that was streaked with bird droppings one of lughs birds he shivered old bretons still knew whod built the dolmens and worshiped at them lugh was the greatest old god and his raven was a harbingeran ominous one it preened its feathers shook and settled then cawed once at him silhouetted against the morning sun the sun choundas sat boltupright twisting his head to scan the empty valley it was a bit past midmorning yet the sun was in his eyes he was facing southeast all the time in the woods where the sun didnt reach had he missed a trail gotten turned around his stomach chilled as he saw a patch of blue through a notch in the woodsthe sea vado bay the cart track by the shrine led down to porto vado or back to the west but it might take him back where he needed to go he strung out a rein to guide his thirsty horse as the raven cawed once more spread its wings and lifted away not six feet over his head winging off to the west choundas then heard what had disturbed itthe thud of hooves the jingle of chains and scabbards and the clomp of feet in the woods there was movement shakoed infantry and a troop of cavalry on the tracelike vado road lance pennants fluttering and points glittering above their heads austrians the ravens flight was the only clue he needed to turn away and begin to ride off again a good sign he thought that here in the land of the roman conquerors of his ancient people he was not alone that a celtic influence still resided he dug in his heels to urge the horse to get him out of sight before those lancers spotted him a shout view halloo peel cried as they left those mazey woods loped out into the broad valley theres our fox gentlemen tally ho heedless of their horses they kneed them into a gallop aiming to cut off the fleeing rider with the cloak flying behind his back mister peel in front with lewrie and mountjoy behind neck and neck almost at once came the shrill call of a trumpet to the rightrear as the troop of austrian lancers entered the valley and wheeled to form two ranks across as they trotted forward quickly changing to the canter peel lewrie warned weve got company bugger em peel threw over his shoulder drawing his saber and laying it pointdown extended beyond his horses neck on they think were french lewrie panted runnin away and youll think buggery he turned his head to see the front rank lower its lances and break into the charge at the urging of a trumpet theyre after us you damn fool speak bloody german anybody i do sir mountjoy called his clothes filthy with clods of earth and grass thrown up by peels horses hooves some anyway i picked up a few phrases from rahl and brauer and before lewrie could tell him not to mountjoy reined in and turned away to trot back toward those glittering lance points into the teeth of the charge with his hands up screeching meine herrйn meine herrйn bitte hilf mir eine fransozich spion voir verfolgen bittel bloody damn lewrie yelped knowing it was suicidal but unwilling to abandon the henhead he reined back himself slowing his horse so quickly it crowhopped after its skid quite willing to throw him off he swung back to join mountjoy at an inoffensive canter his hands empty and outstretched the only thing he knew that might identify himself was to break into a loud songrule brittania the lancers came on like an imminent collision between two ships lances still lowered as mountjoy continued yelling he had a childlike urge to cover his eyes and only watch the outcome through his fingers at the very last second though the front rank parted raising its lances and sawing back to a lope to circle him and mountjoy alan let out a huge whoosh of relief and plastered a grin on his phyz guten morgen mein herr mountjoy was babbling to a pimply faced young officer herr leutnantp mein kapitan lewrie konig george britisch kфniglich kriegsmarine wir verfolgen ein spion parlezvous franзais the blotchfaced young lieutenant said well oui certain sil vous plais mein herr good the officer laughed german is so inelegant what do you say you do msieur thank bloody christ lewrie muttered under his breath once mountjoy got to slanging grateful that it wasnt just the russians aristocracy who hated their own tongue and mostly spoke in french theyll help us pursue sir mountjoy announced leutnant baron von losma will follow us with his troop ive told him that he shouldnt mistake mister peel for choundas when we catch him up bloody good lets be at it then lewrie beamed trupp von losma piped his teenaged voice breaking with the effort though damned elegant in his movements vorwarts off they went again the lancers in a column of twos thundering up through those bouldered bushy hillocks through a patch of forest and out into another smaller valley where they caught up with peel perhaps only a half mile from where theyd split off from him he was circling his horse at a breathertrot waiting for them beyond they could see choundas just as he put his struggling horse to a slope whatd you stop for lewrie demanded reining in them damn em peel spat oh lewrie cringed a little beyond choundas at the top of that grassy slope sat a troop of french dragoonsheavy cavalry it wasnt yards off but it might as well have been the distance to the moon a column of bluecoated infantry could be seen to the north at the head of the small valley marching for the low bouldery ridge theyd left goddamn the mans shitten luck peel cried after all weve done got so close on his heels now this its as if hes in league with the devil damn his blood still a chance lewrie muttered through a dry mouth he alit from his horse trotted to the tumbled ruin of a rock fence just beside the road and unslung his ferguson rifle hed killed lanun rovers at yards with itwinged em anyway one complete turn of the triggerguard lever to lower the screw breech and open the barrels hind end lewrie its over peel pointed out we sit here this dumb and happy they have the slope of us sooner or later theyll charge and lancers aint meant to tangle with heavy cavalry headon its not over yet peel lewrie snapped sooner hes dead the sooner you and twigg leave me the hell alone he bit off the folded end of a premade cartouche the powder bitter on his tongue bullet end up the spout crank the breech shut and pull the flint strikers dogs jaws back checking to see that the flint was firmly seated and didnt slip against the leather under the clamping screws face at half cock he flipped open the frizzen to bare the pan and primed it with a measure from the powder flask that held the very finest talclike igniting powder er sir mountjoy bickered the herr baron von losma says we should hightail it soon sir hes found the frogs so a minute lewrie sighed a minute he pulled the ferguson back to full cock and put it to his eye resting the barrel on the rocks settling himself it looked to be at least yards maybe more and there was choundas stopping beside a french dragoon officer pointing back to the valley smiling like everything he suspected bragging about his escape too there was the wind to consider it was blowing from behind the cavalrymen on that far slope and a little to lewries right a shot uphill almost into the wind he held high aiming a foot above his nemesiss hat a touch to the right maybe a foot beyond choundass shoulder might as well shoot at the moon sir the herr leutnant says mountjoy interrupted with a musket at this range shut up mister mountjoy lewrie barked not a musket there was a ravens caw off to his left so near his ear that he almost jerked the trigger tramp of marching feet thud of a drum another column of infantry emerging far to left of the slope where the cavalry sat and stared at least a battalion coming to use the road they were on the raven swooshed past zooming upward gliding and tilting to gain altitude before beating its wings again flying toward choundas once it was past the wind faded the grass tips before lewrie stilled their slight wavering and he inched the barrel a bit more left took a quarterinch more elevation my congratulations on your breathtaking escape capitaine the dragoon officer enthused offering choundas a silver brandy flask though it is not every day we see our navy among us do you wish me to sweep those austrian scum who chased you away just sitting there counting heads the damned fools lancers theyre insane their infantry is not far behind them choundas cautioned as he slurped down a restoring measure of brandy we wait for the rest of the squadron then the dragoon said in disappointment for the infantry to flank them away we march on vado bay at last choundas beamed indeed capitaine soon your ships will anchor there choundas turned to look at the austrian troop and at the men in civilian dress whod accompanied them hoping that one of them was his bкte noire lewrie was that him kneeling down so close at last so far from his ship and all aid with a word he could urge this cavalryman to gallop down and take him for him he could have lewrie in chains in his cellars at nice by the next evening to begin the exquisite revenge hed planned so long just a word and there was a puff of smoke from the fence from the kneeling man it is him choundas crowed the desperate fool far past even the best musket shot the dragoon officer cried in derision and his troopers guffawed at the hopeless gesture capitaine jonville perhaps choundas began to say a raven came soaring up the slope flaring and riding the thermal off the hillside climbing climbing then beat its wings beginning to circle to guillaume choundass right hand he raised his right arm in supplication remembering what the old people had told him couldnt hit a house at that a second or two in flight arcing up then down as it lost its momentum plummeting like a howitzer shell and regaining velocity thecaliber ball slammed into guillaume choundas with the impact of a heavy hardswung cudgel smashing into the flesh and bone of his upraised right arm just below his armpit his horse screamed almost as loud as he did as he was flung sideways in the saddle and dragged to the right and down by the force of it his horse whirled as if to bite its own haunches rearing and backpedaling for balance and slinging choundass total weight onto that weak left leg caught in the stirrup shuddery and nerveless from his desperate gallop caught by the iron brace that stiffened the thick left boot he flailed to stay in the saddle but his right foot was free and he was falling to land on that right shoulder and arm and the back of his head get dragged for a few paces in a maddened circle before a trooper sprang down to grab the reins and another rushed to free his foot merde alors the dragoon officer breathed in stupefied awe miraculous eatttt thatt you bassttardd lewrie screamed as he rose to his feet his face mottled and split by a feral heathen grin alan trotted back to the horse mountjoy held took the reins and slung the ferguson over his back before mounting thats all for him gott in himmett lt baron von losma peeped turning pale good shot hey lewrie crowed riding in an impatient circle there was a sudden sputter of musketry up the valley among the trees a platoon firing at first then what sounded like a whole regiment lit off the flat bangs of a threegun battery of light artillery joined them followed by another regimental volley heraus lt von losma shouted waving his arm in the air in a signal mach schnell heraus wir zuriickziehen zur ruck jetzt the french infantry column on the road still yards away lumbered out from column to line four deep and began to load for a volley of their own their skirmishers out in front already firing time to scamper sir mountjoy translated as the lancers with them wheeled away almost in a headless panic as the french dragoons came flowing from the trees down off that far slopes crest lewrie peel breathed half in awe but his face hellishdark with concern just what the bloody hell have you started they sawed at the reins and kicked their horses to a gallop back the way theyd come whooping to scare them to greater effort eating a shower of flung clods from the rapidly retreating lancers the french helped whooping and keening with blood lust as they began to climb that bouldery bare ridge lewrie looked behind to see the dragoons in full charge sword points hungry and not fifty yards astern they almost flew over that low ridge down into the broad valley to the crossroads and past the filthy slowtoppling shrine whooping with relief to see at least a brigade of austrian infantry drawn up at the edge of the far woods another quartermile away the drumming of dragoon hooves didnt seem to falter though thundering loud as gunfire and to speak of it there was rather a lot of gunfire waves and volleys of it full broadsides of musketry they blazed past the infantry brigades left flank as trumpets sounded and drums beat to stand the soldiers to attention and begin to load lewrie dared look back once more grateful beyond all expression to see the french dragoons slowing and circling across the face of that stout brigades lines just out of musket shot think were safe now peel informed them checking his horse the troop of lancers though was still rushing pellmell down the road to porto vado the last they saw of them were the winks of lance points and colorful pennants the flash of shod hooves as they thundered away the brigade began to volley by ranks and a sudden fogbank rose before them more blaring of bugles could be heard that stopped em cold mountjoy gasped happily thank god i say for the austrians slow or not they were there when we needed he was not quite so thankful a moment later when infantrymen in gaudy austrian uniforms came streaming back from the firing out of the smoke of their own muskets in a ragged mob as fast as their legs could carry them some mounted officers appeared a few flailing with their swords to turn their troops or stop them other officers galloped on past just as intent on escape they could hear cheering far beyond over the wails of alarm closer to them the drums and tootling of a military band and harsh voices baying out la marseillais what the bloody hell mountjoy yelped as the straggling mob of fleeing infantry became a positive flood as the brigade broke christ they panicked at their own bloody volleys peel spat figuratively and literally a brigade routed by a troop o cavalry maybe we should try to ride back to that village where we began lewrie suggested fingering the brace of longbarreled pistols stuffed in his waistband he looked down that way but there seemed to be the plumes and pillars of gun smoke above those woods too doubt it peel groaned the frogsd have taken the junction above the village before we got there they need the coast roads most of all this way i think peel waved down the sketchy path to vado bay the lancers had used and quickly he added seeing the sparkle of bayonets atop the far bare ridge the blue coats and white trousers of a french brigade deployed in line across the road theyd just ridden how far do you think it is sir mountjoy asked nervously bout three dead italian horses peel replied leading them into motion kicking his alreadyweary mount to a trot but isnt anybody goin to congratulate me lewrie thought or will we live long enough for that chapter from what they could see of it the finest army in europe had turned itself into a panicstricken horde after all general de vinss dithering it had also gone from what theyd deprecated as the slowest in europe to one of the very fastest now going the wrong way its speed of retreat was breathtaking the few poor roads were strangled by trains of wagons bullock teams dragging heavy guns lighter civilian carriages and coaches were strewn along the sides of the roads broken down after theyd tried to bypass the tangled messes large artillery pieces stood abandoned by the side left in artillery parks lined up wheel to wheel as ii for an inspection but their gunners and their dray horses were gone commandeered by the first takers who could get to them there were mounted color bearers clattering along to save their regimental symbolsbut without their regiments officers dressed in a dizzying assortment of brightly martial uniforms infantry artillery cavalry commissariat medical units dragoon lancers grenadiers or fusiliers light infantry or line all mixed together all clopping off toward the sea or the east without their troops there were soldiers in dribs and drabs here a platoon there a company together shambling away to the rear without officers and it was rare to see a full battalion that had kept some sense of order or their weapons the road and ditches the fences and fields were littered with abandoned muskets pistols hangers and knapsacks cartridge boxes and powder flasks crossbelts hats neckstocks and belts anything and everything that might slow them down theyd left behind there were camp followers who accompanied every army to a war wives children laundrywomen and officers servants fiancйes amours and whores mothers and fathers come to see their sons win glory on the fields of honorall running riding or clinging to wagons or an offside stirrup to escape the french from raggedy barefoot peasant girls who slept with the privates to lordly aristocratic courtesans in court dress they lined the road crying and begging for a ride a seat behind a cavalryman for water for a clue as to where to go or a word of encouragement or an explanation of what it was they witnessed hardhearted they rode peel lewrie and mountjoy with pistols in one hand swords in the other and reins in their teeth to prevent a swarm of desperate soldiers or civilians from swamping them and taking their horses children held up to them had to be denied no matter how pitiously a young stillpretty mother might plead their mounts were barely able to carry them at the moment judderlegged and blowing so slick and foamy with ripe ammoniac sweat that lewries thighs and boots were damp with it reeking too with the rotting meat stink of saddle sores and girthgalls that had never completely healed and were now rubbed raw and open leaving blood and pus stains on the saddle pads to trickle to the corners and drip in the dirt of the road every rill every creek or well was thronged with people eager for a drink with artillerists or cavalrymen fighting their way through to water their horses before they died on them villages had to be avoided too crammed with the weak or defeatist almost elbowtoelbow or sprinkled with potential murderers whod have killed their children for a horse piedmontese peel pointed out once theyd found a shady spot far off the road downhill by the side of a small brook they were up north thirty miles or more and here they are running to the sea i think i spotted some austrian uniforms of regiments garrisoned at vado too going the other way that dont bode well i tell you it looked to be four or five miles to the coast lewrie said forcing himself to be brutal and jerk his horses lips from the water before it foundered itself last view we had that last clear hill well be on foot long before then if its that far mister peel said with a fatalistic shrug if the austrians havent abandoned it yet god the french aint pursuin them theyre herdin em weve left the ones streaming down from westtoeast lewrie pointed out as they had to lash with their reins to get their mounts to leave the brook and begin a shaky walk again think well run into a new wave coming up from vado fight our way crosscurrent then peel sighed might even be easier who knows lewrie he drew up as his horse began to limp unable to put weight on its left foreleg thats that for thisun he said dismounting at last he stripped off the saddle and pad the bridle and harness to discourage anyone else forcing the poor beast any farther and began to march beside them leaving it spraddlelegged and headdown in utter exhaustion a mile later it was lewries that sank under him too weak to stand much less walk anymore they stripped it but it could not rise just lay in the road its sides heaving and whickering in pain lewrie drew a pistol and shot it behind the ear he was an englishman adored horses of courseand had never been forced to be so callous to one ever hoped he never would again either a mile more and it was mountjoys that began to favor a forefoot they were all three now on shanks ponies and perhaps a long three miles from the sea still it was almost all downhill and they could see it winking and glittering so invitingly now and again from a vantage point the traffic was coming up to them fleeing porto vado they could see a mass migration heading north and east perversely it was easier to work their way across the flow of traffic cross fields ignored by the retreating army and its train of followers who desperately clung near the roads porto vados out lewrie said pointing south one hour later they were within a mile of the sea with the last strings of stragglers left behind them yet the port town swarmed with military activity a constant coming and going in french uniforms strike the coast over to the east perhaps might find a boat on the beach a scrap o sail we might have to go as far as genoa fancy a shore supper in genoa mister mountjoy fancy a horse sir mountjoy muttered back waving them to get low theres a french cavalry patrol yonder half a dozen riders came up a dirt path from a distant village on the sea swaying in their saddles and laughing loud enough to be heard from yards off waving foraged strawcovered wine bottles still have that cockade that choundas dropped mountjoy alan inquired yessir but you wanted a horse lewrie grunted taking it and wedging it beneath the gold loop of his hat so do i come on act superior he stood up and began to walk toward them rifle slung on his shoulder loaded and primed to fire his pistols in his waistband a march pace nothing hesitant or suspicious about him mes amisl he shouted loudly to get the cavalrymens attention alorsmes amisv from the corner of his mouth he asked a question mountjoy how do you say come here you drunken fools the cavalrymen straightened up in their saddles adjusting the undone collars of their shirts and stocks corking their bottles and trying to hide them in their forage bags come here i have need of you lewrie shouted sternly this time by himself in what he hoped passed for decent french i am capitaine choundas navy come here softer pistols lads they rode up to them a sergeant and five privates cuttyeyed and abashed at being caught drunk cringing at the harsh tone from the officer with the cockade on his hat they didnt recognize the uniform but he had an epaulet and his coat was blue the same as theirs quite close within fifteen feet mes amis lewrie began to smile holding out his arms to admonish them now peel shot first and the sergeant went backward off his horse a bullet in his chest lewrie drew a pistol pulled it to full cock and fired at the nextnearest man who was just reaching for his musketoon he went down to be dragged whimpering and bounding behind his terrified horse mountjoy dropped another whod drawn a saber dashed in and snatched the reins as the man toppled into the dirt peel shot his second a private who was trying to control his rearing mount a shot in return that went wide lewrie missing with his second pistol but mountjoy now mounted popping off at another who swayed in the saddle left arm useless the last wheeled to gallop away but peel had thecaliber musketoon to his shoulder and snapped off a shot that took the fellow in the kidneys spilling him onto the stubbly grain field hed tried to cross they managed to snare the reins of two more mounts swung up in the saddles and lashed away from their hastily improvised ambush before the rest of the cavalry unit the patrol had come from were alerted east peel shouted lashing with the reins far as we can whoo he exulted for all of them to have killed without a scratch and to be astride strong fresh horses still alive and free ten more quick miles going crosscountry above the coast roads any pursuit left behind it looked like and beyond the reach of french soldiers still encountering streams of austrians headed away as fast as they could hobble on foot mostly going inland and noreast running from nothing running away from the sea going almost as far as savona and hoping it was still in genoese hands daring to dip down to the coastal road finally where the traffic was blessedly both sparse and civilian again they drew up on a low shingly bluff at last just yards from the surf there were ships out there not a mile off which had fled vado bay themselves lewrie recognized austrian colors and genoese under red ensigns in sign of their captures no boats mountjoy groaned as spent as his stolen horse by then no way off yes there is lewrie said stripping off his coat and hat there sir there he insisted wigwagging his coat over his head come on you blind son of a bitch see me be a little curious around the next point came a rowboat under two lugsails and jib not a half mile off the beach lewrie began to shout and urged them all to wave their coats to fire off their weapons and scream the boat turned in began to slant shoreward closereaching on a sea wind that had at last come up from the soueast the boat stood in cautiously until almost level with them as they dashed down to the surf line still yelling and waving the sails were lowered and oars appeared to stroke her in within a cable lewrie could make out the dark red hull the neat gilt trim of agamemnons borrowed barge and the incredulous face of midshipman hyde in her stern sheets surrendering the helm to a more experienced able seaman whod beach her proper without risk they waded out to meet her the last few yards splashing up to their thighs as some oarsmen stroked her sideways to turn her bows to the sea while others jumped over to push her around quickly to take the surf from forrud not abeam and to help them scramble over the side to the safety of a solid oak thwart bout given you up sir hyde yelped been up and down this coast for hours looking for you captain mister knolles told me to wait till dusk if you didnt thankee mister hyde lewrie sighed glad for a sip of brackish ships water and a hard biscuit to rap then gnaw dry and for mister knolles s perseverance thank him in person soons i meet him and be damned glad of the doing you get the bastard that stole the gold sir hyde asked as the oarsmen strained to the helmsmans shouts of give way together and put yer backs in it to keep the barge moving forward up over the dangerous breaking surf to calmer water beyond the breakers aye we got him mister hyde lewrie sighed with relief and weary satisfaction we got the bastard its over now take us to jester mister hyde take us home epilogue there had been so few casualties for which the good doctor on duty had thanked a merciful god that he and his compatriots had spent mostly an idle day celebrating an almost bloodless victory over those muchvaunted austrians the coast was theirs now the entire genoese riviera as far as voltri the surgeon had heard boasted within easy ride of genoa itself the austrians and piedmontese had fled like so many terrified children far inland maybe thirty miles hed heard a cavalry chef du brigade crow once spring came once the weather was suitable the republican armйe ditalie would march to complete their conquest of all of the northwest paris was sending a new general to put life into things some newly risen pet of the directory with the improbable name of napoleone bonaparte he was reputed to be impatient and aggressive rare in an artillery officer the surgeon thought till then though through the long ligurian winter thered be peace and quiet some skirmishing but nothing of consequence nothing that tasked his skills to the utmost he could drink his wine smoke his pipe and sleep peacefully to ready himself for the horrors to come the surgeon made his last rounds among the pitiful whimpering wounded who lay in the large tents that the austrians had been so good as to abandon so hastily french casualties under canvas of course and the few piedmontese or austrians under the stars or the trees it was almost cozy in the cavernous pavillion tents glowing like so many amber jewels lit from within by a single lanthorn this one sir his assistant said with a sad moue the poor fellows left us im afraid both legs the surgeon shrugged philosophically too much stress too quickly for his humors to restore their balance cest dommage and that one feverish but better sir the assistant said gesturing for orderlys to remove the dead infantry officer the surgeon took the lanthorn to peel back the blanket and look at his handiwork a neat bit of sewing he grunted with pleasure as he puffed on his pipe you are with us sir the surgeon whispered as the man opened his eyes and groaned in pain i do not recall treating anyone from our navy before sir you came up to headquarters to see the battle hein and saw too much of it quel dommage i will i live the officer croaked gritting his teeth to withstand his pain now that he was awake to feel it roar and gibber a fairly clean wound sir the surgeon assured him chuckling a little your coat and shirt easily extracted from it nothing left behind to cause sepsis so few casualties the water still very hot in the instrument pails i have noted that there is less later infection when the water is bloodless and the water is scalding hot why it is i have no idea but i think it may be worth a letter to paris hein ahh the naval officer grunted screwing up his horribly disfigured face in torment for a second then almost seemed to find it amusing ahh he sighed as that wave of agony subsided i have cheated him again i beat him after all it does not pay to boast of beating the angel of death yet i suggest sir the surgeon laughed a week or more before we count you free of fever and able to be moved to the rear to complete your recovery in nicer surroundings hein for your stump to drain to show a laudable healing pus stump certainment capitaine uhm the surgeon frowned not sure if that was even the proper title of rank and not knowing his patients name your arm was so completely smashed the bone in shatters guillaume choundas tried to raise up to raise his arm against the surgeons entreaties and pressing hands it was gone there was a thick wrapped bandage over absorbing batt the whole once white but now pink or dull red crusted with oozed blood so short almost all nnnoooo choundas screamed nnnooooh lewrie lewrie you lllewwrieeee lugh lughs bird the raven that basstardd cest dommage the surgeon sighed minutes later after giving the distraught fellow a cup of laudanumlaced wine he took a seat on an upturned crate by the fire under the flyleaf of his wagon with the tailgate boards for a rough table bernard pass the wine hein so good this real provence not that italian muck what was that all about jeanclaude mon ami some poor fellow lost his arm the surgeon sighed bourgeois happy in his bearskin slippers at last instead of those ridiculous boots the army insisted he wear the tailboard and the fire wasnt as comfortable as his old cafй back home once the shops and his offices were closed for the night but it could be rather pleasant this life of an army surgeon so far from home you know how they can be once they know it a fellow scarred as he youd expect hes used to pain and loss but he raved like a madman not many unman themselves so loss of his looks anyway bernard snickered une hideux kept ranting about lugh lir lewrie and ravens the surgeon muttered over his wine whatever those are ever heard the like surgeon bernard had not so he merely shrugged nonsense words alliterative ravings was there a head wound hmm might keep an eye on the poor fellow jeanclaude recommend hes kept longer once hes well enough to transfer then hes someone elses worry cards nightfall on the sea aboard a sloop of war that surged surefooted and secure serene for once her young captain pacing the decks boneweary but unable to contemplate sleep as she made her way among a gaggle of escapees from the anchorage at vado bay a bath a shave a clean uniform and a more than ample supper had gone a long way toward physical recovery though he could not be sure what the next days might bring him or his ship excuse me sir mountjoy said interrupting his solitary musings with an apologetic prefatory cough could i speak with you aye mister mountjoy lewrie replied pleasantly i uhm i rather loathe to cause you or your affairs any disruption or distress but well captain lewrie mountjoy said with a sheepish gulp id like to resign my position as your clerk sir ill not put you in danger again mister mountjoy if thats no sir quite the opposite in fact mountjoy gushed going ashore with you and mister peel was the most exciting thing ive ever done sir for the first time in my life i felt active and alive useful and doing something other than scribbling as if id discovered my true calling do you see sir to shed another mans blood strive to shed choundass too well mister peel has suggested that his employer and their uhm department would find my skills very useful forgive me but i intend to hold him to it and take service with that mister silberberg as an assistant in training as it were theyll bloody get you knackered lewrie countered knife in the back some night itll be dry mountjoy what we did today isnt the usual more skulduggery like whist or chess creeping god i hope so sir mountjoy laughed like that i did as a climax to the intellectual though im not a born soldier i enjoy both sorts of action what mr silberberg described never make a sea officer sir you know that have to start very young for that not enough money for an army commission but this id be good at sir and be able to make just as grand a contribution padgett mister giless jackinthebreadroom could move up to be your clerk sir and hes diligent more so than i we both know would it be all right captain do i owe the admiralty a term of service or no you dont mister mountjoy lewrie sighed you serve me at my pleasure and eventually yours youre quite determined i am sir completely mountjoy said with fervent certainty very well then mister mountjoy lewrie said offering a hand to the young man ill accept your letter of resignation and may god protect you in your new career you may go ashore with peel at genoa god always sends the right sir mountjoy beamed thankee wish i was that certain lewrie thought of anything with france holding almost all of the genoese riviera now jester could be sent god knew where there was still the matter of false colors to settle with hotham to decide whether it was glory or infamy and a court he was just boneweary enough though to suspend disbelief to feel a small heretical sense of hope that things would work out in his and jesters favor after what buchanon had said over supper the sea hed shouted in the heat of pursuit look at the seal he thought hed meant that broad perverse windless river of calm that had doomed choundass tartane but buchanons real meaning had been a lot more hed whispered only one hour ago over port and biscuit a seal capum i saw it hed hissed closeaboard what at mister peel told o th raven ashore too dear lord sir made me go ice all over when i heard twas th olduns sir lugh and lir but really sir mean you really or just thought all the way from home there sir buchanon had whispered so reverently shivering with wonder lirs eye pon yapon her sir an you an me an all o us in his hand still swear tjesus sir i think whereer we sail lir means tfollow mayhap he meant tuse ya capum tsettle this fellah choundass business mustve rowed lir sore over somethin for him tgrant ya good cess ashore but once he uses ya he dont forget his favorites me lucky ashore lewrie wryly mused now theres a newun still he went to the bulwark to gaze out at the swelling dark sea and raise one hand almost in supplication as eight bells began to chime up forrud so blissfully routine so fragile thin but brassymellow if youre out there thankee he whispered youve your eye on us spare a glance for mountjoy too hell need it what comes good or ill so be it but thankee for jesters fortune and the night wind breathed in the shrouds as if in a soft and sympathetic assuring response afterword it wasnt the usual thing for individuals to be awarded medals in the eighteenth century those were reserved for successful campaigns or battles given only to the few quite unlike todays medals for migraines so lewrie wasnt recognized for his small part at the glorious first of june admiral howes flag captain sir roger curtis created a storm of controversy by recommending only those few of his personal favorites who had closed the foe and the rest of the ship captains went without which put them into a snit fit there is a large group portrait of howe and others at the national maritime museum greenwich england showing howe suffering tootight shoes in asperity the wounded captain sir edward snape douglas with his hand to his head distracted as if he was hearing some phantasmic voices and at the extreme left sir roger who looms like a nixon white house aide the lt edward codrington went on to fame with nelson at trafalgar and once he made flag rank commanded the victory at navarino the last sea battle fought completely under sail in yes hotham was just about as huge a drooling idiot as i wrote of him he was one of those people who could literally snatch defeat from the jaws of victory not that he tried very hard mind he was replaced in the mediterranean by admiral sir john jervis old jarvy the following year jervis was a bit on the grumpy side a disciplinarian whose harshness saved the mediterranean fleet from the rot of the great mutiny in even if he had to hang a few conspirators to keep his fleet functioning do you imagine gentle reader that lewrie and jervis will get along like a house afire hmm as for those shocked that captain horatio nelson could be portrayed as angry crude in his speech even blasphemous or that the man i wrote about isnt the marble demigod atop that pillar in trafalgar square i mean ive heard of putting people women especially on pedestals but thatun rather takes the cake doesnt it lets remember that its a long way from his fathers rectory at burnham thorpe to a harsh life in the royal navy and nelson spent the greater part of his childhood and all his adult life around sailors drawing principally upon oliver warners portrait of lord nelson i found that yes signorina adelaide correglia of leghorn existed that she was as goosebrained as i described and that nelson was just as silly over her as i wrote more to the point what capt thomas fremantle wrote in his laconically terse entries in his diary which mentions dining aboard agamemnon several times the mort was present fremantle was so terse he wrote of his marriage to mistress betsy wynne later in one rather spare sentence he refers to the happy couple as nelson and his doxy though there is a letter to sir gilbert elliot from nelson that cites one old lady who tells nelson everything they wish to know so it is possible that adelaide correglia was someone in twiggs line of work with whom like lewrie nelson could combine the business of intelligence and pleasure to further cite oliver warners work on nelson warner used the earlier work of james harrison who wrote a biography with the lady emma hamilton that woman as his source who claimed that nelson only had two faults venery and swearing harrison said of him that it is not to be dissembled though by no means ever an unprincipled seducer of the wives and daughters of his friends he was always well known to maintain rather more partiality for the fair sex than is quite consistent with the highest degree of christian purity hmm sounds rather like lewrie in that respect further such improper indulgences with some slight addition to that other vicious habit of british seamen the occasional use of a few thoughtlessly profane expletives in speech form the only dark specks ever yet discovered in the bright blaze of his moral character and id imagine that lewrie was the sort who could get so up his nose as to rouse a saint much less a nelson to intemperance the lt thomas hardy of meleager was indeed the man whom commodore nelson would risk battle with spanish frigates to rescue that hardy of trafalgar fame at the time he was a junior officer aboard meleager later following captain cockburn into the mнneme frigate cockburn hmm there may be some who could say that i have not been exactly charitable to him he was one of nelsons favorite officers held up as a paragon nelson even forgave him for shouldering agamemnon aside and putting his commodore aground under fire later at oneglia in his zeal to close the foe he was the diligent sort whod not have cared very much for lewries sort thoughnever married till he was fortyseven and that to a cousin and died without issueand i think for the reasons stated in the book that lewrie wouldnt have cared for him very much either more to the point i dont since he was that bugger who invaded the chesapeake and burned washington dc and the white house to the ground during the war of there was no raid on bordighera that i know of i made it all up thats what writers tend to do when things get slow same as surfs up when the plot broke down in all those old beach movies with annette funicello beat to quarters do twenty or so rather easier pages and let the good guys slaughter a s load of frogs yes the austrians did win the vado sweepstakes general de vins acted like confederate gen braxton bragg and came down with vapors a migraine or something turning things over to his secondincommand the morning of his battle they ran like the yankees at both battles of manassas nelson lost a lieutenant a midshipman and sixteen men at vado and his purser was forced to stagger eighteen miles with the fleeing austrians there were some units thirty miles from any french outposts who took off like greased lightning without ever having seen an enemy without a shot being firedby them or at them was that lewries fault could a single rifle shot deuced good un you have to admit have been the cause of such a rout stranger things have happened ask the yankees again at that bridge at first manassas as we unreconstructed confederates call it yeeeehhahhh besides i think we all know by now that whenever lewrie turns up things just sorta kinda happen and not always for the best nor intentionally after all he means well but so what will happen next will lewrie reconcile with phoebe will twigg throw him and claudia mastandrea together will guillaume choundas be a raving onearmed lunatic in some french bedlam or will he return to plague lewrie once more will alan settle him once and for all or will he face that courtmartial tune in tomorrow same station to discover what comes amiss with lewries and jesters fortune in the meantime i will be at wrightsville beach north carolina pondering these matters and trying to find some radical feminist bullies in thong bikinis who wish to kick sand at me
