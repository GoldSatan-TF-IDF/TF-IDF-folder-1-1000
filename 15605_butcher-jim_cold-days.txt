cold days book in the dresden files series a novel by jim butcher for chris achterhof writer of greed hell know why after reading this and all my old gaming buddies in the international fantasy gaming society you people are all silly and you made the nineties a much brighter place chapter one mab the queen of air and darkness monarch of the winter court of the sidhe has unique ideas regarding physical therapy i woke up in softness what i probably should say was that i woke up in a soft bed but that just doesnt convey how soft this bed was you know those old cartoons where people sleep on fluffy clouds those guys would wake up screaming in pain if they got suckered into taking one of those clouds after theyd been in mabs bed the fire in my chest had finally begun to die away the heavy wool lining coating my thoughts seemed to have lightened up when i blinked my eyes open they felt gummy but i was able to lift my arm slowly and wipe them clear id gone jogging on beaches with less sand than was in my eyes man being mostly dead is hard on a guy i was in a bed a bed the size of my old apartment the sheets were all perfectly white and smooth the bed was shrouded in drapes of more pure white drifting on gentle currents of cool air the temperature was cold enough that when i exhaled my breath condensed but i was comfortable beneath the beds covering the curtains around the bed parted and a girl appeared she was probably too young to drink legally and she was one of the lovelier women id ever seen in person high cheekbones exotic almondshaped eyes her skin was a medium olive tone her eyes an almost eerie shade of pale greengold her hair was pulled back into a simple tail she wore pale blue hospital scrubs and she had no makeup at all wow any woman who could wear that and still look that good was a freaking goddess hello she said and smiled at me maybe it was just the bed talking but the smile and her voice were even better than the rest of her hi i said my voice came out in a croak that hardly sounded human i started coughing she placed a covered tray on a little stand beside the bed and sat down on the edge of it she took the cover off the tray and picked up a white china cup she passed it to me and it proved to be filled with not quite scalding chicken noodle soup you do that every day talk before youve gotten anything down your throat drink i did campbells and it was awesome i flashed on a sudden memory of being sick when i was very young i couldnt remember where wed been but my dad had made me chicken noodle soup it was the same i think i remember some of it i said after several sips your name is sarah she frowned but i shook my head before she could speak no wait sarissa your name is sarissa she lifted both eyebrows and smiled thats a first it looks like youre finally coming back into focus my stomach gurgled and at the same time a roaring hunger went through me i blinked at the sudden sensation and started gurgling down more soup sarissa laughed at me it made the room feel brighter dont drown yourself theres no rush i finished the cup spilling only a little on my chin and then murmured the hell there isnt im starving what else is there tell you what she said before you do that lets shoot for another first eh i said can you tell me your name what you dont know sarissa smiled again do you harry dresden i said her eyes sparkled and it made me feel good all the way to my toes more so when she produced a plate that was piled with chicken and mashed potatoes and some other vegetables that i had little use for but which were probably good for me i thought i was going to start drooling onto the floor that food looked so good what do you do harry professional wizard i said im a pi in chicago i frowned suddenly remembering something else oh and im the winter knight i guess she stared at me like a statue for several seconds absolutely nothing on her face um i said food she shivered and looked away from me then she took a quick breath and picked up an odd little fork the kind they give to kids with motor control issuesit had lots of rounded edgesand pressed it into my hand if youre willing to go for three well have had a really good day the fork felt weird and heavy in my fingers i remembered using forks i remembered how they felt the slender weight of them the precision with which i could get food from the plate to my mouth this fork felt heavy and clumsy i fumbled with it for a few seconds and then managed on the second try to thrust it into the mashed potatoes then it was another chore to get the stupid thing to my mouth the potatoes were perfect just warm enough barely salted with a faint hint of rich butter ohmmgdd i muttered around the mouthful then i went for more the second forkful was easier and the third easier than that and before i knew it the plate was empty and i was scraping the last of the remains into my mouth i felt exhausted and stuffed though it hadnt been all that much food sarissa was watching me with a pleased smile got it all over my face dont i i asked her it means you enjoyed the food she said she lifted a napkin to my face and wiped at it its nice to know your name finally harry there was the sound of light steady footsteps coming closer sarissa rose immediately turned and then knelt gracefully on the floor with her head bowed well said a womans velvet voice my whole body shuddered in response to that voice like a guitars string quivering when the proper note is played near it hes lucid your majesty and remembered my name and his he fed himself excellent said the voice you are dismissed for today thank you your majesty said sarissa she rose glanced at me and said im glad to see you feeling better sir knight i tried to come up with something charming or witty and said call me she huffed out a surprised little breath that might have been the beginning of a laugh but shot a fearful glance the other way and then retreated the sound of her sneakers scuffing on the hard floor faded into the distance outside the curtained bed a shadow moved across the curtains at the end of the bed i knew whose it was you have passed your nadir she said in a decidedly pleased tone you are waxing rather than waning my knight i suddenly had difficulty thinking clearly enough to speak but i managed well you know wax on wax off she didnt open the curtain around the bed as much as she simply glided through letting the sheer cloth press against her outlining her form she exhaled slowly as she reached my side looking down at me her eyes flickering through shades of green in dizzying cycles mab the queen of air and darkness was too terrifying to be beautiful though every cell in my body suddenly surged with mindless desire and my eyes blurred with tears to see her beauty i did not want to come an inch closer she was a tall woman well over six feet and every inch was radiance pale skin soft lips the color of frozen raspberries long silverwhite hair that shone with opalescent highlights she was dressed in a silk gown of deep frozen green that left her strong white shoulders bare and she was about six inches away from being in bed with me you look great i croaked something smoldered in those almondshaped eyes i am great my knight she murmured she reached out a hand and her nails were all dark blues and greens the colors shimmering and changing like deep opals she touched my naked shoulder with those nails and i suddenly felt like a fifteenyearold about to kiss a girl for the first timeexcitement and wild expectation and fluttering anxiety her nails even just the very tips were icy cold she trailed them down over one side of my chest and rested them over my heart um i said into what was for me an incredibly awkward silence how are you she tilted her head and stared at me sarissa seems nice i ventured a changeling mab said who once sought of me a favor she saw lloyd slates tenure as my knight i licked my lips um where are we arctis tor she said my stronghold in the knights suite you will find every mortal amenity here thats nice i said what with my apartment burned to the ground and all is there a security deposit a slow smile oozed over mabs mouth and she leaned even closer to me it is well that you heal she whispered your spirit wandered far from your body while you slept free spirit i said thats me not anymore mab murmured and leaned down toward me you are shaking yeah her eyes filled my vision are you frightened of me harry im sane i said do you think i am going to hurt you she breathed her lips a fraction of an inch from mine my heart beat so hard that it actually hurt i think you are who you are surely you have no reason to fear she whispered her breath tickling my lips you are mine now if you are not well i cannot use you to work my will i tried to force myself to relax thats thats true i said i hadnt seen her picking up the thick fluffy pillow beside me while she held my eyes so i was totally unprepared when she struck as fast as any snake and slammed the pillow down over my face i froze for half a second and the pillow pressed down harder shutting off my air clogging my nose and mouth then the fear took over i struggled but my arms and legs felt as if theyd been coated in inches of lead i tried to push mab away but she was simply too heavy my arms too weak her hands and forearms were frozen steel slender and immovable my vision went from red to black sensation began to recede mab was cool unrelenting merciless she was mab if i did not stop her she would kill me mab couldnt kill a mortal but to her i was no longer one of them i was her vassal a member of her court and as far as she was concerned she had every right to take my life if she saw fit that cold knowledge galvanized me i locked my hands around one of her arms and twisted straining my entire body my hips arched up off the bed with the effort and i wasnt even trying to push her away there was no opposing the absolute force of her but i did manage to direct her strength just a little to one side and in so doing managed to push her hands and the smothering pillow past me freeing my face enough to suck in a gasp of sweet cold air mab lay with her upper body across mine and made no effort at all to move i could feel her eyes on me feel the empty intensity of her gaze as i panted my head swimming with the sudden rush of blessed oxygen mab moved very slowly very gracefully there was something serpentine about the way she slithered up my body and lay with her chest against mine she was a cold ephemeral weight an incredibly feminine softness and her silken hair glided over my cheeks and lips and neck mab made a low hungry sound in her throat as she leaned down until her lips were almost touching my ear i have no use for weakness wizard she shivered in a kind of slow alien ecstasy rest heal sleep i shall most likely kill you on the morrow you a princess bride quote i croaked what is that she asked then she was gone just gone and that was day one of my physical therapy i could describe the next few weeks in detail but as bad as they were they did have a certain routine to them besides in my head theyre a music video montage set to the foo fighters walk i would wake in the morning and find sarissa waiting for me keeping a polite and professional distance between us she would help me take care of the needs of my weakened body which was rarely dignified but she never spoke about herself at some point after that mab would try to kill me in increasingly unexpected and inventive ways in the video in my head theres a shot of me eating my own meal againuntil just as i finish the giant bed bursts into flames i awkwardly flop out of it and crawl away before i roast then obviously the next day sarissa is helping me walk to the bathroom and back just as i relax back into bed a poisonous serpent a freaking indian cobra falls from the beds canopy onto my shoulders i scream like a girl and throw it on the floor the next day im fumbling my way into new clothes with sarissas helpuntil a small swarm of stinging ants comes boiling out of them onto my flesh and i have to literally rip the clothes off of me it goes on like that sarissa and me on waisthigh parallel bars me struggling to remember how to keep my balance interrupted by a tidal flood of redeyed rats that forces us to hop up onto the bars before our feet get eaten off sarissa spotting me on a bench press and then mab bringing a great big old firemans ax whistling down at my head at the end of my third set so that i have to block with the stupid straight bar me slogging my exhausted way into a hot shower only to have the door slam shut and the thing start to fill with water into which freaking piranha begin to plop on and on seventyseven days seventyseven attempted murders use your imagination mab sure as hell did there was even a ticking crocodile i had just gotten back from the small gym whered id hiked about four miles up and i dont know how many miles forward on the elliptical machine i was sweaty and exhausted and thinking about a shower and then bed again i opened the door to my quarters and when i did mab opened fire with a freaking shotgun i didnt have time to think or calculate before she pulled the trigger all i could do was react i flung myself back slammed my will out into the air ahead of me coalescing it into a barrier of pure energy the gun roared deafening in the enclosed space buckshot slammed against the barrier and bounced scattering everywhere landing with pops and rattles i hit the floor keeping the barrier up and mab advanced her eyes glittering through every shade of opal wild and ecstatic and incongruous against her otherwise calm expression it was one of those russiandesigned shotguns with the big drum magazine and she poured all of it into me aiming for my face the second the gun went click instead of boom i flung myself to one side in a swift roll just in time to avoid the pounce of a silvergrey malka feline creature about the size of a bobcat with wicked claws and the strength of a small bear it landed where my head had been its claws gouging chips from the stone floor i kicked the malk with my heel and sent him flying across the hall and into the stone wall he hit it with a yowl of protest i whirled my attention back to mab as she dropped one drum magazine on the floor and produced another before she could seat it in the weapon i slashed at the air with my hand and shouted forzare unseen force lashed out and ripped the magazine and the shotgun alike from her hands i made a yanking motion and the bouncing shotgun abruptly shot across the empty space between us i grabbed it by the barrel which was freaking hot just as the malk recovered and leapt at me again i swung the empty shotgun twohanded and slammed the malk in the skull hard enough to knock it from the air and leave it senseless on the floor mab let out a delighted silvery laugh and clapped her hands like a little girl who has just been told shes getting a pony yes she said lovely brutal vicious and lovely i held on to the shotgun until the stunned malk recovered and began slinking sullenly away and only after it was out of sight around the corner did i turn to face mab again this is getting old i said dont you have anything better to do with your time than to play grimtooth games with me indeed i do she replied but why play games if not to prepare for challenges that lie ahead i rolled my eyes fun i suggested the delight faded from her face replaced by the usual icy calm it was a scary transformation and i found myself hoping that i had not provoked her with my wiseassery the fun begins when the games end my knight i frowned at her what is that supposed to mean that appropriate attire awaits you in your chambers and that you are to get dressed for the evening she turned to walk after the departed malk her gown whispering on the stone of the floor tonight my wizard shall be fun chapter two back in my room i found my clothes waiting for me a tux in dark silver and pearl the first of two small paper envelopes proved to contain a pair of jeweled cuff links the stones too blue and too brilliant to be sapphires the other one held my mothers amulet it was a simple silver pentacle a battered fivepointed star bound within a circle on a simple silver chain the pentacles center was filled with a small red stone cut to size id once fastened the gem into place with hot glue apparently mab had sent it to a genuine jeweler to attach it with something more solid i touched the stone gingerly and could instantly sense the energy within it the psychic journal of my late mothers travels i slipped the amulet on over my head and felt a sudden and profound sense of relief i had thought it lost when my bulletriddled self had fallen into the waters of lake michigan i stood there with my hand over it for a moment just feeling the cool metal press against my palm then i got dressed in the tux and examined myself in a mirror the size of a pool table just a gigolo i sang offkey trying to enjoy myself everywhere i go people know the part im playing the guy looking at me out of the mirror looked raw and hard my cheekbones stood out starkly id lost a lot of weight while i was in what amounted to a coma and my rehabilitation had added only lean muscle back onto me you could see veins tight against my skin my brown hair hung down past my jawline clean but shaggy i hadnt cut it or asked for a barber things that know magic can do awful stuff to you if they get hold of a lock of your hair so id decided to hang on to mine id ditched the beard though beards grow out so fast that if you shave every day there isnt much of a window for anyone to use them against youand shaved stubble is too diffuse to make a decent channel anyway i looked a little more like my brother with the long hair go figure long lean face dark eyes a vertical line of a scar under the left one my skin was absolutely pastypale i hadnt seen the sun in months lots of months as i looked the song just sort of faded out i didnt have the heart for it i closed my eyes what the hell are you doing dresden i whispered youre being kept locked up like a goddamned pet like she owns you does she not growled a malks voice didnt i mention it those things can talk they dont pronounce words too well and the inhuman sound of it makes the hairs on the back of my everything stand up but they talk i spun lifting my hand in a defensive gesture again but i neednt have bothered a malk i didnt think id seen before sat on the floor of my chambers just inside the door his toolong tail curled all the way around his front feet and overlapped itself in the back he was a huge specimen of the breed maybe eighty or ninety pounds the size of a young adult mountain lion his fur was pitchblack apart from a white spot on his chest one thing id learned about malks was that you didnt show them weakness ever these are my chambers i said get out the malk bowed its head i cannot sir knight i am under orders from the queen herself get out before i get you out the very tip of the big malks tail twitched once were you not the bond servant of my queen and were i not obliged to show you courtesy i should like to see you try it mortal i squinted at him that was very unmalklike behavior apart from one every malk id met had been a bloodthirsty little killing machine primarily interested in what it could tear apart and devour next they werent much for small talk they also werent terribly brave especially when alone a malk might jump you in a dark alley but youd never see him coming this one looked like it might like to see me put a chip on my shoulder i extended my senses cautiously and suddenly felt the nearly silent thrum of the malks aura whoa the thing had power like lots of power you couldnt usually feel a wizards aura unless you were close enough to touch it but i could feel his from across the room whatever that thing was it only looked like one of the other furry terminally add homicidal maniacs i reeled in on the attitude who are you the malk bowed his head once a faithful servant of the queen of air and darkness i am most often called sith heh i said wheres your red lightsaber siths golden eyes narrowed when first your kind began scrawling knowledge upon stone and clay my name was ancient walk carefully around it just trying to brighten the conversation with humor sithy you need to cheer up siths tail twitched again slicing your spine into coasters would cheer me may i gotta go with no on that one i said then i blinked wait youre cat sith the cat sith the malk inclined its head again i am he hells bells cat sith was a major figure in faerie folklore this thing wasnt just a malk it was the freaking monarch of the malks their progenitor their optimus prime id taken on an ancient faerie creature like this one a few years back it hadnt been pretty when cat sith had offered to slice my spine into coasters he wasnt kidding if he was anything like the ancient phobophage he could do it i see i said um what are you doing here i am your batman my not the notional hero sith said a bit of a growl in his voice your batman your orderly orderly i frowned wait you work for me i prefer to think of it as managing your incompetence sith replied i will answer your questions i will be your guide while you are here i will see to it that your needs are met i folded my arms and you work for me siths tail twitched again i serve my queen aha evasion there was something he was avoiding you are to answer my questions are you not yes did mab order you to obey my commands twitch twitch twitch went the tail sith stared at me and said nothing silence could generally be taken as assent but i just couldnt resist get me a coke sith stared at me then he vanished i blinked and looked around but he was gone then maybe a second and a half later there was the snaphiss of a beverage can being opened i turned and found cat sith sitting on one of the rooms dressers an opened can of coke sat beside him whoa i said how did you dont even have thumbs sith stared at me i crossed to the dresser and picked up the can siths eyes tracked me the whole time his expression enigmatic and definitely not friendly i sipped at the drink and grimaced warm you did not tell me otherwise he said i shall be happy to similarly fulfill any such command you give me sir knight but for those that contravene the orders of my queen translation i dont want to be here i dont like you give me commands and i will give you hell for it i nodded at the malk i hear you i sipped at the coke warm or not it was still coke so why the tux whats the occasion tonight is a celebration of birth birthday party huh i said whose sith said absolutely nothing for several seconds then he rose and leapt down to the floor landing without a sound he flowed past me to the door you cannot possibly be that stupid follow me my hair was still pretty messy i slopped some water on it and combed it back which was as close to neat as it was going to get and then walked after sith my patent leather formal shoes gleaming and clicking on the stone floor whos going to be at this party i asked sith when i caught up to him i hadnt left my chambers in a while my entire life had been eating sleeping and getting myself put back together besides i hadnt wanted to go sightseeing around arctis tor the last time id been there id pissed off the faeries like all of them i hadnt fancied the idea of bumping into some hostile bogeyman looking for payback in a dark corridor the door leading from my chambers opened by itself and sith walked through it with me behind him the high and mighty among the winter sidhe sith said important figures from the wyld there may even be a delegation from summer there as we emerged into the capital of winter the corridors changed from what looked more or less like smooth poured concrete to crystalline ice in every hue of glacial blue and green the bands of color merging intertwining flickers of light danced through the depths of the ice like lazy fireflies of violet and crimson and cold sky blue my eyes wanted to follow the lights but i didnt let them i couldnt tell you why but my instincts told me that would be dangerous and i listened to them kind of a big event huh i said think therell be a problem with the paparazzi one may hope sith said dispatching the perpetrators of such an intrusion would be gratifying the air was arctic cold i could feel the biting depth of the chill but its fangs couldnt seem to break my skin it wasnt exactly comfortable but it didnt matter i didnt shiver i didnt shake i chalked it up to the power mab had given me sith led me down a much dimmer corridor and we passed in and out of patches of deep darkness and cold sullen light as we did our shadows danced and stretched after a few seconds i noticed that cat siths shadow was larger than mine like seven or eight times larger than mine i gulped the last time i was at a supernatural shindig i got poisoned and then everything there tried to kill me so i burned the whole place to the ground i said an appropriate way to deal with ones enemies sith said perhaps you will find arctis tor less flammable ive never met a place i couldnt blow up burn down or knock over with enough motivation i said think anyone at the party wants to kill me yes i want to kill you because i annoy you because i enjoy it sith glanced up at me for a moment his billboardsize shadow on the wall mirrored the motion and you also annoy me its one of my gifts asking annoying questions is another other than you is there anyone at the party i should make sure not to turn my back to you are of winter now wizard his turned his golden eyes away from me again dont turn your back to anyone chapter three cat sith led me down passages i had never seen on my previous visit to mabs seat of power heck back then i had thought it consisted entirely of a wall around a courtyard and a single turreted tower i hadnt ever seen the complex beneath the ice of the courtyard it was enormous we walked for ten minutes mostly in the same direction before cat sith said that door the one he spoke of was made of ice just like the walls though it had a thick ring of what might have been silver hanging upon it i grabbed the ring and tugged and the door opened easily onto a small antechamber a little waiting room complete with several easy chairs now what go in cat sith said wait for instructions follow instructions im not good at either of those things i said siths eyes gleamed excellent i have orders to dispatch you if you disobey mabs commands or undermine her authority in any way why dont you go ask eldest fetch how easy that one is mittens i said scat sith didnt vanish this time he just sort of melted into shadow his golden eyes remained behind for a few seconds and then he was gone always stealing from the greats i mumbled lewis carrolls estate should be collecting a licensing fee from that guy unless of course it was maybe the other way around i went into the chamber and the door shut behind me there was a table with what looked like handmade candies on it i didnt touch them not because i was worried about my svelte figure but because i was standing at the heart of wicked faerieland and eating random candy seemed like a less than brilliant idea there was an old book on the table next to the candies set carefully and precisely in place beside the dish it was titled kinder und hausmärchen i leaned down and opened it the text was in german it was really old the pages were made of paper of the finest quality thin and crisp and edged in gold foil on the title page under the title were the names jacob and wilhelm grimm and the year it was autographed and personalized for mab i couldnt read the text so i settled for the illustrations it was better than reading those stupid celebrity magazines in every other waiting room and was probably more grounded in reality the door opened soundlessly while i looked at the book and a vision came into the room she wore a velvet dress the deep bluepurple of twilight she glanced back toward the hallway behind her as the door closed and i saw that the dress plunged low in the front she had matching opera gloves that reached to halfway up her biceps and there was a garland of periwinkles in her dark hair that complemented the dress gorgeously then she turned back to me and smiled oh my she said you clean up nicely harry i rose politely to my feet though it took me a couple of seconds to say sarissa wow you barely look like you she quirked an eyebrow at me but i saw a pleased tilt to her mouth my that was almost a compliment im out of practice i said i gestured toward a chair would you care to sit she gave me a demure smile and did moving with an absolute and liquid grace i offered her my hand to help her sit which she didnt need she gripped my fingers lightly anyway once she was seated i sat back down myself did you want a bit of candy her smile somehow contained gentle reproof i hardly think that would be wise do you hells bells no i said i just uh you make conversation when youre uh im not sure what to i picked up the priceless copy of the grimms tales and held it up book sarissa covered her mouth with one hand but her eyes twinkled oh um yes ive seen it a few times ive heard rumors that her majesty worked hard to make sure the tales were put into print sure i said makes sense why she asked oh the sidhes influence had been waning as the industrial age gathered steam i said by making sure the tales kept being told to mortal children she made sure that she and her folk were never forgotten and thats important sarissa asked if it wasnt why else would she do it im pretty sure that being forgotten is bad for beings that live with one foot in the mortal world and the other over here wouldnt shock me if she greased some wheels for walt disney either he did more than anyone else to bring those stories into modern times hell he built a couple of fairylands in the mortal world i hadnt ever thought about it that way sarissa said she folded her hands in her lap and smiled at me it was a completely calm and lovely expressionbut i had the sudden instinct that she was concealing unease i might not have been able to tell a couple of months ago but shed been on the periphery of several of mabs therapy sessions and id seen her react to sudden fear and stress there was that same sense of controlled tension in her now as there had been when a small avalanche of poisonous spidersbig oneshad come cascading out of the towel cupboard in the workout room shed been wearing capri pants and no shoes at the time and shed had to hold completely still while dozens of the things swarmed over her naked feet until i could clear them off gently and cautiously so as not to threaten the little things into killing us that particular test had been all about regulating ones reaction to sudden fear sarissa had done it refusing to let her anxiety control her shed waited expressionless and almost calm looking much then as she did right now it made my feet start to itch she was expecting spiders so i said to what do i owe the pleasure of your company do you need me to perform some lastminute yoga routines you took to yoga like a duck to vacuum she said i know how much you love the routines but im afraid i must disappoint you tonight im to be on your arm by command of the queen im supposed to tell you the protocols for a gathering of the court and make sure you dont get too bored i leaned back in my chair and regarded her thoughtfully i cant remember the last time i had that problem and gosh walking around with someone as lovely as you all night sounds like torture she smiled and lowered her eyes can i ask you something i asked of course i didnt use that like a rhetorical question i said im serious id like to ask you something but if you would rather keep it to yourself thats okay too that put a crack in her mask i saw her eyes flick up quickly to my face for a moment and then back down why wouldnt i want to answer your questions because weve been working together every day for eleven weeks and i dont know your last name i said i dont know what you do in the real world i dont know your favorite color or what kind of ice cream you like best i dont know if you have family youre very very good at talking about things that dont matter and making it seem like the only conversation that could possibly have made sense she very carefully did not move or answer mabs got something on you too doesnt she just like she does me there was another moment of stillness then she said in a bare whisper mab has something on everyone the only question is whether they realize it or not i get that youre afraid of me i said i know you saw lloyd slate in action when he was the winter knight and i know exactly what a peach of a human being he was and i figure you think im going to be like him i didnt say that she said it wasnt an accusation i said as gently as i could im not trying to trick you into saying something im not hoping that youll give me an excuse to do something to you okay im not like lloyd slate neither was he sarissa whispered not at first a cold little feeling wobbled through my guts see thats the tragedy of the human condition no one wants to be corrupted by power when they set out to get it they have good even noble reasons for doing whatever it is they do they dont want to misuse it they dont want to abuse it and they dont want to become vicious monsters good people decent people set out to take the high road to pick up power without letting it change them or push them away from their ideals but it keeps happening anyway history is full of it as a rule people arent good at handling power and the second you start to think youre better at controlling your power than anyone else youve already taken the first step this is the reality sarissa i said quietly im the winter knight ive got mabs favor and blessing i can pretty much do as i damned well please here and i wont have to answer to anyone but her for it the young woman shivered if i wanted it i said quietly if i wanted y to hurt you i could do it right now you couldnt stop me and no one else would do a damned thing ive spent a year on my back and now that im moving again um my various drives are clamoring for action in fact mab probably sent you in here to see what i would do with you the pleasant mask faded from sarissas face replaced with wary neutrality yes of course she did she switched her hands moving the bottom one to the top carefully as if she worried about wrinkling her dress i know exactly what role she has in mind for me sir knight i am toher mouth twistedbe at your convenience yeah well i said that isnt going to happen obviously her eyes widened slightly she held completely still im sorry im not lloyd slate i said im not one of mabs pet monstersand ill die before i let her make me into one you were kind to me and you helped me through a bad patch sarissa i wont forget that you have my word i dont understand she said it isnt complicated i said i wont take anything away from you i wont force you to do anything you dont want to do period i couldnt interpret the expression on her face when i said that there could have been anger in it or suspicion or terror or skepticism whatever was going on in her head to make her face look like that i couldnt translate it you dont believe me i said do you ive lived a third of my life inside arctis tor she said and turned her face away i dont believe anyone in that moment i didnt think id ever seen someone so entirely lovely look so utterly alone a third of her life in winter and yet she could still be compassionate and friendly and caring shed probably seen things had to face ugliness that few mortals ever didthe unseelie were endlessly enthusiastic about their amusements and they liked their games nasty and cruel but here she was facing a fate she must have feared since she was a childbeing given to a monster to be devoured facing it calmly staying in control of herself and still managing to be warm to me too that told me she had a lot of strength and strength has always been something i found attractive in a woman so has courage so has grace under pressure i could really get to like this girl which of course was why mab had chosen herto tempt me to make me convince myself to abandon the high road so that i could have her then once id done one little thing shed start scattering new lures in front of me until eventually i picked another one up mab was mab she had no intention of keeping a knight with a conscience so she was planning on assassinating mine an inch at a time once id abused my power over the girl mab would use my guilt and selfloathing to push me to the next step and the one after that mab was one coldblooded bitch i looked away from sarissa i was going to have to keep her safefirst and foremost from me i understand i told her or at least i understand part of it my first mentor wasnt exactly officer friendly either she nodded but it was an entirely noncommittal gesture an acknowledgment that i had spoken not a statement of agreement okay i said uncomfortable silence is uncomfortable why dont you tell me what i need to know for tonight she collected herself and slipped back into her pleasant demeanor well enter next to last just before the queen she will present you to the court and then there will be a meal and entertainment after the feast youll be expected to mingle with the court and give them a chance to meet you thats the protocol thanksgiving dinner at the inlaws something like a real smile brought a little light to her eyes at the sight of which my glands did not go pitterpat at all not quite she said there are two laws all must follow under pain of death only two man how do unseelie lawyers make a living first sarissa said ignoring my wiseassery blood may not be spilled upon the floor of the court without the queens express command no murder without getting the nod first got it second no one may speak to the queen without her express command i snorted seriously because im not much for keeping my mouth shut in fact im pretty sure i physically cant probably because i was influenced at an impressionable age did you ever read any spiderman comics when you were harry sarissa said her voice suddenly tight she put her hand on my arm and her lean fingers were like heavy wires no one speaks to the queen she whispered intently no one not even the lady maeve dares disobey that law she shuddered ive seen what happens we all have i pursed my lips and studied her hand thoughtfully for a moment then i nodded okay i said i hear you sarissa exhaled slowly and nodded just then a door i hadnt seen before opened in the center of what had looked exactly like a wall cat sith stood on the other side of the door he ignored me pointedly turning his golden eyes to sarissa it is time very well sarissa said we are ready i rose and offered sarissa a hand up she took it and i tucked her arm into mine her fingers gave my forearm one quick squeeze and then we turned to follow cat sith down another hallway sarissa leaned a little closer to me and whispered you know what this is dont you i grunted quietly yeah i said its my first day in the prison yard chapter four sith led us down yet another passageway this one darker than the others until finally i couldnt see the malk at all in the dimness instead a very dim phosphorescence in the shape of his paw prints began to rise from the floor giving us just enough light to move by i could feel sarissa growing increasingly tense beside me but she said nothing smart if anything was going to jump up and eat us our ears would tell us about it first the sound of our steps on the floor changed and i realized that we had moved into a large open space just as i did the glowing paw prints in front of us vanished i stopped at once pulling sarissa in closer against my side again she remained completely silent except for one sharp little inhalation silent seconds went by sith i said quietly you are a suck guide i dont care how big your shadow is my voice echoed cavernously while i waited but apparently sith didnt have a comeback after a few seconds i reached up and tugged my amulet out of the tux i held it up and concentrated sending a microcurrent of my will into the design and an instant later it began to glow with a bluewhite light i held it aloft and looked around we were in another ice cave this one filled with enormous bizarre structures was the only thing i could think to call them i might have called them sculptures except no one does sculptures the size of buildings these days even in ice i looked around the place slowly there was something odd about the structures something almost sarissa was looking too she seemed alert but not frightened are those giant pieces of furniture familiar the structures were sculpture built on a scale of maybe one to eight of a couch two easy chairs a brick fireplace bookshelves mab had recreated my old basement apartment in ice right down to textured carvings of all of my area rugs crafted into the ice of the floor i had about a second to take that in before the cavern exploded with sound color and motion a wave front of pure noise slapped against me as a sudden horde of beings from every dark folktale ever told surged into view at the edges of my light their screams and cries coming from all around me this was a worstcase scenario for a mortal wizard we can do amazing things but we need time to make them happen sometimes we get that time by preparing well in advancecreating tools that help us focus our abilities more quickly and with greater precision sometimes we get the time by picking where and when to begin our battles sometimes we do it by slinging the spell from a couple or a couple hundred miles away but i didnt have any of that going for me my convalescence with mab had kept me way too busy recovering or sleeping to have enough time to create new tools and my amulet was all i had on the upside mab had given me a serious workout magically speaking id been forced to use my abilities without any kind of tools or crutch to help me or else perish i was better at wielding raw magic now than id ever been in my life it just wasnt going to be enough to survive what was coming at me i moved without thinking putting myself between sarissa and as many of them as i could and bringing my will to bear upon my right hand pallid bluewhite fire suddenly engulfed my fingers as i let the pentacle fall i raised my handno time to think or aim or plandetermined to take someone down with me sarissas hand snapped out and she grabbed my wrist jerking my arm down before i could unleash the spell and i heard two things in the vast roar of sound first sarissa screaming no bloodshed second i realized that everything else in the cavern was bellowing surprise the horde of all things dark and hideous stopped maybe twenty feet short of sarissa and me and the walls and floor and ceiling began to glow with light music began to play a full symphonic freaking orchestra live somewhere on the other side of the giant replica of my old secondhand sofa high up on the ceiling of the cavern thousands of wisps of eerie light swarmed deep within the ice swiftly forming up like a flotilla of synchronized swimmers until they formed the words happy birthday dresden i stood there with my heart beating too fast for several seconds and blinked at the entire place uh oh sarissa studied the ceiling for a moment and then looked up at me i didnt know neither did i really i said is it halloween already just barely i think sarissa said back it got weirder they started to sing they sang happy birthday remember when i said that a malks voice made my skin crawl its nothing next to the cackling rasp of a swamp hag or the freakyweird whistling voice of a manticore goblins cant carry a tune if it has handles and the huge bat things that served as mabs air force shrieked in pitches that could barely be heard trolls hideous giant thugs towering over ten feet tall sound like laryngitic foghorns but layered all throughout that cacophony were voices that went to the other extreme voices that carried the melody with such perfect razoredged clarity that it made me want to slash my wrists on it people always equate beauty with good but it just aint so amongst the winter court were beings of haunting beauty mesmerizing beauty disarming beauty flawless beauty maddening beauty bloodthirsty beauty even in the mortal world a lot of predators are beautiful and if youre quick and motivated enough you can admire that beauty while they kill you and eat you like all the other things there the sidhe sang to me and i could feel the weight of their attention on me like the pressure wave from an onrushing shark you dont listen to music like that you survive it the voices ended abruptly and left one crystalline alto singing and many more the crowd of creatures parted suddenly and a girl stepped out of their ranks she paused for a moment for dramatic effect and to give everyone time to admire her shed changed her hair again now it was a kind of extrawide mohawk long except for where it had been shaved completely away from the sides of her head where the cut could show off the tips of her gently tapering ears it was still colored in all glacial shades of blue and green and deep violet and hung down over much of one side of her face allowing her to borrow enough of veronica lakes vibe to give her wide wide eyes a little extra hint of cheerily wicked mystery she was tallish for a girl maybe fiveten and built with that perfect balance of lean and lush proportions that some girls are lucky enough to have for maybe a year the kind of look that gets girls that age in trouble with men who should be old enough to know better and she was naked gloriously disconcertingly nakedand just as fresh and vibrant and unspoiledlooking as shed been the first time id met her most of ten years before only you know shed been less naked then man was i ever noticing that part heres the birthday boy maeve said in a singsong voice flinging both arms up she started toward me in a slow and slightly exaggerated walk technically she wasnt entirely naked she had silver piercings at the tips of her breasts beneath her lip in her navel and probably elsewhere i didnt let myself look quite that close her flawless pale skin was also spangled with gemstones i dont know how theyd been attached but they clung to her and sent little flashes of color glittering around the cavern when she moved they were concentrated most densely around her well shed been ah vajazzled she came slinking over to me in the silence her green eyes framed in a quasimask of gemstones and some kind of henna inking and she absolutely smoldered with sex not that shed never been suggestive before but this was taking things to a whole new level look at you she said walking around me and eyeing me slowly and thoroughly rumors of your death have been greatly exaggerated it would seem hi maeve i said you know i almost wore that same outfit gosh would our faces have been red the winter lady mabs successor and understudy completed the circle and stopped in front of me just oozing pure animal attraction it is a birthday i wore a birthday suit she took a deep breath mostly for effect i hope you approve hell yes i approved or at least everything south of my upper lip didway more than it should have really she wasnt using some kind of magic on me i had gone on alert to such a possibility the second id seen her it must have been all the rest and the exercise and the good diet most of which id successfully avoided back in the real world it had resulted in a robust and healthy yet perfectly normal libido perfectly normal it wasnt me changing whatever mab had done to me that had healed a broken spine made me able to run at vampire speed and given me the kind of reflexes that were capable of keeping up with the attack of a furious malk hadnt changed me on some fundamental level everything was perfectly healthy and normal here in denial land maeves eyes met mine and she gave me a slow slow smile and as when mab had been near i felt my whole body thrum in response to her to her presence her proximity to her everything that smile contained something within it something conveyed to me in a flashing instantmaeve as she would look in ecstasy beneath me looking up at me with that lovely face mindless with sensation and with that image came a hundred or a thousand others each of them a single captured moment the kind of moments that are the only one to survive a frenzied dream frozen and layered atop one another each of them a promise a prediction and every one of them aimed right at the most base most primitive parts of my brain it wasnt limited to visual imagery each layer of the flash had its own round of sensual memory every one of them only partial but intensetouch taste scent sound and visiondozens and dozens of dreams and fantasies compressed into that one instant of dark inspiration ive had sex that didnt feel as good as maeves smile you hear me came maeves thoughts along with the images you hear me now because we are together now just as you are with mab i felt you you know when you joined yourself to us and i want to feel more you are my knight as well dresden let me welcome you come to me come with me walk by starlight and let me show you secret delights it took me a couple of seconds to remember that i was still standing there in the icy hall still wearing my clothes still standing most of an arms length away from maeve when i spoke it was through clenched teeth sorry already got a date for tonight maeve she dropped her head back and laughed bring her she said her eyes both dancing and wild her eyes shifted to sarissa who took a short breath and went stiff beside me shes gorgeous and i would love to get to know her better imagine the possibilities my knight another multisensory slide show hit my head and every single image was something that i should have known better than to find intriguing but that i could not bring myself to entirely ignoreonly this time sarissa was included i can show you pleasures you have never dreamed could be bring your lovely companion i will give you her and many many more besides again my head lit up with lunatic pleasuremaybes dizzying electrifying and i felt as if i were about to start tearing my way out of my clothes and just for a second i considered it im not really proud of that fact but its not like im beyond temptation either im just as stupid as the next guy and for a second i thought about seeing what was behind door number one i knew it would be foolishand fun yeah but mostly foolish i knew that id be an idiot to go along and yet one day something is going to kill me it might be some monster it might be my own foolishness it might be what gets most everyone in the end simple implacable time although i wasnt betting on that one id been closer to the idea of my own death lately having been dead or at least mostly dead for a good while and i wasnt any more comfortable with the idea i didnt have any more desire to go out in an ugly painful way than i did before and if youve gotta go there are probably worse ways to do it than in a blaze of sybaritic glory damn maeve had a great pitch heh everyone selling something to a sucker does the entire hall had gone completely silent except for my own harsh breathing and i suddenly became aware of the tension in the air every being there was waiting and i suddenly realized that this was the second murder attempt of the evening maeve was trying to destroy me you ever make lloyd that offer i asked maeve tilted her head staring at me her smile suddenly frozen cat got your tongue i asked in a louder voice i put scorn into it did you not hear the question the frozen smile became something subarctic what did you say to me i said no you psychopathic hosebeast i answered spitting out the words with every ounce of contempt i could muster up i saw how you treated lloyd slate i saw how you treated the changelings of your court i know what to expect from you you arrogant spoiled selfinvolved petty cruel little queenbee twit maeves expression changed though not in any kind of focused way she looked startled sarissa gave me a shocked look then she glanced around as if hunting for a foxhole or bomb shelter or perhaps some kind of armored vehicle to throw herself into you sent your last handmaiden to murder my friends on their wedding day maeve i continued in a voice loud enough to be heard by the entire hall did you think id forgotten that or was it just too small and unimportant a fact for you to keep it from dribbling out of your alleged brain do you think im too stupid to understand that you set up this surprise party in the hopes that youd startle me into spilling blood at court darth barbie you tried to murder me just now maeve and you think a little psychic porn is going to make me forget it i cant decide if youre insane or just that stupid maeve stared at me with her mouth dropping wide open now hear this i said youre cute doll youre gorgeous you inspire supernatural levels of wood and so what youre damaged goods so turn around and move your naked little ass away from mebefore i do it for you for a long moment there was dead silence and then maeves face twisted up in fury the seductive beauty of her features vanished replaced by an animals rage her eyes blazed and the temperature in the air dropped suddenly painfully enough to cause icy frost crystals to start forming on the ice the freaking ice iced over maeve glared at me with naked hatred in her toobig eyes and then gave me a small bow of her head and a little smile it would appear we yet have a life to celebrate she hissed music from somewhere in the room the symphony began playing again the silent gangcircle ring of bedtimestory villainy broke up with fluid grace and seconds later you would have thought you were at any kind of extremely wild extremely posh costume party maeves eyes glittered and she spun once displaying herself to me with a mocking little flick of her hair and then vanished into the crowd i turned to sarissa and found her staring at me with wide eyes you turned her down uhhuh no one does that not here whatever i said you dont understand the insult youve just given her is is sarissa shook her head and said with masterful understatement you just earned a little payback in her mind that was going to happen sooner or later i said what bugs me is her response music sarissa asked yeah i said and in a minute there might be dancing cant be good it could be worse she said she took a deep breath and settled her arm in mine again you won the first round i only survived it here that is winning so if we win the rest of the night well be making a good start i looked around us and said come on where are we going somewhere that isnt the middle of the floor i said somewhere i can put my back to a wall and hopefully somewhere with snacks im starving chapter five im never really comfortable at parties maybe im just not the partying type even when they arent full of lunatic elves hulking monsters and psychotic faerie queens parties are kind of tough for me i think its because im never sure of what to do with myself i mean therere drinks but i dont like being drunk and im pretty sure i dont get any more charming when i do get that way more amusing tops and that isnt always in a good way theres music but i never really learned to dance to anything that involved an electric guitar there are people to talk to and maybe girls to flirt with but once you put all the stupid things i do aside im really not all that interesting i like reading staying home going on walks with my dogits like im already a retiree who wants to hear about that especially when i would have to scream it over the music to which no one dances so im there but not drinking listening to music but not dancing and trying to have conversations with nearstrangers about anything other than my own stupid life and they generally seem to have the same goals i do leads to a lot of awkward pauses and then i start wondering why i showed up in the first place hells bells the kind of party with monsters is actually easier for me i mean at least i have a pretty good idea of what to do when im at one of those the food table was set up over by the replica of the trapdoor that used to lead into my subbasement it was open in the giant model which meant that there was a gaping hole in the icy floor and if you slipped at the wrong moment youd wind up falling down into stygian darkness i wondered whether the drop was to scale the table was loaded down with party food of every description but apart from the sheer variety it didnt look like anything but regular old food i inhaled through my nose and felt absolutely certain about thatthis was mortal chow not the fabled ambrosia of faerie thank god sarissa said picking up a pair of plates food i was afraid theyd have nothing but those flower trifles again wait i said are we sure this is food you cant smell it she asked i can always tell local cuisine is not exactly subtle practically the first thing i learned here was how to tell the difference she started loading up both plates mostly with things i probably would have picked anyway well she had basically been my dietitian for nearly three months shed know by now what i liked and didnt weird would it be like that if i ever had like a wife or something whoa where the hell did that thought come from all the recent if entirely bent domesticity my heart did a weird little rabbitlike maneuver beating way too fast for a few seconds hells bells had i just had a panic attack at the very notion of calling some woman my wife though now that i thought about it i wasnt sure i had ever used that word in connection with myself and somebody else at the same time not explicitly anyway i shook my head and filed the thought away to be examined later when i didnt have a great big target drawn on my back i let sarissa pick us some food while i kept an eye out for anyone or anything suspicious after about twenty seconds of that i decided that it was an impossibility and dialed it back to watching for anyone who rushed us with a knife screaming i kept my defensive spells right on the tip of my mind so to speak and ready to erupt into reality at an instants notice i spotted a good quiet corner for us to stand in over by the giant mantel above the giant fireplace i took the plates from sarissa and we started that way a form that i recognized emerged from the crowd in our path and i found myself smiling the creature that came limping over to me wasnt much more than five feet tall and leaned on a heavy gnarled walking staff he wore a hooded robe of undyed linen belted with a length of softlooking rope three folded strips of purple cloth were tucked into the beltthe formal stoles of senior members of the white council of wizards taken after they fell to him in separate duels oh and he was a goat well a very humanlooking goat anyway he had the same long face as a goat and curling rams horns on his head his eyes were golden his beard long and white and he looked pleased eldest gruff i said smiling sir knight he replied his basso a pleasant rumble we exchanged small bows which also seemed to please him please do thou accept my best wishes on this day of your birth gladly i said how did they rope you into showing up to this freak show he sighed obligation word i nodded to sarissa may i introduce sarissa shes been helping me recover from an injury sarissa this is lord gruff she said giving him a courtesy that somehow seemed natural how lovely to meet you again sir it is pleasant to see thee child eldest gruff said thou dost seem to thrive despite the climate that may be a generous assessment sarissa replied i prefer to think of it as a hopeful one the gruff said i see thou hast attached thyself to the new knight no i said quickly no she hasnt theres been no attaching shes been doctoring me sarissa arched an eyebrow at me and then said to the gruff it was mabs price ah the gruff said a heavy burden obligation canst be for winter and summer alike he glanced aside at me does he know of thine it hasnt come up sarissa said ah eldest gruff said raising his hands he had weird nails they were hoofy i will then follow the course of silence sarissa inclined her head thank you of course two more figures approached us both of them over seven feet tall im not used to being the shortest person in any given conversation or even the shorter person i can change lightbulbs without stretching i can put the star on the christmas tree without standing on tiptoe im like the bumble but with way better teeth and i didnt like feeling loomed over which probably should tell me about the kind of effect i might be having on other people sort of generally speaking and especially when i gave attitude to power figures who were shorter than me but that kind of crystallized moment of enlightenment probably wouldnt be helpful in winning the evening the first was depressingly familiar he was dressed in hunters leathers all grey and green and brown there was a sword with a hilt made from some sort of antler at his side it was the first time id seen him wearing something other than a helmet he had shaggy grizzled light brown hair that fell to his shoulders his features were asymmetrical but though not handsome contained a certain roguish charm and his eyes were an unsettling shade of goldgreen i didnt know his name but he was the erlking one of the beings of faerie powerful enough to lead the wild hunt and he was the reigning ruler of the goblins not like the big ugly dimwit in the hobbit real goblins are like mutant terminator serial killer psycho ninjas think hannibal lecter meets jackie chan oh and id insulted him once by trapping him in a magic circle faeries large and small hate that action gruff said the erlking tilting his head eldest gruff made a small bow in reply lord herne know you these children aye said eldest gruff he began making polite introductions i studied the man standing beside the erlking while he did he was a sharp contrast the erlking was huge but there was something about him that suggested agility and grace it was like looking at a tiger sure it might be standing there all calm and relaxed at the moment but you knew that at any second it could surge with speed and terrible purpose and that it wouldnt give you any warning before it came at you this man wasnt a tiger he was a bear his shoulders were so broadly proportioned that he made herne look positively slender by comparison his forearms were nearly the size of his biceps and he had the kind of thick neck that you see only in power lifters and professional thugs there were scars all over his hands and more on his face all of them faded away to ancient white lines like those you see on some lifelong bikers he wore a coat of mail of some kinda creature of faerie couldnt abide the touch of iron so it had to be made from something else over the mail he wore a long open coat of scarlet trimmed in white fur it was held in with a wide black leather belt he had such a barrel of a chest that even a modest bit of stomach was a considerable mass on his huge frame his gloves were made of black leather trimmed with more white fur and they were tucked through the belt right next to the very plain and functional hilt of an unadorned broadsword his hair was short white and shining clean and his white beard fell over his chest like the white breaker of a wave his eyes were clean winter sky blue i lost track of what eldest gruff was saying because my mouth was falling open the second man noticed my expression and let out a low rumbling chuckle it wasnt one of those ironic snickers it was a rolling fullthroated sound of amusement and it made his stomach shake like dare i say it like a bowl full of jelly and this eldest gruff said is mabs new knight uh i said sorry i uh hi i stuck my hand out harry dresden his hand engulfed mine as he continued to chortle his fingers could have crushed my bones i know who you are dresden he rumbled call me kringle wow seriously cause wow oh my god thats adorable sarissa said smiling you are such a fanboy dresden yeah ive just i hadnt really expected this kind of thing kringle let out another rumbling laugh it absolutely filled the air around him surely you knew that i made my home among the beings of faerie did you think i would be a vassal of summer lad honestly i asked i havent ever really stopped to think it through few do he said how does your new line of work suit you doesnt i said then why did you agree to it seemed like the right thing to do at the time kringle smiled at me ah i didnt much care for your predecessor ditto i said so do you come to all of these its customary kringle replied i get to visit folk i rarely see elsewhere he nodded toward the erlking and eldest gruff we take a few moments to catch up and hunt the erlking said showing sharplooking teeth when he smiled and hunt kringle said he eyed eldest gruff would you care to accompany us this year gruff somehow managed to smile you always ask you always say no eldest gruff shrugged and said nothing wait i said to kringle youre going hunting i pointed at the erlking with him you kringle let out another guffaw and i swear to god rested his hands on his belly while he did it why wouldnt i dude i said dude youre freaking santa claus not until after halloween he said enough is enough im drawing a line hah i said but im kinda not joking here he grunted and the smile faded from his features lad let me tell you something here and now none of us is what we once were everyone has a history everyone comes from somewhere each moves toward a destination and in a lifetime as long as mine the road can run far and take strange windingssomething i judge you know something about i frowned meaning he gestured at himself this became the tale with which you are familiar only in fairly recent times there are wizards enough alive today who knew of no such person when they were children awaiting the winter holiday i nodded thoughtfully you became something different he gave me a wink of his eye so what were you before kringle smiled apparently content to say nothing i turned to sarissa asking you seem to know these guys mostly what she wasnt there i looked around the immediate area but didnt see her i moved my eyes back to kringle and the erlking the two of them looked at me calmly without expression i darted a glance to eldest gruff whose long floppy right ear twitched once i glanced to my left following the motion and spotted sarissa being led onto the dance floor underneath the replica of my original star wars poster the poster was the size of a skyscraper mural now the dance floor beneath it the size of a parking lot for the most part the sidhe were dancing all fantastic grace and whirling color with the occasional glitter of jewellike feline eyes sparkling as they turned and swayed a young male sidhe was leading her by the wrist and from the set of her shoulders she was in pain you couldnt have guessed it from her expression the young sidhe wore a black leather jacket and a cincinnati ball cap but i didnt get a look at his face a fresh challenge it would seem the erlking murmured yeah i said gentlemen if you would excuse me you know mabs law at court aye kringle asked you know the price of breaking it yep what do you mean to do lad seems that what we have here is a failure to communicate i said think ill go open up a dialogue chapter six moving onto a dance floor full of sidhe is like dropping acid partly its because theyre just so damned pretty the sidhe maidens there were all in maeves league in terms of sheer physical attractiveness and some of them were just about as barely dressed as she was only in what must have been the latest trends in the chicago club scene for the fashionably provocative and yeah the boys were pretty too and tarting it up just as much as the girls but they werent nearly as much of a distraction to me partly its because of their grace the sidhe arent human even though they look like close relatives when you see an olympic gymnast or ice skater or a professional dancer performing a routine you cant help but be impressed with the sheer casual grace with which they move as if their bodies are lighter than air the clumsiest of the sidhe operate at about that same level and the exceptional leave the mortals eating dust behind them its hard to describe because its hard for the brain to processtheres no frame of reference for what i saw the motion the balance the power the effortless subtlety it was like suddenly discovering an entirely new sense with an enormous amount of input i kept seeing things that made my brain scream at me to stop and watch so that it could catalog and process them properly and partly its because of their magic the sidhe use magic the way the rest of us breathe instinctively and without thinking about it id fought them before and their power was largely invoked through simple gestures as if the spells had been hardwired into their motor reflexes for them movement was magic and at no time so much as when they danced their power didnt come after me specificallyit was more like i had plunged into it as if it were a pool of water occupying the same space as the dance floor it subsumed my mind almost at once and it was all i could do to grit my teeth and hang on ribbons of colored light flared in the air around the dancing sidhe their feet struck the floor and their hands struck upon bodies their own or otherwise adding rippling layers of syncopated rhythm to the music gasps and cries joined with the beat and the melody primal and fierce echoing and challenging one another from all quarters as if theyd practiced it they hadnt it was just what they were sound and rhythm struck from either side thrumming against my ears disorienting me light danced and fluttered through the spectrum in subtle seductive patterns bodies twisted and strained in inhuman artistry their very grace an assault upon my reason part of me wanted to just stand there and drink it in gawking like some ugly clumsy behemoth among the sidhe plenty of mortals had been lulled into tearful rapture by such dancesand generally speaking it hadnt ended real well for them i put up every mental defense i could reaching for that core of cold clear power that had been within me since the night id murdered my predecessor with medeas bronze dagger i hadnt even realized what was happening to me at the time since other things had been on my mind but i now realized that the power had restored my shattered body and given me strength and speed and endurance at the very limits of human abilityand maybe past them i felt it only when i sought it out but apparently my instinctive need to survive had been enough to tap into it back when id set out to rescue my daughter from the late red court of vampires now it poured into my mind like an icecold breeze and withered away the bedazzlement the sidhes dance had wrought on my thoughts i started forward through the throng and for a few feet i tried to skip and slip and duck my way through the moving crowd without hitting anyone then i realized that even with whatever i had gained from becoming the winter knight i was still hopelessly dullwitted and slowfooted when compared to the sidhe so i just started walking and left it up to them to get out of the way it kinda fit my mood better anyway they did it too none of them were obvious about it and some of them came within a fraction of an inch of striking me with whirling limbs but none of them did the sidhe are tall generally speaking but im nba tall and i could see over the crowd i spotted the red ball cap and a flash of sarissas wide eyes and went after them i caught up to them near the back wall of the cavernous chamber the sidhe who had grabbed sarissa stood behind her one of his arms wound around her neck the other around her waist holding her back against his chest her eyes were wide now i could see deep red flushing on the skin of her wrist where bruises were already starting to form in the shape of the sidhes fingers i found myself clenching my hands into fists and growling deep in my throat without any evident forethought to it the dance floor for ten feet all around any of the three of us became clear of moving bodies the sidhe had made room for the confrontation jewellike eyes glittered and watched intermittently while the dance continued sir knight said the sidhe holding sarissa he had straight black hair beneath the cap and cheekbones so high that they needed to wear oxygen tanks he was smiling and there was something particularly vulpine in it his canines were just a little too large a little too sharp what a pleasure it is to speak with you you arent going to think so in a minute i said let her go he leaned in closer to her and inhaled through his nose odd he said i dont smell you on her you havent claimed her as your own shes not yours either i said let her go dont make me say it again shes just a mortal he said smiling a mortal of no station here in arctis tor at court this place is not meant for mortals her body her mind and her life are all forfeit should we decide to take them we just decided to let her go i began walking toward him something feverish came into his eyes and i could suddenly see every bone and tendon in his hand tight against his skin his nails seemed a little too long a little too heavy and a little too sharp to be normal sarissa tried to speak but only made a choking sound and went silent you keep coming the sidhe said and ill keep squeezing this game is terribly interesting i wonder how hard ill have to squeeze to crush her windpipe i stopped because i knew the answer to his question not very hard its only a little more pressure than you need to crush an empty beer can its sort of scary how easy it is to kill someone once you know how to get it done what about mabs law i said ill not shed a drop of her blood he replied smoothly when i cut off her air or break her neck shell simply ceasewhich is a waste but the law is the law and i got a sudden sinking feeling that the sidhe in front of me in his black leather jacket and his red cap knew how to get it done youre not a cincinnati fan are you ah the sidhe said smiling you see sarissa hes worked it out it took a while but he got there youre a redcap i said not a redcap he said snapping annoyance in his voice the redcap little knight the redcap was one of those figures i had hoped was a story according to what i knew of legend he got his name by greeting travelers in a friendly fashion and then murdering them horribly once that was done he would dye his cap freshly scarlet by dipping it in their cooling blood odds seemed reasonable that he was a badass legend was about as reliable as every other rumor mill on the planet but looking at the guy i got the impression that he would smile and have an erection the whole time he murdered sarissa or me he certainly expected me to react with fear and caution which just goes to show you that no matter how old something is centuries dont necessarily make it all that bright the big bad redcap i drawled and when you were picking a red cap for tonight to emblemize your power and skill you went with cincinnati over philly or boston seriously the redcap apparently didnt know what to make of that he just stared at me trying to decide whether hed been insulted or not man you sidhe are a crowd of poseurs did you know that you try to do and say the things you think will push our buttonsbut you just dont get it do you have you even been to a ball game i caught one with gwynn ap nudd a few years back decent guy maybe youve heard of him do you think your allies frighten me wizard the redcap demanded i think youre an opportunist i said a what you heard me you jump people traveling alone people who dont have a chance in hell of defending themselves against you especially not when you make nice and put them off their guard first i gave him a toothy smile im not off my guard red and im not someone who doesnt have a chance against you touch me and i will kill her he snarled giving sarissa a little jerk by way of demonstration i looked at sarissa and hoped that she could read deeper than the surface thats bad but theres not much i can do about it if you decide to kill her now i said of course after you do that i dont really like your chances red if she dies youll join her you wouldnt break mabs law he sneered youre right i said so i figure ill just open a way back to the mortal world drag you through it and after that well ive always been partial to fire evidently that line of possibility had not occurred to the redcap what i know its not thematically in tune with my new job and all but i find it effective build a man a fire and hes warm for a day i said but set a man on fire and hes warm for the rest of his life tao of pratchett i live by it you wanted to face me down in front of everyone get props for tweaking my nose on my first night here well congratulations red youre the man the redcaps eyes narrowed gleaming bright and his foxlike smile widened you think im afraid of you the last time somebody swiped my date to a party it got a little messy i said in a very mild voice ask the red court about it oh wait the redcap actually laughed at that and it was hurtful literally my ears rang painfully at the sharpness of the sound it is nothing to me how many cockroaches or vampires you have ended mortal i am sidhe whatever i said killed some of them too yes the redcap said and there was an ugly hungry heat in his tone the lady of summer i was in that battle mortal i saw her blood flow i nodded and said and what makes you think i wont do it again the redcap jerked his chin a little to one side and said they do i froze dammit harry i chided myself youre dealing with faeries there is always a scam with faeries there is always a sucker punch on the way id gotten too forwardfocused the redcap hadnt been a challenger he was the bait as if on cue the wild dancing turned to stillness the music died all motion in the chamber as far as i could tell ceased entirely and suddenly i stood in a small glade within a forest of lean wickedly beautiful figures and weirdly sparkling eyes two beings emerged from that forest shambling out from the crowd of sidhe one on either side of me maybe fifteen feet away the first on my right was a huge figure shuffling forward with its form doubled over beneath a tattered grey cloak that could have covered a small truck its legs took strides that were two or three times as long as mine and when it came to a halt its long arms spread out to either side of it and rested on the floor beneath its hood i could make out a flat broad head as stark as a skull and colored red and glistening its arms ended in hands with only three fingers but they were proportionally too thick and a couple of feet long they too were red and glistening as if something had been built on a bone framework with flesh and muscle added on over it but then whoever had made it had forgotten to put the skin on it dripped little patters of ichor onto the floor and stared at me with very wide very white eyes that contained only tiny pinpoints of black i recognized the thing it was a rawhead a creature that assembled itself out of the discarded bones and flesh of slaughtered hogs and cattle then they started eating whatever they could catch usually starting with pets then working their way up to schoolchildren and finally hunting down adults if you caught them early you should shut them down hardbut no one had caught this one as i watched it rose slowly up to its full height of well over ten feet its jaws had come from more than a couple of different creatures and they spread open in a slow wide gape into a mouth as wide as a waterslide tunnel more liquid pattered down out of the rawheads jaws onto the floor and its breath rasped in and out in a slow enormous wheeze on the left the second figure drew back its hood it was maybe only eight feet tall and mostly humanlooking except for the thick coat of yellowwhite fur that covered it it was layered in so much muscle that it could be seen even through its pelt and its eyes were burning bloodshot orbs shining out from beneath a cavernous brow ridge it was the winter courts version of an ogre it was a great deal stronger than it looked and if it wanted to it could pick me up and drive my head into one of the icy walls then hammer my spine in like a piton ive been waiting to see that expression on his face all night the redcap said to sarissa isnt it priceless whats going to happen next im so interested taking on a little friendly training and a grumpy malk was one thing but going up against three of the nastier creatures in faerie all at once was probably a losing proposition maybe i could survive it if i was fast and good and a little bit lucky but sarissa wouldnt i had only one real chance instant and overwhelming aggression if i could knock one of these bozos out of the fight before it even started that changed the odds from impossible to merely daunting it meant that there might be a chance of saving the girl of course it also meant that i would break mabs law id bragged about opening a way and if push came to shove i probably couldbut not before the rawhead and the ogre closed in on me just then there was a sound a shriek a blast of cruel trumpets that sounded as if whoever blew them was being beaten with a salted lash it took me a second to realize that no instruments were playing instead high up on the constructed replica of my favorite chair at my left shoulder crystals were thrusting themselves up out of the ice and screaming as the ice changed form they rose into a half dome of spikes and frozen blades and shuddered as the center of the new outgrowth shifted again wisps of arctic blue and green and purple buzzed and whirled within those sharp spikes sending out a wild coruscation of colored light the aurora was mesmerizing and blinding at the same time and little disco balls hoped that they could grow up to be half as brilliant one day mab stepped out of the solid ice as if passing through a gauzy curtain she was in formal wear a robe of opalescent white belted with joined crystals of ice a tall crown of more ice rose from her brow and her white hair spilled down around her like snow atop a mountain she was distant and cold as pure and lovely and merciless as moonlit snow she stood for a moment staring out at the cavern then she sat the motion slow and regal and the ice within the spiked dome reshaped itself into a seat beneath her she settled onto it and the ice screamed again shrieking out a second tortured fanfare every head in the cavern turned to her the sidhe all around me knelt at once including the redcap and his buddies all over the chamber other beings of the winter court did the same and suddenly only a very few people were standing upright i was one of them so were the erlking kringle and eldest gruff though each of them stood with his head bowed in acknowledgment of winters ruler i took my cue from them but kept my eyes open i spotted maeve standing only forty or fifty feet away on an icy deck that had been formed to look like a paperback that had fallen from one of my bookshelves maeve was in a perfect position to see the conflict between the redcap crew and me and she hadnt bowed either she was sipping something ice blue from a champagne flute and ignoring her mothers presence entirelybut i could feel her malice burning toward me even though she wasnt looking directly at me mab studied me and my playmates for a solid minute saying nothing and in that silence you could hear the fluid dripping from the rawheads various bits onto the icy floor maeve turned to her mother and sipped at her blue champagne she said nothing and her features were entirely smooth and relaxed but you could just smell the way she was smirking on the inside and only then did i really get it maeves first attempt to get me to start a fight at court had been a distraction then shed wanted me to focus on her to unnerve me with her highvoltage psychic sex moves that way i wouldnt be thinking clearly enough to avoid it when the redcap sprang his surprise mab stared down at the winter lady for another silent minute then she smiled and bowed her head very slightly toward her daughter the gesture one of acknowledgment well played mab murmured she didnt raise her voice she didnt have to the ice rang with it her eyes shifted to me and though she was too far away for me to make out any details i somehow knew exactly what the expression on her face meant i had allowed myself to be drawn into this mess i would have to be the one to get me out of it i was on my own mab turned her gaze back to the rest of the room on this day of celebration of our newest knights birth we give you greetings one and all you lords and ladies of winter welcome again to our home we can see that the celebrations are already well under way she settled back on her throne and placed one finger against her lips as though she were fascinated with the scene before her we pray you do not let our entrance further disrupt them she lifted a languid hand it is our desire that you continue the festivities oh fun i turned back to face the redcap keeping his wingmen in my peripheral vision and tried to think of something anything that would get both me and sarissa out of this mess the rawhead gathered itself into a crouch again clearly ready to pounce its mismatched set of claws and talons gouged at the floor in anticipation the ogre flexed its hands open and closed once it sounded like a popcorn popper the redcap already had his feet underneath him again dragging sarissa effortlessly up with him and i was wearing a tux hells bells clearly if i wanted us to survive the evening i had to step up my game mabs voice came out as a throaty purr music let us see a dance chapter seven the odds here were long way long all three deadly faeries stood ready to move and no matter which of them i took on first sarissas outlook wasnt good the music began low and quiet with a slowly slowly rising presence i needed some kind of edge a game changer in fact a game changer was exactly what i needed faeries are always underhanded and tricksy true and id overlooked that a few moments before but theres something else about faeries that runs absolutely bone deep they love to play games why dont we make this interesting i said out loud i trust you wouldnt object to making a bit of a game of our dispute oh the room got intense then as maybe a thousand throats all inhaled at the same time i could practically feel the air grow closer as all of those beings leaned very slightly toward me their suddenly sharpened interest filling the cavern the tempo of the music changed with it as well now all suspended strings and muted percussion i felt a surge of emotion run through me one that i knew was not my ownit was too pure too primal and it made my body do that thrumming thing again mabs approval was fierce but wizard said the redcap were already playing a game one cannot change the rules simply because one is losing but one can change the stakes i replied what if you could get more out of it the redcap narrowed his eyes what more could you have to lose than your life i gave him what i hoped was a patronizing smile and then said wait why am i talking to the tool instead of the person holding it i turned my back on the redcap gulped and faced maeve im offering you a prize winter lady are you willing to hear me out maeves eyes sparkled more brightly than the jewels on her midriff she came to the edge of the platform and stood watching me if he wins i said jerking my head back at the redcap ill go with you willingly maeve tilted her head and if you win sarissa goes free you leave peacefully maeve thrust out her lower lip peacefully thats hardly ever any fun she lifted a hand and idly toyed with her hair as i see it i already have a prize mortal i get to see mother watch the steam rise from at least one fresh corpse here in her own court youre absolutely right maeve i said and youve got me in a pickle and it was cleverly done i winked at her but what fun is the game youve already won why settle for so ephemeral a prize however worthy when you could take mabs knight from her in front of all of winter that one sank home i could feel the sudden surge of ambitious lust that went racing through the winter lady and the seething hatred that went along with a swift glance toward distant mab on her throne maeves mouth curled up in an expression that bore as much resemblance to a smile as a shark does to a dolphin she snapped her fingers the sound almost as loud as a smallcaliber gunshot and two sidhe hurried to her side escorting a dazedlooking athletic young man maeve didnt wait for him she simply sat the sidhe shoved the young man to his hands and knees and maeves slight weight settled across his broad back ill give you this much mother she said without looking toward mab you do pick the most interesting mortals to serve you mabs smirk said more than any words could have otherwise she neither moved nor spoke my lady began the redcap behind me hush maeve said absently i want to see what happens what did you have in mind wizard in answer i reached up and with a couple of quick tugs undid my tuxs tie it wasnt one of those preassembled ties it was made out of a single band of pure silk sized perfectly to wrap around my throat with a couple of wider bits left over for handholds i held it up making a bit of drama out of it as i turned in a circle and said out of respect for our host and her law there shall be no bloodshed then i tossed the tie to the icy floor halfway between myself and the redcap i looked up at maeve and gave my chin an arrogant little lift sup princess you game maeve lifted one hand and idly began tracing a fingertip over her lips her eyes bright she looked at red and nodded okay chucklehead i said turning to face him how about you let the yeti there hold the girl while you and i dance i gave him a broad grin unless youre afraid of little old cockroachswatting me reds upper lip twitched if he hadnt been one of the sidhe and at a party and in front of all of his dearest frenemies he would have snarled at me he beckoned the ogre with one hand and the thing lumbered over to him he thrust sarissa into its huge hairy meaty arms the ogre didnt get the girl around the neck it simply wrapped its hand over her skull like some hairy spidery helmet and held on the smoky glass chopsticks in sarissas hair clattered to the ice and her eyes got even wider if the wizard uses his magic the redcap said break her neck he eyed the ogre and said without ripping it off yuh the ogre said its beady eyes glared at me the redcap nodded and turned to face me his eyes narrowed yowch nice move on reds part though im not sure he needed to bother id never been able to tag one of the sidhe with a really solid hit with my magic their defenses against that kind of thing were just too damned good but id been counting on using it indirectly to help out in the fight and the redcap had just taken that option away from me sarissa gave the redcap a glare that might have peeled paint from a wall and then said her voice rasping harry you dont have to do this for me you can walk away you kidding i said under my breath you think im going to go to all the trouble of finding a new pt guy hang tough she bit her lip and nodded i dismissed the girl from my thoughts as much as i could and tried to focus i was still better off than id been a few moments ago now instead of a threeversusone fight that would probably kill me and certainly kill sarissa i had a pure oneonone if i lost sarissa wouldnt make it and i would either be maeves chew toy or dead i was hoping for dead but if i won sarissa and i both got to walk away it wouldnt keep something like this from happening again but wed live through the night which was by definition victory of course now i had to win without using magic in a stranglingcord duel against a faerie who was faster than me and who had centuries of experience in killing mortals oh and i had to win it without drawing blood or id be guilty of breaking mabs lawand i knew how she would react to that mab wasnt evil exactly but she was mab shed have me torn apart the only mercy she would show would be by doing it all at once instead of spread over weeks long story short nobody there was going to help me at times it sucks to be the lone hero guy i had one advantage i was used to competing out of my weight class i didnt have a whole ton of training in unarmed combat but i did have considerable experience with being in dicey situations against homicideoriented people and things that were bigger than me stronger than me faster than me and motivated to end my life i knew how to fight an uphill battle the redcap knew how to kill but by maneuvering me out of using my magic hed tipped some of his hand he was being cautious about me sure he was a predator but in nature predators generally go after the weak the sick the aged and the isolated solitary predators almost exclusively hunt by attacking from surprise where they have every advantage in their favor hell even great white sharks do that and theyre just about the biggest oldest predators on the planet ive seen a lot of things that hunted people in my time and i regard them as a professional hazard part of the job i know how they operate predators dont like to pick fair fights it runs counter to their nature and robs them of many of their advantages the redcap had tried to limit what i could do in a bid to scrape together any advantage he could as any predator does that told me that he probably wasnt used to this kind of open confrontation he was nervous i was nervous toobut i was on familiar psychological ground and he wasnt maybe i could use that i undid the top button of the shirt and shrugged out of the jacket as if nothing at all were about to happen taking my time i tossed it at one of the watching sidhe he caught it and folded it neatly over one arm never looking away while i calmly undid the cuffs of my shirt and rolled up the sleeves i stowed the cuff links in a pocket i stretched and yawned which might have been taking the pantomime over the top but what the hell in for a penny i smiled at maeve inclined my head very slightly to mab and turned to face the redcap ready i said ready the redcap echoed the music abruptly stopped and in the silence mabs voice came from everywhere begin i rushed forward faster than i ever could have done before id become mabs knight it was damned close the redcap was quicker off the mark but i had longer arms he snatched the nearest end of the silk an instant before i grabbed my end as my fingers closed he snapped it back out of my grip and then dropped his weight straight down his back leg coming forward into a crescentshaped sweep about six inches off the icy floor i turned my forward stumble into a forward roll i went over the kick tucked in tight and came up to my feet smoothlybut the motion had carried me past him and i knew that with his speed and grace hed already be leaping toward my back i spun to him one hand at the level of my throat to intercept him if he was already close enough to get the tie around it and lunged back toward him with my right arm raised to the horizontal hoping to catch him across the neck in a clothesline id misjudged he was moving so fast that all i got was motion blur and he hadnt swept the silk tie at my neckhed aimed for my upraised left hand the silk snaked around my wrist and i caught it in my hand just in time for him to slip to one side dragging my arm in close to his body he used my forward momentum and my trapped arm to rob me of my balance and spin me in a circle hauling at my arm with all his strength his strength was considerable and his technique was sound he suddenly reversed using my own motion against me and dislocated my arm from its shoulder socket with a loud pop and a flash of redhot pain harry sarissa screamed grabbing uselessly at the ogres wrist it was as thick as her own leg and the ogre didnt even seem to notice her struggling the redcap kept hold of my arm my wrist pulled up against his sternum and still trapped in the tie he smiled broadly and walked backward in a small circle the pain and the leverage forcing me to scramble along the floor in front of him a gale of lovely cold laughter went up from the sidhe like a chorus of frozen chimes the redcap took a miniature mocking bow to the crowd and spoke to me i was worried for a moment mortal youre faster than you look he kicked me in the dislocated shoulder he wasnt trying to kick my arm off he was just doing it for the hell of it it hurt a lot you should see the look on your face mortal the redcap said this is fun you know what red i gasped were all having fun i took my weight onto my knees and back and slammed the heel of my right hand into the side of the jackasss knee i dont know how much stronger mabs gift had made me because id never been much of a weight lifter until id started therapy i didnt know too much about how much weight lifters could for example benchpress so i didnt have a very good idea how i stacked up against plain old me or plain old anybody plus the weights for the bench press were marked in metric units and i kind of fell asleep the day we learned to convert them to pounds but im pretty sure four hundred kilos isnt bad the redcaps knee popped like a balloon from the force of the strike and bent in toward his other knee he howled in startled agony and tried to throw himself away but just as i hadnt been able to move for a few critical seconds after hed injured me his body wasnt responding properly either and he fell next to me the left side of my body felt like it was on fire but me and pain are old buddies his grip on the tie had loosened and i couldnt move my left arm enough to get it loose so before he could recover i punched him in the neck with my good hand he gagged and thrashed and i was able to unwrap the silk from my useless arm i tried to pull the tie away from him but hed already shaken off the hits id given him and held on i jerked on it as hard as i could but i had only the one arm and was fresh out of leverage i could feel the tie sliding through my fingers so i let go without warning and snapped my hand at a different target as he fell back he dropped into a backward roll and came up six feet away he perched on one hand and a knee still gripping the tie i casually settled his red ball cap onto my head touched a forefinger to its brim winked at him and said you have hat hair again there was a chorus of marrowcurdling laughter from the sidhe it wasnt any more pleasant to have them laughing with me than it had been to have them laughing at me the redcaps face flushed a furious red and i could see the blood vessels in his eyes bursting hells bells the twit hadnt been particularly perturbed when id crippled his leg but touch his hat and embarrass him in front of his peers and the dude flipped out nobody has their priorities straight anymore i made it to my feet before he simply leapt at me he hit me before i could get my balance and we both went down his eyes burning he ignored the tie and latched onto my throat with both hands he was strong i think i might have been stronger than he was but i had only the one arm i slammed it at his forearmsif he kept his grip on me those nails would almost certainly draw blood he hissed and jerked his hands away at the last second and i slammed my knee against his injured leg i bucked him off me while he screamed i went after him we rolled a couple of times and i cannot tell you how much it hurt both of us to do it he had the use of both arms i was able to use both legs to stabilize myselfbut he was a hell of a lot squirmier than me and in a blur of confusing motion he somehow managed to slither around to my back and get an arm across my throat i got a few fingers underneath it and started trying to pry him away it wasnt a winning move i managed to lessen the pressure but i couldnt pull him off me and my head started to pound another group inhalation went up from the sidhe and i could feel them leaning closer their interest almost frenzied hundreds and hundreds of gemlike eyes sparkling like stars as the light started dimming sarissa stared at me with wide eyes her expression horrified but shed lost one of her shoes i watched as she reached out with her toes and managed to pluck one of her fallen glassy chopsticks up off the floor the freaking yeti holding her didnt notice it was staring far too intently at the fight sarissa passed the chopstick up to her hands gripped it with both of them and snapped it in the middle shattered pieces of black glass fell away from a slender steel rod without looking she simply lifted her hand and pressed the rod against the underside of the yetis wrist faeries be they sidhe or any other kind cannot abide the touch of iron to them its worse than molten plutonium it burns them like fire scars them poisons them theres a lot of folklore about cold iron and its a widely held belief that it refers only to coldforged iron but thats a bunch of hooey when the old stories refer to cold iron theyre being poetic like when they say hot lead if you want to hurt one of the fae you just need iron including any alloy containing it to hurt them and man does it ever hurt them the ogres wrist burst into a sudden coruscation of yellowwhite flame as bright as that of an arc welder the ogre howled and jerked its arm away from sarissas head as if hed been a child experimenting with a penny and an electrical outlet sarissa spun on her heel and slashed the little steel rod across the ogres thigh it howled in primal fury and flinched back sweeping one long arm at her in pure reflex sarissa caught only a tiny fraction of the blow but it was enough to send her staggering she fell only a couple of feet away from me and looked up her eyes dazed her lower lip had been split wideopen a large ruby droplet fell from her lip and hung in the air shining and perfect and stayed there for half of forever then it finally splashed down onto the icy floor there was a shrieking hiss as the blood hit the supernatural ice a sound somewhere between a hot skillet and a highpressure industrial accident the ice beneath the drop of blood shattered as if the droplet had been unimaginably heavy and a web of dark cracks shot out for fifty feet in every direction the music stopped the redcap froze so did everyone else mab rose out of her chair and somehow in that instant of action she crossed the distance from her high seat as though the simple act of standing up were what propelled her to the space nearby as she came the pallid finery of her dress darkened to raven black as if the air had contained a fine mist of ink her hair darkened as well to the same color and her eyes turned entirely black sclera and all as did her nails the skin seemed to cling harder to her bones making her beautiful features gaunt and terrible the redcap flinched away from me and dragged himself back with his arms getting clear give credit where its due he might have been a sadistic bloodthirsty monster but he wasnt a stupid one the furious burned ogre wasnt bright enough to realize what was happening still smoldering still enraged it came stomping toward sarissa knight mab said the word a whipcrack maeve came to the edge of the platform and clutched her hands into fists her mouth twisted into a snarl i didnt get up off the ground there wasnt time instead i focused my will upon the advancing ogre and funneled my anger and my pain into the spell along with the frozen core of power within me i unleashed the energy as i thundered ventas servitas the ogre was only a couple of yards from sarissa when the gale of arctic wind id called up slammed into the thing and lifted its massive bulk completely off the ground it tossed the ogre a good ten feet away it landed in a tumble dug its claws into the ice and fought its way back to its feet i rose from the ground acutely conscious of mabs black presence just over my left shoulder of the watching eyes of the winter court id told sarissa this was my first day in prison and the yard was full of things that could and would kill me if they got the chance it was time for an object lesson i reached down into the cold inside of me it was painful to touch that power like throwing yourself into icy water like emerging from warm covers into the shuddering cold of an unheated apartment on a winter morning i didnt like it but i knew how to get it all i had to do was think about everyone id let down everyone id left behind back in chicago my brother thomas my apprentice molly my friends my daughter karrin i thought about them and it felt like something in my chest was starting to tear in half the winter inside me was torment and agonybut at least when i was immersed in it i couldnt feel i lifted my right arm the side that projects energy focused my will and shouted infriga there was a flash of light an arctic howl a scream of air suddenly condensed into liquid and an explosion of frost and fog centered upon the ogre the air became a solid fog bank a rolling mist and for several seconds there was silence i waited for the mist to disperse and after several long seconds it began to clear away swept along by the remnants of the gale i had called first when it cleared the entire winter court could see the ogre standing crouched just as it had been when i threw the spell at it i waited for a moment more letting everyone see the ogre standing absolutely still in defiance of mabs law then i drew forth my will again extended my hand and snarled forzare a lance of invisible power lashed out at the ogreand when it struck the frozen monster shattered into thousands of icy chunks the largest of which was about the size of my fist the bits of the former ogre exploded over several hundred square yards of the dance floor and grisly frozen shrapnel pelted the watching sidhe and sent them reeling back with shouts of alarm the sidhe gathered themselves again and every one of those bright eyes locked onto me their expressions alien unreadable from one of the back corners i heard a deep heartily amused chuckle rolling through the air kringle i thought i turned to mab and almost spokebut then i remembered her other law and closed my mouth mabs mouth twitched in an approving microsmile and she nodded her head at me if you consent i would speak to them she stared at me with those black carrionbird eyes and nodded first i helped sarissa to her feet passing her a clean white handkerchief which she immediately pressed to her mouth i gave her what i hoped was a reassuring smile then i took a deep breath and turned to address the room turning in a slow circle as i spoke to be sure i included everyone my voice echoed throughout the whole chamber as clearly as if id been using a pa system all right you primitive screwheads listen up im harry dresden im the new winter knight im instituting a rule when youre within sight of me mortals are offlimits i paused for a moment to let that sink in then i continued i cant give you orders i cant control what you do in your own domains im not going to be able to change you im not even going to try but if i see you abusing a mortal youll join chunky here zero warnings zero excuses subzero tolerance i paused again and then asked any questions one of the sidhe smirked and stepped forward his leather pants creaking he opened his mouth his expression condescending mortal do you actually think that you can infriga i snarled unleashing winter again and without waiting for the cloud to clear hurled the second strike shouting forzare this time i aimed much of the force up grisly bits of frozen sidhe noble came pattering and clattering down to the ice of the dance floor when the mist cleared the sidhe looked stunned even maeve im glad you asked me that i said to the space where the sidhe lord had been standing i hope my answer clarified any misunderstandings i looked left and right seeking out eyes but didnt find any willing to meet mine are there any other questions there was a vast and empty silence broken only by kringles continued rumbles of amusement daughter mab said calmly your lackey shamed me as the host of this gathering i hold you accountable you will return to arctis minora at once there to await my pleasure maeve stared at mab her eyes cold then she spun in a glitter of gems and began striding away several dozen of the sidhe including the redcap and the rawhead followed her mab turned to sarissa and said in a much calmer voice honestly iron i apologize my queen sarissa said ill dispose of it safely see that you do mab said now i would have a dance sir knight i blinked but didnt hesitate for more than an instant or three um my arm seems to be an obstacle mab smiled and laid a hand upon my shoulder my arm popped back into its socket with a silver shock of sensation and the pain dwindled to almost nothing i rolled my shoulder testing it if it wasnt exactly comfortable it seemed to work well enough i turned to mab bowed and stepped closer to her as the music rose again it was a waltz while the stunned sidhe looked on i waltzed with mab to a full orchestral version of shinedowns and the smaller bits of our enemies crunched beneath our feet oddly enough no one joined us dancing with mab was like dancing with a shadow she moved so gracefully so lightly that had my eyes been closed i might not have been able to tell that she was there at all i felt lumbering and clumsy beside her but managed not to trip over my own feet that was welldone wizard mab murmured no one has lifted a hand to them that way since the days of tam lin i wanted them to understand the nature of our relationship it would seem you succeeded she said the next time they come at you they will not do it so openly ill handle it i expect nothing less mab said in the future try to avoid being at such a stark disadvantage sarissa may not be there to rescue you a second time i grunted then i frowned and said you wanted this to happen tonight it wasnt just about me staring down your nobles youre setting something into motion her lips quirked slightly at one corner in approval i chose well you are ready my knight it is time for me to give you my first command i swallowed and tried not to look nervous oh the song came to a close with mab standing very close to me lifting her head slightly to whisper into my ear the sidhe applauded politely and without enthusiasm but the sound was enough to muffle what she whispered into my ear wizard she said her breathy voice trembling every syllable bubbled with venom with hate kill my daughter kill maeve chapter eight dancing with mab was like rapidly downing shots of wellaged whiskey being that close to her to her beauty to her bottomless eyes hit me pretty hard the scent of her cool and clean and intoxicating lingered in my nose a disorienting pleasure id thrown around a lot of energy to pull off the pair of chunkmaking combos and between that and mabs proximity i was having a little trouble walking a straight line after the dance it wasnt like i had feelings for her i didnt feel the kind of low pulse of physical attraction that i would around a pretty woman i didnt particularly like her i sure as hell didnt feel any love for her it was simply impossible to be that close to her to that kind of deadly power and beauty to that kind of immortal hunger and desire without it rattling the bars of my cage mab wasnt human and wasnt meant for human company i had no doubt whatsoever in my mind that longterm exposure to her would have serious unpleasant side effects and never mind what she had just asked me to do the consequences of that kind of action would be really really huge and only an idiot would willingly involve himself in direct action on a scale that significantwhich really didnt say anything good about me given how often id been the guy wearing the idiots shoes after our dance mab returned to her high seat and surveyed the chamber through barely open eyes a distant figure now garbed in pure white and untouchable again as my head came out of the cold numb clarity of wielding winter the aches and pains the redcap had given me began to resurface in a big way fatigue began piling up and when i looked around for a place to sit down i found cat sith sitting nearby his wide eyes patient and opaque sir knight the malk said you do not suffer fools there was the faintest hint of approval in his tone what is your need ive had enough party i said would it inconvenience the queen for me to depart if she wished you to stay you would be at her side cat sith replied and it would seem that you have introduced yourself adequately good if you do not mind i said please ask sarissa to join me i do not mind cat sith said in a decidedly approving tone he vanished into the party and appeared a few moments later leading sarissa she walked steadily enough though she still had my handkerchief pressed to her mouth you want to get out of here i asked her its a good idea she said most of the vips left after your dance things will devolve from here devolve i asked i dont care to stay she said her tone careful i would prefer to leave i frowned and then realized that she was trying to get a read on me i simultaneously became acutely aware of a number of sidhe ladies who were i would say lurking except that you dont generally use that word with someone so beautiful there were half a dozen of them though who were staying nearby and whose eyes were tracking me i felt disconcertingly reminded of a documentary id once seen about lionesses involved in a cooperative hunt there was something about them that was very similar one a ravishing darkhaired beauty wearing leather pants and strategically applied electrical tape stared hard at me and when she saw me looking licked her lips very very slowly she trailed a fingertip over her chin down across her throat and down over her sternum and gave me a smile so wicked that its parents should have sent it to military school oh i said understanding despite my fatigue my throat felt dry and my heart revved up a bit devolving ill go sarissa said i dont expect anything from you simply because we arrived together a sidhe lady with deep indigo blue hair had sidled up to miss electrical tape and the two slid their arms around each other both staring at me something inside meand id be lying if i said that none of it was minelet out a primal snarl and advised me to drag both of them back to my cave by the hair and do whatever i damned well pleased with them it was an enormously powerful impulse something that made me begin to shift my balance to take a step toward them i arrested the motion and closed my eyes yeah i said yeah they look great but that isnt a fantasy come true harry thats a wood chipper in playboy bunny clothing i shook my head and turned deliberately away from temptation before i opened my eyes again well both go i said to sarissa itd be a bad idea to stay i offered her my arm she frowned thoughtfully at me for a moment before she put her hand on my arm we left again preceded by cat sith once we were in the icy hallways she asked me why why what leave she said you wanted to stay and lets just say that the ah appetite of sidhe ladies has never been overstated and nothing excites them more than violence and power there are men who would literally kill to have the opportunity you just passed up probably i said morons then why turn it down she asked because im not a goddamned sex doll thats a good reason to avoid attention that is forced on you she said but that isnt what happened why pass up what they were offering we walked for a while before i answered ive already made one choice that that took everything away from me i said i dont know how much longer ill be around or how much of a life i can make for myself now but im going to live as much of it as i can as my own man not somebodys prison bitch not the flavor of the day ah she said and frowned faintly i blinked several times and suddenly realized what shed been trying to find out oh youre wondering if i turned them down because i was planning to have you instead she gave me an oblique look i wouldnt have phrased it that way i snorted im not she nodded why not does it matter i asked why always matters it was my turn to give sarissa an appraising look yeah it does so why not because you arent a goddamned sex doll either even if i were willing she asked my stomach jumped a little at that sarissa was attractive as hell and i liked her id made her smile and laugh on occasion and it had been a while man story of my life it seems like its almost always been a while but you have to think about more than what is going to happen in the next hour youre here because mab ordered you to be here i said anything we did would have an element of coercion to it no matter how it happened im not into that you saved my life just now sarissa said some people might think youd earned my attentions people think stupid things all the time the only opinion that matters is yours i glanced at her besides you probably saved me right back toting steel into the heart of winter using it right in front of mab herself thats crazy she smiled a little it would have been crazy not to tote it she said ive learned a few things in my time here we had reached the doors to my suite which still felt awkward to say even in my own head my suite guys like me dont have suites we have lairs cat sith had departed discreetly i hadnt seen him go how long has it been i asked too long she said she hadnt taken her hand off of my arm you know i said weve been working together for a while now we have but we havent ever talked about ourselves not really its all been surface stuff you havent talked about you she said i havent talked about me maybe we should change that i said sarissa looked down there were points of color in her cheeks i should we you want to come in i asked to talk thats all she took a moment to choose her words if you want me to i tried to think about this from sarissas point of view she was a beautiful woman who had to be constantly aware of male interest she was a mortal living in a world of faeries most of whom were malicious all of whom were dangerous her introduction to the office of the winter knight had been lloyd slate who had been one monstrous son of a bitch she had some kind of relationship with mab herself a being who could have her destroyed at any moment she was displeased with sarissa and i was mabs hatchet man shed been targeted for death for no better reason than that she happened to be my date at the party shed nearly died yet shed taken action to save herselfand me tooand now here she was standing calmly beside me not showing the least anxiety shed spent months helping me get back on my feet again always gentle always helpful always patient she was wary about extending me any trust shed been holding herself at a careful distance i could understand why caution was a critical survival trait in winter and as far as she was concerned i was most likely a monster in the process of being born a monster shed been given to no less thinking about it even if i had saved her life it wouldnt have needed saving had she not been with me i figured that between that and everything else shed done for me i was well in her debt but i couldnt help her if i didnt know more about her for a couple of minutes i said please she nodded and we went inside i had a little living room outside of my bedroom i read somewhere that in general women tend to be more comfortable with someone sitting beside them rather than across from them men tend to be the opposite facing each other has undertones of direct physical conflictin which a generally larger stronger person would have an advantage i didnt know whether it was true or not but she was already keyed up enough and i didnt want to add anything to it so i seated her at one end of the couch and then seated myself at the opposite end out of arms reach okay i said we havent talked i guess because ive never told you anything about myself is that about the shape of it trust has to go both ways she said i huffed out a short laugh youve been hanging around mab too much shes not big on answering simple yesorno questions either sarissas mouth twitched at the corners yes i laughed again okay i said well when in rome maybe we should exchange questions and answers you can go first she folded her hands frowning and then nodded ive heard a lot of stories about you that youve killed a lot of people are they true i dont know what youve heard i said but yeah when bad things came after people in my town i made it my business to get in the way and ive been a warden of the white council for a while now i fought in the war against the red court ive done a lot of fighting sometimes people get killed why are you in mabs debt i have a form of congenital dementia she said i watched what it did to my older sister and she shuddered doctors cant help me mab can have you ever killed anyone who wasnt trying to kill you i looked down at my shoes twice i said quietly i cut lloyd slates throat to become the winter knight and a flash of memory a ruined city full of howling monsters and blood flashes of light and roaring detonations of magic tearing asunder stone and air alike dust everywhere friends fighting bleeding desperate a stone altar covered in a thick coating of dried blood a terrified little girl my daughter treachery a kiss pressed against the forehead of a woman i was about to murder god susan forgive me i couldnt see through the blur in my eyes and my throat felt like the redcap might be garroting me again but i forced myself to speak and i killed a woman named susan rodriguez on a stone altar because if i hadnt a little girl and a lot of good people would have died she knew it too i swiped a hand at my eyes and coughed to clear my throat what were the terms of your bargain with mab that as long as i remained myself and sane i would attend her and do as she bade me for three months out of every year summer vacation when i was in school weekends now except for lately taking care of you meant that id have months and months off to make up for it she fidgeted with the bloodied handkerchief her split lip had stopped bleeding and a line of dark drying blood marred it the whole time we worked on your therapy i think you said something about having a dog and a cat once but you never spoke about any friends or family why not i shrugged im not sure i said and then i realized that i was lying to everyone in the room maybe maybe because it hurts to think about them because i miss them because because theyre good people the best and im not sure i can look them in the eye anymore after what ive done what about you do you have any friends there are people i sometimes do things with she said i dont im not sure id call them friends i dont want to make friends i have the attention of some dangerous beings if i got close to anyone i could be putting them in danger dont you ever worry about that every day i said ive buried friends who died because they were involved with my work and my life but they wanted to be there they knew the dangers and chose to face them it isnt my place to choose for them do you think its better to be alone i think its better for them sarissa said youre healthy now are you going to go home to your friends and family home isnt there anymore i said and suddenly felt very tired they burned my apartment down my books my lab and my friends think im dead how do i just walk back in hi everyone im back and did you miss me im working for one of the bad guys now and what good movies came out while i was gone i shook my head im making fresh enemies nasty ones id be pulling them in all over again i know what theyd saythat it didnt matter but i dont know what im going to do yet mab seems to trust you what is it that you do for her exactly sarissa smiled faintly im sort of her humanity sherpa she said for all of her power and knowledge mab doesnt always understand people very well she asks me questions sometimes we watch television or go to movies or listen to music ive taken her to rock concerts weve gone ice skating shopping clubbing once we went to disneyland i blinked wait your job is youre bffs with mab sarissa let out a sudden torrent of giggles until her eyes started to water a little oh she said still giggling oh ive never thought of it like that but god it applies doesnt it we do something every weekend she shook her head and took a moment to compose herself then she asked me is there anyone special for you back home karrin but i didnt dare use her name no telling what other ears might be listening maybe i said it was sort of starting up when i left im not sure where it would have gone id like to think that i shrugged well it was bad timing on an epic level you nothing more than casual she said if i was close to someone well it would create a target for mabs enemies which i sometimes think is practically everybody in faerie killing the lover of mabs pet mortal would be an insult while remaining oblique enough to not allow her room to respond she took a deep breath and looked at her hands i saw you speaking to her on the dance floor i saw your face who did she tell you to kill i hesitated i im pretty sure i shouldnt say its information that could get you into trouble i looked up in time to see the wariness returning to sarissas features ah she said well i suppose our little exchange is over then she bit her lower lip and asked quite calmly was it me that one caught me off guard uh what no no it wasnt you she didnt move for several heartbeats i see then she looked up gave me a pleasant and false smile and said well its late and you should still try to rest as much as you can sarissa wait i began she rose her back straight her shoulders tense i think im going to my bed um unless youd prefer i stood up with her dont think that im against the idea as a general principle youre smart and i like you and youre gorgeous but no not like this she chewed on her lip again and nodded thank you for that for understanding sure i said i offered my arm and walked her back to the door of my lair lair worked so much better in my head than suite at the door she looked up at me may i ask you a question of course are you going to obey mab my brain started gibbering and running in circles at the very thought of what mab had asked me to do but i forced it to sit down and start breathing into a paper bag and then i thought about it for a second maybe maybe not why she asked i rocked back onto my heels it felt like that one little word had thumped me between the eyes with a wiffle ball bat sarissa had hit exactly upon what most bothered me about mabs command why why now instead of six months ago or a year ago or a hundred years ago why today instead of tomorrow hell why should i do it in the first place the whole reason winter and summer had a knight was because the queens of faerie themselves were forbidden from directly killing any mortal and they needed a hit man to make it happen but maeve wasnt a mortal as far as mab was concerned little miss spanglecrotch was fair game why im not sure yet i said but im damned well going to find out chapter nine cat sith i called once sarissa had left from behind me a voice said yes sir knight i twitched and didnt whirl around like a frightened teenager i turned in a very urbane and james bondian fashion in keeping with my tux eyed him and said hells bells do you always come in like that no the malk replied he was sitting on the back of the sofa sarissa and i had recently vacated generally i do not speak i simply proceed are you aware of my orders i asked i am aware that you have been given orders i am to facilitate your ability to comply with them i nodded i need to get back to chicago right now and i need a car cat sith turned and padded down the hallway toward my bedroom he stopped in the hall at the door to the linen closet and lashed his tail once then looked at me very well i frowned at him then i went to the closet and opened the door autumn air humid and smothering compared to that of arctis tor flooded into my lair brilliant lights shone on the other side of the door and it took me a few seconds of blinking against them to adjust and realize that i was being blinded by simple streetlights inside my closet there was a bit of sidewalk and then michigan avenue stretching out to the storefront opposite i blinked several times sith had opened a way between faerie and chicago the spirit world the nevernever is vast almost beyond imagining faerie is but one part of it for the most part occupying the realms of spirit that lie most adjacent to the mortal world the geography of the spirit world isnt like that of the real world different places in the spirit world will connect with places with a similar energy in the real world so dark spooky parts of the nevernever hook up with dark spooky places in the mortal world and my freaking linen closet in arctis tor hooked up to chicagospecifically to michigan avenue to the gothic stone building across the street from the old historic water tower it was night cars went by occasionally but no one seemed to take notice of the open portal to the heart of winter arctis tor was isolated in the nevernever difficult to reach without inside help even traveling by ways takes at least some time and id expected a hike back to the real world how i asked quietly her majesty had it made sith said i whistled intentionally forming a connection from a specific place to a specific place took amounts of energy so enormous that even the white council of wizards could rarely manage itid seen it done only once in my lifetime the year before in chichén itzá she had it made for me indeed sith said in fact this is for the time being the only way in or out of faerie i blinked several times you mean winter faerie sith stated all of it i choked wait you mean all of faerie is on lockdown indeed sith said until dawn why i asked one presumes it was done to give you a head start with that sith walked calmly through the door and onto the sidewalk your car sir knight i stepped through the door into the chicago air and it slugged me in the face with a legion of scents and sensations and sounds that were as familiar to me as my own breathing after the cool dry silence of arctis tor i felt like id leapt into the middle of an active circus there were too many sounds scents too much color too much motion arctis tor was as still as the deepest night of winter twentyfourseven chicago is well chicago i found myself blinking my eyes very rapidly home i know its corny especially since chicago is what a polite person would call a colorful place its a den of crime and corruption and its a monument to architecture and enterprise its violent and dangerous and an epicenter of music and the arts the good the bad the ugly the sublime monsters and angelstheyre all here the scents and sounds triggered a mental avalanche of memories and i shivered at the intensity of it i almost didnt notice the car that pulled up to the curb beside me it was an ancient hearse a caddy that must have been built sometime in the years immediately following world war ii complete with rounded tail fins it had been painted dark dark blue and given a flame job in shades of electric purple it wavered and bobbed drunkenly down the avenue turned a bit too sharply toward the curb lurched ahead with a roar of the engine and then skidded to a halt with the brakes locked missing the posts along the edge of the road and the chains that hung between them by maybe an inch will there be anything else sir knight cat sith asked not right now i said warily um who is driving that thing i recommend it be you sith said with unmistakable contempt and then with a swish of his tail he vanished the engine roared once more and the car lurched but didnt move from its rest the lights went on and then off and then the wipers swept on a few times before the engine dropped to an idle and the brake lights shut off i approached the car warily leaned across the chains and rapped on the driversside window nothing happened the windows were tinted a little enough to make the dark interior invisible on the welllit street i couldnt see anyone inside i opened the door three cheers boys piped a tiny cartooncharacter voice hip hip hip shrilled maybe a dozen more tiny voices hip hip hip hip hip hip that was followed by a heartfelt chorus of yay sitting in the drivers seat of the hearse were a dozen tiny humanoids their leader the largest of them was maybe eighteen inches tall he looked like an extremely athletic youth drawn down to scale he was dressed in armor made from castoff bits of garbage and refuse his breastplate had been made from a section of aluminum can a white one bearing a cocacola logo the shield on his left arm was made from the same material this one sporting cokes seasonal christmas polar bears part of a plastic toothpaste travel container had been fixed to his belt and what looked like a serrated butter knife was thrust into it its handle wrapped in layers of duct tape and string his hair was violet a few shades of blue darker than the lavender i remembered silky and nearly weightless drifting around his head like dandelion down wings like a dragonflys hung from his back like an iridescent cloak he was standing atop a formation of smaller sprites stacked up in a miniature human pyramid and his hands rested on the wheel several wearylooking little wee folk were leaning against the gearshift and several more were on the floor holding the brake down in a dog pile of tiny bodies they were all dressed in similar outfits of repurposed garbage the leader gave me a sharp salute beaming major general toottoot of the sir za winter lord knights guard reporting for duty it is good to see you my lord his wings buzzed and he fluttered out of the hearse to hover in front of my face spinning in circles look look i got new gear were all winter and stuff piped up one of the smaller members of the guard he brandished his shield which was made out of a section of plastic that had come from a solidstick deodorant container bearing the words winter clean go winter shouted toot thrusting a fist into the air go pizza echoed the others toot spun around and scowled at them no no no we practiced this go pizza they bellowed louder and more in unison toottoot sighed and shook his head this is why youre all kernels and im a major general cause you got corn silk in your ears toot and company were kind of my minions id gotten along well with the little folk over the years mostly by virtue of bribing them with pizza a few snitches and stool pigeons had developed into a band of cute little moochers and then into an armyand at some point after that toot had somehow gotten the idea to make them into a real army and they triedthey honestly didbut its tough to form a disciplined military when most of the guys in it have an attention span about twenty seconds long discipline is boring guys guys i said break it up and shove over im in a hurry the wee folk complied at once all of them scrambling into the passenger seat or over into the rear compartment i got in as quickly as i could and shut the door behind me i buckled in and pulled out into the sparse traffic the big caddy moved out with a satisfied rumble and way more power than i was used to in an automobile my last car had been a vintage vw bug with an engine about the size of a deck of cards toot i said have you grown yes toot said disgusted even though i stand around with weights on my head for like twenty whole minutes every day i even got laundered twice and nothing i think you look dashing i said he settled down at the center of the dashboard his legs hanging off and kicking idly thank you my lord so the pizza came on schedule while i was uh away yes my lord the lady leanansidhe provided it in your stead toot lowered his voice and talked from between clenched teeth if she hadnt these knuckleheads would have deserted well we do have a deal i said thats what a deal means right right toot said firmly we trust you harry youre barely like a human at all i knew he meant it as a compliment but something chilly slithered down my back at the statement my faerie godmother the leanansidhe had covered my obligations at home while i was gone man that could get complicated among the sidhe favors are hard currency but i was glad to see toot and his gang they were damned handy and could be far more dangerous and capable than most even in the supernatural world i realized i never doubted you or the guard for a second major general which was true i had no doubt at all that as long as the pizza kept flowing id have their absolute loyalty toot beamed at the compliment and his body pulsed with a gentle aura of cool blue light how can the guard serve you my lord theyd started off the evening nearly crashing the car but it was impressive theyd managed it at all im on a case i said seriously ill need someone to watch my back lean forward a little my lord toot said instantly and shouted hey kernel purpleweed come watch the za winter lord knights back i fought not to smile no thats a metaphor i said toot frowned and scratched his head i dont know what its for mustnt laugh mustnt it would crush his little feelings in a minute im going to pull over and go into a building i want guards to stay inside and around the car and i want a couple more to go with me and make sure no one sneaks up on me when im not looking oh toot said thats easy good i said as i pulled the car over make it so toot saluted leapt into the air and zipped back to the rear compartment piping orders as he went i set the old caddys parking brake and got out wasting no time i didnt hold the door open any longer than i would have if id been alone the little folk do not need that kind of coddling theyre not always bright but theyre fast tough and resourceful id have had trouble keeping them in the car if i wanted to once i was out and moving i was to all appearances alone whoever toot had sent to watch my back would be silent and nearly invisible and i didnt bother rubbernecking around to try to spot them one thing about the little folk that held as well with every faeriewhen they made a deal they stuck to it theyd had my back before and they had it now heck since i was committing a felony they probably thought it was fun to come along for the ride its tough to get one of the little folk to care about discipline on the other hand they really arent terribly impressed with danger either i walked about a block to the right apartment building a brownstone blockhouse that had all the flair and imaginative design of a brick of baking chocolate it wasnt an upscale place like where my brother lived but it wasnt one of the projects at their worst either it didnt have a doorman and the security wouldnt be topoftheline and that was for now the important thing i got a little bit lucky on the way ina resident a man in his twenties who had apparently been out drinking opened the door on his way home and i called out hold that please he did he probably shouldnt have but guys in tuxes even without a tie dont strike anyone as a criminal upon first impression i nodded to him and thanked him with a smile he muttered something bleary and turned down a side hallway i hit the elevators and took one up once i was on the right floor the rest wasnt too tough i walked calmly down the hallway to the proper door and leaned against it a ripple of gooseflesh washed up my arm beginning on the back of my hand and i jerked my fingers back in pure instinct huh there were wards on the door magical defenses i hadnt expected that wards can do all kinds of things to an intruder from suggesting that he turn around and leave to giving him a stiff push away to frying him like a bug zapper i took a moment to study the wards they were a smooth patchwork of enchantment probably the result of several lesser talents working together somebody like me can put up a ward that is like a huge iron wall this was more like a curtain of tightly interwoven steel rings for most purposes both would serve fairly wellbut with the right tool the latter kind of wall is easily dealt with and im the tool i muttered then i thought about it sighed and shook my head one day i told myself one brave and magnificent day i will actually be cool i rested my fingertips lightly on the door and went over the wards in my thoughts aha had i tried to break in the wards would have set off an enormous racket and a bunch of smoke along with a sudden intense sensation of claustrophobia fire alarms would have gone off and sprinklers and the authorities would have been summoned that was a nominally effective defense all by itself but the claustrophobia bit was really masterful the noise would trip off an instinctive adrenaline response and that combined with the induced panic of the ward would send just about anything scurrying for the exit rather than take chances in what would have been a very noisy and crowded environment that kind of subtle manipulation always works best amidst a flurry of distractions washingtons been doing it like that for decades i cut the wards off from their power source one at a time trying to keep the damage to a minimum so that it would be easy to fix i already felt bad enough over what i was about to do then once the wards were offline i took a deep breath and leaned against the door with a sudden thrust of my legs and body id been working out the doorframe splintered and gave way and i slipped quickly and quietly into waldo butterss apartment it was dark inside and i didnt know it well enough to navigate without light i left the door a little bit open so that the light from the hall would leak in this was the dangerous part if someone had heard the noise theyd be calling the cops i needed to be gone in the next five minutes i crossed the living room to the short hallway butterss bedroom was on the right his computer room on the left the bedroom door was closed there was a faint light in the computer room i entered there were several computers set up around the walls of the room which i knew butters and company used for some kind of group computer gamerelated thingy they all did together the computers were all turned off except for one the biggest one in the corner which sat facing out into the room butters called it the captains chair he sat there and coordinated some kind of game activity raids i think they were called and they went on into the wee hours his job required him to work nights and he claimed it helped him keep circadian rhythm to play video games on his off nights that monitor was on and in the reflection in the glass of the rooms single window i could see that the screen had been divided into maybe a dozen sections and every single one of them was playing a different pornographic scenario a human skull sat on the table facing the monitor and faint orange flickers of light danced in its eyes despite its utter inability to form any expression it somehow gave the impression of a happily glazed look id been in the room for about two seconds when the computer made an awful sound coughed out a little puff of smoke and the monitor screen went black i winced my fault wizards and technology dont get along so well and the more advanced the technology is the sooner something seems to go wrongespecially with electronics butters had been cobbling together a theory to explain why the world worked like that but id drawn the line at covering my head in a tinfoil hat in the name of science the skull let out a startled disappointed sound and after several disoriented flickers its eyelights panned around the room and landed on me harry said the skull it didnt move its jaws to form the words or anything they just came out hells bells youre back from the dead from the mostly dead i replied you made it out of omaha beach huh you kidding bob said the minute you were clear i ran like a bunny and hid you could have taken that jerk i said why would i want to bob asked so when do we set up the new lab and can i have broadband his eyes gleamed with avarice or something near it i need broadband harry thats a computer thing right philistine bob the skull muttered bob wasnt a skull per se he was a spirit of air or intellect or one of any of a great many other terms used to describe such beings the skull was the vessel that he inhabited kind of like a djinnis bottle bob had been working as an assistant and adviser to wizards since before crossbows had gone out of style and hed forgotten more about the ins and outs of magical theory than i knew hed been my assistant and friend since id first come to chicago i hadnt realized until i actually heard his voice how much id missed the demented little perv when do we get to work bob asked brightly i am working i said i need to talk to you im all ears bob said except for the ears part bob blinked are you wearing a tux uh yeah tell me you did not get married i didnt get married i said except for the whole mab thing which is creepy and weird she spent the last three months trying to kill me once a day sounds like her style bob said howd you get out of it um i said oh bob said uh oh maybe you should go harry relax i said i know youve had your issues with mab but im the only one here yeah thats kinda the part that bothers me i scowled at him oh come on how long have you known me harry youre mabs hit man yeah but im not here to hit you i said you could be lying bob said maybe the sidhe cant lie but you can hells bells im not lying but how do i know that because i havent hit you already i frowned at him wait a minute youre stalling me arent you stalling you bob asked brightly what do you mean there was no warning none at all the door to butterss bedroom exploded outward sending splinters of cheap plywood sailing everywhere a missile of living muscle hit me in the back at almost the same instant shoving my chest forward and whiplashing my head back my spine lit up like a casino and i felt myself driven hard to the ground something powerful and snarling and terribly strong came down on top of me and i felt claws and fangs begin to rake at me guess i used up all my evenings luck on the front door guy chapter ten claws shredded my tux raking over my back my buttocks and the backs of my legs jaws would have bitten into my neck if i hadnt gotten my hands in the way clamping them over the back of my neck and squeezing them as tight as i could hoping that a finger wouldnt come up and be nipped off pain came in hot and high but the claws didnt dig as deep as they would have if this had been a malk or a ghoul and i had to hope the damage wouldnt be too seriousunless the fight went on long enough for blood loss to weaken me some analytical part of my head was going over those facts in a detached and rational fashion the rest of me went freaking berserk with anger i got one arm beneath me to brace myself and threw the other elbow back in a heavy strike that slammed into something soft and drew a startled yelp out of my attacker the teeth vanished for a second and the claws slowed i rolled shoving with a broad motion of that same arm and threw a wolf the size of a great dane off of my back it hit one of the computer tables with a tremendous racket sending bits of equipment tumbling i got my feet underneath me seized a computer chair by its back and lifted it by the time the wolf with dark red fur was getting back onto its feet the chair was already halfway through its swing and i was snarling in incoherent fury only at the last second did i recognize my attacker through my rage and divert the arc of the descending chair it broke into about fifty pieces when it hit the floor just in front of the wolf plastic and metal tumbling in every direction the wolf flinched back from the flying bits and lifted its eyes toward mine it froze in what was an expression of perfect shock and in a pair of seconds the wolf was gone its form melting rapidly into the shape of a girl a redhead with generous curves and not a stitch of clothing she stared at me gasping in short breaths her expression pained before she whispered harry andi i said standing straighter and trying to force my body to relax the word came out in a snarl adrenaline still sang along my arms and legs and more than anything in the whole world at that moment i wanted to punch someone in the face anyone it didnt matter who and that was not right andi i said forcing myself to quiet and gentle my voice what the hell are you doing here me she breathed i im not the one whos dead the night is young thought the furious part of me but i fought it down rumors death exaggerated i said instead and i dont have time to chat about it i turned toward bob at his desk and heard andi open a drawer behind me the sound an automatic makes when someone racks the slide and pops a round into the chamber is specific and memorableand gets your attention as effectively as if it were also really really loud get your hands away from the skull said andis shortened pained voice or i put a bullet in you i paused my first impulse was to cover the floor of the computer room with frozen chunks of andi and what the hell was i thinking it was the anger that kept on rolling through me in cold waves that was pushing for that for action for violence dont get me wrong its not like i exactly have an allergy to either of those thingsbut id always done a reasonably good job of keeping my temper under control i hadnt felt like this in years not since the first days id nearly been killed by the white council i fell back on what id learned then i closed my eyes and took a few deep breaths reminding myself that the anger was just anger that it was a sensation like feeling hot or cold it didnt mean anything by itself it wasnt a reason to act thats what thinking was for the old lessons helped and i separated myself from the fury i put my hands slowly out to my sides making sure they were visible then i turned to face andi she stood with a pistol in a solid weaver stance like shed learned how from someone who knew i could deflect bullets if i had to do it but i couldnt stop them and we were in a building full of innocent bystanders you know about the skull i asked kind of hard not to she said since i live here i blinked several times you and damn way to go butters andi stared steadily down the sights of her gun she was holding herself a little hitched as if her right side pained her that elbow id thrown must have caught her in the ribs i winced i dont mind a little of the roughandtumble when necessary but i dont hit my friends i dont hit women and andi was both sorry about that i said nodding toward her i didnt know it was you and i still dont know if its you she replied especially with you dead and all there are plenty of things that might try to look like harry bob i said over my shoulder tell her its me cant bob said in a dreamy tone boobs right because andi was naked id seen her that way before because that was one of the hazards of being a werewolf i knew several and theyd been my friends when they change form clothes and things dont go with so when they change back theyre stark naked ill give bob this muchthe little creep had good taste changing into a wolf must be a really fantastic exercise regimen because andi and naked went really well together although at the moment i was mostly impressed with her great big slightly heaving gun bob i said more urgently i put my hand out trying to get it between the skull and andi without actually reaching for it hey bob demanded dammit harry its not like i get much of a chance to see em andis eyes widened bob is it really him yes but he works for the bad guys now bob said its probably safest to shoot him hey i said nothing personal bob assured me what would you advise a client to do if the winter knight broke into her place fought with her and cracked two of her ribs not to shoot i said the bullets going to bounce and there are way too many people in the apartments around us at that andi took her finger off the trigger though she left it extended and pressed against the guard she exhaled slowly thats more like what i would expect from from you harry she swallowed is it really you whatevers left of me i said we heard about your ghost i could even sort of sort of smell you when you were near i knew we thought you were dead wasnt really my ghost i said it was me i just sort of forgot to bring my body along with me i coughed think you could maybe point that somewhere else my fingers not on the trigger she said dont be such a baby im thinking she watched me for a moment and said okay lets assume its really you what are you doing here i came for the skull i said im invaluable bob piped useful i scowled at him dont get cocky i know you came for the skull andi said why now in the middle of the night why break in harry all you had to do was ask i ground my teeth andi i dont have a lot of time so im going to give you the short answer okay okay when i break in here and take something from butters hes my victim and of no particular consequence if i come here and ask him for help hes my accomplice and it makes him a target for the people im working against she frowned what people i sighed thats the kind of thing id tell an accomplice andi um she said isnt that kind of what we are its what you were i said with gentle emphasis bobs right im not exactly on the side of the angels right now and im not taking you and butters down the drain with me say harry bob asked who are you up against not in front of the eyestanderbey i said just trolling for info like a good lackey bob said you understand sure i said andi frowned bob isnt isnt he supposed to be yours im not the present owner of the skull i said whoever has the skull has bobs loyalty services bob corrected me dont get cocky and right now im working for butters and you of course toots toots andi said in a flat voice did you really just say that her gaze shifted to me bystander if you dont know anything i said theres no reason for anyone to torture you to death to find it that made her face turn a little pale these people think the saw movies were hilarious i said theyll hurt you because for them it feels better than sex they wont hesitate and im trying to give you all the cover i can you and butters both i shook my head and lowered my hands i need you to trust me andi ill have bob back here before dawn she frowned why by then because i dont want the people i work for to get hold of him either i said hes not the same thing as a human thank you bob said i explain and explain that but no one listens but hes still kind of a friend bob made a gagging sound dont get all sappy on me dresden andi i said ignoring him i dont have any more time im gonna pick up the skull now you gonna shoot me or what andi let out a short frustrated breath and sagged back against the table she lowered the gun grimaced and slipped one hand across her stomach to press against her ribs on the other side i didnt look at what that motion did to her chest because that would have been grotesquely inappropriate regardless of how fascinating the resulting contours may or may not have been i picked up the skull an old familiar shape and weight in my hand there was a flitter in the flickering eyelights and maybe a subtle change of hue in the flames awright bob crowed back in the saddle pipe down i said ive got backup with me the other team might have surveillance on me that is just as invisible id rather they didnt listen to every word piping down o mighty one bob replied when i turned back to andi she looked horrified oh god harry your back i grunted twisted a bit and got a look at myself in the reflection in the window my jacket was in tatters and stained with blots of blood it hurt but not horribly maybe as much as a bad sunburn im sorry andi said ill live i said i walked over to her leaned down and kissed the top of her head im sorry about your ribs and the computers ill make up the damages to you guys she shook her head dont worry about it whatever you know whatever we can do to help i sighed and said yeah about that um im sorry about this too she frowned and looked up at me about what i was going to deck her clip her on the chin and put her down for a few moments while i left that would do two things first it would prevent her from getting all heroic and following me second if i was currently being observed it would sell the notion that i had stolen bob from her it was a logical if ruthless move that would give her an extra layer of protection however thin but when i told my hand to move it wouldnt winter knight mabs assassin whatever i dont hit girls i sighed im sorry i cant deck you right now she lifted both eyebrows oh you think youd be protecting me i take it as screwed up as it is to think thatyeah i would be ive been protecting myself just fine for a year harry andi said even without you around ouch i winced andi looked down i didnt sorry no worries i said better call the police after im gone report an intruder its what youd do if a burglar had broken in she nodded is it all right if i talk to butters about it this whole thing would have been a lot simpler if i could have kept anyone from getting involved that had been the point of the burglary but now well andi knew and i owed her more than to ask her to keep secrets from butters whom i owed even more carefully i said behind your threshold and maybe not anyone else just yet okay okay she said quietly thanks i didnt know what else to say so i added another im sorry then i took the skull and hurried back out into the night chapter eleven once i was in the hearse again i started driving i had a silent and nearly invisible squadron of the za lords guard flying in a loose formation around the car except for toot who perched on the back of the passenger seat bobs skull sat in the seat proper its glowing eye sockets turned toward me so boss bob said brightly where we headed nowhere yet i said but im operating on the theory that a moving target is harder to hit thats a little more paranoid than usual bob said i approve but why i grimaced mab wants me to kill maeve what bob squeaked toot fell off the back of the passenger seat in a fit of shock you heard me i said you okay toot just checking for assassins my lord toot said gamely all clear back here that doesnt make any sense bob said tell me everything so i did and then she told me to kill maeve i finished and i decided to come looking for you wait wait wait bob said let me get this straight mab gave you a whole girl all to yourself and you didnt even get to first base i scowled bob can you focus please this isnt about the girl bob snorted making this the first time it hasnt been about the girl i guess maeve bob i said what i need to know is why mab would want her dead maybe shes trying to flunk you intentionally bob said why do you say that because you cant kill maeve harry i dont want to do it i said im not even sure if im going to youre too busy wrestling with your stupid conscience to listen to me boss bob said you cant kill her not might not shouldnt cant i blinked several times uh why not maeves an immortal harry one of the least of the immortals maybe but immortal all the same chop her up if you want to burn her scatter her ashes to the winds but it wont kill her shell be back maybe in months maybe years but you cant just kill her shes the winter lady i frowned huh i killed the summer lady just fine bob made a frustrated sound yeah but that was because you were in the right place to do it hows that mab and titania created that place specifically to be a killing ground for immortals a place where balances of power are supposed to change theyve got to have a location like that for the important fightsotherwise nothing really gets decided its a waste of everyones time and cannon fodder id seen part of that place being createdwith my sight no lessand it was burned indelibly into my memory i saw the surging energy the two queens of faerie were pouring out power on a level that defied description and of course i had in some sense been in that place when i murdered lloyd slate and took his job as mabs triggerman memory the ancient stone table stained with blood stars wheeling above me dizzying in their speed and clarity writhing cold mist reaching up over the edges of the table clutching at my bare skin while mab bestrode me her naked beauty strangling me raking my thoughts out through my eyes power surging through me into me from the blood in the swirling grooves of the table from mabs hungry will i shuddered and forced the memory away my hands clenched the wheel so i cant kill her i said quietly no bob said i glowered out at the road what is the point of telling me to do something she knows is impossible i wondered aloud youre sure about this bob theres no way at all without the stone table not really bob said his eyes flicking around the car and not in most of the nevernever either hey i said whats with the shifty eyes what shifty eyes bob asked when you said not really your eyes got all shifty uh no they didnt bob the skull sighed do i have to tell you dude i said since when has it been like that between us since you started working for her bob said and somehow managed to shudder i tilted my head thinking as hard as i could wait this has to do with your feud with mab not a feud bob says in a feud both sides fight this is more like me screaming and running away before she rips me apart i shook my head man bob i know you can be an annoying git when you want to be onebut what did you do to make mab mad at you it isnt what i do harry bob said in a very small voice its what i know i lifted an eyebrow it took a lot to make the skull flinch and what is that exactly the lights in the eye sockets dwindled to tiny pinpoints and his voice came out in a whisper i know how to kill an immortal like maeve i asked him maeve bob said mab mother winter any of them holy crap now that was a piece of information worth killing for if the skull knew how to subtract the im from immortal then he could be a source of danger to beings of power throughout the universe hell he was lucky that gods and demons and supernatural powers everywhere hadnt formed up in a safari and come gunning for him and it meant that maybe i wasnt looking at an impossible mission after all id like you to tell me i said no way bob said no way the only reason ive been around this long is that ive kept my mouth shut if i start shooting it off now mab and every other immortal with an interest in this stupid planet are going to smash my skull to powder and leave me out to fry in the sun the eyelights bobbed toward the rear compartment and there are too many ears around here toot i said get everybody out of the car i need privacy make sure no one gets close enough to eavesdrop aw toot complained from the rear compartment not even me youre the only one i can trust to keep those other mugs from doing it major general no one overhears got it i could practically hear the pride bursting out of his voice got it he piped will do my lord he rolled down a window and buzzed out i rolled it back up and took a look around the hearse with both normal and supernatural senses to be sure we were alone then i turned back to the skull bob its just you and me talking here think about this mab sends me off to kill maeve something that would be impossible for me to do on my ownand she knew that you know how to do it she knew the first thing i would do is come back here as the first step in the job i think she meant for me to come to you i think she meant for you to tell me the skull considered that for a moment its indirect and manipulative so youre probably onto something let me think a long minute went by then he spoke very quietly if i tell you he said youve got to do something for me like what a new vessel he said youve got to make me a new house somewhere i can get to it then if they come after this one ive got somewhere else to go tall order for me i said soberly youve basically got your own little pocket dimension in there ive never tried anything that complicated before not even little chicago promise me bob said promise me on your power swearing by ones power is how a wizard makes a verbal contract if you break your word your ability with magic starts to fray and if you keep doing it sooner or later itll just wither up and die a broken promise sworn by my power could set me back years and years in terms of my ability to use magic i held up my hand i swear on my power to construct a new vessel for you if you tell me bob assuming i survive the next few days just dont expect a deluxe place like you have now the flickering eyelights flared up to their normal size again dont worry boss bob said with compassion i wont wiseass right then bob said the only way to kill an immortal is at certain specific places and you know one where hah already youre making a human assumption there are more than three dimensions harry not all places are in space some of them are places in time theyre called conjunctions i know about conjunctions bob i said annoyed when the stars and planets align you can use them to support heavyduty magic sometimes thats one way to measure a conjunction said the skull but stars and planets are ultimately just measuring stakes used to describe a position in time and thats one way to use a conjunction but they do other things too i nodded thoughtfully and theres a conjunction when immortals are vulnerable give the man a cookie hes got the idea every year when is it on halloween night of course i slammed on the brakes and pulled the car to the side of the road say that again halloween bob said his voice turning sober its when the world of the dead is closest to the mortal world everyoneeverythingstanding in this world is mortal on halloween i let out a low slow whistle i doubt there are more than a couple of people alive who know that harry bob said and the immortals will keep it that way why are they so worried i asked i mean why not just not show up on halloween night because its when they he made a frustrated noise its hard to explain because you dont have the right conceptual models you can barely count to four dimensions i think the math guys can go into the teens skip the insults and try halloween is when they feed bob said or or refuel or run free its all sort of the same thing and im only conveying a small part of it halloween night is when the locked stasis of immortality becomes malleable they take in energyand its when they can add new power to their mantle mostly they steal tiny bits of it from other immortals those kemmlerite freaks and their darkhallow i breathed that was halloween night exactly bob said that ritual was supposed to turn one of them into an immortal and the same rule appliesthats the only night of the year it actually can happen i doubt all of them knew that it had to be that night but i betcha cowl did guy is seriously scary seriously in need of a body cast and a therapist more like i raked at my toolong toomessy hair with my fingers thinking so on halloween theyre here all of them any who are the only word i can come close with is awake immortals arent always moving through the time stream at the same rate as the universe from where you stand it looks like theyre dormant they arent you just cant perceive the true state of their existence properly theyre here i said slowly feeding and swindling one another for little bits of power right theyre trickortreating duh bob said where do you think that comes from ugh this whole time that is creepy beyond belief i said i think it was the second or third merlin of the white council who engineered the whole halloween custom thats the real reason people started wearing masks on that night back in the day it was so that any hungry immortal who came by mightmightthink twice before gobbling someone up after all they could never be sure the person behind the mask wasnt another immortal setting them up halloween is tomorrow night i said a bank sign i was passing told me it was a bit after two am or tonight i guess technically what a coincidence bob said happy birthday by the way i didnt get you anything except maybe my life s okay im kinda birthdayed out already i rubbed at my jaw so if i can get to maeve on halloween night i can kill her well bob hedged you can try anyway its technically possible it doesnt mean youre strong enough to do it how big a window do i have when does halloween night end i asked at the first natural morning birdsong bob replied promptly songbirds rooster whatever they start to sing the night ends oh good a deadline i narrowed my eyes thinking gives me a bit more than twentyfour hours then i muttered and all i have to do is find her when she can be anywhere in the world or the nevernever then get her here then beat her down all without her escaping or killing me first simple yep almost impossible but simple and at least you know the when and the how bob said but im no closer to why cant help you there boss the skull said im a spirit of intellect and the premise were dealing with makes no sense why not because theres no reason for it bob said his tone unhappy i mean when maeve dies there will just be another maeve i frowned what do you mean bob sighed you keep thinking of the faerie queens as specific individuals harry bob said but they arent individuals theyre mantles of power roles positions the person in them is basically an interchangeable part what like being the winter knight is exactly like that bob said when you killed slate the power the mantle just transferred over to you its the same for the queens of faerie maeve wears the mantle of the winter lady kill her and youll just get a new winter lady maybe thats what mab wants i said doesnt track bob said why not i asked because the mantle changes whoever wears it my guts felt suddenly cold im not lloyd slate neither was he not at first doesnt matter who it is bob prattled on over time it changes them somewhere down the line you wouldnt be able to find much difference between maeve and her successor meet the new maeve same as the old maeve i swallowed so so lily who took the summer ladys mantle after i killed aurora its been what ten years or so shes gone by now or getting there bob said give it another decade or two tops and she might as well be aurora i was quiet for a moment then i asked is that going to happen to me too bob hedged youve probably felt it starting um strong impulses intense emotions that kind of thing it builds and it doesnt stop he managed to give the impression of a wince sorry boss i stared at my knuckles for a moment so i said even if i frag this maeve another one steps up maybe not for decades but she does immortals dont really care about decades boss bob said to them its like a few weeks are to you i nodded thoughtfully then maybe its about the timing how so i shrugged hell if i know but its the only thing i can think of maybe mab wants a less maeveish maeve for the next few years why bob asked i growled i already have one why i dont need you adding more i drummed my fingers on the steering wheel why doesnt mab do it herself oh i see its okay if you add more whys you have complicated rules harry i ignored that with the disdain it deserved im serious mab has the power whats stopping her from tearing maeve to shreds something bob suggested i cant believe i got my tux shredded for brilliant analysis like that i said hey bob said i just told you something so valuable that it could save your life or get you killed yeah i sighed you did but it isnt enough i need more information you do know a few people around here bob said i growled my physical therapist who ive known for three whole months nearly died tonight because she showed up at a party with meand that was with mab looking over my shoulder as a referee how is that any different from the last time you played with faeries because now i know them i said it was actually sort of scary looking back at the me from a decade ago that guy was terrifying in his ignorance aurora and her crew were basically a decent crowd misguided yeah but to them we were the bad guys they were tough but they werent killers maeves different how bob asked she doesnt have limits i said and you figure youre up against her i know i am i said and shes grown powerful enough to challenge mab in her own court i also know more about mab now and all of it scares the crap out of me i snorted and felt a tremble of winged insects in my midsection and apparently maeve is a threat to her and im supposed to deal with it bob whistled well maybe that explains it explains what why mab was so hellbent on getting you to be the new knight bob said i mean youre kind of an avatar of the phrase things fall apart mab has a target she wants to be absolutely sure of youre like her guided missile she cant know exactly whats going to happen but she knows theres going to be a great big boom im a missile huh her big dumb bunker buster he said cheerily of course you know the thing about missiles harry yeah i said as i put the caddy back in gear again theyre expendable buck up little camper at least you had a hot redhead jump your bones tonight not the right bone but you cant have everything i snorted thanks bob andi totally got the drop on you where was your tiny secret service team i forgot to invite them past the threshold i said besides i think shed hit me before anyone could have shouted a lookout anyway you ever think about replacing them with some real bodyguard goons harry i know a thing that knows a thing screw that toot and his gang arent exactly gangstas but i trust them that means more that means youre a sucker bob said did the xfiles teach you nothing trust no one i grunted cat sith gave me almost the same advice ack bob said that guy he still got the attitude i feel safe in assuming that he does i dont like him but hes no dummy bob said at least he gives good advice mathematically maybe i said but trust isnt one of those things that lends itself well to math sure it does bob said you trust somebody they betray you you get a negative value you never trust they can never disappoint you you break even i laughed or you trust its vindicated and youre better off shah bob said like that happens lifes about more than breaking even i said bob snorted which is why the first thing you did when you got back to town was call all of your friends and immediately tell them you needed their help and trust them to help you i scowled out at the road it wasnt like the first thing you did was abuse one of your friends and inflict property damage on his house and steal a powerful magical counselor whose loyalties are transferrable to whoever happens to be holding an old skullpresumably so that youd have a lackey who would agree with whatever you said instead of give you a hard time about it and the only beings youre allowing to help you are a bunch of tiny faeries who worship the ground you walk on because you buy them pizza bob made a skeptical sound i can see how important trust is to you boss thats why i got you clearly i said because i wanted a yesman and youre so good for that hey im just a mirror boss not my fault youre ambivalent im not ambivalent you know better but youre being a moron about it anyway bob said if that aint ambivalence maybe mabs getting to you because its a little crazy he sniffed besides if you werent of two minds about it i wouldnt be giving you this kind of crap now would i i was going to say something sarcastic but the red glare of a stoplight suddenly appeared about ten feet in front of the old caddys nose i stared at the light for a fraction of a second and then mashed the brakes down i had an instant to see that it wasnt a traffic signal but toottoot his aura glaring brilliant scarlet frantically waving his arms at me as the caddy lumbered forward i saw him take a couple of steps forward running up the windshield and up out of sight above me as the heavy old piece of detroit iron began to slide on the asphalt i saw an object tumble out of the air in front of me and hit the street turning over and over i had another instant to recognize a plain black nylon duffel bag and then the world went white and a hammer the size of the chrysler building slammed me back against the old caddys seat chapter twelve the bomb might have been fifty feet away when it exploded mabs therapy had paid off on raw instinct id already begun to form a defensive shield in front of me when everything went boom i hadnt had time to build much of a shield but what little i could do probably kept me conscious explosions are unbelievably loud if you havent been near one theres no way to convey the sheer violence of it it doesnt really register as a sound the way a gunshot will theres just this single terrible power in the air a sudden hammer blow of disorienting pressure as if youve been hit by a truck made of pillowtop mattresses your hearing goes theres a familiar highpitched tone only no one is telling you that this is a test of the emergency broadcast system theres dust and smoke everywhere and you cant see your muscles dont all work right you tell them to move and its iffy maybe they do maybe they dont its hard to tell which way is down not that you dont know it rationally somewhere in your headbut your body just seems to forget its natural awareness of gravity even if something sharp and fast doesnt go flying through some of your favorite organs a nearby explosion leaves you halfblind deaf and drunkenly impaired vulnerable one moment the caddy was screeching and sliding toward that black duffel bag the next i was staring at a cloud of dust and the dim image of a brick wall at the end of the caddys nose the windshield had been splintered into a webwork of cracks that made it hard to see my chest hurt like hell i picked fitfully at it my fingers clumsy and thought to myself that the car sith had provided must have had armored glass or there would be windshield mixed in with my intestines lights danced and darted in my vision my eyes wouldnt focus enough to track them smells were incredibly sharp the air was acrid thick with smoke laced with the scents of things it is unhealthy to burn i smelled gasoline nearby there were wires hanging down from something in the corner of my vision outside the car spitting white sparks none of it seemed normal but i couldnt quite remember the right word to describe it danger right that was it danger i was in danger a moving target is harder to hit i pushed open the passenger door and stumbled out of the car choking on dust another car wreck man mike was going to charge me a small fortune to fix the blue beetle this time did i have the money in the bank i couldnt remember whether id deposited my last stipend check from the wardens no wait the car id just gotten out of wasnt the blue beetle my trusty old volkswagen bug that had died in the line of duty it was the creepy herman munster hot rod my boss had gotten m my brain finished rebooting and things snapped back into focus someone had just tried to bomb me back into the stone age i shook my head gagging on dust then dragged the redcaps hat down off my head and over my mouth as a dust mask the caddy was up on the curb and had hit a building the building had gotten the worst of it one of the caddys headlights was out its front fender crumpled a bit and the passenger door had been thrown open but otherwise the car was fine maybe ten or twelve square feet of brick wall had fallen out some of it onto the hood some of it onto the sidewalk i looked around it was hard to see through the dust there were a lot of bustedup walls several small fires a streetlight had come swinging down from the line that supported itthat was where the sparking cables came from lights still darted and flickered randomly and i blinked trying to clear the stars away but stars in the vision were usually white and silver these were orange and red like the embers of a fire then one of those lights pivoted in midair and flashed toward my eyes i jerked away from it still clumsy and a sudden spike of agony burned through my face i screamed and staggered to one knee something had gone through my cheek and was still there tacking the damned cincinnati cap to my face i reached for it on instinct but before i could get to it pain exploded from my back from the fresh wounds there from my bruised hands from my throat where the redcap had nearly crushed it that did put me on the ground it was too much to process much less ignore i reacted on blind animal instinct swiping at the most intense source of pain with my paw there was another flash of agony and suddenly the hat came away from my face a bloodied nail a good four inches long fell away with the hat its last two inches bloodied its other end swathed in duct tape the instant it came free i felt my pain recede again back to the dull background annoyance it had been a few moments before my thoughts cleared as the agony retreated someone had shot me with a freaking nail gun what the hell was going on here no sooner had i thought that than another light flashed toward me and before i could react a second round of utterly ridiculous levels of pain slammed through me starting at my leg the other pains resurfaced with the fresh addition of my throbbing face i screamed and swatted and tore a second nail much like the first from the flesh of my right quadriceps again that cold power flooded into me making pain distant making thoughts more clear the embercolored lights were coming at me too fast there was no time to get a defensive spell up not in my condition and my body winter knight or not wasnt fast enough to dodge or swat them out of the way even as i processed those thoughts a third nail hit me in the left arm and i had to scream and thrash my way out of another spike of pure agony i felt utterly helpless and stunned at my inability to overcome so tiny a foe and i suddenly knew how the late summer lady aurora had felt at the end get up harry i panted fighting through the disorientation the polar shifts in pain get up before they nail you nail you get it but i always joke when im afraid and i was terrified whatever these things were if they got more than one of those nails into me i doubted i would be able to hold my thoughts together long enough to get them out again i had a gruesome vision of myself stretched in lifeless agonized rigor on the sidewalk nails sticking out of every square inch of my skin i tried to scramble to evade but compared to the darting motes of light i was moving in slowmotion replay half a dozen more of the glimmering things came arrowing toward me out of the night zooming at me in a flying v formation and i knew things were about to get really bad then someone blew on a coachs whistle a sound i heard even through my stunned ears and a tiny distant voice piped to the za lord half a dozen little cool blue spheres of light flashed toward my attackers intercepting them only a couple of feet from my body six explosions of sparks and glowing motes lit the night various colors swirling and spinning as the tiny soldiers of the za lords guard closed to battle with my attackers toot soared in from directly overhead his heels landing hard on my stomach for somebody the size of a chicken he was strong and my breath huffed out as i was knocked back to the ground he planted his feet wide a snarl on his tiny face his shield hefted up to a defensive position his tableknife sword in hand stay down my lord wait until we clear a path for escape a path i took a second to look around i saw one of toots kernels go by flying sideways wielding a spear made of a straight pin and a pencil against another of the little folk a humanish figure dressed in what looked like actual black armor made of some kind of shaped plastic or maybe carapace and carrying another of the toofamiliar nails the enemy faerie was wounded and glowing motes of scarlet and sullen orange light dribbled from a straight pininflicted wound on his tiny leg sullen and chill spheres of light darted everywhere dozens of them all spinning and diving and looping at once there was no way to track all of that motion even if id been completely clearheaded i would have done well to follow a tenth of it five or six more enemy fae larger and brighter than the others dived down at me bearing a nail sword in each hand they let out shrill eerie little cries as they came at meand at toottoot okay ive thought a lot of things about toottoot over the years ive compared him to a lot of really humorous stuff and occasionally to people i didnt admire too much ive made jokes at his expense though never when i thought it would hurt him but if youd asked me for a perfect parallel for the little guy a year ago i would never ever ever have said king leonidas toot let out a highpitched roar and leapt into the air he smashed his shield into the blackarmored fae in the center of the enemy formation spinning as he did to send the luckless faerie careening into the companion on his left toots sword lashed out and a single dragonfly wing went fluttering free of the body it had been attached to the little fae went spinning out of the air to crash into a pile of fallen bricks and rubble two got through agony the next thing i knew toot was pulling a nail from the muscle over my abdomen and fresh hits there and in my left pectoral muscle had added their toll of pain to my evening toot gripping the nail carefully by its ducttape handle turned and flung it at a pair of dueling fae striking the orangelit enemy with the broad side of the steel nail there was a flash of white light and the hit fae let out a shriek that started at the edge of human hearing and went up into dog frequencies and darted away the guard in hot pursuit theyre breaking toot bellowed well as much as someone who can fit in a bread box can bellow after them kernels sullen lights slithered away in panic while bright balls of blue buzzed after them permission to pursue those jerks my lord toot shouted i finally had a couple of seconds to get my head together i shook it violently it didnt help but the simple act of putting together recognition of a problem consideration of a solution and taking action to fix it had gotten my mental house in some kind of order its a feint i said looking around theyre luring the guard away there high up way the hell high up maybe twenty stories a blob of embercolored light suddenly plunged off of a balcony and began to fall toward us as it came closer the blob broke apart into dozens of angry little spheres they began to bob and interweave picking up more and more speed the patterns dizzying confusing streaking lights peeled off from the main cloud in every direction toot once more perched on my stomach stared up at them his mouth open his left arm sagged his shield dropping down to his side uhoh he gulped um im not sure i can get them all my lord i sat up forcing him off my stomach and gained my feet you did good toot i growled okay small fry wizard time a couple of years back me and my apprentice molly had been studying air magic as part of her basic grounding in the elemental forces she hadnt ever picked up the knack for using blasts of wind as weapons but she had managed to develop a spell that did a passable imitation of a blowdryer i lifted my right hand summoned my will and readied the blowdryer spell only i turned it to eleven ventas reductas i thundered unleashing my will and an arctic gale came howling and shrieking from my outstretched hand it condensed the damp october air into mist too bellowing out from my hand in a cone the size of an apartment building frost formed on every surface in the immediate area it struck the cloud of diving little folk and sent them tumbling in every direction little orange lights went spinning and wobbling their complex formation shattered i saw them begin to gather to one side trying to reform but i poured on the wind and altered the direction of the blast scattering them again mollys spell was more efficient than anything id come up with when i had her level of experience but theres no free lunch that much wind takes a lot of energy to whip up and i wasnt going to be able to hold it forever abruptly toot flashed away from me diving through the air his wings a blur he vanished behind the nose of a parked car on the other side of the street brandishing his sword a brawl spilled out from the tail end of the car an instant later one of the enemy little folk went tumbling in a windmill of arms and legs and fetched up against the corpse of the traffic signal two went darting away in obvious panic their flight erratic and swift dropping their nail swords as they fled and then there was a flash of sparks as steel struck steel and toot came out from behind the truck frantically defending himself from another of the little folk almost as tall as he was the foe was dressed in black armor covered in spikes made from the tips of freaking fishhooks even the helmet and he fought with what seemed to be an actual sword designed to size a wavybladed thing that i think was called a flamberge as i watched the enemy champions blade sheared half an inch of aluminum from the top of toots shield and he followed up with a series of heavy twohanded blows meant to divide toot in half toot bobbed and weaved like a reed but the assault was ferocious the foe as fast as he was he got the flat of the shield in front of another blow stopping it but on the next strike the flamberges wavy blade caught on the edge of the shield and sliced through it again leaving it little more than a rectangle of aluminum strapped to toots arm toot took to the air but his opponent matched him and they darted and spun around a light pole the enemys sword meeting toots improvised blade in flashes of silver sparks i wanted to intervene but like it always does size mattered my target was tiny and moving fast the pair of them were darting around so much that even if i got lucky and hit someone i probably had as much chance of taking out toot as i did captain hook over there my evocation magic was more focused and precise than it had ever been thanks to mab but my control still wasnt up to the task of being that discriminating and besidesi still had to keep my giant leaf blower going against the rest of hooks goons all i could do was watch hook swung at toots head but toot ducked in the nick of time and the flamberge caught briefly in the metal of the streetlights post aha toot said and slammed his table knife down onto hooks armored hand the other fae reeled obviously in pain and the flamberge fell to the ground surrender villain toot cried face the justice of the za lord never answered another piping voice from within the helmet and hook produced a pair of toothpickslender daggers he made a scissor shape of them and caught toots next attack in it flicking the table knife aside and whipping his dagger at toots throat toot recoiled but took a long cut across his chest the knife shearing through his armor just as the flamberge had done my major general screamed in pain recoiling it was the opening id needed and i twisted my leaf blower around to slam into hook it caught the little fae as he was starting to move toward toottoot sending him tumbling into the side of a building while the back blast of wind actually threw toot clear he managed to recover in midair wings blurring and shot unsteadily toward me i caught him in my free hand drawing him in close against my side and turned partly away from hook sheltering toot the cloud of hostile fae was still swirling and wobbling around they obviously lacked any kind of leadership and were still disordered by the galeforce winds with which id hit thembut i was almost out of energy and about two seconds after they got their act together i was a dead man feets dont fail me now i muttered i kept the leaf blower on hook who i suspected was their leader and strode forward toward the car i checked it with several quick glances the gasoline smell wasnt coming from the caddy but from a halfsmashed car that had been close to the exploding duffel bag i gave the leaf blower one last surge of power and lunged into the caddy slamming the door behind me i dumped toot down next to bob as gently as i could whats happening bob shouted blearily from where hed landed sideways in the well of the passenger seat im getting my ass kicked by tiny faeries i shouted back fumbling to start the car theyve got my freaking number there was a loud pop and a slender miniature steel dagger slammed through the passenger window transforming it into a broken webwork as difficult to see through as a stainedglass window ack i said bob started laughing hysterically the dagger vanished and then the same thing happened on the drivers side holy crap hook was way too bright for someone the size of a tickle me elmo he was blinding me i got the caddy into reverse and rumbled back off the sidewalk onto the street shedding bricks and debris as i went just as i bounced down onto the street proper the front windshield exploded into a web of cracks too so i just kept driving backward turning to look over my shoulder that went well for a few seconds and then the rear window broke too i gritted my teeth under normal circumstances the next move would be to roll down the window and stick my head out of it tonight i was pretty sure id get a miniature dagger in the eye if i tried sometimes you have to choose between doing something stupid and doing something suicidal so i kept driving blind and backward through the middle of chicago while bob chortled his bony ass off tiny faeries he giggled rolling a bit as the caddy weaved and jounced tiny faeries my plan worked for about ten secondsand then i slammed into a parked car i was lucky that it wasnt a large one i mean i couldnt see it but it bounced off the caddy like a billiard ball struck by the cue ball it also knocked the wheel out of my hands wrenching it from my fingers and sending the caddy onto another sidewalk it smashed through a metal railing and then the back tires bounced down into a sunken stairwell i struggled to get the caddy clear but there was nothing for the tires to grab onto end of the line i let out a heartfelt curse and slammed a fist against the steering wheel then i made myself close my eyes and think think think dont react in panic keep your head dresden major general i said you okay its not bad my lord he gasped ive had worse weve got to move i said run away bob giggled run away tiny faeries i growled in frustration and popped the redcaps hat down over bob stop being a jerk this is serious bobs voice was only barely muffled it sounded like he couldnt breathe serious tiny faeries the mmmighty wizard dresden you are not as funny as you think you are i said severely toot you got any ideas trap them all in a circle toot suggested i sighed right id just need to get them all to land in the same place at the same time inside of a magic circle i had no means to create toots a great little guy just not really adviser material orange light began to bathe the broken windows highlighting the webwork of cracks in them a lot of orange light crap i gasped i am not going to be known as the wizard who used his death curse thanks to a bunch of bitty nail guns then there was a very sinister sound toward the rear of the caddy someone opened the lid to the fuel tank it wasnt hard to work out what would happen next fire hell no i said i recovered the ball cap turned a stillgiggling bob upside down and then popped toot into the skull he sprawled in it arms and legs sticking out but he didnt complain hey bob protested serves you right giggles i snapped i tucked the skull under my arm like a football i knew i didnt have much of a chance of getting away from that swarm of fae piranha but it was an infinitely larger chance than i would have if i stayed in the car and burned to death hells bells what i wouldnt give to have my shield bracelet or my old staff i didnt even have an umbrella i wasnt sure how much more magic i had left in me but i readied my shield spell shaping it to surround me as i ran i wouldnt be able to hold it in place for longbut maybe if i got very very lucky i would survive the swarm long enough to find another option i took several sharp and completely notpanicked breaths then piled out of the cadillac bringing my shield up with a shout of defendarius the little folk started hitting my shield almost instantly i once rode out a hailstorm in a domeshaped quonset hut made of corrugated steel it sounded like that only closer and a hell of a lot more lethal i went into a sprint between the stillpresent dust the shroud of mist my leafblower spell had billowed forth and the swarm of hostile fae i could barely see i picked a direction and ran ten steps twenty steps the enemy continued pounding against the shield and as i kept pouring my will into it to keep it in place my body began to feel heavier and heavier thirty stepsand i stepped into a small pothole in the sidewalk stumbled and fell falling in a fight is generally bad you tend not to get up again i mean theres a reason that the phrase he fell was synonymous with death for a bunch of centuries i fell and then i heard the most beautiful sound of my life somewhere nearby a cat let out an angry hissing scream the little folk live in mortal dread of felis domesticus cats are observant curious and fast enough to catch the little fae hell the domestic cat can stalk kill and subsist upon more species than any other land predator in the world they are peerless hunters and the little folk know it the effect of the scream was instantaneous my attackers recoiled on pure reflex immediately darting about twenty feet into the aireven hook i got a chance to look up and saw a large brindle tomcat leap from the top of a trash can onto the sidewalk beside me no shouted hook from inside his helmet slay the beast slay them all what what did i ever do to you bob protested indignant im not even supposed to be here today the fae all looked at hook and seemed to begin gathering their courage again a second cat screamed nearby and a third and a fourth cats started prowling out of alleys and from beneath parked cars cats began pacing along building ledges twenty feet from the ground glowing eyes reflected light from the deep shadows between buildings even hook wasnt willing to put up with that action i guess the little fae champion let out a frustrated scream then turned and darted up up and away vanishing into the night the others followed hook flowing away in a ribbon of emberlight i lay there for a second exhausted and panting then i sat up and looked around the cats were gone vanished as if theyd never been there i heard someone walk out of the alley behind me and my body went tense and tight despite my weariness then a young womans voice said in a passable british accent the little folk are easily startled but theyll soon be back and in greater numbers i sagged in sudden exhausted relief the bad guys hardly ever quote star wars molly i breathed a tall young woman dressed in rather shabby secondhand clothing crouched down next to me and smiled hey boss welcome home chapter thirteen grasshopper i said feeling myself smile illusion very nice molly gave me a little bow of her head its what i do also good timing i said also what the hell how did you know i was alive here but sure how did you know priorities boss can you walk im good i said and pushed myself to my feet it wasnt as hard as it really should have been and i could feel my endurance rebuilding itself already the energy coming back into me i was still tireddont get me wrongbut i should have been fallingdown dizzy and i wasnt you dont look so good molly said was that a tux briefly i said i eyed the car feel like driving sure she said but thats pretty stuck harry unless you brought a crane i grunted faintly irritated by her tone just get in start it and give it gas gently molly looked like she wanted to argue but then she looked down abruptly a second later i heard sirens she frowned shook her head and got into the car the motor rumbled to life a second later i went down the stairwell where the cars tires were stuck set down bobs skull and found a good spot beneath the rear frame then i set my feet put the heels of my hands against the underside of the caddy and pushed it was hard i mean it was really really gutbustingly hardbut the caddy groaned and then shifted and then slowly rose i was lifting with my legs as much as my arms putting my whole body into it and everything in me gave off a dull burn of effort my breath escaped my lungs in a slow groan but then the tires were up out of the stairwell and turning and they caught on the sidewalk and the caddy pulled itself the rest of the way i grabbed the skull still with the mostly limp toottoot inside it staggered back up out of the stairwell and into the passenger side of the car i lifted my hand and sent a surge of will down through it muttering forzare and the overstrained windshield groaned and gave way tearing itself free of the frame and clearing mollys vision go i grated molly went driving carefully the emergency vehicles were rolling in past us and she pulled over and drove slowly to let them by i sat there breathing hard and realized that the real effort of moving that much weight didnt hit you while you were actually moving itit came in the moments after when your muscles recovered enough to demand oxygen right the hell now i leaned my head against the window panting hows it going buddy i asked a moment later it hurts toot sighed but ill be okay my lord the armor held off some of the blow i checked the skull the eyelights were gone bob had dummied up the moment molly was around as per my standing orders which had been in place since she had first become my apprentice bob had almost unlimited knowledge of magic molly had a calculated disregard for selflimitation when she thought it justified they would have made a really scary pair and id kept them carefully separate during her training we need to get off the street i said someplace quiet and secure i know a place just like that molly said what happened someone tossed a gym bag full of explosives at my car i growled and followed it up with the freaking pixie death squadron from hell you mean they picked this car out of all the other traffic she asked her tone dry what are the odds i grunted one more reason to get off the street pronto relax she said i started veiling the car as soon as we passed the police if someone was following you before they arent now catch your breath harry well be there soon i blinked impressed veils were not simple spells granted they were sort of a specialty of mollys but this was taking it up a notch i didnt know whether i could have covered the entire caddy with a veil while driving alertly and carrying on a conversation in fact i was pretty sure i couldnt grasshopper was growing up on me i studied mollys profile while she drove stared really id first met her years ago when she was a gawky little kid in a training bra shed grown up tall fiveten or a little more she had dark blond hair although she had changed its color about fifty times since id met her at the moment it was in its natural shade and cut short hanging in an even sheet to her chin she was wearing minimal makeup the girl was built like a particularly wellproportioned statue but she wasnt flaunting it in this outfitkhaki pants a creamcolored shirt and a chocolate brown jacket the last time id seen molly shed been a starvedlooking thing dressed in rags and twitching at every sound and motion like a feral catwhich was hardly surprising given that shed been fighting a covert war against a group called the fomor while dodging the cops and the wardens of the white council she was still lean and a little hyperalert her eyes trying to watch the whole world at once but that sense of overly coiled spring tension was much reduced she looked good noticing that made things stir under the surface things that shouldnt have been and i abruptly looked away uh she said harry you look better than the last time i saw you kiddo i said she grinned briefly right back atcha i snorted itd be hard to look worse for either of us i guess she glanced at me yeah im a lot better im still not she shrugged im not exactly little miss stability at least not yet but im working on it sometimes i think thats where most of us are i said fighting off the crazy as best we can trying to become something better than we were its that second bit thats important she smiled and didnt say anything else within a few moments she had turned the caddy into a private parking lot i dont have any money for parking i said dont need it she paused and rolled down the cracked window to wave at an attendant operating the gate he glanced up from his book smiled at her and pushed a button the gate opened and molly pulled the caddy into the lot she drove down the length of it and pulled the car carefully into a covered parking spot okay come on we got out of the car and molly led me to a doorway leading into an adjacent apartment building she opened the door with a key but instead of moving to the elevators she guided me to another doorway to one side of the entrance she unlocked that one too and went down two flights of stairs to a final door i could sense magical defenses on the doors and the stairs without even making an effort to open myself up to it that was a serious bunch of security spells molly opened the second door and said please come in she smiled at toot and your crew with you of course thanks i said and followed her inside molly had an apartment she had an apartment big enough for hugh hefners birthday party the living room was the size of a basketball court and it had elevenfoot ceilings there was a little bar separating the kitchen from the rest of the open space she had a fireplace with what looked like a handmade living room set around it in one corner of the room and a second section of comfy chairs and a desk tucked into a nook lined with builtin bookshelves she had a weight bench too along with an elliptical machine both of them expensive european setups the floors were hardwood broken up by occasional carpets that probably cost more than the floor space they covered a couple of doors led off from the main room they were oak granite countertops a sixburner gas stove recessed lighting hells bells i said uh nice place molly shrugged out of her jacket and tossed it onto the back of a couch you like she walked into the kitchen opened a cabinet door and pulled out a firstaid kit i like i said uh how the svartalves built it for me she said svartalves they were some serious customers in the supernatural scene peerless artisans a very private and independent folkand they tolerated absolutely no nonsense no one wants to get on the bad side of a svartalf they werent exactly known for their generosity either you working for them i asked no she said this is mine i bought it from them i blinked again with what honor she said she muttered something and flicked a hand at a chandelier hanging over the table in the little dining area it began to glow with a pure white light as bright as any collection of incandescent bulbs bring him over here and well see if we cant help him i did so transferring toot from the skull to the table as gently as possible molly leaned down over him peering right through the breastplate what hit you toottoot a big fat jerk toot replied wincing he had a real sword too you know how hard it is to convince any of you big people to make us a sword we can actually use i saw his gear i said i totally liked yours better major general way cooler and more stylish than that stupid blackknight look toot gave me a brief fierce grin thank you my lord toot got out of his ruined armor with effort and with mollys cautious steadyfingered help i managed to clean the wound and bandage it it looked ugly and toot was anything but happy during the process but he was clearly uncomfortable and weary rather than being badly hurt once the wound was taken care of toot promptly flopped onto the table and went to sleep molly smiled got a clean towel out of a cabinet and draped it over the little guy toot seized it and curled up beneath it with a sigh all right molly said picking up the firstaid kit she beckoned me to follow her to the kitchen your turn off with the shirt not until you buy me dinner i said for a second she froze and i wondered whether that had come out like the joke it had sounded like in my mind then she recovered molly arched her eyebrow in a look that was disturbingly like that of her mother a woman around with whom a wise man will not mess and folded her arms fine i said rolling my eyes i shrugged my way out of the ruined tux jesus molly said softly looking at me she leaned around me frowning at my back you look like a passion play doesnt feel so bad i said it might if one of these cuts gets infected molly said just just stand there and hold still man she went to the cabinet and came back with a big brown bottle of hydrogen peroxide and a couple of kitchen towels i watched her walking back and forth well start with your back lean on the counter i did resting my elbows on the granite still watching her molly fumbled with the supplies for a second then bit her lower lip and began to move with purpose she started dribbling peroxide onto the cuts on my back in little bursts of cold liquid that might have made me jump before id spent so much time in arctis tor it burned a little and then fizzed enthusiastically so not one question i asked her hmmm she didnt look up from her work i come back from the dead i sort of expected i dont know a little shock and about a million questions i knew you were alive molly said yeah i sort of figured how she didnt answer and after a moment i realized the likely answer my godmother she takes her yodaing seriously i remember i said keeping my tone neutral how long have you known several weeks molly said there are so many cuts here i dont think i have enough bandaids well have to wrap it i guess ill just put a clean shirt over them i said look it isnt a big deal little marks like that are going to be gone in a day or two little winter knight stuff pretty much i said mab kinda gave me the tour during my recovery what happened she asked i found my eyes wandering to bobs skull telling molly what was going on would mean that she was involved it would draw her into the conflict i didnt want to expose her to that kind of dangernot again of course it probably wasnt my sole decision and besides molly had intervened in an assassination that had been really close to succeeding whoever was behind the swarm of piranha pixies had probably seen it molly was already in the fight if i started keeping things from her now it would only hinder her chances of surviving it i didnt want her involved but shed earned the right to make that choice for herself so i gave it to her straight succinct and with zero editing except for the bit about halloween it felt sort of strange i hardly ever tell anyone that much truth the truth is dangerous she listened her large eyes steadily focused on a point around my chin when i finished all she said was turn around i did and she started working on the cuts on my chest arms and face again cleaning the wounds was a little uncomfortable but nothing more i watched her tending me i couldnt read her expression she didnt look up at my eyes while she worked and she kept her manner brisk and steady very businesslike molly i said as she finished she paused still not looking up at me im sorry im sorry that i had to ask you to help me do what i did im sorry that i didnt make you stay home from chichén itzá i never should have exposed you to that you werent ready no kidding molly said quietly but i wasnt really taking no for an answer at the time either neither of us made smart choices that night maybe but only one of us is the mentor i said im supposed to be the one who knows whats going on molly shook her head several times a jerky motion harryits over okay its done its the past let it stay there sure you want that i am okay i picked up a paper towel and dabbed at a few runnels of peroxide bubbling their way down my stomach well now all i need is a clean shirt molly pointed at one of the oak doors in there there are two dressers and a closet nothing fancy but im pretty sure it will all fit you i blinked several times um what she snorted and rolled her eyes harry duh i knew you were alive that meant youd be coming back lea told me to keep it to myself so i got a place ready for you she took a quick step back into the kitchen opened a drawer and came back with a small brass key here this will get you past the locks and past the svartalves wards and past my defenses i took the key frowning um im not asking you to shack up with me harry molly said her tone dry its just until you get back on your feet or or just as long as youre in town and need a place to stay did you think i couldnt take care of it myself of course not molly said but you know i guess i think that maybe you shouldnt have to she looked up at me uncertainly you were there when i needed you i figured it was my turn now i looked away before i got all emotional the kid had gotten this place together made some kind of alliance with a very suspicious and cautious supernatural nation furnished a room for me and picked me up a wardrobe in just a few weeks when shed been living in rags on the street all the time for the better part of a year before that im impressed grasshopper i said seriously this isnt the impressive part she said but i dont think we have time to get into that right now given what youve got going lets survive halloween i said and then maybe we can sit and have a nice talk molly you shouldnt have done this for me ego much she asked the ghost of her old irreverent self lurking in her eyes i got this place for me harry i lived my whole life in one home living on the street wasnt wasnt a good place for me to put myself back together i needed someplace someplace she frowned yours i suggested stable she said quiet and mine not that you arent welcome here while you need it i suppose you didnt get those clothes for my sake either maybe i started dating basketball teams molly said her eyes actually sparkling for a moment you dont know sure i do i said she started putting the kit away think of the clothes as as a birthday present she looked up at me for a second and gave me a hesitant smile its really good to see you harry happy birthday thanks i said id give you a hug but id bleach and bloodstain your clothes at the same time rain check molly said im uh working up to hugs might take a while she took a deep breath harry i know youve got your hands full already but theres something you need to know i frowned yeah yeah she rubbed her arms with her hands as though cold ive kind of been visiting your island in the middle of the southern reaches of lake michigan lies an island that doesnt appear on any charts maps or satellite images its a nexus point of ley lines of dark energy and it doesnt like company it encourages people who come near it to get lost and wander away planes fly over the thing all the time but no one sees it a few years back id bound myself to the island and the worldclass genius loci that watched over it id named it demonreach and knew relatively little about it beyond that it was an ally when id been shot and plunged into the dark waters of lake michigan it had taken mab and demonreach both to preserve my life id woken up from a coma in a cavern beneath the islands surface with plants growing into my freaking veins like some kind of organic iv line it was a seriously weird kind of place how did you get there i asked in a boat duh i gave her a look you know what i mean she smiled the expression a little sad after youve had someone like the corpsetaker pound your mind into pomegranate seeds a psychic no trespassing sign seems kinda slowpitch heh i said point but its a dangerous place molly and its getting worse she said i shifted my weight uneasily define worse energy is building up there like like steam in a boiler i know im still new at thisbut ive talked with lea about it and she agrees god she was dragging this out making me wonder what she knew i hate that agrees with what um molly said looking down harry i think that within the next few days the island is going to explode and i think that when it does it will take about half the midwest with it chapter fourteen of course it is i said i looked around and grabbed the firstaid kit then started stomping toward the indicated guest bedroom i swear this stupid town why does every hideous supernatural thing that happens happen here im gone for a few months and augh be right back grrssll frrrsl rassle mrrrfl there was a light switch in the bedroom and it worked the lightbulb stayed on and everything i scowled up at it suspiciously normally when im in a snit like this lightbulbs dont survive eye contact much less my yosemite sam impersonation evidently the svartalves had worked out a fix for technological grumpywizard syndrome and the room well it reminded me of home my apartment had been tiny you could have fit it into mollys main room half a dozen times easy my old place was almost the same size as her guest bedroom shed furnished it with secondhand furniture like my place had been there was a small fireplace with a couple of easy chairs and a comfortablelooking couch there were scuffedup old bookshelves cheap and sturdy lining the walls and they contained what was probably meant to be the beginning of a replacement for my old paperback fiction library over toward where my bedroom used to be was a bed though it was a full rather than a twin a counter stood where my kitchen counter had been more or less and there was a small fridge and what looked like an electric griddle on it i looked around it wasnt home but it was in the right zip code and it was maybe the single sweetest thing anyone had ever done for me for just a second i remembered the scent of my old apartment wood smoke and pine cleaner and a little bit of musty dampness that was inevitable in a basement and if i squinted my eyes up really tight i could almost pretend i was there again that i was home but theyd burned down my home i had repaid them for it with interest but i still felt oddly hollow in my guts when i thought about how i would never see it again i missed mister my cat i missed my dog i missed the familiarity of having a place that i knew that was a shelter i missed my life id been away from home for what felt like a very long time there was a closet by the bed with a narrow dresser on two sides it was full of clothes nothing fancy tshirts old jeans some new underwear and socks still in their plastic packaging some shorts some sweatpants several pairs of used sneakers the size of small canoes and some hiking boots that were a tolerable fit i went for the boots my feet are not for the faint of sole ah ha ha i ditched the tux cleaned up and covered the injuries on my legs and got dressed in clothes that felt familiar and comfortable for the first time since id taken a bullet in the chest i came out of the bedroom holding the bloodied clothes and glanced at molly she pointed a finger at the fire i nodded my thanks remembered to take the bejeweled cuff links out of the pockets of the pants and tossed what was left into the fire blood that had already been soaked up by cloth wouldnt be easy to use against me even if someone had broken in and taken it somehow but its one of those things best not left to chance okay i said settling down on the arm of a chair the island who else knows about it lea molly said presumably she told mab i assumed word would get to you mab i said is apparently the sort of mom who thinks you need to find things out for yourself those are real i grunted have you had any contact with demonreach the spirit itself molly shook her head it tolerates my presence but it isnt anything like cordial or friendly i think it knows im connected to you yeah i said im sure it does if it wanted you off the island youd be gone i shook my head several times let me think molly did she went into the kitchen to the fridge she came out with a couple of cans of cocacola popped them both open and handed me one we tapped the cans together gently and drank i closed my eyes and tried to order my thoughts molly waited okay i said who else knows no one she said you didnt tell the council molly grimaced at the mention of the white council of wizards how would i do that exactly given that according to them im a wanted fugitive and that no one there would blink twice if i was executed on sight plenty of them would blink twice i said quietly why do you think youre still walking around molly frowned and eyed me what do you mean i mean that leas clearly taught you a lot molly and its obvious that your skills have matured a lot in the past year but there are people there with decades worth of years like the one youve had maybe even centuries if they really wanted you found and dead youd be found and dead period then how come im not molly asked because there are people on the council who wouldnt like it i said my g ebenezar can take anyone else on the council on any given day if he gets mad at them thats probably enoughbut ramirez likes you too and since hed be the guy who would theoretically be in charge of capturing you anyone else who did it would be walking all over his turf hes young too but hes earned respect and most of the young guns in the wardens would probably side with him in an argument i sighed look the white council has always been a gigantic mound of assorted jerks but theyre not inhuman except sometimes molly said her voice bitter humanity matters i said youre still here arent you no thanks to them she said if they hadnt shown up at chichén itzá none of us would have made it out molly frowned at that that wasnt the white council true technically that had been the grey council but since the grey council was mostly made up of members of the white council working together in secret it still counted in my mind sort of those guys i said are what the council should be and might be and when we needed help the most they were there i sipped some more coke i know the world seems dark and ugly sometimes but there are still good things in it and good people and some of them are on the council they havent been in contact with you because they cant bebut believe me theyve been shielding you from getting in even more trouble than youve already had you assume she said stubbornly i sighed kid youre going to be dealing with the council your whole life and that could be for three or four hundred years im not saying you shouldnt get in their faces when theyre in the wrong but you might want to consider the idea that burning your bridges behind you could prove to be a very bad policy a century or two from now molly looked like she wanted to disagree with mebut she looked pensive too she drank some more of her coke frowning damn why couldnt i have figured out that particular piece of advice to give to myself when i was her age it might have made my life a whole lot simpler back to the island i said how sure are you about the level of energy involved she considered her answer i was at chichén itzá she said its all pretty blurry but i remember a lot of fragments really well one of the things i remember is the tension that had built up under the main ziggurat do you remember i did though it had been pretty far down on my list of priorities at the time the red king had ordered dozens maybe hundreds of human sacrifices to build up a charge for the spell he was going to use to wipe me and everyone connected to me by blood from the face of the earth that energy had been humming inside the very stones of the city go to a large power station sometime and stand near the capacitors the air is full of the same kind of silently vibrating potential i remember i said its like that maybe more maybe less but its really really big its scaring the animals away what time is it i asked molly checked a tall old grandfather clock ticking steadily away in a corner three fifteen ten minutes to the marina an hour and change to the island and back call it an hour for a service call i shook my head and snorted if we leave right now that puts us back here in town right around sunrise wouldnt you say more or less she agreed mab i said in the same tone i reserved for curse words what thats why the lockdown i said then clarified mab closed the border with faerie until dawn molly was no dummy i could see the wheels turning as she figured it out shes giving you time to deal with it unmolested relatively unmolested i corrected her im starting to think that mab mainly helps those who help themselves okay once maeve gets to start moving pieces in and out of faerie in the morning things are going to get busy fast also i dont want to be working with the magical equivalent of a reactor core the next time hook and his band of minipsychos catch up with me so molly nodded so we go to the island first we go to the island now molly had the apartment buildings security call us a cab on the theory that it would be slightly less noticeable than the monster car now in the parking lot they took her orders as if she were some kind of visiting dignitary whatever shed done for the svartalves they had taken it very very seriously i left toot sleeping off the fight with some junk food left out where he would find it when he woke up bob was in a cloth messenger bag i had slung over one shoulder still buttoned up tight molly glanced at the bag then at me but she didnt ask any questions i felt like wincing molly hadnt ever exactly been shy about pushing the boundaries of my authority in our relationship as teacher and apprentice her time with my faerie godmother the leanansidhe mabs girl friday was starting to show lea had firm and unyielding opinions about boundaries people who pushed them got turned into dogsor something dogs ate the marina was one of several in the city lake michigan provided an ideal venue for all kinds of boating sailing and shipping and there was a nautical community firmly established all around the shores of the great lake im not really part of it i say wall instead of bulkhead and im not quite sure if port is left or if its something best left until after dinner i get the terms wrong a lot i dont care marinas are parking lots for boats lots of walkways were built on piers or were floating pontoon bridgestyle in long straight rows boats were parked in individual lots much like in any automobile parking lot most of the boats showed signs of being prepared for winternovember can be a dangerous time for pleasure boating on lake michigan and most people pack it in right around halloween windows and hatches were covered doors closed and there were very few lights on in the marina which was good because i was breaking and entering again id had a key to the marinas locks at one time but id lost track of it when i got shot drowned died got revived into a coma haunted my friends for a while and then woke up in mabs bed my life hells bells anyway i didnt have a key or any time to spare so when i got to the locked gate to the marina i abused my cool new superstrength and forced the chainlink gate open in a low squeal of bending metal it took me about three seconds cool molly murmured from behind me wait did you do the car too i grunted a little out of breath from the effort holy cow molly said youre like spiderman strong nah i panted spiderman can press ten tons i can do sets with four hundred kilos kilos molly said i inherited the last guys weight set i said its this fancy european thing not sure exactly how heavy that is in english in england they use kilos molly said wryly but it would also be around sixty or sixtyfive stone i stopped and looked at her she smiled sweetly at me i sighed and kept on walking out to the boat its called the water beetle it could be the stunt double for the boat of the crusty old fisherman in jaws except that it had been freshly painted and refinished and it looked a little too nice i stopped on the dock in front of it there id been standing right there looking out toward the parking lot when it happened my chest didnt actually feel a pang of agony but the memory of it was so sharp and clear that i might as well have reexperienced itit hadnt hurt at the time not until id been in the water for a while but it had been pure fire once mab and demonreach had succeeded in keeping my soul and body knit together and to think id had to call in a solid to get the guy to come shoot me it seemed like kind of a waste at this point id been sure that if i had managed to win the day thanks to my deal with mab that i would be a monster in need of a good putting down id scheduled my own assassin and molly had used her unique talents to help me forget that it was coming once the day had been safely saved the plan had been to circumvent the evolution of monsterharry by way of highpowered rifle except id survived next i guess came the monsterharry part i had it on good authority that it didnt have to end with me going all nutty and villainousassuming an archangel was trustworthy which i didnt i also had it on good authority that it would end like that anyway so at the end of the day i really didnt know what was going to happen to me in the future heh why should i be any different the water beetle was definitely not battened down for winter not yet she was a sturdy tough little craftnot fast but not afraid of much of anything nature would throw at her either her gangplank was down and batten and gangplank are about the only boat words im comfortable with i moved up it without hesitation even in the shadowy dimness of late night on the marina i was familiar with the boat id visited the island on it on multiple occasions i went aboard and up onto the roof of the wheelhouse where the drivers position was i flicked on a couple of tired old bulbs and checked the gauges fuel oil good she had more than enough for the trip out to the island and back the key wasnt in the ignitionit would be in the small safe down in the boats cabin but i knew the combination were good i called softly come on molly came up the gangplank while i went down into the cabin i got no warning whatsoever no sound no visible motion nothing one second i was going down the stairs and the next my face and chest were being crushed against the wall and something extremely sharp was pressing against my neck just beneath my right ear cool ironstrong fingers were spread over my whole head pressing it to the wall the message was clearif i struggled or made any sound something pointy would go into my brain i froze it seemed smart if my attacker wanted me dead i wouldnt still be able to reason that he could already have killed me hello precious murmured a mans very soft voice i think youre on the wrong boat i sagged suddenly in relief stars and stones i breathed thomas you scared the hell out of me the power of the cold fingers against my head did not falter in the slightest but there was a short stunned silence then the pressure against my skull became furious do you think this is funny my half brother said his voice becoming louder fairly boiling with anger do you think i am amused by this kind of prank thomas i said its me sure it is thomas snarled the pressure against me surging for a second harry dresden is dead i thought my eyeballs were trying to squeeze their way out of their sockets glurk now he growled im going to give you exactly three seconds to start telling me the truth or i swear to god they will never find enough pieces of you to identify the body he meant it hells bells he was furious if i were the kind of guy who ever got scared by anything ever which of course i am not i would have been feeling extremely nervous at that moment mab i ground out dammit thomas you lunatic it was mab mab sent you thomas demanded mab saved me i rasped hells bells man its me thomas growled lower but he didnt pancake my skull or stick something sharp and metal into my brain thomas was strongstronger than me a vampire of the white court can bring out that kind of strength only on special occasions but thomas was a very wellfed vampire i knew that if he wanted to do it winter knight steroids or no he could twist me like a congressmans logic molly he called out i know youre out there i can smell you a few seconds later there were soft steps on the gangplank and then the shadows moved at the door im here what the fuck is this he demanded im not sure molly said its dark but if i could see id tell you that i try not to put myself between two siblings when theyre fighting it never seems to help two or three flabbergasted seconds passed then the pressure against my skull was gone so fast that i all but fell over i grabbed myself before i could and shook my head ow nice to see you again too man he moved silently across the cabin and something clicked a batterypowered tap light came to life bringing a dim if adequate level of light to the compartment my brother was a hair shy of six feet tall he looked much as i remembered him dark glossy hair fell to his shoulders his skin was even paler than mine his eyes were stormcloud grey though they looked brighter than that now glinting with little metallic flecks that revealed his anxiety and anger he and i shared a similar scowl all dark brows and intense eyes and his mouth was twisted into a silent snarl as he stared at me he was wearing a pair of jeans and that was it the cabins bunk had been folded down and slept in id woken him when i came aboard in his right hand he held a metal tent stake there was both dirt and rust on it can you get gangrene in your brain oh molly said she stared at thomas for a moment oh um my oh i forgot to mention it my brother is the kind of man whom women stalk in cooperative packs id say he was model pretty except that as far as i could tell there werent any models as pretty as he was he had muscles that rippled even when he was motionless and relaxed and it was utterly unfair and i didnt do a lot of appraising myself in the mirror typically but i suddenly realized that sometime in the past few years thomas had stopped looking like my older brother he looked younger than me wizards can live a long time but we dont look youthful while we do it thomas was a vampire hed look this good until he stopped breathing the guy barely works out eats whatever he wants and gets to look that good and that young his whole life how is that fair you cant be my brother thomas said staring hard at me my brother is dead you know how i know thomas i began because my brother would have contacted me thomas snarled if he were alive he would have gotten in touch with me he would have let me know molly winced and looked away as though shed just heard a very loud and very unpleasant sound im not sensitive to the emotions of others the way molly is but i didnt need to be to know that thomas was boiling over in reaction to seeing me there im sorry harry molly said i cant it hurts go i said softly she nodded and withdrew onto the deck of the boat shutting the door behind her my brother stayed where he was staring at me all this time he said and not a word i was dead i said quietly or the nextbest thing to it maybe it was more like a coma hell i thought i was dead when did you wake up he asked his voice was carefully neutral about three months ago i said wasnt in good shape ive been recovering since then three months he said no phones there no actually i was in a cave on the island for a while then arctis tor no way for you to make contact he asked calmly you silence fell heavily thomas knew the kinds of things i could do if i want someone to get a message i can generally make sure it gets doneone way or another what do you want me to say man i responded i sold out thomas yeah when you hurt your back you told us for maggie to get her home safe right he was silent for a second then he said empty night why didnt i put that together he sighed let me guess you tried to kill yourself after she was home safe right i snorted through my nose something like that he shook his head in silence for several seconds then he took a deep breath looked up at me again and said you moron hey i said you idiot dammit thomas i said i havent lived my life the way i have to watch myself get turned into i broke off suddenly and looked away into what harry he asked say it i shook my head no you dont get a pass on this one little brother thomas said say it into a monster i snapped right thomas said a monster like me that isnt what i meant it is exactly what you meant he spat angry you arrogant he flung the tent spike in a fit of pure frustration it tumbled end over end once and sank two inches into a wooden beam you were going to be tempted eh going to have to deal with monstrous urges going to have to face the possibility that you might change if you lost focus for a minute lose control of yourself maybe hurt somebody you care about he shook his head cry me a fucking river man boofuckinghoo i couldnt look at him youd rather be dead than be like me he said thats one hell of a thing to say to your brother it wasnt about that i said it kind of was he snapped back dammit harry i cant go back and change it i said maybe i would if i could but its done im sorry but it is you should have talked to me he said thomas you should have trusted me he said dammit man the memory of those desperate hours hit me hard i felt so helpless my daughter had been taken away from her home and for all the times i had gone out on a limb for others no one had seemed willing to do the same for me the white council for whom i had fought a war had turned its back on me time had been running out and the life of a little girl who had never known her father was on the line why i asked him tiredly what would it have changed what could you possibly have said that would have made a difference that i was your brother harry he said that i loved you that i knew a few things about denying the dark parts of your nature and that we would get through it he put his elbows on his knees and rested his forehead on his hands that wed figure it out that you werent alone stab twist he was right it was just that simple my brother was right i had been selfinvolved and arrogant maybe it was understandable given the pressures on me at the time but that didnt mean that i hadnt made bad calls of colossal proportion i should have talked to him trusted him i hadnt even tried to consider anyone other than maggie hadnt even thought to start seeking support from my family id just moved right along to the part of the plan where i hired one of the worlds premier supernatural assassins to whack me that probably said something about the state of despair id been in at the time but it didnt say as much as i had about my brother he was right about that too it wasnt something i had ever consciously faced before but i had told thomas with my actions that it was better to be dead than a monstera monster like him and actions speak far more loudly than words i always thought it would get easier to be a person as i aged but it just gets more and more complicated im sorry i should have talked to you then i said my voice sounded hoarse i should have talked to you three months ago but i couldnt because i made the wrong call i didnt think i should contact anyone why not he asked looking up because i didnt deserve to do it i said quietly because i sold out because i was ashamed he came to his feet angry oh absolutely i get that i mean you had to stay away otherwise we all would have known that you arent perfect you gawking stupid arrogant egotistical he hit my chest and wrapped his arms around me so hard that i felt my ribs creaking clumsy shorttempered exasperating goofy useless i hugged my brother back and listened to a steady string of derogatory adjectives until he finished it asshole yeah i said i missed you too chapter fifteen thomas got us to the island navigating by the stars i kept checking the ships compass not because i didnt trust my brother but because i had no freaking idea how he managed to keep the water beetle on course without one molly had spent the first part of the trip down in the cabin wrapped up in some blankets it was a chilly night out on the lake thomas and i were comfortable in shirts i suspected my apprentice was still feeling the aftereffects of standing too close to my reunion with thomas i filled thomas in on recent events on the way out omitting only the details on the immortalkilling thing i had a sinking feeling that knowing something that important about beings that powerful was an excellent way to get yourself killed horribly on any night of the year that wasnt halloween yeah yeah yeah thomas said when i finished the briefing have you seen her yet i scowled seen who you tell me he said just you and molly i said he gave me a look of profound disappointment and shook his head thanks dad i said youre alive he said you owe it to her to go see her maybe when this is done i said you might be dead by then he said empty night harry didnt your little adventure in the lake teach you a damned thing i scowled some more like what like life is short he said like you dont know when its going to end like some things left unsaid cant ever be said he sighed im a freaking vampire man i rip out pieces of peoples souls and eat them and make them happy to have it happen i didnt say anything that was what my brother was he was more than that too but it would have been stupid to deny that part of him im mostly a monster he said and even i know that she deserves to hear you tell her you love her even if she never gets anything more than that i frowned wait who are we talking about here either he said stop being an idiot stop flagellating yourself about how you endanger her by being in her life youre the only you in her life harry believe me they dont make replacements for a guy like you they dont make replacements for anybody i said tiredly well see thomas looked at me like he wanted to push but he didnt so what about you i asked justine and her playmate keeping you company playmates thomas said absently plural totally not fair hmph i said he frowned hey how did you know about that ghost me was there the night justine decided shed had enough of you moping i said ghost you was there for how long exactly he asked i left before it got to an nc he snorted yeah well justine has sort of become a dietitian uh what he shrugged you are what you eat right same principle applies to vampires justine thinks im sad she brings home someone happy she thinks im too tense someone laidback and calm he pursed his lips really its been kind of nice balanced like his eyes narrowed and flickered through a few paler shades and i get to be with justine again even if it was hell that would make it worthwhile dude i said making the word a disgusted sound single guys everywhere hate you starting with me i know right he asked nodding and smiling then he looked ahead and pointed there see it i peered ahead into the black and found a giant block of more solid black we were at the island the cabin door opened and molly emerged the blanket still wrapped around her shoulders her face still looked drawn but not as pale as it had before we left the marina she came up the steps to the top of the wheelhouse and stood beside me thomas she asked why were you down at the boat tonight thomas blinked and looked at her what do you mean i mean why were you sleeping on board because you didnt tell me what time youd be there and i got sleepy he said molly glanced aside at thomas and then at me i asked you to do it uh yeah thomas said snorting you called around ten molly kept looking at me frowning no no i didnt thomas promptly cut the throttle on the boat the water beetle began coasting to a halt and the sound of the water hitting her hull resurfaced as the rattle of her engines died okay thomas said uh what the hell is going on then molly i said are you sure none of my issues have included memory loss or unconscious actions she said thomas squinted back at her if they had how would you know it molly frowned valid point but theres been no evidence of that to my knowledge im as confident about that as anything else i perceive so if molly didnt call me thomas began who did i finished water slapped against the hull what do we do molly asked if someone set us up to be here thomas said its a trap if its a trap they sure as hell didnt try very hard to hide it i said all we really know is that someone wanted us here molly nodded do you think mabs work i asked having my ride prepared yeah maybe if your new boss wanted you on the island wouldnt she just have told you to go there thomas asked seems like i said taking her orders is pretty much my job now molly snorted softly maybe ill grow into it i said you dont know thomas snorted softly more water sounds we didnt have a lot of choice really whether or not wed been manipulated into showing up there was still a giant potential problem with the island something that had to be addressed as soon as possible if i waited dawn would be upon us and it was entirely possible id be too busyor deadto fix the problem before it went boom which meant that the only time i had to take real action was right now just once i growled id like to save the goddamned day without a shot clock you know the monster business is an easier gig thomas said nodding way way easier which was my brothers backhanded way of telling me what he thought of me i think we all know im not smart enough for that i said eyes open everyone thomas pull her up to the dock lets see whos waiting for us the island had once been host to a small town back in the late nineteenth century it had been home to docks warehouses and what might have been a fishery or cannery or something probably no more than a couple of hundred people had lived there at most but the people werent there anymore and what was left of the town was like some kind of skeleton lying among the trees that had grown up through the floorboards i dont know what happened to the town stories from the time mention only mysterious events in the lake and an influx of new customers to what passed for a psychiatric care facility of the day the town itself had been expunged from any records and not even its name remained to be found the island likewise had vanished from the official recordthough if i had to guess i would say that the reigning authorities at the time decided that covering up the islands existence was the best way to protect people from exposure to it actually knowing what i know now id guess that the island made them come to that conclusion the island id named demonreach was very much alive most of the world is actually people think that civilization and organized religion have somehow erased the spirits that exist in nature in all the world they havent people arent the omnipotent force for destruction that we arrogantly believe we are we can change things true but we never really destroyed those old spirits and presences of the wild we arent that powerful we are very loud and very selfinvolved though so most people never really understand when theyre in the presence of a spirit of the land what the old romans called a genius loci so naturally they also didnt understand when they were in the presence of a truly powerful spirit of the landa potent spirit like that of say vesuvius or demonreach id been to the island on most weekends up until i got shot and thomas had often come with me wed used some fresh lumber some material salvaged from the ruined town and some pontoons made from plastic sheathing and old tractortire inner tubes to construct a floating walkway to serve as a dock anchored to the old pilings that had once supported a much larger structure upon completion i had dubbed it the whatsup dock and thomas had chucked me twenty feet out into the lake thus proving his utter lack of appreciation for referenceoriented humor and id thrown him forty feet out with magic once i got dry because come on hes my brother it was the only thing to do the water beetle came drifting slowly into the dock and bumped it gently you had to be a little bit nimble to get over the side of the boat and onto the floating dock but fortunately for me you didnt need to be a gymnast wed limned the outer boards of the floating dock in phosphorescent paint and in the darkness it was a gently glowing clearly visible outline i hit the dock and secured the first line on the ring wed installed then walked down the dock and caught the second when thomas threw it to me once the boat had been made fast thomas lowered the gangplank a pirates life for me and molly padded down it thomas came last buckling on his gun belt which was currently hung with his ridiculously huge desert eagle just in case we were attacked by a rabid cape buffalo and a big old bolostyle machete watching him put the weapons on i started to feel a little bit naked i didnt have any of my usual gear and id survived a bunch of nasty situations because id had it i rubbed my hands against the thighs of my jeans scowling and tried not to think of how the only gear i had now consisted of a messenger bag and a talking skull thomas noticed oh hey you need a piece man theyre just so fashionable i said he slipped back aboard and came out with a freaking relic he tossed it to me i caught it frowning it was a repeating rifle a winchester complete with the large rounded hoop handle on the lever action it was seriously heavy with an octagonal barrel walnut wood fixtures and shining brass housing elkhorn sights the gun had a certain comforting mass to it and i felt like even if it ran out of ammunition i would still be holding a seriously formidable club plus whatever it was chambered in a gun that heavy would hardly kick at all itd be more like handling a shotgun that pushed against your shoulder rather than trying to jar it off what am i i complained john wayne you arent that cool thomas said its quick easy to instinctshoot and good to way out past the effective range of a handgun lever action itll be reliable keep working right through the apocalypse which was a point in its favor the way my life had been lately rounds traditional fortyfive colt he said knock a big man down in one hit and keep him there catch he tossed me an ammo belt heavy with metallic shells that were nearly as big around as my thumb i slung the belt across my chest made sure the chamber was empty but with a shell ready to be levered into it and balanced the heavy gun up on one shoulder keeping one hand on the stock molly sighed boys thomas hooked a thumb back at the boat i got a machine gun you can have molly barbarian she said i dont rate a machine gun i asked no you dont thomas said because you cant shoot i just gave you that to make you feel better you ready i asked them molly had her little wands out one in each hand thomas swaggered down the gangplank and looked bored i nodded at them turned and took several quick steps off the dock and onto the stony soil of the island my link with the island was an extremely solid and powerful bondbut it existed only when i was actually standing on it now that i was knowledge flooded into me through me a wave of absolute information that should have inundated my senses and disoriented me entirely but it didnt that was the beauty of intellectus pure universal knowledge while i stood on the island i understood it in a way that was breathtakingly simple to experience and understand but practically impossible to explain properly knowledge of the island just flowed into me i could tell you how many trees stood upon it how many had been taken down by the summers storms seventynine and how many of the apple trees currently bore fruit twentytwo i didnt have to focus on an idea or wrest the knowledge from the island i just thought about it and knew the way i knew what my fingers were touching the way i knew what scents belonged to what foods we were alone on the island that much i knew but i could also sense a profound unease in the place mollys description had been perfectly accurate something was wrong some kind of horrible strain was upon the island a pressure so pervasive that the trees themselves had begun to lean away from the islands heart stretching their branches toward the waters of the lake without my heightened awareness of the island i never would have been able to sense the shift of inches across thousands and thousands of branches but it was real and it was there were clear i said theres no one else out here youre sure thomas asked im certain i said but ill stay alert if i sense anyone showing up ill fire off a shot wait thomas said where are you going up the hill i told him uh up to the tower i think alone you sure thats smart he asked molly was standing at the end of the dock she crouched down reaching a hand out toward the dirt of the island she brushed her fingers against it and then jerked them away with a shudder ugh yes we dont want to step off the dock not tonight i could hear thomass frown in his voice islands got its panties in a bunch eh i think something bad would happen to us if we tried to go with him molly said her voice troubled whatevers happening demonreach only wants harry to see whats going on why doesnt it just marry him thomas muttered under his breath it sort of did i said my brother the geosexual i snorted look think of it as a business partner and be glad its on our side it isnt on our side molly said quietly but i think it might be on yours same thing i said warningly out at the island in general you hear that theyre my guests be nice the thrumming tension in the island didnt change not in the least it went on with a kind of glacial inevitability that didnt give two shakes for the desires of one ephemeral little mortal wizard or not i got the feeling that nice simply wasnt in demonreachs vocabulary id probably have to be satisfied with it refraining from violence well talk i said to the island trying to make it a threat demonreach didnt care i muttered under my breath bounced the winchester on my shoulder and started walking walking on the island is an odd experience id say its like walking through your house in the dark except ive never known a house as well as i knew that island i knew where every stone lay where every branch stuck out in my path knew it without being warned by any senses at all walking in the dark was as easy as doing it in broad daylighteasier even id have had to pay at least a little attention to use my eyes but here every step was solid and every motion i made was minimal efficient and necessary i made my way through unbroken brush in the dark hardly making a sound never tripping once as i did i noted that molly had been right about another thing the clash of energies in the air had created enough dissonance to drive away most of the animals the ones that had the capacity to readily escape the deer were gone birds and raccoons were gone and so were the skunksthough that would be one hell of a long swim to the nearest stretch of lakeshore animals had been known to swim farther smaller mammals mice and squirrels and so on remained though they had crowded into the ten yards or so nearest the shoreline all around the island the snakes were having a field day with that and evidently werent bright enough to know that there was a bigger problem brewing i found the trail to the top of the hill the high point on the island and started up it there were irregular steps cut into the hillside to make the ascent easier they were treacherous if you didnt walk carefully or if you didnt have nearomniscience about the place at the top of the hill is a ruined lighthouse made of stone its basically just a chewedup silo shape now having collapsed long ago next to the ruined tower someone cobbled together a small cottage out of fallen stones when i first saw it it had been a square squat little building with no roof thomas and i had been planning on putting the roof back on so that i could overnight on the island someplace where i could build a fire and stay warm but we hadnt gotten that far yet when everything had gone sideways the cottage just sat empty and forlornbut a soft golden glow bathed the interior wall i could see from my position there was the scent of wood smoke on the air someone had built me a fire i made my way forward cautiously looking around with both my awareness and my eyes just in case my omniscience was in actuality nighomniscience but i couldnt sense any threat so i went into the cabin and looked around there was a fire in the fireplace and a folding table stacked with thick plastic boxes containing jars of food that would stay good for months at a time the boxes would resist the tampering of critters there were some camp implements stored in another box and i took the time to break out a metal coffeepot went out to the little old iron pump just outside the front door and filled it i tossed in a couple of handfuls of coffee grounds hung it on the swivel arm by the fireplace and nudged it over the fire then i broke out the skull and set him down on the table okay bob i said we have work to do you been listening yeah yeah bob said his eyelights flickering to life island go boom or something were on a mission to find out what its going to do and why and how we can stop it gosh id never have thought of that myself harry this is top secret stuff i said anything you learn here is for me and you only you go to someone else i want this whole evening locked away someplace nice and tight and dont go splitting off another personality on me like you did with evil bob entirely confidential check bob said and it would take a lot more than one night working with you to build up enough momentum to spin off a whole new me i have to actually learn things to make that happen less insult more analysis i said the beams from the skulls eye sockets grew brighter they swept left and right up and down panning around like prison searchlights bob made thoughtful noises i tended the coffeepot after it had been boiling for a few minutes i took it off the fire added a splash of cold water from the pump to settle the grounds and poured myself a cup i added a little powdered creamer and a bunch of sugar might as well drink syrup bob muttered says the guy with no taste buds i said i sipped been meaning to have you out here to take a look at the place anyway uhhuh bob said absently so i asked um bob said im still working on the surface layer of spells on the stones of this cottage harry i frowned uh what you know therere symbols there right i sipped coffee sure i said they kinda lit up when nauseating mindnumbing horror and pain flashed over my thoughts for a couple of seconds id used my wizards sight to look at the wrong being a couple of years ago and that isnt the kind of mistake you ever live down now the memory of seeing that things true being was locked into my noggin and it wouldnt go away or fade into the pastnot ever thats bad but the really bad part is that ive gotten used to it it just caused a stutter step in my speech the naagloshii tried to get inside it didnt seem to like them much i should fucking think not bob said his voice nervous um harry i dont know what these are i frowned at him uh what i dont know he repeated he sounded genuinely surprised i dont know what they are harry magic is like a lot of other disciplines that people have recently begun developing in historic terms working with magic is a way of understanding the universe and how it functions you can approach it from a lot of different angles applying a lot of different theories and mental models to it you can get to the same place through a lot of different lines of theory and reasoning kind of like really advanced mathematics theres no truly right or wrong way to get there eitherthere are just different ways some more or less useful than others for a given application and new vistas of thought theory and application open up on a pretty regular basis as the art develops and expands through the participation of multiple brilliant minds but that said once you have a good grounding in it you get a pretty solid idea of whats possible and what isnt no matter how much circumlocution you do with your formulae two plus two doesnt equal five except maybe very very rarely sometimes in extremely specific and highly unlikely circumstances magic isnt something that just makes things happen poof there are laws to how it behaves structure limitsand the whole reason bob was created was so that those limits could be explored tested and charted i could count on the fingers of no hands how many times bob had come up completely dry he always knew something the skull had been working with wizards for centuries hed run into damned near everything uh what i said seriously nothing theyre powerful he said i can tell you that much but theyre also complex i mean like molly on her best day could not come close to weaving together something this crazy you on your best day could not sling around enough power to juice up one of the smallest stones and thats just the first layer i think there are more maybe a lot more uh like hundreds on each stone yeah thats it isnt you cant put that much magic into that little space i protested no no i cant bob said and no you cant because its impossible but um someone doesnt care how did they do it if i knew that it wouldnt be impossible bob said an edge to his voice but i can tell you this much it predates wizardry as we know it i would have said what but i felt like id been saying that a lot already so i sipped coffee and scowled interrogatively instead this work the actual spells on the stone comes from before even the predecessors to the white council im conversant in the course and application of the art since the golden age of greece this stuff whatever it is its older you cant lay out spells that last that long i mumbled it isnt possible lot of that going around bob said harry youre were talking about a whole different level here one that i didnt even know existed uh do you get what that means in round terms at least i shook my head slowly well at least youre smart enough to know that bob said um okay you know the old chestnut about how sufficiently advanced science could be described only as magic right i said well im going to use the same model right now as a wizard youre pretty good at making wooden axles and stone wheels these spells theyre an internal combustion engine you do the math from there on your metaphorical abacus i guess i blew out a very long very slow breath hells bells i suddenly felt very young and very arrogant and not terribly bright i mean id known i was going to be out of my depth when i first hooked up with the island but i thought id at least be in the same freaking ocean instead i was i was in uncharted space wasnt i and the best part of this whole conversation those spells that had stymied one of the most advanced research tools known to wizardry and baffled the collected knowledge of centuries those were just the ruined part of the island what the hell was i going to find in the part that was working one second i was alone in the ruined cottage and the next there was a presence filling the doorway looking down at me through the empty space where the roof should have been it was huge maybe twelve feet tall and roughly humanoid in shape i couldnt see much of it it was covered in what looked like a heavy cloak that covered it completely two points of green fire burned from within the cloaks hood it simply stood unnaturally still staring down at me though the cool night breeze over the lake stirred the edges of its cloak demonreach the manifested spirit of the island uh i said hi the burning eyes shifted from me to bob on the table and then demonreach did something it had never done before it spoke out loud its voice was a rumble of heavy rocks scraping together of summer thunder rolling in from over the horizon the voice was huge not loud that didnt do it justice it just came from everywhere all at once the surface of my partly drunk coffee buzzed and vibrated at the allpervasive sound another one meep bob squeaked the lights vanished from the eye sockets of the skull i blinked a bunch of times you youre talking now necessity right i said um so youre having some trouble i guess trouble it said yes i came to help i said feeling extremely lame as i did um is that even possible potentially came the answer then the vast form turned it took a limping step the ground didnt so much tremble at the weight as shift slightly beneath the sheer overwhelming presence of the ancient spirit follow bring the memory spirit meep bob whimpered i grabbed the skull in shaking hands and stuffed it into the messenger bag i grabbed a chemical light from the storage boxes on the table snapped it and shook it to life as i hurried to catch up i had an instinct about where we were headed but i asked to be sure uh where are we going demonreach kept walking slow paces that nonetheless forced me to scurry to keep up below the spirit walked to the ruined circle of the lighthouse and lifted a shadowy arm in a vague gesture when it did the ground of the circle rippled and quivered and then what had appeared to be solid stone began to run down pouring itself into a hole like sand falling through an hourglass in seconds an opening the size of the trapdoor to my old lab had formed in the stone and stairs led down into the darkness oh i said id known there were caves beneath the island but not how i had gotten there or where i could find them wow whats the game plan here exactly the well is under attack came the surroundsound answer it must be defended demonreach started toward the stairs there was no way it should have fit down them but it moved as though that wasnt going to be an issue wait you want me to fight off something you cant stop i asked it is time for you to understand understand what our purpose warden it said follow me then it went down the stairs and vanished into the unknown here there be monsters bob whispered half hysterically run run already think its a little late for that i said but for a second there i thought about taking his advice some part of me wondered what tibet looked like this time of year for a minute it seemed like an awesome idea to go find out but only for a minute then i swallowed gripped the plastic glow stick in fingers that felt very slippery for some reason and followed demonreach down into the dark chapter sixteen i dont know how far down those stairs went im not even kidding im not taking poetic license the stairs went down twelve steps took a right angle and went down twelve more took another rightangled turn and went down twelve more and so on i stopped counting in the low two hundreds and resorted to my awareness of the island to feel out the rest of them duh seventeen hundred and twentyeighttwelve cubed the stairs were about eight inches each which meant eleven hundred feet and change straight down that was well below the water level of the lake hell it was below the bottom of the lake the staircase echoed with deep groaning sounds pitched almost too low to be heard in the wan light of the chemical glow stick the place took on a kind of amusementpark funhouse atmosphere where you suddenly realize that youve been routed into a circle with no apparent way out down down to goblin town you go my lad i sang in a hearty badly pitched baritone i was panting ho ho my lad demonreachs glowing eyes flicked toward me maybe irritated oh come on i said you never saw the rankinbass animated version of the hobbit the one they made before they did the movies in new zealand it didnt answer harry bob muttered at me stop trying to piss it off im bored i said and im not looking forward to coming back up i get that were going a long long way down but couldnt we use an elevator ooh or a firemans pole then itd be like going down to the batcave way more fun i raised my voice a little and more efficient maybe it was my imagination but when i said that last i thought i saw demonreachs steady pace slow for a thoughtful second or two nah hey how come you called me warden i asked i mean ive been a warden but there are a lot of other guys who are better at it than me im not exactly the poster child warden demonreach said now there are many first there was one i counted down the last ten steps out loud stopped at two and jumped over the last one to the floor beneath with both feet my hiking boots clomped on the stone we had reached a small chamber the floor and walls lined in the same stone used in the lighthouse and cottage i put a hand on them and could feel them quivering with power with the dissonance of conflicting energies actually looking back i saw that at some point the walls of the stairway and the stairs themselves had begun to be constructed of the same materialevery single stone of it invested with impossible amounts of power and skill uh i said question demonreach had stopped at a stone doorway shape in the wall it was surrounded with larger stones covered in intricate carving the burning eyes turned toward me um who made this place it didnt speak it pointed to the door i looked there was a sign in the middle of it a sigil it wasnt something i recognized as part of any set of runes that i knew but i knew id seen it somewhere before it took me several seconds of sorting through memories to run it downid seen it on the spine of a very very very old journal on my mentors bookshelf merlin i said quietly thats whose sign that is isnt it demonreach did not respond why say yes when silence will do i swallowed the original merlin was the real deal arthur and excalibur and everything merlin had according to legend created the white council of wizards from the chaos of the fall of the roman empire he plunged into the flames of the burning library of alexandria to save the most critical texts helped engineer the catholic church as a vessel to preserve knowledge and culture during europes dark ages and leapt tall cathedrals in a single bound there were endless stories about merlin popular theory among contemporary wizards was that they were more apocryphal than accurate hell id always figured it that way too but staring around at this place i suddenly felt less sure watch demonreach stretched out one long arm still shadowy and indistinct in the feeble light of my glow stick it touched one of the stones framing the door and the stone erupted into emerald light i hissed and shielded my eyes against it and took note of the fact that the air suddenly crackled with power demonreach touched a second stone which also began to glow when it did the sense of building energy was palpable in the air and the hairs on my arms began to stand up that was when i got what was happening here demonreach had wards around whatever was beyond the doormuch like the wards that had been put into position around butterss apartment only they had to be fueled with freaking mystic plutonium or something to generate this much ambient energy simply from being bypassed the giant spirit reached for another stone but paused before touching it remember the stones they were like a security keypad demonreach was giving me the combination to its security system and given how much dangerous energy was in the air right now it stood to reason that if i ever got the combination wrong well youd need a bloodhound a ouija board a forensic anthropologist and a small army of little folk to find what was left of me i took careful note of which stones the spirit had indicated really careful note demonreach touched the last stone and the granite doorway in front of us didnt move exactlyit simply stopped being there the leashed violence in the air that angry watchful energy dwindled and vanished and demonreach moved forward through the doorway i followed we emerged into a familiar cavern and once again my chest lit up with phantom remembered pain it was surprisingly well lit for a subterranean chamber when id last been there i hadnt been in any shape to go over the details but i could now see that several glimmering clusters of crystal in the floor some kind of pale green quartz maybe gave off a dim glow no single patch of them really provided adequate illumination but as a whole they filled most of the cavern with wan greenwhite light roots burrowed down into the cavern through its ceiling though i had no idea how in the hell theyd gotten there no plant sent roots down as deep beneath the surface as this chamber no normal earthly plant did anyway water dripped slowly down from above and where it fell from the ceiling was where the patches of crystal lay over to one side of the chamber was a hollowedout section of soft earth no deeper than a very shallow bathtub about seven feet long i recognized it even without seeing the withered vines that lay strewn forgotten all around the area it was my sickbed where my body had lain for months while mab and demonreach exerted themselves to keep the pumps working while my mind and spirit were doing a casper impersonation my chest panged again and i looked away waking up from that particular nap had been one of the top two or three most painful moments of my life something inside me had changed not because of the pain of the experiencethough that had been profound staring at that place i felt as if the pain had been a side effect of a deeper and more significant shift in the way i thought of myself saw myself and how i should interact with my world fire isnt always an element of destruction classical alchemical doctrine teaches that it also has dominion over another province change the fire of my tribulations had not simply been pain to be endured it had been an agent of transformation after all that id been through id changed not for the worse i was pretty sureat least not yet but only a moron or a freaking lunatic could have faced the things i had and remained unfazed by them i blinked myself out of my reverie to find demonreach watching me there was something intense about its eyes memory it said reflection i frowned what do you mean this place i pondered that one for a minute are you saying that i just went into an internal monologue because i came in here demonreach did not seem to feel a need to clarify memory reflection i sighed well if i ever need to mull things over i know just where to go i guess it was chilly in the cavern and damp and the air was thick with musty earthy smells i turned a slow circle surveying the entire chamber what do you call this place demonreach said nothing and did not move right i said you dont call it anything at all i guess i scrunched up my nose thinking what is this chambers purpose containment i frowned uh of what the least the least what i asked feeling exasperated demonreach just watched me uh harry bob said in a small voice maybe you should look at the crystals i glanced down at the skull shrugged and walked over to the nearest formation i stood over it for a moment it was a large clump maybe twelve feet long and four or five across and and the shadows passing through the translucent crystals seemed to indicate that the floor beneath it had been hollowed out much the same as my own recovery bed in fact i frowned leaning closer there was a form beneath the crystals an outline the image of whatever it was got to me only after being refracted through multiple crystals so it was awfully blurry but i peered at it trying to unfocus my eyes and look past it the way you do those magic paintings at the mall the image suddenly snapped into disjointed clarity the form beneath the crystal was a lean creature of basically human shape maybe nine or ten feet tall and lithe covered in shaggy hair of golden brown its arms were too long for its body its hands were too big for its arms its fingers were too long for its hands and were tipped with vicious claws and its yellowgold eyes were open aware staring at me in naked undisguised hatred fuck me i shouted staggering back in pure panicked reflex thats a naagloshii thats a fucking naagloshii naagloshii were bad news serious bad news originally divine messengers of the dines holy people they had turned their backs on their origins and become the legendary skinwalkers of the american southwest i went up against one of them once it killed one of my friends tortured my brother halfcrazy and left me with permanent psychic scars before beating the everloving snot out of me the only reason i had survived was that the wizard who was the greatest shapeshifter id ever seen had intervened listenstowind had taken on the naagloshii headtohead even then it had been close and the naagloshii had escaped to fight another day ive run into cruel and dangerous beings before but the naagloshii were quite simply among the most evil creatures it had ever been my displeasure to encounter and one of the damned things was staring at me from beneath a fragile layer of quartz i could have smashed with a wrench its eyes burning like it was going to eat me whole i got a sudden sinking feeling and i turned to the next mound of quartz and the next im a lucky guy i didnt have one of the most nightmarish fiends in circulation lying on the floor within pouncing distance i had six of them there were more shapes beneath more crystal mounds i didnt recognize them im pretty sure i was extremely happy that i didnt the least i said my voice shaking youre telling me that a naagloshii is one of the least i felt like sitting down so i did sort of abruptly onto the floor what what else is in here demonreach turned to a wall it lifted an arm and the stone of the wall faded into nonexistence revealing a hallway maybe fifty feet across i got back up onto my shaky legs again to take a look the tunnel sloped down gently and was lit by the wan glow of the crystals lots of crystals lots and lots and lots of crystals the tunnel stretched into the distance maybe it was a mile long maybe two maybe it ran all the way down to hell mounds of crystals dotted the tunnel at regular intervals some of them were the size of buildings some of the individual crystals had to be the size of freaking trees i had barely gotten my gawk on when a flood of energy smashed into me as though opening the door had released liquid held back under pressure the energy had no physical presencebut i felt a nauseating wave of greasy cold flooding through me the dark power of the ley lines that converged upon the island breathing across me like a cloud of invisible smog the well demonreach said the spirit turned slowly and eleven more doorways to tunnels almost identical to the first one sighed into existence eleven more of them because one infinite tunnel full of horrors obviously wasnt enough i had twelve the dark energy from them hissed and oozed through the air as if sheer malice and vicious will had been distilled into an unseen mist and and everything down there makes a naagloshii look like small change i asked correct of course naturally i said staring down the first hall what are they whats down there nightmares dark gods nameless things immortals holy crap i whispered and that was when i understood why the place was called the well this is why the island is the source of all those ley lines its like a great big bubbling geyser of bad bob let out an awed whistle uh wow boss yeah thats exactly it the energy in those ley lines its the body heat these things give off i felt a giggle coming up man containment hells bells containment i tried to stuff the giggles back down and addressed demonreach this isnt a magical stronghold i said its a prison its a prison so hard that half a dozen freaking naagloshii are in minimum security correct demonreach answered warden chapter seventeen i dont guess this job pays anything does it i asked the spirit just regarded me didnt think so i said so when you call me warden youre speaking literally indeed and you are what the guard the guard the walls the bars i am order you are not the first lawperson i would want to be involved with i said i raked my fingers back through my hair okay i said wincing the things in here are they dangerous where they are they are always dangerous but they have the least opportunity to express it here i blinked those were some of the longest most nuanced and most complex sentiments the spirit had expressed to me which meant that we were speaking about something importantwhich only made sense demonreach didnt care about friends or enemies or the price of tea in china it cared about its inmates period anything else everything else would be judged based upon its relevance to that subject but can they get loose not without outside intervention demonreach said or your authorization meep i breathed uh you mean i could turn these things loose you are the warden i swallowed is it possible for me to communicate with them you are the warden oh hells bells this is bad i had just inherited myself a world of trouble having experienced a naagloshii up close and personal there wasnt any way i was letting one of those hideous things loose i doubted i was going to like anything else that was being held prisoner here any better in fact i had no intention for the time being of even looking at them much less finding out who and what the inmates wereand forget about actually talking to them not going to happen things that old and powerful could be deadly with only a few carefully chosen words dropped at the right placeand id learned that one the hard way too but none of that really mattered id just been handed what amounted to a great big ugly weapon of mass destruction and potential havoc to the various powers of the supernatural world it wouldnt matter that i would never use it all that would matter was that i had it to use really officer i know thats a rocket launcher in my trunk but im only holding it so that someone bad wont use it really honest the guys in the white council who didnt like me were going to turn purple and start frothing at the mouth when they found out and every foe the white council ever had would start looking at me like a gift from heavensomeone with knowledge of the inner workings of the council with enormously concentrated personal power who was almost certain to frighten the council enough to make them suspect isolate and eventually move against him that guy would be an awesome asset in any struggle against the wizards of the world and boy wouldnt the white council know it like i didnt have enough recruiters aiming for me already and hey the very best part i didnt actually have a real usable superweapon i just had the key to a great big box full of pain and trouble for a whole lot of people no wonder my grandfather had looked stunned when hed seen what i had done with demonreach or maybe less stunned than horrified my head was starting to ache again dammit this was all i needed over the past few years my headaches had grown steadily worse to the point where sometimes they all but knocked me unconscious i could function through it to some degreeyou dont spend most of your life learning to manipulate the powers of the universe without racking up a considerable amount of selfdiscipline and tolerance for pain but it was just one more freaking stone being added to the baggage i had to carry while i tried to get out of the tightest corner i had ever been in demonreach growled in all capital letters and the headache vanished one second my scalp was tightening up as two separate ice picks dug into my skull in the same places they always did and the next the pain was utterly gone the endorphins my body had started pumping got to the scene to find no pain there and threw a party instead i didnt fall over in a dazed stupor because of my universemanipulating chops but it was close whoa i breathed uh what did you just do i warned it i blinked several times you warned away my headache the creature causing it the parasite i stared stupidly for a second and then sorted through my memories again thats right right here in this chamber the last time id been here either mab or demonreach had said something about the division of labor keeping my body alive while the rest of me was elsewhere theyd said that the parasite kept my heart running i glowered at demonreach and said tell me about this parasite i will not i made an exasperated sound why not it bargained with what your life warden i thought about that one for a few seconds wait you needed its help to save me and its price was that you dont tell me about it indeed i exhaled slowly and ran my fingers over my head something was running around in there giving me migraines is it a danger to me in time what happens if it stays in there i asked it bursts forth from your skull aglck i said i couldnt help it my skin was crawling id seen those alien movies at a formative age how do i get it out demonreach seemed to consider that for a moment then it said ask grasshopper molly uh seriously you know shes new right it just looked at me how long do i have to take care of it i asked soon soon how soon is soon what do you mean soon it just stared at me right immortal inhuman whollyfocusedonholdingevilhordestillforever sorts of creatures dont have a real solid grasp of the concept of time from what ive seen and heard over the years ive begun to understand that linear time is a uniquely mortal perspective other things arent attached to it nearly as tightly as we are there were bushes on the island older than me there were trees there older than chicago demonreach was not compatible with stopwatches or day planners okay i said okay priorities put the skullburstingparasite issue aside for the moment that leaves me in charge of a veritable doomsday machine that the white council and everyone else is gonna flip out about but they arent going to flip out about it today because presumably they dont even know im alive yet and if i dont stay focused on the next twentyfour hours i might not live long enough to have all that fun so we forget about that for now too sensible priorities im glad you approve i said i was pretty sure something that didnt understand minutes and seconds wouldnt be big on getting sarcasm either youve still got a problem i need you to explain it to me you are too limited demonreach said it would damage you as it damaged your spirit i held up both my hands and half flinched for gods sake dont think it at me you think way too loud the glowing eyes looked somehow disgusted this means of conveyance of ideas is inefficient and limited words words words i said tell me about it but its what weve got unless you can draw me a picture demonreach was still for a momentand then vines abruptly twined up out of the floor i almost jumped but stopped myself it clearly hadnt done me any harm apart from what id done to myself and if it wanted to hurt me i wasnt going to be able to stop it anyway so i waited the vines twined up into my bag and came out wrapped around bobs skull harry bob squeaked hes one of mine i said in a hard voice you hurt him and you can forget me helping you little entity demonreach said you are familiar with the warden you will translate you will not be damaged hey i said and took a step between demonreach and bob did you hear me hopalong put down the skull harry bob said again harry wait it heard you i scowled and turned to look at bob he looked like the same old bob yeah yeah the skull said the eyelights were flicking everywhere as if watching dozens of screens at once man this thing is big and old is it hurting you uh no no it isnt and it could if it wanted to its just kind of a lot to take in then the skull quivered in the grip of the tendrils and said oh oh what i asked its explaining the problem bob reported it had to take it through several levels of dumbingdown before i was able to get it i grunted and relaxed a little oh so whats the problem hang on im trying to figure out how to dumb it down enough for you to get it thanks i growled i got your back boss then bob bounced up and down in the tendrils a few times hey hopalong turn this thing around this way demonreach glowered at the skull bob jiggled a little more come on were on a schedule here i blinked at that damn you went from scared to wiseass pretty quick there bob bob snorted cause as big and bad as this thing is it needs me to talk to you and that makes me important and it knows it lesser beings once knew to respect their elders demonreach said i respect the crap out of you bob complained you want me to help and im telling you how now turn me around a sudden breeze passed through the cavern in a long enormous sigh and the vines stirred and twisted the skull toward the nearest wall bobs eyelights brightened to brilliance and suddenly cast double cones of light on the wall there was a scratchy sound that seemed to emanate from the skull itself a blur of a sound like an old film sound track warming up and then the old spotlightsweeping th century fox logo appeared on the wall along with the pompous trumpetled symphony theme that often accompanied it a movie i asked you can play movies and music and tv butters gave me the internet baby now hush and pay attention the opening logo bit faded to black and then familiar blue lettering appeared it read a long time ago pretty much right here okay come on i said youre going to buy me a lawsuit bob hush harry or youll go to the special hell i blinked at that confused im not supposed to be the guy who doesnt get the reference joke dammit on the wall the black gave way to a star field that panned down to a blueandgreen planet earth then it zoomed in and in and in until i recognized the outline of lake michigan and the other great lakes and came closer still until it got to the outline of the island itself bob is invaluable but man he loves his wisecracks and his drama the image sank down until it showed a familiar landing point though it had no ruined town and no whatsup dock and no row of wooden piles in the water it was just a little beach of dirt and sand and heavy brooding forest growth then a ribbon of light maybe eight feet long split the air vertically the light broadened until it was maybe three feet wide and then a figure appeared through it i recognized the signssomeone had opened a way a passage from the nevernever to the island the figure emerged made a gesture with one hand and the way closed behind it it was a man fairly tall fairly lean he wore ragged clothing in many shades of grey his grey cloak had a deep hood on it and it shadowed his features except for the tip of his nose and a short greywhite beard covering a rather pointy chin letters appeared at the bottom of the screen they read merlin wait you saw merlin i asked bob nah bob said but i cast alec guinness looks good right i sighed could you get to the point please oh come on bob said i wrote in this romance triangle subplot and cast jenna jameson and carrie fisher theres a love scene youre gonna really bob okay okay fine sheesh the movie shifted into fast motion the greyclad figure became a blur it walked about waving its arms and directed oceans of energy here and there settling them all in and around the substance of the island itself wait did demonreach tell you how he did that no bob said annoyed its called artistic license harry okay i get it merlin built the island however he did it get to the part with the problem bob sighed merlin walked into the woods in comically fast motion and vanished then time passed the sun streaked by hundreds and then thousands of times the shadows of the island bowing and twisting the trees rising growing growing old and dying at the bottom of the screen words appeared that read a lot of time passes thank you for dumbing that down for me i said de nada then the camera slowed again merlin appeared again oceans of power rose up and settled into the island then merlin vanished and more years passed maybe a minute later he appeared againlooking exactly the same i might addand repeated the cycle hold on i said he did it again twice ah bob said as a fourth cycle began on the screen sort of see harry this is one of those things that youre going to have trouble grabbing onto go slow and try me merlin didnt build the prison five times bob said he built it once in five different times all at the same time i felt my brows knit uh he was in the same place doing the same thing in five different times at once exactly that does not make any sense i said look a mortal jail is built in three dimensions right merlin built this one in four and probably in several more though you cant really tell whether or not he built it in a given dimension until you go there and measure it and the act of measuring it will change it but the point is this is really advanced stuff i sighed yeah im getting that but whats wrong the shot zoomed out rising up to give a topdown view of the island which became a blurry shape a familiar fivepointed star blazed itself across the surface of the lake its lines so long that the pentagon shape at its center enfolded the island entirely within the pentagon a second pentacle formed like the first one drawn in the manner to preserve and protect the camera tightened in and i saw that the second pentagon enfolded the entire hilltop where the cottage and ruined tower lay the camera tightened more and i saw more pentacles drawn this time not flat but at dozens of intersecting angles their centers encircling the dozen tunnels full of evil beings beneath the island these bob said represent the original enchantments on the island this is vastly simplified of course but the basic starandcircle architecture is the same as the work you do harry then the design blurred and increased growing denser and more delicate and more brilliant in power until something twinged in my brain and i had to look away from the diagram yeah sorry about that boss this is meant to represent the entanglement of the spells being delivered at different times no wonder it was so complicated i muttered and its even worse than this bob said im filtering it down for you and heres the problem i forced myself to look back at the projection and saw those millions upon millions of spells resonating with one another spreading and interlocking into an impenetrable barrier it was i thought somehow like watching crystals grow the spells powering the actual construction of it hadnt been alone too much stronger than some of the work i had donebut when theyd been interconnected with their counterparts across time theyd fed upon one another created a perfect resonance of energy that had become something infinitely greater than the sum of its parts then i saw the dissonance appear bob had chosen to show it as a sullen red light that began to pulse lightly at the westernmost edges of the great design it began as something faint but then like an oncoming headache started to throb into something larger and more noticeable where scarlet and blue light touched there were ugly flares of energyflares that i had been sensing ever since id gotten to the island before long that scarlet pulse had spread to half the island and then abruptly the screen went white text at the bottom read november by tomorrow i said super but i still dont see what is wrong bob energy hits it bob said a directed burst of energy a whole lot of it it unravels the whole containment spell merlin laid down and triggers the failsafe fire rumbled demonreach i figured that one out thanks i said but nothing has actually happened to the spells yet nope said bob that tension thats building its well think of it as cause and effect only backward huh what the island is experiencing now is the echo of the moment that burst of energy strikes it bob said only instead of the echo happening after its happening first i stopped and thought youre telling me that the reason the island is about to blow up is because its about to blow up bob sighed someone hits the island with energy harry but theyve figured out how merlin put this place together they arent attacking it in three dimensions theyre attacking in four theyre sending power through time as well as through space so i have to stop them from attacking the island tomorrow no bob said exasperated you have to stop them from attacking whenever it is that they actually attack uh look the rock theyre throwing hits tomorrow bob said but you have to stop them from throwing it at whatever point theyre standing when they throw it oh i said blinking i get that bob turned to look at demonreach do you see what i have to work with here i had to take that down to throwing a rock before it got through his understanding is limited demonreach agreed okay ive had just about enough from both of you i said if youre so smart how come you dont stop it from happening the explanation would damage you warden bob made an impatient sound because that spirit is the island harry the spells the well the physical island all of it demonreach does not exist outside this island it has no ability to reach beyond itself the attack is coming from outside the prison thats why it needs a warden in the first place i scowled it talked to me in the graveyard last year it bullied mab into helping it bob said i did not bully i bargained okay okay i said ill add that to my list then find whoever it is wherever they are and stop them from doing something they havent done yet unless they have bob said in which case well kinda too late right i said tiredly i had my own private purgatory full of sleeping monsters i had a parasite in my brain that was fixing to burst my skull on its way out of me my little island paradise was about to explode with enough energy to cook dark gods and lord only knew what else hanging around under the island that meant we were talking about a release of energy in the gigaton range and if i didnt stop someone from doing it the continental shelf was about to have a very bad day oh right and i was supposed to kill an insane immortalor else face the wrath of her mother and i had to do it all in the next twentyfour hours maybe a little less and the sad part is this actually feels like having my life back how bent is that harry bob said sunrise in one hour right i sighed and picked up the skull i tucked him away into the messenger bag and said to demonreach im on it good i muttered darkly under my breath and turned for the stairs then started jogging back up them thinking of all the problems arrayed against me good thing id been working out chapter eighteen okay for the record that is one hell of a lot of stairs to go up also for the record i did them two and three at a time at a run and went to the top without stopping from there i went pounding down the hillside my feet never slipping or faltering until i got back to the beach moving at an easy run the sun was rising behind me but the solid mass of demonreach kept it blotted out in shadow and i could tell only by the light beginning to fill the sky thomas came to his feet as i left the woods his hands moving to his weapons automatically i shook my head at him never slowing down and said lets get this tub moving what did you find out he called he started untying the lines and then leapt nimbly up to the deck of the water beetle molly appeared from the cabin looking as though shed been sleeping a few seconds before i ran down the dock and hopped up to the ships deck a bunch of people are gonna be mad at me ive got some kind of medical issue thats going to kill me in a while if i dont deal with it oh and the islands blowing up tomorrow and taking a whole lot of the country with it if i dont fix it thomas gave me a steady look so he said same old same old i think its nice that there are some things in this world you can rely on i said my brother snorted and started the water beetles engines we backed away from the dock and then he turned gunned it and headed back toward town like i said before the boat isnt a racing machine but its got some horsepower in it and as the sun rose properly we were zooming over the orangegold water leaving a huge vshaped wake behind us while i stood at the front of the boat my hands on the railing i felt it when the dawn broke the way you almost always can if you stop to pay attention something subtle and profound simply shifted in the air around me even if id been blindfolded i would have felt the transition the way that the winds and currents of energy broadly known as magic began to gust and shift driven by the light of the oncoming sun i wasnt close enough to any of the ways to the realms of faerie to be able to sense whether they had been reopened but it made sense that they would be sunrise tends to disperse and dissolve patterns of magical energynot because magic is inherently a force of the night so much as because the dawn is inherently a force of new beginnings and renewal every sunrise tended to erode ongoing enchantments a spell spread so wide that it curtained the whole of faerie away from the mortal world would by necessity be rather thin and fragile when the sun hit it it would be like about a zillion magnifying glasses focusing light on old newsprint it would blacken and wither away my mind treated me to a gruesome little collage of imagesthe darkest beings of faerie suddenly pouring forth from every creepy shadow and unsettling alley and dangerouslooking old abandoned building in the city youd think my mind would find better things to do like fantasize about improbably friendly women or something molly came up and stood with me facing ahead i looked at her obliquely the rising sun behind us painted her hair gold but left her face lightly veiled in shadow she didnt look young anymore i mean dont get me wrong it wasnt like her hair had gone grey and her teeth fell out but there had always been a sense of energy and life and simple joy welling up from the grasshopper it had been her default setting and i hadnt realized how much i had loved that about her now her blue eyes looked weary wary she wasnt looking at the beauty in life as much as she once had her eyes scanned for dangers both nearby and farther down the road heavy with caution and made wise by painand they had far far more steel in them than i had ever seen there before months of training with the leanansidhe while fighting a street war will do that maybe if id been tougher on the grasshopper early on it wouldnt have come as such a shock to her maybe if id focused on different aspects of her training she would have been better prepared maybe maybe maybe but i was kidding myself mollys eyes were always going to end up like that sooner or laterjust like mine had this business doesnt play nice with children i told you molly said never looking toward me its in the past leave it there you listening to my head kiddo her mouth twitched only when i want to hear the roar of the ocean i grinned i liked that so much better than all the sir knights id been getting lately how much can you tell me she asked i looked at her eyes for a moment while she stared ahead and made a decision everything i said quietly but not right this second weve got priorities to focus on first we can get into the details after weve dealt with the immediate threat maeve molly asked and the island i told her about the danger to demonreach without going into specifics about the islands purpose so if i dont stop it boom molly frowned i cant imagine how you can stop an event from happening if you dont know who is going to do it and both where and when its going to happen if the problem was simple and easy it wouldnt require wizards to fix it i said the impossible we do immediately the unimaginable takes a little while im serious she said so am i i replied be of good cheer i think i know the right guy to talk to about this one half the sun was over the horizon when chicagos skyline came into sight i just basked in that for a minute yeah i know stupid but its my town and id been gone for what felt like a lifetime it was good to see the autumn sun gleaming off of glass and steel then i felt myself tense and i pushed myself up from where id been leaning on the forward rail i took a moment to look around me very carefully i didnt know what had set off my instincts but they were doing the same routine theyd learned to do every time mab had been about to spring her daily assassination attempt and i couldnt have ignored them if id wanted to i didnt see anything but then i heard itthe humming roar of small highrevolution engines thomas i shouted over the snorting of the water beetles motor i gestured toward my ear and then spun my hand in a wide circle it wasnt exactly tactical sign language but thomas got the message from his vantage point in the wheelhouse atop the cabin he swept his gaze around warily then his gaze locked on something northwest of us uhoh i breathed thomas spun the wheel and rolled the water beetle onto a southwesterly course i hustled over to the ladder up to the wheelhouse and stood on the top rung which put my head about level with thomass i shielded my eyes from the glare of the oncoming sun with one hand and peered northwest there were five jet skis flying toward us over the water thomas had altered course enough to buy us a little time but i could see at a glance that the jet skis were moving considerably faster than we were thomas opened the throttle all the way and passed me i kid you not a shiny brass telescope seriously i asked him ever since those pirate movies came out theyre everywhere he said ive got a sextant too any tent you have is a sex tent i muttered darkly extending the telescope thomas smirked i peered through the thing holding myself steady with one hand given the speed and bounce of the boat it wasnt easy but i finally managed to get a prolonged glimpse of the jet skis i couldnt see much in the way of detail yetbut the guy on the lead jet ski was wearing a bright red beret weve definitely got a problem i said friends of yours the redcap and some of his sidhe buddies it looks like i said lowering the telescope theyre winter muscle but i think theyre mostly medieval types that gives us a couple of minutes to there was a sharp hissing sound and something unseen slapped the telescope out of my hand sending it spinning through the air in a whirl of torn metal and tiny shards of broken glass the report of a gunshot followed a second later holy crap i sputtered and dropped down to lie flat on the deck there was another hiss and a loud cracking sound as a round smacked into the wall of the cabin above me medieval are you sure you know what that means thomas demanded he heeled the boat about a bit and then snaked it back in the original direction following a serpentine course that would make us a harder targetbut it also meant that we were going slower cruising in a zigzag while our pursuers were rushing forward in a straight line but even with the maneuvers the rounds kept coming in at that distance with the relative movements of the vehicles a purely human marksman could have hit us only through something that went well past good luck and began approaching divine intervention but the redcap and his cronies werent human the grace id seen the sidhe displaying on the dance floor had been all precise subtle elegance and flawless grace both of those things transitioned well into marksmanship i still had my shiny gleaming cowboy rifle but it was worse than useless in this situation the colt round would be killer at conventional gunfight distances most of which happened at about twenty feetbut it would lose a lot of effectiveness shooting at targets that distant coincidentally the guy holding the gun would also lose effectiveness shooting at targets that distant so blazing away at them seemed like a stupid plan hey i shouted toward my brother if i take the wheel can you pick them off from here if we drive straight maybe he called back a round tore a chunk of wood off the corner of the boats dashboard thomas stared hard at it for a second six inches to the left and it would have hit him in the lower back uh he said continuing to veer and swerve the boat plan b right i muttered right plan b i thought furiously while the fusillade continued rounds hit the side of the ship in sharp angry whacks surely they didnt have the ammunition to keep this kind of thing up for very long though thinking about it i had no idea how rapidly they were going through the ammo for all i knew one guy was shooting at us and getting more and more successful at judging the shot over the surface of the water and the sidhe were closing their accuracy seemed to be increasing as they did once they got into optimal range where they were close enough to land rounds but we werent capable of replying in kind all they had to do was maintain the distance and kill us to death i could start throwing magic at them but mabs training had a gap in it everything had been right up in my grille id never engaged her or one of her proxies at more than twenty feet or so and without a properly prepared staff or blasting rod id never be able to reach out far enough to hit those clowns odds were good that they knew it too theyd hold the distance a weakness i had to exploit a weakness the sidhe hated iron but even if i found some how did i get it to them i mean a gun shooting jacketed rounds would really screw them up but for it to work id have to hit them there was a box of nails in the toolbox i could throw those maybe but again there was the issue of actually hitting them which wasnt going to happen as long as they were way out there i needed to lure them in closer grasshopper i shouted the cabin door swung open and molly bellycrawled onto the deck until she could see me who started shooting at us bad guys i cringed as another round hit the side of the boat and peppered me with wooden splinters obviously can we outrun them not happening i said ideas i could veil us going to be hard to hide the boats wake isnt it oh right what do we do i need mist i said a bunch of it gimme oh ow i dont know harry id have to move an awful lot of fire to give you even a little you know thats not my thing it doesnt have to be real mist i said oh molly called that is exactly my thing attagirl fuck thomas snarled i looked up to see him stagger holding on to the boats wheel with his right hand his face twisted in pain hed taken a bullet in his left arm just above the elbow and he held it clenched in tight against his body teeth bared slightly too pale blood trickled down his elbow and dribbled to the deck plan b harry where the hell is plan b go go go i told molly my apprentice closed her eyes and clenched her fists i saw her focus felt the slight stirring in the air as she gathered her will and power then she moved her hands in a complicated little gesture whispering something she continued making the gesture and i realized that the motion was duplicating that of weaving three lines into a braid from between her fingers a thick white mist began to appear first it came as a trickle but as i watched it thickened to a stream then molly bowed her head in concentration and muttered words beneath her breath and a sudden plume of white mist bigger than the water beetle itself began jetting from her hands and spreading out to blanket the surface of the water over the boats wake shutting the pursuing sidhe away from view for a long minute we raced across the water a wall of white mist spreading out to cover our wake the enemy fire continued for a few seconds but then dropped off to nothing hell if we could keep this up maybe we could make it back to shore without doing anything more i checked molly her face was pale twisted into a grimace of concentration and already the plume of illusory mist was beginning to wane mist isnt a hard illusion to pull off and its usually the first thing an apprentice learns to do with that kind of magic but molly was spreading the illusion out over an enormous area and bruteforce approaches were not her strong point in magic we wouldnt make it back to shore that way fine then thomas i shouted throttle down let them catch up to us and then gun it thomas slowed the boat abruptly and the sound of screaming jet ski engines rose up over the water beetles motor growing higherpitched as they approached molly drop it on my signal kay she gasped my brother stood at the wheel with his eyes closed focused intently on the sound then abruptly he gunned the water beetles engines again molly now molly let out a groan and the illusionary cloud of white mist vanished as if it had never existed the formation of oncoming jet skis was only about fifty yards away charging hard after us over the water and they were moving so much more swiftly than us that within seconds they were almost on top of the water beetle jet skis started swerving left and right to avoid a collision with our boat all except for the redcap he was guiding the jet ski with one hand and held a military carbine in the other his eyes widened as the vehicle rushed closer but rather than swerving to one side he broke out into a wild smile swung the gun around to point toward me and accelerated before he could shoot i unleashed my gathered will into a burst of completely unfocused magical energy shouting hexus i think i mentioned before how technology doesnt get along with wizards put any kind of intricate machine in a wizards presence and suddenly everything that might go wrong with the machine does go wrong and thats when were not even trying to make it happen electronics generally get hit the hardest like poor butterss computers but that particular law of magical forces is good across the spectrum jet skis especially the brandnew ones are intricate machines they focus tremendous power and energy into a tiny space and their systems are regulated by little computers and so on theyre a gathering of tiny nearly continuous explosions in a box moving water under intense pressureand a world of things can go wrong with them the redcaps jet ski suffered an abrupt catastrophic engine failure there was a hideous sound of tearing metal a flash of flame and the handlebar twisted abruptly from his hands the jet skis nose plunged down into the water flinging the redcap off of it at full speed hed been doing maybe sixty when i hit him and he skipped twice across the waters surface before he slammed into a swell from the water beetles wake and vanished under the surface thomas meanwhile had seized another opportunity as the jet skis split off to swing around us he whirled the steering wheel turning the water beetle sharply to her left i heard one scream and a crunching sound accompanied by a heavy reverberation in the deck beneath my feet as a jet ski slammed into our boats nosewith results very similar to a deer slamming into a speeding semi hexus molly shouted from where she was crouched on the deck her aim was good even if her hex wouldnt carry the same kind of raw power mine did the jet ski thomas had missed suddenly began billowing smoke and its roaring engine cut away to a gasping labored rattle i spun to face the other direction pitching another hex at the two jet skis passing on the far side of the ship they were at the edge of my range and racing away so my hex didnt convince their engines to tear themselves apart the way the shortrange focused curse had the redcaps vehiclebut one of the jet skis abruptly began coasting to a stop and the other took a sharp right turn and then simply went on turning in a furious continuous circle thomas opened up the throttle all the way and the water beetle left the lamed flotilla of wouldbe assassins bobbing in her wake i didnt relax until id swept the ships exterior with my eyes and magical senses alike to make sure no one was hanging on to a rail or something then just to be certain i doublechecked the cabin and hold until i was certain that no one had infiltrated the boat in the chaos and then i sank down in relief on a chair in the cabin but only for a second then i grabbed the firstaid kit and went up to the bridge to see to thomas molly was sprawled on the deck in the morning sunshine exhausted from her efforts and obviously asleep she snored a little i stepped over her and went up to my brother he saw me and grunted we should be pulling into port in another fifteen minutes he said i think were clear that wont last i said hows your arm through and through thomas said not too bad just stop the leak hold still i told him then i started working on his arm it wasnt bad as bullet wounds go it had entered the lean muscle at the bottom of his triceps in back and come out the other side leaving a small hole that had probably been the redcap thenthe rounds from his m would be armorpiercing metaljacketed military rounds specifically designed to punch long fairly small holes i cleaned it up with disinfectant got a pressure bandage positioned over the holes and taped it down okay you can stop complaining now thomas who had been silent the whole time gave me a look you can have your harem change out the bandages later i said how busy are you today oh he mused i dont know i mean ive got to get a new shirt now after that i asked would you like to help me save the city if you dont already have plans he snorted you mean would i like to follow you around wondering what the hell is going on because you wont tell me everything then get in a fight with something that is going to leave me in intensive care uhhuh i said nodding pretty much yeah he said okay chapter nineteen we took thomass car back to his apartment you got the hummer fixed i said approvingly he snorted after i let you ride in it it went undamaged for what about thirty minutes come on i said stretching out my legs there was room it was at least an hour how you doing back there molly from the backseat molly snored i smiled the grasshopper had shambled to the truck and flung herself down on the backseat without saying a word she okay thomas asked she pushed it today i said with that mist thing she does illusions all the time i thought dude i said it was hundreds of yards long and hundreds of yards across thats a huge freaking image to project especially over water because water grounds out magic thomas asked exactly right i said and be glad it does or the sidhe would have been chucking lightning bolts at us instead of bullets molly had to sustain her image while the energy from which it was made kept on draining away and then she hexed one of the jet skis for her thats some serious heavy lifting shes tired he frowned like that time you collapsed at my dads place more or less i said mollys still relatively new at this the first few times you hit your wall it just about knocks you out shell be fine so how come the sidhe didnt hex up their own engines i mean im guessing a jet ski would run for about ten seconds with you on it id give it ten or fifteen minutes i said and it worked for the sidhe because they arent human why should that make a difference i shrugged no one really knows ebenezar thinks its because human beings are inherently conflicted creatures magic responds to your thoughts and to your emotionsand peoples thoughts and emotions are constantly conflicting with one another the way he figures it that means that theres a kind of turbulence around people with magical talent the turbulence is what causes mechanical failure why i shrugged again its just the way things are the specific effects this turbulence causes tend to change slowly over time three hundred years ago it made cream turn sour disturbed animals and tended to encourage minor skin infections in wizards gave them blemishes and moles and pockmarks fun thomas said yeah im not upset about missing out on that kind of fun i said then sometime between then and now it segued into triggering odd flashes of hallucination in the people who hung around in close proximity to us you know the whole ergot theory of history people with talent especially people who didnt even know they had it probably had a lot to do with that now it mucks around with probability where machines are concerned thomas eyed me then he carefully powered off his trucks stereo funny i said after a moment i added i dont mean to do it i mean i try not to do it but i dont mind if you break my stuff thomas said ill just make lara buy me new stuff lara thomass half sister was the power behind the throne of the white court of vampires lara was gorgeous brilliant and sexier than a swedish bikini team hiking up a mountain of money as a potential enemy she was a little scary as an occasional ally she was freaking terrifying i wasnt ever going to tell thomas this but when id been arranging my own murder lara had been the runnerup on my list of possible administrators of my demise i mean hey if youre going to go there are worse ways to do it than to be taken out by the freaking queen of the worlds succubi hows lara doing i asked shes lara thomas said always doing business planning plans scheming schemes like the brighter future society i asked the bfs was an alliance of unlikely bedfellows of the supernatural scene in chicago headquartered out of a small but genuine castle guarded by hired guns from valhalla thomas bared his teeth in a smile that was laras idea actually marcone imported that freaking castle and had it rebuilt over your old boardinghouse lara says its impregnable the death star was impregnable i said so lara got in bed with marcone she tried thomas said but marcone kept it purely business thats two men who have turned her down in the same century she was annoyed i grunted id been the other guy john marcone was the crime lord of chicago he could buy and sell united states congressmen and had the establishment in chicago completely wired he was also the first regular mortal to sign on to the unseelie accords and according to them he was the baron of chicago i was sort of hoping shed kill him i said i was sort of hoping for the other way around thomas said but with the fomor trying to muscle in on everyones territory they need each otherfor now the fomor are that bad i asked they were a crew of bad guys whose names were known primarily in old mythology books the survivors of a number of dark mythoi across the world the worst of the worstor at least the most survivalminded of the worst theyre ruthless thomas said and theyre everywhere but between marcones hired goons laras resources and murphys people they havent gotten a solid foothold here other cities its bad los angeles seattle san francisco miami and boston are the worst off theyre grabbing anyone with a lick of magical ability and carrying them away thousands of people hells bells i muttered what about the white council theyre busy thomas said word is that theyre operating around the coasts of europe especially in the mediterranean fighting the fomor there laras people have been sharing a little information with the council and vice versa but theres nothing like an alliance they arent working in the us at all i asked thomas shrugged your warden buddies are trying he said ramirez got hurt pretty bad last year i dont think hes back in action yet but the wardens in baltimore and san diego are holding out and the kid in texas is giving them hell good for wild bill i said so how come other cities havent gone down lara thomas said simply his voice altered subtly and i could recognize the precise enunciated tones that marked his sisters voice we labored for centuries to cultivate this herd i will not abide a horde of toady hasbeen poachers shes a sweetheart i said shes done a lot he said but she wouldnt have been able to do it without the paranet wow seriously knowledge is power thomas said there are tens of thousands of people on the paranet eyes and ears in every city getting more experienced every day something happens one of the fomor moves and the entire community knows about it in minutes i blinked they can do that internet thomas said the netters are all lowgrade talents they can use computers and cell phones without hexing them up so something starts happening they tweet about it and lara dispatches a ready team and she just happens to get to find out more about the magical talents in other cities the ones who cant really defend themselves in case she gets hungry later yeah thomas said but its not like the netters have a lot of choice in the matter he paused for a couple of blocks and then said laras getting scary lara was always scary thomas shook his head not like this shes getting involved in government she was always doing that i said city officials sure a few key state bureaucrats and she kept it gentle and invisiblemanipulation influence but now shes going for something different what control its funny how chilling one little word can be ill stick her on my todo list then i said thomas snorted not like that i said pervert yeah because you think shes hideous shes too scary to be pretty i lied if she knew id told you even that much bad things would happen thomas said to you not me im family his jaw tensed to justine no it wont i said because if she tries it well protect justine my brother looked at me thanks he said quietly whatever i said its getting cloying in here are we there yet he smiled jerk wuss jackass pansy philistine dandysprat butthead whiner thomas had just pulled the hummer into a parking space in a garage across from his apartment building in the loop when a gold suv roared up and came to a sudden halt behind the hummer thomas and i traded a fast look and we were both thinking the same thing a car meant that an attacker would probably be a mortal using mortal weapons that meant guns that meant that if they started shooting at us while we were still in the car molly asleep in the backseat wouldnt have a prayer both of us rolled out of the front seat getting clear of the hummer as fast as possible thomas had his handgun with him i took the winchester with me the occupants of the gold suv didnt come leaping out with guns blazing the engine stopped then several seconds later the drivers door opened and someone got out he walked calmly around the front of the suv it was a slender man a bit below average height his hair was a blond so pale that it was nearly white he wore faded blue jeans and a green silk shirt he had a gun belt a lot like thomass number fitted with an automatic pistol on one hip and a sword on the other he wasnt a particularly goodlooking man and he didnt carry himself aggressively but his jaw and his eyes were both hard he stopped at a point where he could see both of us and stood there his arms akimbo his hands not quite entirely relaxed by his sidesand near his weapons harry he said quietly fix i said i knew him he was my opposite number on the summer side of things his predecessor had been murdered by my predecessor i heard that mab had recruited you to be the new winter knight he said i was sure that it was a wild rumor the man i knew would never have bowed to a creature like mab i had my reasons i said he looked me up and down slowly then he said youve been given instructions maybe i said you have he said mabs sent you to kill someone hasnt she its none of your concern i said quietly the hell it isnt fix said the winter knight exists to execute people mab cant kill herself you think i dont know that i think that theres an awful lot of glass in your house fix i said youre in the same business as me never fix said the summer knights job isnt to do titanias killing no what is it then to stop you he said simply not even mab should get to decide who lives and who dies harry life is too precious to be wasted that way so when she sends you to kill someone someone gets in the way thats me i didnt say anything for a minute i had assumed that the summer knight would have the same job i did just for a different crew i hadnt really thought about actually crossing swords with fixmetaphorically or otherwise ten years ago that possibility wouldnt have fazed me but fix wasnt the same guy he had been back then he was the summer knight and he was currently standing up to a champion of the white court and the winter knight without batting an eye i recognized the calm in him the stillness that was almost like serenityit was focus and confidence he knew the danger he didnt want to fight but he was quietly ready for it and ready to accept whatever consequences it might bring its generally a really bad idea to fight guys who are in that particular mental space you want me to run him off thomas asked fixs eyes didnt move from me but he directed his words at thomas come try it vampire stars and stones i sighed i took the winchester and put it gently back into the hummer fix can we stop the high noon routine im not going to fight you he frowned slightly that sort of remains to be seen thomas i said get back in the truck please what i want to talk to fix and it isnt going to be a real productive conversation if he has to keep one eye on each of us and his fingers by his gun in case you draw on him thomas grunted suppose he draws and shoots you as soon as im not backing you up if that happens and if itll make you feel better you can come fight him i suppose i regarded fix for a moment and then said but he wont harry thomas said he wont i said quietly i know him he wont thomas let out a low growling grumblebut he got back into the hummer and shut the door fix eyed me warily and checked his surroundings quickly as though expecting some kind of ambush i sighed and sat down on the rear bumper of the hummer fix i said look ive been doing this job for about six hours now i havent gone all dark side yet fix folded his arms his fingers were still close to his weapons but a little farther away than theyd been a moment before youve got to understand lloyd slate was a real monster man i know you dont know because you never had to face him without power the way we did i spread my hands i didnt always have power fix and even with it there are plenty of big scary things out there that im just as helpless against i know then you know what my problem is he said lets assume for a moment that im sometimes an idiot i said whats your problem he gave me a brief smile you were dangerous enough without mabs hand on you now you can make lloyd slate look like a gradeschool bully but i havent i said but you could maybe i wont maybe you will if im as powerful as you seem to think i said then what makes you think you can stand up to me he shrugged maybe i cant but at least i have a chance the people behind me wouldnt ah i said we both sat for a moment then i said so i guess it wont be enough for me to assure you that im not up to no good you know how you could tell when slate was lying how his lips were moving i smiled briefly well it seems to me youve got a couple of choices oh you do the math you see what i have the potential to do and you plan for what i could do rather than what you think i will do might be smart fix said von clausewitz would say so if this was a war and i was the enemy sure what else do you think i could do extend a little trust maybe i said thats the illusion here man as far as im concerned we dont need to be enemies we dont need to be at war fix pursed his lips then he said heres the problem with that you belong to mab i like harry maybe i could even trust him but i know what mab is likeand harry belongs to mab now the hell i do i said just because i took this job doesnt mean im all cozy with her you uh looked kinda cozy man with mab on the stone table sealing a contract like the one with mab isnt something you do with an impersonal handshake i felt my cheeks heat up oh you saw that all of faerie did fix said god thats humiliating i muttered i know what you mean he said at least it wasnt on payperview i snorted okay i said finally im under some time pressure here so i think you need to make a decision yeah i nodded who is going to make this call you or von clausewitz fix looked away then he said i hate this kind of crap this is the first time ive had a job ive held down for more than six months i hear you he gave me another brief smile i want to believe you he said then he took a steadying breath and faced me lowering his arms to his sides again but there are people depending on me to keep them safe i cant afford to do that i stood up very slowly and reluctantly fix i dont want this fight and youll get a chance to avoid it he said im going to give you until noon to get out of town harry if i see you after that im not going to spend any more time talking and im not going to challenge you to a fair fight if youre really serious about being your own man if you really want to keep the peace between usyoull go i dont think i can do that i said i didnt think you could he said quietly you have until noon we exchanged a nod then he moved back to his suv never taking his eyes off me once he was in he started it and drove away i sank back down onto the hummers back bumper again and closed my eyes great one more thing i liked fix he was a decent guy hed become the summer knight and as far as i knew hed never abused his power people in the supernatural community liked and respected him id even seen him in action once he was a hell of a lot more formidable than hed been as the scared young man id first met i didnt want to fight him he might not give me a choice mab was not about puppies and kittens and id known that when i signed on even if she wasnt evil exactly she was vicious violent and ruthless i had no doubt that mab had done for a number of decent people in her time one way or another there were stories about the winter knight stretching back for centuries and various vile personalities had held the title some of them had even been famous gilles de rais andrei chikatilo john haigh fritz haarmann if i were in fixs shoes and he were in mine i might well have pulled the trigger without thinking twice i leaned my head back against the truck with a little thunk thomas sat down next to me and the hummer settled a little more well well what he going to back off doesnt matter i said sure it does i shook my head it doesnt matter because hes a decent guy and im not going to hurt him he might not give you much choice theres always a choice i said thats the thing man theres always always a choice my options might really truly suck but that doesnt mean there isnt a choice youd let him kill you thomas asked i looked up at him no but i wont hurt him my brother gave me a tightlipped look and then got up and walked away there was a shimmer in the air and molly appeared standing about ten feet behind what had been fixs position during our conversation she watched thomas go with an unhappy expression i blinked at her how long have you been standing there i got out of your side of the car when thomas got in she said you know just in case something happened it seemed like a good idea to make sure he went down quick if a fight broke out so you wouldnt have to kill him i smiled at her totally unfair i had this teacher who kept telling me that if i was ever in a fair fight someone had made a mistake she said sounds like a jerk he has his moments she said she squinted after thomas and said hes just afraid you know he doesnt want to lose his brother twice i know i said but im really proud of you boss she said her voice quieter i mean i know youve had some hard calls to make lately but my dad would say that you were right about this one theres always a choice i grunted if i get into it with fix i said i dont want you to get involved why not because faeries keep score i said and theyll never leave a score unsettled if i told you that youd tell me that wasnt my choice to make and id be right i said and sighed but i have enough worries already grasshopper leave it alone for me she looked like id just asked her to swallow a bug ill try she said thanks i said and extended my hand she helped me up whats next a phone call lets go chapter twenty i dont care how busy he is i said into the phone i need to talk with him period we were in thomass living room thomas was sprawled on a recliner the hideous hightech brushedsteel look that had been the places trademark had been softened with window dressings and various bits of decorationjustines touch thomas like most men regarded a throw pillow as something to throw one bounced off of my chest way to turn on the charm harry he murmured i covered the phones receiver with one hand polite gets you nowhere with these people trust me i turned back to the phone no i said not over this line its bugged just tell him that doughnut boy needs to speak to him or an informed highlevel operative in person within the hour thomas mouthed the word operative at me his fingers spread in a gesture meant to convey spooky importance i kicked the pillow back at him dont give me excuses i said he can get here if he damned well wants to and we both know it call me back at this number i thunked the phone down earlier today molly said from where she sat on the floor someone said something to me about not burning my bridges let me think who was that ixnay i growled i know what im doing i turned to thomas how many bugs does lara have on this place harry thomas said in a scandalized toneone that was just a little bit too well projected to be meant for me im her brother she would never behave that way toward her own flesh and blood her own kin her own dear sibling i growled how many he shrugged it changes new ones come in sometimes when im not home i grunted i put the phone on the counter unplugged it and grabbed a pepper shaker i put a circle of pepper around the phone and sealed it with a gentle effort of will youre set for money right with laras money yes good i said and then i unleashed a burst of will with a mutter of hexus that burned out every bit of electronics within fifty feet the apartments lightbulbs all winked out at the same instant thomas groaned but he didnt otherwise complain grasshopper i said on it molly said she rose to her feet frowning her eyes mostly closed and began walking slowly around the apartment while she did that i broke the circle of pepper with a brush of my hand and plugged the phone back in if you were going to do that thomas asked why not do it before you made the phone call that absolutely did set off every flag laras security teams have to wave i held up a hand for silence until molly had wandered down the hall and back nothing she said no spells thomas asked right i said anyone who came in uninvited wouldnt be able to make that kind of spell stick and no one youve invited in has i frowned molly i didnt she said quickly has planted a spell to listen in on you i finished and i wanted laras people to know who i contacted when they try to follow up on it theyll betray their presence and hell be alerted to how they operate it was a payment thomas said i shrugged call it a friendly gesture at my sisters expense thomas said laras a big girl shell understand i considered things for a moment and then said everyone be cool something might happen thomas frowned like what cat sith i called in a firm voice i need you if you please there was a rushing sound like a heavy curtain stirred by a strong wind and then from the fresh dark shadows beneath thomass dining table the malks alien voice said i am here sir knight thomas jerked in reaction despite my warning and produced a tiny semiautomatic pistol from i knew not where molly drew in a sharp harsh breath and backed directly away from the source of the voice until her shoulder blades hit a wall it was just possible that i had understated how unsettling a malk sounds when it speaks id clearly been hanging around creepy things for way too long take it easy i said holding a hand out to thomas this is cat sith molly made a sputtering noise i gave her a quelling glance and said to thomas hes working with me cat sith came to the edge of the shadows so that his silhouette could be seen his eyes reflected the light from the almost entirely curtained windows sir knight how may i assist you empty night it talks thomas breathed how molly asked the threshold here is solid how did it just come in like that which was a reasonable question given that molly didnt know about my former cleaning service and how it had interacted with my old apartments threshold beings out of faerie dont necessarily need to be invited over a threshold i said if theyre benevolent to the inhabitants of the house they can pretty much come right in wait thomas said these freaks can walk in and out whenever they want pop in directly from the nevernever and you didnt tell us about it only if their intentions are benign i said cat sith came here to assist me and by extension you as long as hes here hes i frowned and looked at the malk help me find the correct way to explain this to him sith directed his eyes to thomas and said while i am here i am bound by the same traditions as would apply were i your invited guest he said i will offer no harm to anyone you have accepted into your home nor take any action which would be considered untoward for a guest i will report nothing of what i see and hear in this place and make every effort to aid and assist your household and other guests while i remain i blinked several times i had expected sith to hit me with a big old snarkclub rather than actually answering the questionmuch less answering it in such detail but that made sense the obligations of guest and host were almost holy in the supernatural world if sith truly did regard that kind of courtesy as the obligation of a guest he would have little choice but to live up to it thomas seemed to digest that for a few moments and then grunted i suppose i am obliged to comport myself as a proper host then say instead that i am under no obligation to allow myself to be harmed or to remain and give my aid if you behave in any other fashion sith corrected him if you began shooting at me with that weapon for example i would depart without doing harm and only then would i hunt you catch you outside the protection of your threshold and kill you in order to discourage such behavior from others in the future thomas looked like he was about to talk some smack at the malk but only for a second then he frowned and said its odd you sound like like a gradeschool teacher perhaps it is because i am speaking to a child cat sith said the comparison is apt thomas blinked several times and then looked at me did the evil kitty just call me a child i dont think hes evil so much as hyperviolent and easily bored i said and you started it you called him a freak my brother pursed his lips and frowned i did didnt i he turned to cat sith and set his gun aside cat sith the remark was not directed specifically at you or meant to insult you but i acknowledge that i have given offense and recognize that the slight puts me in your debt please accept my apologies and feel free to ask a commensurate service of me should you ever have need of it to balance the scales cat sith stared at thomas for a moment and then inclined his head even children can learn manners done until such time as i have need of you i regard the matter as settled thomas raith you know him i asked and your apprentice molly carpenter sith said his voice impatient as well as the rest of your frequent associates may i suggest that you get on with the business at hand sir knight tempus fugit one of winters most dangerous creaturesmost dangerous huntersknew all about my friends that was something that a smart man would be concerned about i reminded myself that just because someone is courteous it does not necessarily mean that they arent planning to vivisect you it just means that theyll ask whether the ropes holding you down are comfortable before they pick up the scalpel cat sith might be an ally for the moment but he was not my friend in a few minutes were going to be leaving i said ive got a hunch that well be under observation and i dont want that i want you to distract anyone who has us under direct surveillance with pleasure without killing them or causing significant bodily harm i said for all i know theres a cop or a pi watching the place so nothing permanent cat sith narrowed his eyes his tail twitched to one side but he said nothing think of it as a compliment i suggested any idiot could murder them what i ask is far more difficult as befits your station his tail twitched the other way he said nothing after that i said i want you to get word to the summer lady i want a meeting uh what thomas said is that a good idea molly asked at the same time i waved a hand at both of them and kept talking to sith tell her its got to happen before noon can you contact her of course sir knight said sith she will wish to know the reason for such a meeting tell her that id prefer not to kill her knight and id like to discuss how best to avoid it tell her that ill meet her wherever she pleases if she promises me safe conduct bring me her answer sith eyed me then said such a course is unwise im not asking you to do it what do you care the queen may be less than pleased with me if i break her newest toy before shes gotten sufficient use from it gosh i said sith flicked an ear and managed to do it contemptuously i will bear this message sir knight and i will distract those who hunt you when will you be departing behind me thomass phone began to ring tell you in a second i said i answered the phone go for doughnut boy a woman with a voice cold enough to merit the use of the kelvin scale spat he will meet you accorded neutral ground ten minutes cool i said i havent had a beer in forever there was a brief perhaps baffled silence and then she hung up on me i turned back to thomas and molly and said lets go sith please be the eldest malk vanished gin i finished somewhat lamely thomas swung to his feet and slipped the little automatic into the back of his pants then pulled his shirt down over it where are we going accorded neutral ground i said oh good molly said im starving chapter twentyone in the lobby we found the doorman sitting on the ground grimacing in pain a cpd patrol officer was next to him with a firstaid kit as we passed i saw several long long slices in the back of one of the doormans legs running from just above his heel to the top of his calf his slacks and socks alike were sliced in neat parallel strips the wounds were painful and bloody but not lifethreatening both men were both too preoccupied to pay an instant of attention to the three of us as we calmly left the building i winced a little as we went by them dammit i hadnt wanted to turn even the gentlest of cat siths attentions upon any of my fellow chicagoans but i hadnt worded my command to him tightly enough of course that was a rabbit hole i didnt want to start downexperience has taught me that you do not win against supernatural entities at lawyering it just doesnt happen i didnt even want to think about what sith might have done if i hadnt forbidden him the use of deadly force maybe this was the malks way of telling me to beware the consequences if i kept giving him commands like a common servant or maybe this was his idea of playing nice after all he hadnt slashed up the cop and every passerby for all i knew he thought hed been a perfect gentleman molly checked out the parking garage from beneath a veil while thomas and i waited once she pronounced the garage villainfree we got into my brothers troop transport and left in chicago you cant swing a cat without hitting an irish pub and angering the cat but mcanallys place stands out from the crowd its the favored watering hole for the supernatural scene of chicago normals never really seem to find their way in though we get some tourists once in a while they rarely linger morning traffic was roaring at full steam and even though macs wasnt far it took us a little time to get there clouds had swallowed up the bright dawn thick and grey a light rain was falling occasionally i could see flashes of distant lightning glowing through the clouds overhead or hear a subtle growl of low thunder and it was supposed to be nice today molly murmured i smiled a little but didnt say anything thomas pulled into the little parking lot adjacent to macs parking his hummer next to an old white trans am he stopped frowning at it i thought mac usually opened up at noon he said eleven i said my old office building hadnt been far away id eaten many a lunch at macs place guess he came in early today thats handy thomas said where does that saying come from i asked uh thomas said handy i blinked as we walked well yeah that one too but i was thinking of the phrase you cant swing a cat without hitting something around here thomas gave me a steady look dont you have important things to be thinking about right now i shrugged i wonder about these things life goes on man if i stop thinking about things just because some psycho or crew of psychos wants me dead ill never get to think about anything will i thomas bobbed his head to one side in acknowledgment of my point about thirty feet from the door molly abruptly stopped in her tracks and said harry i paused and looked back at her her eyes were wide she said i sense i narrowed my eyes say it you know you want to say it it is not a disturbance in the force she said her voice halfexasperated theres a a presence here something powerful i felt it in chichén itzá good i said nodding hes here seriously neither of you guys knows where that saying comes from damn i hate not knowing things its enough to make a guy wish he could use the internet macs pub was all but empty its a place that looks pretty spacious when empty yet its small enough to feel cozy when its full its a study in deliberate asymmetry there are thirteen tables of varying sizes and heights scattered irregularly around the floor there are thirteen wooden columns placed in similarly random positions their faces carved with scenes from oldworld nursery tales the bar kind of meanders and there are thirteen stools spaced unevenly along it just about everything is made from wood including the paneled walls the hardwood floors and the paneled ceiling thirteen ceiling fans hang suspended from the ceiling ancient things that mac manages to keep running despite the frequent presence of magical talents the decor is a kind of feng shui or at least something close to it all that imbalance is intended to scatter the random outbursts of magical energy that cause problems for practitioners it must work the electric fans and the telephone hardly ever melt down mac stood behind the bar a lean man a little taller than average his shaven head gleaming ive patronized his establishment for most of my adult life and he still looked more or less like he had when i first met him neat dressed in dark pants a white shirt and a pristine white apron that proved its ongoing redundancy by never getting messy mac was leaning on the bar listening to something the pubs only other occupant was saying the second man was well over six feet tall and built with the kind of broad shoulders and lean power that made me think of a longdistance swimmer he wore a dark grey business suit an immaculate european number of some kind obviously custommade his hair was the color of old steel highlighted with sweeps of silver and his sharp chin and jawline were emphasized by the cut of a short silverwhite beard the man wore a black eye patch made of silk and even against the backdrop of that suit it gave him a piratical aura the man in the eye patch finished saying whatever it was and mac dropped his head back and let out a short hefty belly laugh it lasted only a second and then it was gone replaced with macs usual calm genial expression but the man in the suit sat back with an expression of pleasure on his face at the reaction its him molly said who is that donar vadderung i told her whoa thomas said molly frowned the the security company guy ceo of monoc securities i said nodding empty night dresden thomas said you just demanded that he come to see you is that bad molly asked him its glah thomas said think of doing that to donald trump or george soros molly winced im not sure i can do that thomas glared at me you set up laras surveillance crew to go up against his guys i smiled balls thomas said shes going to rip mine off tell her it wasnt your fault you couldnt have stopped me shell get it i said you guys sit down get some food or something this shouldnt take long molly blinked then looked at thomas and said wait a minute were his flunkies you maybe thomas said sneering im his thug im way higher than a flunky you are high if you think im taking any orders from you molly said tartly the two of them went to a far table bickering cheerfully and sat down passing by the real reason we were meeting herea modest wooden sign with simple letters burned into it accorded neutral territory the unseelie accords had supported the various supernatural political entities over the past few turbulent decades they were a series of agreements that at the end of the day were basically meant to limit conflicts between the various nations to something with a definite structure they defined the rights of those lords who held territory as well as the infractions that could be committed against those lords by other lords think of them as the geneva conventions of the spooky side thats kind of close mac had somehow gotten his place declared neutral ground it meant that whenever any signatory of the accords was here he was obligated to be a good guest to offer no harm or violence to any other signatory and to take any violence that might erupt outside it was a meeting ground where there was at least a fair chance that you might actually get to finish a meal without being murdered by someone who might otherwise be a mortal enemy vadderung watched molly and thomas sit and then transferred his attention back to me his single eye was an icy shade of blue and unsettling as i approached him i had an instinctive impression that he could see more of me than i could of him well well well he said rumors of your death et cetera i shrugged im sure it isnt an uncommon play among wizards i said something in his eye flashed an amused thought that went by almost before i could see it fewer try it than you might think he said i didnt try anything i said it just happened vadderung reached out and lazily collected a cup of coffee he sipped it watching me then he leaned forward slightly and said slowly nothing that significant just happens dresden i squinted at him shrugged then i said mac can i get a beer mac had sauntered a discreet distance down the bar he eyed me and then a slowly ticking clock on the wall i havent had a drink in a lifetime i said if i go all nutty about it you can sign me up for aa mac snorted then he got me a bottle of one of his microbrewed ales they are nectar and ambrosia he opened it and passed me the bottle since he knew i rarely drink beer out of a glass and i tilted it toward him before drinking some pretty early for that isnt it vadderung asked i can smell the whiskey in yours from here i said and held up my bottle he smiled lifted his coffee cup toward me in salute and took a long sip as i put back some more ale then we both set our drinks down what do you need vadderung asked advice i said if the price is right and what do you think a sufficient price would be lucy charges a nickel ah vadderung said but lucy is a psychiatrist you realize that youve just cast yourself as charlie brown augh i said vadderung smiled you found it lonely where you were i see why would you say that the banter the talk unnecessary companions many would say that now is the time for rapid decisive action but you have spent precious time reconnecting with your allies he tilted his head slightly therefore if you have such a driving need for it i can logically assume that you have spent your recent time apart from such company does that seem reasonable to you arctis tor isnt much of a vacation spot i said no what is it i narrowed my eyes wait are you trying to shrink me he sipped his coffee why would you ask me that question because you keep asking questions i said jokes on you lucy i dont have a nickel i regarded my bottle ive got time for banter just not for games vadderung set his coffee down and spread his hands i dont work for free he said i havent earned enough money in my entire lifetime to afford your fees i said but you dont need more money he waited ill owe you one i said that seemed to amuse the hell out of him wrinkled topography appeared at the corner of his eye given the caliber of your talents for making enemies i hope youll understand if i dont consider what you offer a sound longterm value i smiled and sipped some beer but its worth a few minutes of your timeor you wouldnt have come here in the first place that drew a quick flicker of an amused smile i will accept your offer of one favorand a nickel i told you i dont have a nickel he nodded gravely what do you have i rummaged in my pockets and came out with the jeweled cuff links from my tux i showed them to him those arent a nickel he said soberly he leaned forward again as he had a moment before and spoke slowly what do you have i stared at him for a second then i said friends he sat back his blue eye all but throwing off sparks it was so bright thomas i called i need a nickel what thomas asked in cash yeah thomas reached into a pocket and produced a bunch of plastic cards he fanned them out and showed them to me what about these those arent a nickel i said oh for goodness sake molly sighed she reached into a pocket and produced what looked like a little old ladys coin purse then she flicked a nickel toward me i caught it thanks youre promoted to lackey she rolled her eyes hail ming i slid the nickel across the bar to vadderung there he nodded talk to me right i said um its about time no he said its about your island i eyed him warily what do you mean what i mean he said is that i know about your island i know where it came from i know what it does i know whats beneath it uh i said oh im aware of how important it is that the island be well managed most of the people who came to your party in mexico are by which he meant the grey council vadderung was a part of it it was a group of folks mostly wizards of the white council who had joined together because it seemed like the white council was getting close to meltdown and they wanted to save it but since the rats were in the walls the only way to do it was covertly working in cells i wasnt sure who exactly was a member except for my grandfather and vadderung he had come along with the rest of the mostly anonymous grey council when id gone to take my daughter back from the red court and seemed to fit right in of course i was pretty sure he wasnt a wizard i was pretty sure he was a lot more than that so i broke it down for him speaking very quietly i told him about the attack being aimed at the island from across time hard lines appeared in his face as i did idiots he breathed even if they could defeat the banefire wait i said banefire the failsafe vadderung said the fire the island showed you right itll kill everything held there rather than let them escape right it is the only way vadderung said if anyone managed to set free the things in the well seems like it would be bad i said not bad vadderung said the end oh i said good to know the island didnt mention that part the island cannot accept it as a possibility vadderung said absently it should probably put its biggirl pants on then i said the way i understand it it might already be too late i mean for all i know someone cast this spell a hundred years ago or a hundred years from now vadderung waved a hand nonsense there are laws that govern the progression of time in relation to space like everything else meaning what meaning that the echoes caused by the temporal event are proportionately greater than the span of time that was bridged he said had the attack been launched from a century ago or hence the echoes of it would have begun far far in advance of the eventcenturies ago these echoes have appeared only within the past few days i would guess roughly that the attack must originate only hours from the actual realtime occurrence which is tomorrow i said so its happening sometime today or sometime tomorrow most likely not tomorrow vadderung said altering ones past is more than mildly difficult the paradox thing i asked like if i go back and kill my grandfather how was i ever born to go back and kill my grandfather paradox is an overrated threat there is a quality similar to inertia at work once an event has occurred there is an extremely strong tendency for that event to occur the larger more significant or more energetic the event the more it tends to remain as it originally happened despite any interference i frowned theres a law of the conservation of history vadderung grinned ive never heard it phrased quite like that but its accurate enough in any event overcoming that inertia requires tremendous energy will and a measure of simple luck if one wishes to alter the course of history its a far simpler matter to attempt to shape the future i grunted so if i go back in time and kill my grandfather what happens he beats you senseless i suspect vadderung said his gaze direct oh man vadderung knew about ebenezar which meant that either he was higher in the old mans circle of trust than i was or he had access to an astoundingly scary pool of information you know what i mean i said paradox universe goes poof if it works like that ive never seen it as evidenced by the fact that he spread his hands here it is i suspect a different form of apocalypse happens i frowned like what a twinned universe vadderung said a new parallel reality identical except for that event one in which you never existed and one in which you failed to kill your grandfather i pursed my lips that doesnt really end well for me in either case an excellent reason not to meddle in the natural course of time wouldnt you say meddling with time is an irrationally outrageously catastrophically dangerous and costly business i encourage you to avoid it at all costs you and the white council i said so its going to happen sometime today or tonight vadderung nodded and nearby why because the energy requirements are astronomical he said bridging a temporal gap of any length is something utterly beyond the reach of any mortal practitioner acting alone doing such a thing and then trying to project the spell over a distance as well the difficulty of it would be prohibitive and do not forget how much water surrounds the island which will tend to mitigate any energy sent toward itthats one reason the well was built there i nodded all of that hung together based upon everything i knew of magic people always assume that magic is a free ridebut it isnt you cant pull energy from nowhere and there are laws that govern how it behaves so this time bomb it has to come from how close i asked the shores of the lake i suspect vadderung said the island itself would be the ideal location but i doubt that it will cooperate with any such effort not hardly i agreed and you cant just scribble a chalk circle and pull this spell out of your hat its got to have an energy source a big one precisely vadderung said and those things tend to stand out he smiled they do and whoever is trying to pull this off if they know enough about futzing with time to be making this attempt they know that the echoes will warn people that its coming theyll be ready to argue with anyone who tries to thwart them they most certainly will he finished his coffee i had made the right call here vadderungs advice had changed the problem from something enormous and inexplicable to something that was merely very difficult very dangerous and likely to get me killed um i said dont take this the wrong way but this is a highstakes game the highest yes he agreed im thinking that maybe someone with a little more experience and better footing should handle it someone like you maybe he shook his head it isnt practical i frowned not practical it must be you why me its your island vadderung said that makes no sense he tilted his head and looked at me wizard you have been dead and returned it has marked you it has opened doors and paths that you do not yet know exist and attracted the attention of beings who formerly would never have taken note of your insignificance meaning what i asked there was no humor at all in his face meaning that now more than ever you are a fulcrum meaning that your life is about to become very very interesting i dont understand i said he leaned forward slightly correct that he looked at his watch and rose im afraid im out of time i shook my head rising with him blocking him wait my plate is already pretty full here and if you havent noticed im barely competent to keep myself alive much less to prevent arkham asylum from turning into the next tunguska blast vadderung met my eyes with his and said in a growl move i moved i looked away too id seen too many things with my sight already and i had a bad feeling that trading a soulgaze with vadderung would not improve my performance over the next day or so where are hugin and munin i asked i left them at the office he said they dont like you im afraid birdbrains i muttered he smiled nodded to mac and walked to the door can i do this i asked his back you can i made an exasperated sound how do you know odin turned to look back at me with his gleaming eye his teeth bared in a wolfs smile the scar on either side of his eye patch silver in the light coming through the door perhaps he murmured you already have then he opened the door and left i scowled at where hed been standing and then slouched back on my barstool i grabbed my beer finished it and set it down a little harder than i had to mac was back at the grill making some of his famous steak sandwiches for thomas and molly i waved at him but before i could say anything he had already added another steak to the first two my stomach growled as i got up and went to molly and thomass table perhaps you already have now what the hell had he meant by that chapter twentytwo i filled molly and thomas in on what i had learned from vadderung while we ate macs steak sandwiches were too awesome not to eat even if it was more or less breakfast time molly blinked as i finished uh who is that guy thomas gave me an even look my brother had figured it out he tilted his head microscopically toward molly a friend i think i said when you work it out youre ready to know ah molly frowned and toyed with a few crumbs pushing them around with a forefinger she nodded okay so whats next thomas asked i finished the last few bites of my sandwich in a hurry man that tasted good i washed it down with some more of macs excellent beer normally a couple of bottles along with a meal would leave me ready for a nap today they felt about as soporific as red bull molly i said i want you to go talk to toot i need the guard to gather up and be ready to move when i give the word scouts she guessed i nodded while youre doing that im going to go figure out the potential sites for the time bomb spell so we know where to aim the guard order some pizza that will gather them in okay she said um money i looked at thomas she already came through for me once your turn thomas snorted and slipped a white plastic card out of his pocket it was utterly unmarked except for a few stamped numbers and a magnetic strip he flicked it across the table to molly when you get your pizza have them run that molly studied the card back and front is this a diners club card or something its a raith contingency card he said lara hands them out to the family once they ring up the first charge on the card itll be good for twentyfour hours for how much molly asked twentyfour hours thomas repeated molly lifted her eyebrows thomas smiled faintly dont worry about amounts my sister doesnt really believe in limits do whatever you want with it i dont care molly took the card and placed it very carefully in her secondhand coin purse okay she looked at me now i nodded get a move on she paused to draw a pen from her purse she scribbled on a napkin and passed it to me my apartments phone i glanced at it read it and memorized it then i slid it to thomas who tucked the napkin away in a pocket youre going to just send her out there alone molly regarded thomas blankly then vanished oh thomas said right i stood up and crossed the room to the door i opened it and glanced out as though scanning suspiciously for anyones approach i felt molly slip out past me as i did then i closed it again and came back inside thunder rumbled over the lake but no rain fell i noticed my brother drawled that you didnt leave her a way to contact you did you he snorted you think fix would hurt her i think she wont give him much choice i said shes come a long waybut fix is exactly the wrong kind of threat for her to mess with hes used to glamour he can defend against it and hes smart mollys not too shabby herself thomas said molly is my responsibility i said i hadnt meant for the words to come out that cold that hard the anger surprised me but it bubbled and seethed still some part of me was furious at thomas for questioning my decision regarding my apprentice molly was mine and i would be damned if some chiseljawed white court pretty boy was going to i closed my eyes and clenched my jaw pride possession territoriality that wasnt me that was the mantle of winter talking through me sorry i said a moment later and opened my eyes thomas hadnt reacted in any way to my snarl my anger or my apology he just studied me then he said quietly i want to suggest something to you im not trying to make you do anything you just need to hear it sure i said im a predator harry he said we both know that yeah so so i recognize it in others when i see it and and youre looking at molly like shes food i frowned at him i am not he shrugged it isnt all the time its just little moments you look at her and i can see the calculations running you notice every time she yawns i didnt want what thomas was saying to be true so what when she yawns shes showing us that shes tired it makes us take notice because tired prey is easy prey he leaned forward putting one arm on the table i know what im talking about no i said my voice getting cold again you dont i tried going into denial like that when i was about fifteen it didnt work out too well what i asked him you think im going to attack her when she goes to sleep yeah he said if you dont recognize whats motivating you and control it you will maybe not today maybe not tomorrow but eventually you cant just ignore those instincts man if you do theyll catch you off guard some night and you will hurt her one way or another i wasnt sure what to say to that i frowned down at my empty bottle of ale she trusts you thomas said i think some part of you knows that i think that part sent her away from you for a damned good reason take this seriously harry yeah i said quietly ill try this stuff keeps catching me off guard nature of the beast youve always been good at keeping things right between the two of you even though shes carrying a torch the size of a building i admire you for that id hate to see it come apart i rubbed at my eyes my brother was right id been forcing myself to look away from molly all morning that had never been an issue before that was part of winter toohunger and lust a need for heat in the darkness it had driven lloyd slate just as it had several other winter knights over the years it had driven them insane i had to learn to recognize that influence before someone got hurt yeah okay i said when i get done sprinting from one forest fire to the next ill ill figure something out until then feel free to slap me around a bit if you think i need it thomas nodded very seriously but his eyes sparkled im your brother i pretty much always feel free to do that heh i said id like to see you i trailed off glancing at mac who was staring at the door to the pub frowning i followed his gaze the glass on the top half of the door was faceted and partly frosted but it was clear enough to give you a blurry image of whoever was standing outside the door or at least it would have been if the exterior hadnt been blanketed by a thick grey mist thomas noticed me and looked huh he said uh doesnt the fog usually burn off in the morning we didnt have any this morning i said so thomas drawled that isnt right no i said no it isnt there just werent all that many reasons someone would blanket an area with mistto conceal an approach we both stood up and faced the door behind us mac reached under the bar and came out with a pistolgrip shotgun made of black composite material it had a folding stock and barely enough of a barrel to qualify as a hunting piece this is crazy thomas said nobody attacks macs its neutral ground what about these fomor ive heard about not even them thomas said every time theyve gotten close to this place the bfs came down on them like an avalanche its practically the only thing theyve really agreed on i blanked for a second and then said oh brighter future society it isnt the faeries is it thomas asked theyre called the unseelie accords i said winter equals unseelie anyone in winter who violated mabs treaty would be thrilled to die before she was through with them summer then it isnt noon yet i said the sounds of the city outside had vanished an unnatural hush fell i could hear three people breathing a little harder than they normally would a creaky ceiling fan and that was about it definitely magic i said someone doesnt want anybody seeing or hearing what happens in here there was a sharp sound a sudden motion and a stone sailed through one of the faceted panes of glass on the door thomas produced his pistol and macs shotgun snapped up to his shoulder some broken glass tinkled to the floor and the stone tumbled down and bounced off of my foot before it came to rest on the floor it was a rounded piece of glassy black obsidian about the size of an egg tendrils of mist came through the broken pane of glass and the stone on the floor abruptly quivered and began to buzz thomas and i both took several wary steps away from it but the buzzing increased and warped until it became an eerie quavering voice like something youd hear on an old wornout vinyl record sssssend out the wizzzzard it hummed each word slow and drawnout sssssend him to ussssss and all othersssss may ssssstay i know a good place for you to pound sand you gutless fu thomas began helpfully i held up a hand no i told him quietly wait for what this is neutral territory i said in a voice pitched to carry outside the door if you want to talk come on in you wont be attacked sssssend him to usssss that wasnt creepy or anything my schedule is kind of full today i called hows next tuesday for you thrice we asssssk and done hissed the voice sssssend him to usssss now i took slow steady breaths to keep the fear at bay and think i was pretty sure that whatever was out there it wasnt interested in talking i was also pretty sure that i didnt want to toddle out onto that narrow mistclouded stairway to start a fight but i wasnt the only one in the room i looked back at mac i dont want to bring any trouble into your place mac i said youre my host here ill take it outside if you want me to in answer mac made a growling sound and worked the action on the shotgun pumping a shell into the chamber then he reached under the counter produced a heavycaliber automatic pistol and put it on the bar within easy reach thomas showed his teeth in a predatory grin im leaving bigger tips from now on right i muttered i gestured at thomas to move a few steps back and made sure that neither of us was standing in macs line of fire to the door i focused on the black stone it would start there hey creep i called lifting my left hand you heard the man kisssss my asssssss ssssso be it hissed the voice from the stone and the black stone exploded i was ready for it though id already prepared the defensive spell and i poured my will into a thick wall in the air in front of me as fragments of glossy black stone flew around the room they bounced off my shield and went zinging shattering one of my empty beer bottles on the table slamming into the wooden columns and gouging wood out of the walls none of them got to thomas mac or me id put the shield between us and the black stone while our attackers wasted time in negotiation it wasnt as good as the shield i could have thrown up if i had managed to replace my old shield bracelet and i couldnt hold it up anywhere near as long but i didnt need to once the explosion had passed i dropped the shield already focusing my will upon my other hand gathering a cannonball of raw force and at the first flicker of motion outside the doors glass i snarled forzare and sent it hurtling forth force hammered into the door and turned maybe fifty pounds of leaded glass into a cloud of razorsharp shards the stairwell down to macs place was sunkenthere was no way any of the shrapnel could fly out at street level an instant later the bottom half of the door exploded into flying daggers of wood my shield stopped anything heading toward mac but i couldnt catch them all one of them clipped my left cheekbone broadsideif it had tumbled for another fraction of a second the sharp end would have driven right into my brain as it was it hit me like a baseball bat stunning me and knocking me down the world did that slowmotion echochamber thing that happens sometimes with a head blow and i saw our attacker come in at first i couldnt translate what i was seeing into something that made sense it looked something like those giant spinning whirling tubes covered in strips of soft cloth at an automated car wash the ones that actually shampoo your car except it wasnt a tube it was a sphere and it wasnt at a car wash it was rolling in through macs doorway macs shotgun went off the sound of it slapping me in the back those things are loud in an enclosed space dust and bits of scrap cloth flew out of the attacker but it didnt slow down the giant rag ball hurtled toward me until thomas dashed in from the side and smashed it with a roundhouse swing of one of macs heavy oak tables quick bar fighting tip for youin real life when you hit a guy with furniture it doesnt break into pieces the way it does in the movies it breaks whoever you hit with it there was a meaty sound of impact and the rolling shapes forward momentum was instantly converted into a perpendicular line drive it streaked across the room trailing streamers of greybrown cloth like a ragged comet the cloth flapping and snapping with unnatural volume until it hit the wall with a solid thwack another fighting tip for you dont stay on the ground if you dont know exactly what youre up against if you arent sure that the guy youre fighting doesnt have a buddy coming along who might help you cant afford to be down and relatively motionless my body was already moving though i wasnt sure how it was doing that pushing me back to my feet mac put a hand on the bar and vaulted up onto it like he did it all the time the attacker bounced off the wall rolled across a tabletop and fell to the floor in a heap mac took a pair of quick steps to get a better line of fire and boom went the shotgun again another cloud of scrap cloth and dust flew up from the attacker the room lurched back into normal speed dozens of strips of the dark sackcloth came flying off of the thing twining in an instant around chairs and tables a chair flew at thomas knocking the table out of his hands and he was forced to dodge to one side instead of closing in macs shotgun bellowed three more times and i hurled another lance of force at the thing macs shells did nothing but create puffs of debris and my own arcane strike split and flowed around the thing shattering a chair and smashing in a portion of the wall behind it and it laughed furniture exploded out from it flung with superhuman force my shield barely caught the narrow edge of a table that had been flung like a frisbee thomass legs were scythed out from under him by a flying bar stool and he hit the floor with a huff of expelled breath mac had already thrown himself down behind the barbut when another table hit it there was an enormous cracking sound and several pieces of wood broke under the impact a shape stirred in the writhing mass of ashcolored sackcloth and rose its outline veiled but not entirely obscured by the cloth it was lankytall and had to stand hunched over to avoid the lazily spinning blades of the ceiling fans it was more or less humanshaped and i was suddenly struck by the realization that i was looking at a humanoid who was wearing some kind of enormous ungainly garment made of all those restless rustling strips it lifted its head slowly and focused on me it didnt look at meit didnt have any eyes just smooth skin laced with scars where they had once been its skin was pearly grey lined with darker stripes that made me think of a shark its mouth was gaping open in a wide grin that reinforced the impression it didnt have teethjust a single smooth ridge of bone where teeth would have been on a human its lips were black and its mouth smudged with more of it twin trails of saliva drooled from the corners of its mouth leaving black streaks to down past its chin there wasnt a hair to be seen on its head wizard it said and its voice was the same as had come through the glossy stone your life need not end this day surrender and i will spare your companions i could hear mac reloading behind me thomas had his gun in his hand behind his back and was prowling silently around the room to force sharkface to turn to keep an eye on him except it didnt have eyes whatever this thing was using to keep track of us i had a feeling that just standing in an inconvenient spot wasnt going to net us much of an advantage surrender i said as though trying to place where id heard the word before yeah um im not so sure i want any surrenders today there was a sale on surrenders last week and i missed it but i dont want to rush out and buy another one at the regular price right away im afraid the sale might come back a week later and then i mean come on how stupid would i feel then levity will not change the course of this day sharkface said its buzzing twisting voice was distinctly unpleasant in my ears the aural equivalent of the stench of rotting meat which was appropriate because the rest of him did smell like rotting meat you will come with me isnt that what mab said harry thomas quipped i kept my hand shielded from sharkface with my body and gave my brother the finger look spanky i said to sharkface im a little busy to be tussling with every random weirdo who is insecure about his junk otherwise i would just love to smash you with a beer bottle kick you in the balls throw you out through the saloon doors the whole bit why dont you have your people contact my people and we can do this maybe next week next week is your selfdeprecation awareness seminar thomas said i snapped my fingers what about the week after apartment hunting bother i said well no one can say we didnt try see you later harry said a strange voice or rather it wasnt strangeit was just strange to actually hear it mac isnt much of a talker dont chat kill it macs words seemed to do what none of my nonsense hadthey made sharkface pissed off it whirled toward mac dozens of sackcloth strips flicking out in every direction grabbing whatever objects were there and its alien voice came out in a harsh rasp you sharkface snarled you have no place in this watcher do you think this gesture has meaning it is every bit as empty as you you chose your road long ago have the grace to lie down and die beside it i think my jaw might have hung a little loosely for a second uh mac kill it mac repeated his voice harder its only the first yes sharkface said tilting its head almost to the perpendicular kill it and more will come destroy me and they will know leave me and they will know your breaths are numbered wizard as it spoke i could feel a horrible hopeless weight settling across my heart dammit hadnt i been through enough more than enough hadnt my life handed me enough misery and grief and pain and loneliness already and now i was going to be up against something else something new and scary something that came galumphing at me by the legion no less what was the point no matter what i did no matter how much stronger or smarter or better connected i got the bad guys just kept getting bigger and stronger and more numerous behind me i heard mac let out a low groan the shotgun must have fallen from his fingers because it clattered on the floor on my left i saw thomass shoulders slump and he turned his face away his eyes closed as if in pain the people who stayed near me got hurt or killed as often as not the bad guys got away to come embadden my life another day why deal with a life like that why did i keep on doing this to myself because i growled under my breath youre charlie brown stupid youve got to try for the damned football because thats who you are and just like that the psychic assault of despair that sharkface had sent into my head evaporated and i could think clearly again i hadnt felt the cloying somehow oily power slithering up to mebut i could sure as hell feel it now as it recoiled and pulled away id felt it beforeand i suddenly knew what i was dealing with sharkface jerked its head toward me and its mouth opened in shock for a frozen instant we stared at each other across maybe fifteen feet of cluttered pub it seemed to last for hours thomas and mac were both motionless reaching out for physical supports as though drunk or bearing a heavy burden they wouldnt be able to get themselves out of the building in their current conditionbut i didnt have any choice sharkface and its sackcloth cloak flung half a ton of furniture at me about a quarter of a second after i raised my right hand and snarled fuego i hadnt used much fire magic lately obviously you dont go messing around conjuring up flame when youre at the heart of winter there are things there that hate that action but fire magic has always been my strongest suit it was the first fully realized spell i ever mastered and on a good day i could hang around in the same general league as any other wizard in the world when it came to fire magic on top of that i tapped into the latent energy a particularly meddlesome angel had bestowed upon me whether i wanted it or notan ancient source of the very energy of creation itself known as soulfire soulfire was never meant for battlebut its presence could infuse my battle spells with significant energy and momentum making them far more difficult to counter i had to be careful with itburn too much in too short a time and it would kill me but if i didnt live to walk out of the pub it wouldnt matter how much soulfire i had stored up for a rainy day i expected a roar of flame a flash of white and gold light the concussion of superheated air suddenly expanding right in sharkfaces ugly mug what i got was an arcticgale howl and a spiraling harpoon of bluewhite fire burning hotter than anything this side of a star sharkface hurled furniture at me trying to shelter behind it but the fire id just called vaporized chairs and tables in the instant it touched them they shattered with enormous screaming detonations of thunder and every impact made sounds that by all rights should have belonged to extremely large and poorly handled construction vehicles sharkface crossed its bony grey forearms before it in a lastditch effort to deflect the spell if id been focused on it concentrating on pushing the spell past its defenses maybe it would have burned right through sharkface and its stupid cloak but that wasnt the plan instead i sprinted across the distance between us through the hideous heat of my spells thermal bloom it was like running through an oven i saw my spell splash against sharkfaces crossed forearms and the thing managed to deflect almost all of the spell awaybut not all of it fire scorched across one of its cheeks and splashed over its right shoulder setting a large mass of sackcloth strips aflame it screamed in pain a sound that raked at my ears and began to lower its arms to retaliate the second it did i drove my right fist into its stupid creepy face man the yahoos i scrap with never seem to anticipate that tactic they all assume that what with me being a wizard and all im going to stand back and chuck magic missiles at them or something then scream and run away the second they get close enough to let me see the whites of their eyes okay granted that is how a lot of wizards operate but all the same youd think they would remember that theres no particular reason why a wizard cant be as comfortable with physical mayhem as the next guy two things happened first as my fist sailed forward there was a sudden thrill that flowed up my arm from my hand something delicious and startling i had barely processed that when i heard a crackling noise and then saw glacial blue and green ice abruptly coating my fist second i hit sharkface like a freaking truck starting right on the tip of its chin and driving straight toward south america the ice coating my fist shattered into tiny shards that laced and sliced but i barely felt it sharkface flew back as if id slugged it with a sledgehammer and hit the wall with enough violence to crack and splinter the heavy oak paneling sharkfaces cloak fluttered hard as it went backwardthe freaking thing was cushioning his impact just as it had managed to stop shotgun pellets at short range sharkface bounced off the wall staggering and i gave it a left and another right and then kicked its legs out from underneath it as brutally as i knew how it went to the floor hard once sharkface was down i stomped for its head with my hiking boots going for a quick kill which was exactly what this asshole had coming to it for messing with my favorite jointbut that stupid cloak got in the way strips flew out to gain purchase and hauled him out from beneath my boot even as i reacted moving to follow him up more of the sackcloth tendrils seized a dozen bottles of liquor from behind the barand flung them harshly onto the puddles of vicious bluewhite fire still burning upon the floor where sharkface had deflected them i slashed at the tumbling bottles with an effort of will but i hadnt had a softtouch spell in mind during the previous seconds my clumsy grab accomplished nothing but to shatter one of the bottles early and flames roared up from where the spilled liquor fell alcohol fires are a nasty business booze burns a good deal hotter and faster than for example gasoline in seconds it can take the temperature from below freezing to seven hundred degrees hot enough to turn flesh into briquettes mac and thomas were both down there was no way i could get them both out of the fire in timewhich meant my only option was to stop it from happening sharkface let out an eerie defiant shriek and suddenly vanished into the writhing mass of his coat again becoming nothing but flailing cloth and dust and stench the creature bounded into the air and streaked like a sackcloth comet out the front doorand there was diddly i could do to stop it instead i turned to the fires just as bottles began to shatter on the floor just as whitehot flames began to leap i hurled my will through my body drawing forth the frigid purity of winter calling infriga howling wind and cold engulfed the nascent fires and the floor around where the fires had been and the walls and um the ceiling i mean pretty much every nonliving surface in the place was completely covered in a layer of frost half an inch thick mac and thomas started groaning i gave them a minute to pull themselves together and watched the door sharkface didnt show up for a rematch maybe he was busy changing into fresh undies because id scared him so bad right more likely he was off doing a right stuff walk and gathering his gang the fog lightened and burned off within five minutes or so and the sounds of the city returned the attack was over mac stared woozily around the pub shaking his head covered in glittering frost and ice it looked like the place santas elves must go when they finish their shift at the toy shop mac gave me a look and then gestured at the pub clearly wanting an explanation hey i said crossly at least it didnt get burned to the ground count your blessings man thats better than most buildings get around me thomas sat up a moment later and i helped him to his feet what happened he asked blearily psychic assault i told him a bad one how you feeling confused thomas said he looked around the place shaking his head the pub looked like it had just been raided by super bowlberserk bears fans what was that thing i rubbed at my forehead with the heel of my hand an outsider thomass eyes went wide and round what an outsider i repeated quietly were fighting outsiders chapter twentythree outsiders thomas said are you sure you felt it i said that mental whammy it was exactly like that night in the raith deeps thomas frowned but nodded yeah it was wasnt it mac walked silently past us to the ruined door he bent down and picked something up out of the general wreckage there it was the accorded neutral territory sign it was scorched on one corner but he hung it back up on the wall then he leaned his hands against it and bowed his head i knew how he felt violent encounters tend to be scary and exhausting even if they last for only seconds my nerves were still jangling my legs were trembling a little and i wanted very badly to just plop down onto the floor and breathe for a while i didnt wizards are stoic about this kind of thing and my brother would make fun of me thomas exhaled slowly through his nose his eyes narrowed i dont know much about them he said thats not surprising i said theres not a lot of information on outsiders we think thats because most people who run into them dont get a chance to tell anyone about it lot of things like that in the world thomas said sounds like these things are just a little creepier than your average demonic nasty its more than that i said creatures out of the nevernever are a part of our reality our universe they can get pretty bizarre but they have a membership card outsiders come from someplace else thomas shrugged whats the difference theyre smarter tougher harder to kill you handled that one pretty well didnt look so tough i snorted you missed out on the end i hit that thing with my best shot and i barely made it uncomfortable it didnt leave because i hurt it it left because it didnt expect me to fight clear of its whammy and it didnt want to take any chances that i might get lucky and prevent it from reporting to its superiors still ran thomas said yeah that mindmeld thing was awful but the bastard wasnt all that bad i sighed that little creep peabody dropped one outsider on a meeting of the council the best wizards in the world were all in that one room and took it on together and the thing still managed to murder a bunch of them its hard to make magic stick to outsiders its hard to make them leave its hard to hurt them its hard to make them die theyre insanely violent insanely powerful and just plain insane but that isnt what makes them dangerous uh thomas said it isnt then what is they work together i said quietly near as we can tell they all work together thomas was silent for a moment as he considered the implications of that work together he said to do what i shook my head whatever they do their actions are not always predicated on rationalityor at least thats what the council thinks you sound skeptical the white council always assumes that its at least as smart as everyone else all put together i know better because youre so much smarter than they are thomas said wryly because im on the street more than they are i corrected him the council thinks the outsiders are just a giant box of crazy that can go rampaging in any random direction but you dont think that the phrase crazy like a fox leaps to mind okay so what do you think these outsiders are doing i shrugged im almost certain they arent selling girl scout cookies but dont quote me dont worry i hardly ever want to sound clueless but the fact that theyre working together implies a purpose a goal yes so my brother asked what do they want thomas theyre aliens i mean theyre like supermegaüberaliens they might not even think at least not in the way we understand it how the hell are we supposed to make even an informed guess about their motivationassuming that they have one doesnt matter how weird they are thomas said moving together implies purpose purpose implies a goal goals are universal they arent from this universe thats the point i said maybe youre right i dont know but until i have a better idea its smarter to keep reminding myself that i dont know rather than assuming that i do know and then translating anything i learn to fit my preconceptions heres a fact that is no assumption thomas said they wanted you yeah i said why he asked all i can do is guess so guess i sighed my gut says theyre planning a jailbreak thomas grunted might have been smarter for them to have left you alone now you know something i made an exasperated sound yes those fools by trying to kill me theyve revealed their very souls i have them now thomas gave me a steady look being mabs bitch has made you a pessimist i am not a pessimist i said loftily though that cant last that made thomas grin nice thank you at the door mac looked up suddenly and said dresden thomas tilted his head listening then he said cops i sighed poor guys bet last nights watch hasnt even been released to go home yet theyre going to be cranky the explosion thing thomas asked the explosion thing we didnt need to be detained and questioned all day and i didnt need to get into an altercation with the police eithertheyve got no sense of humor at all for such things you always hear about there being no rest for the wicked but im pretty sure cops arent racking up much extra hammock time either thomas and i traded a look and headed for the door i paused by it and looked at mac it knew you mac stared at nothing and didnt answer mac that thing was dangerous i said and it might come back mac grunted look i said if my guess is right that twit and its buddies might wipe out a big chunk of the state or possibly states if you know something about them i need it mac didnt look up after several seconds he said cant im out look at this place i said quietly you arent out nobody is out drop it he said neutral territory neutral territory that is going to burn with all the rest of it i said i dont care who you are man i dont care what youve done i dont care whether or not you think youre retired from the life if you know something i need it now harry we need to move thomas said urgency tightening his voice i could hear the sirens now they had to be close mac turned and walked back toward his bar dammit i shook my head and turned to leave dresden mac called i turned to look back at him mac was standing behind the bar as i watched he took three bottles of beer from beneath the counter and placed them down in a straight line one by one their sides touching then he just looked up at me three of them i said three of these things hells bells one of them had been bad enough mac neither nodded nor shook his head he just jerked his chin at me and said luck were gonna talk i said to mac mac turned a look on me that was as distant and as inaccessible as antarctic mountains no he said we arent i was going to say something smartass but that bleak expression made it seem like a bad idea so instead i followed my brother up the debrisstrewn stairs and into the rainy morning we passed the first police car to arrive at the scene on our way out driving at the sedate pace of upright citizens i love evading representatives of the lawful authority thomas said watching the car go by in his rearview mirror its one of those little things that make me happy i paused and thought about it me too i mean i know a bunch of these guys some of them are good people some of them are jerks but most are just guys doing a job and its not like sticking us in a room and questioning us is going to accomplish anything to make their day go more smoothly and you enjoy driving authority figures insane thomas said i shrugged i watched the dukes of hazzard at a formative age i said of course i enjoy it where next thomas asked mollys place i thought about it for a minute i didnt think it would be a great idea to be there when fix came looking for a fight svartalves were a little prickly about territory and they might not be at all amused if i dragged a personal conflict into their domain but there were other people i wanted to contact before nightfall and i needed a phone and some quiet workspace to do it in the summer lady has granted your request for an audience said cat sith from the backseat thomas nearly took the hummer off the street and into a bus stop shelter my heart leapt into my throat as if it had been given bionic legs and its own sound effects thomas regained control of the vehicle almost instantly letting out a wordless snarl as he did sith i said too loud my heart was running at double time i glared at him over the front seat dammit the malks toolong tail flicked back and forth in smug selfsatisfaction shall i interpret that as an order to burn something sir knight if you are to survive long in winter you must learn to be much more specific in your turns of phrase no dont burn anything i said grouchily i thought about giving the malk an order not to sneak up on me like that anymore but thought better of it that would be exactly the kind of order that cat sith would take grotesque amusement in perverting and i wanted to avoid putting him into a playful mood what did lily have to say that she would guarantee your safety from harm wrought by herself her court and any in her employ or influence the malk said provided that you came alone and kept the peace i grunted thinking why would she want you alone thomas asked unless she planned on doing something to you because the last time she saw the winter knight he was murdering the previous summer knight i guessed aloud because the last time she saw the corpse of the summer lady i was the one whod made it because im a known thug who wrecks things a lot thomas bobbed his head slightly to one side in acknowledgment okay point sith i asked where is the meeting a public venue sith said his eyes halflidded chicago botanic gardens see i said to thomas thats not a venue for an assassinationfor either of us there are too many people around there are plenty of ways out for anyone who wants to leave thats a viable neutral location if i remember right thomas said the last time the summer lady tried a hit on you didnt she animate a bunch of plants into a giant monster that tried to kill you in the garden center of a walmart i rode in silence for a few seconds and then said yeah but it was dark not as many people around oh thomas said okay i held the back of my left fist up to him then used my right fist to make a little circular cranking motion next to it while slowly elevating the center finger of my left hand until it was fully extended then i turned to sith what do you think is the risk acceptable for a meeting in that location you would be foolish to meet with her at all cat sith replied however given her promise and her chosen location i judge it to be at least possible that she may actually intend to treat with you suppose shes lying thomas said she cant i told him none of the sidhe or the greater powers of either court can tell an outright lie right sith logically speaking my answer to that question would be unsupportable as truth i sighed well thats how it is among them i said no falsehoods they can twist words around they can avoid answering they can mislead you by drawing you to false conclusions but they cant blatantly tell a lie thomas shook his head as he pulled onto and started north i still dont like it that crowd never gives you what you expect think how boring it would be if they did i said we both considered that wistfully for a beat you might have to go in alone thomas said but im going to stay close things go bad just make some noise and ill come in they arent going to go bad i said but even if they do i dont want anyone to get hurt summers weird but theyre basically good neighbors i dont blame them for being jumpy sith made a disgusted sound problem i asked him this compassion the malk said if you prefer i can slash your throat open now sir knight and save the vampire the cost of fuel ive got a better idea i said i want you to stay close to thomas and alert him to any source of danger if a fight breaks out your goal is to assist in making sure that both he and i escape without doing harm to any innocent bystanders and without killing any mortals sith started making a sound like my cat always did right before he spit out a hairball hey thomas said those are custom leather seats sith spit out a glob the size of a small plum but instead of a hairball it was actually a small collection of splintered chips of bone he flicked his tail in scorn and then leapt lightly into the rear bed of the hummer jerk thomas muttered just drive i said he grimaced and did after a few miles he asked you think this is going to work this peaceful summit thing sure i said after a second i added probably probably maybe i said were down to maybe now i shrugged well see chapter twentyfour the botanic gardens of chicago arent actually in chicago which always made them seem a little shady to me badumpbump rain was coming down in fitful little starts averaging out to a mild drizzle the air was cool in the low fifties and combined with the rain it meant that the gardens werent exactly crowded with ardent floraphiles the weather didnt bother me in fact i could have taken the jacket off and felt finebut i didnt my grandfather had taught me that magic wasnt something you used in a cavalier fashion and it wasnt considered to be a seductive corruptive force the way black magic and the winter knights mantle were i had an instinct that the more i leaned on mabs power the more of an effect it would have on me no sense flaunting it once i was inside i found myself in a setting of isolation that would be hard to duplicate anywhere else this close to the city the gardens are the size of a moderate farm more than three hundred acres that wouldnt mean much to city mice but to translate that into chicago units it was a couple of dozen city blocks worth of garden thats a lot of space to wander in you could walk the various paths for hours and hours without ever visiting the same place most of those paths were grey and empty i passed a retiree near the entrance and a groundskeeper hurrying out of the rain toward what looked like a concealed toolshed and other than that it seemed like i had the whole place to myself there were seasonal decorations out here and therea lot of pumpkins and cornstalks where theyd been planning on halloween festivities apparently they were going to be hosting some kind of trickortreating function that afternoon but for the time being the place did not teem with costumed children and bedraggled parents it was a little eerie really the place looked like it should have been crowded and felt like it was meant to be crowded but my soft footsteps were the only sound other than the whisper of rain yet i did not feel as though i were alone you hear the phrase i felt like i was being watched all the time theres a good reason for thatits a very real feeling and it has nothing to do with magic developing an instinct for sensing when a predator might be studying you is a fundamental survival trait if youre ever in a spooky situation and have a strong instinct that you are being watched hunted or followed i advise you not to treat those instincts lightly theyre there for a reason i walked for about five minutes and instinct converted into certainty i was being followed i couldnt spot who was doing it exactly and there were all kinds of plant cover to conceal whoever or whatever was pacing me but i was confident that they were out there maybe my brothers fears hadnt been entirely without merit lily hadnt said where she intended to meet me exactlyor rather i chided myself i hadnt badgered cat sith hard enough for the details the furry jerk had calmly denied me that rather important piece of information simply by never mentioning it and i hadnt questioned him closely enough my own fault id played the malicious obedience card more than a couple of times in my life but this was the first time id had it played against me man no wonder it drives people insane so i started walking the main paths systematically the gardens are built on a series of islands in a little lake joined by footbridges and grouped into themes i found lily waiting on the covered bridge to the japanese garden her long fine hair flowed in gentle waves to the small of her back it was silverwhite evidently the weather didnt bother her either she was dressed in a simple green sundress that fell to her knees the kind of thing youd expect to see in july she had a pastel green sweater folded over one arm for appearances sake brown leather sandals wrapped her feet and their ties crisscrossed around her ankles she stood very still her deep green eyes focused on the ripples the little raindrops sent up on the surface of the lake and if i hadnt known better if i hadnt known lilys features well enough to be sure it was her i would have sworn that i was looking at aurora the summer lady id murdered at the stone table before stepping onto the bridge i paused for a moment to look around me to truly focus my senses there in the bushessomething that moved with feline smoothness paced me in utter silence more presences filled the water stirring up more ripples than the rain could account for and on the far side of the bridge a number of presences lurked veiled by magic that kept me from knowing anything about them beyond the fact of their existence i figured that there were at least twice as many guardians present the ones i couldnt sense without really buckling down they would probably be the most capable and powerful of lilys escort too if lily meant to do me harm walking out onto that bridge was a great way to trap myself and an absolutely fantastic place in which to be shot the railing on either side was of light fine material and would provide no real cover there were an almost unlimited number of places where a rifleman could be lying in wait if i went out there and lily meant to hurt me id have a hell of a time arguing with her but shed given her word that she wouldnt i tried to look at this from her point of viewafter all i hadnt given my word and even if i had i could always break it had i intended to attack lily the bridge presented her with an opportunity to block me in to slow me down while she and her people escaped screw this i didnt have time to waffle i hunched my shoulders hoped no one was about to shoot me again and strode out onto the bridge lily didnt give any indication that shed noticed me until i got to within about ten feet of her then she simply lifted her eyes from the water though she never looked at me id been the one to ask for this meeting i stopped gave her a bow and said thank you for meeting me lady summer she inclined her head the slightest visible degree sir knight been a while i said relative to what she asked life i guess i said much has happened she agreed wars have raged empires have fallen she finally turned her head to regard me directly friends have changed lily had been gorgeous as a mortal woman after becoming the summer lady her beauty had been magnified into something that was only barely human something so tangible and intense that it shone out from her like light flowing out of her skin it was a different kind of beauty from mabs or maeves their loveliness was an emptiness looking on them created nothing but desire a need that cried out to be filled by contrast lilys beauty was a fire a source of light and warmth something that created a profound sense of satisfaction looking at lily made the pains of my heart ease and i suddenly felt like i could breathe freely for the first time in months and some other part of me abruptly filled my mind with a violent and explicit imagemy fist tangled in lilys hair that soft gentle mouth under mine her body writhing beneath my weight as i took her to the ground it wasnt an idle thought and it wasnt a daydream and it wasnt a fantasy it was a blueprint if lily was immortal i couldnt kill her that didnt mean i couldnt take her i forgot how to speak for a couple of seconds as i fought the image out of my forebrain then i forced myself to look away from her out to the water of the lake i leaned down on the guardrail gripping it with my hands i was a little worried that if i didnt give them something to do they might try something stupid i took a cleansing breath and reengaged my speech centers im not the only one whos changed since that day i could feel her eyes on me intently studying my face i had a feeling that she knew exactly what id just felt true she murmured but weve made our choices havent we and now we are who we are i am sorry if i made you uncomfortable sir knight what just now i saw her nod in my peripheral vision a moment ago you looked at me i have seen a face with that precise expression before slate yes well i growled im not slate im not some pet monster maeve made to play with no lily said her voice sad you are a weapon mab made to war with you poor man you always had such a good heart had i asked it isnt yours any longer lily said quietly i disagree i said strenuously and the need you felt a moment ago she asked did that urge come from your heart sir knight yes i said simply lily froze for a second her head tilting slightly to one side bad things are inside everyone i said i dont care how gentle or holy or sincere or dedicated you are there are bad things in there lust greed violence you dont need a wicked queen to make that happen thats a part of everyone some more some less but its always there you say that you were this wicked from the beginning lily asked im saying i could have been i said i chose something else and im going to continue choosing something else lily smiled faintly and looked back at the lake you wished to speak to me about my knight fix yeah i said he basically gave me until noon to leave town or we shoot it out at the ok corral im busy i dont have time to skip town but i dont want either of us to get hurt what do you wish me to do tell him to stand down i said even if only for a few days its important lily bowed her head it grieves me to say this sir knight but no i will not i tried not to grind my teeth audibly and why not she studied me again her green eyes intense can it be she asked can it be that you have come so far have fallen in with your current company without realizing what is happening here uh i said frowning you mean here today i mean here lily said in our world yeah uh maybe you havent heard but i havent been in our world much lately lily shook her head the pieces are all in front of you you have only to assemble them vague much i asked why cant you just tell me what the hell youre talking about if you do know there is no need to speak if you truly do not know no amount of speech will convince you some things must be learned for oneself i made a disgusted sound and spit into the lake take that lurking bodyguards lily i said look this isnt complicated fix is about to come at me i dont want to hurt him so i came here in peace to try to talk it out what have i done here today that has convinced you that im some kind of psychotic maniac who cant be trusted it isnt anything youve done lily said it isnt anything you had any control over you didnt know i threw up my hands at that didnt know what lily frowned and studied me her expression drawn with worry you she shook her head god harry you really mean it you arent her creature no i said not yet lily nodded and seemed to think for a moment then she asked would it pain you for me to touch you why i asked because i must know she said i must know if it is upon you yet what she shook her head i cannot risk answering any questions until i am sure i grunted i thought about it yeah i could keep my inner caveman on a leash if it meant getting some answers okay i said go ahead lily nodded then she walked toward me she reached up and her slender warm fingers touched my forehead like a mother checking a child for a temperature she stayed that way for a long moment her eyes distant then abruptly she let out a little cry and flung her arms around me oh she said oh oh oh we thought you taken okay inner caveman or not when a girl that pretty is giving you a fullbody hug you dont come up with the wittiest dialogue uh i havent had a girlfriend for a while now lily leaned her head back and laughed the sound of it was like eating hot cookies melting into a warm shower and snuggling a fuzzy puppy all at the same time enough she said enough come out he is a friend and just like that faeries popped out of absolutely everything in sight elves tiny humanoids no more than a couple of feet high rose up out of the bushes a serpent the size of a telephone pole slithered out of the bridges rafters seven or eight silvercoated faerie hounds emerged from behind a stand of groomed arbor vitae two massive centaurs and half a dozen sidhe of the summer court simply blinked into visibility from behind their veils they were all armed with bows yikes if id meant lily any harm my body would have resembled a feathery porcupine the water stirred and then a number of otters who were all too big to have been born this side of the last ice age came rushing out eeaye eeaye oh i said uh wow all this for me only a fool wouldnt respect your strength she said particularly now personally i thought shed gotten to overkill about one elf after those bows but i didnt want her to know that okay i said you touched me make with some answers certainly she said then she moved her hand and the open air suddenly had the enclosed feeling of a small room when she spoke her voice sounded odd as if it were coming over a radio shed put up a privacy spell so that no one could listen in what would you like to know um right i said why did you touch my head like that what were you looking for a disease she replied a parasite a poison could you repeat that answer only without the poetry lily faced me squarely her lovely face intent sir knight you must have seen it you must have seen the contagion spreading it has been before your eyes for years i havent seen then i paused my head started adding things together you you arent talking about a physical disease are you of course not lily said it is a kind of spiritual malady a mental plague an infection slowly spreading across the earth and this plague what does it do i asked it changes that which ought not change she said quietly it destroys a fathers love for his family by twisting it into maniacal ambition it distorts and corrupts the good intentions of agents of mortal law into violence and death it erodes the sensible fear that keeps a weakly talented sorcerer from reaching out for more power no matter how terrible the cost i felt my head rock back as if shed slammed a croquet mallet into it and the bottom dropped out of my stomach again victor sells the shadowman i whispered agent denton and the hexenwolves leonid kravos the nightmare my first three major cases yes lily whispered each of them was tainted by the contagion it destroyed them i put a hand on the rail and leaned against it fourth case aurora a champion of peace and healing who set out to send the natural world into havoc lilys eyes glistened with tears i saw what it did to her she said i didnt know what was happening to my friend but i saw it changing her twisting her day by day i loved aurora like a sister sir knight but in the end even i could see what she had become tears fell and she made no effort to wipe them away i saw i knew in the end you may have killed her harry but you also did her a kindness i shook my head i i dont understand why you didnt want to tell me about it no one who knows of this speaks of it lily said why not dont you see lily said what if you had been tainted as well and i revealed to you that i recognized what was happening i kicked my brain into gear and thought uh then i felt sick youd be a threat id have to kill you to keep you quiet or make you the next recruit exactly lily said but why suspect me of being tainted i heard my own voice trail off as i realized the only thing that could have moved lily against me so strongly be at ease lily said and beckoned and freaking maeve the winter lady strolled onto the far end of the bridge and sauntered toward us she was dressed in leather pants of dark purple and a periwinkle sweater whose sleeves fell past the ends of her fingers and her mouth was curled into a tiny wicked smirk hey there big guy she purred lily give you the skinny not yet lily said maeve this isnt the sort of thing one should simply ram down anothers throat of course it is maeve said her smile widening maeve lily began maeve did a little pirouette that wound up with her toes practically touching mine as she smiled up at me her toosharp teeth very white do you have a camera i want someone to get a picture oh dear lily said maeve leaned in close her smile widening mab she breathed my mother the queen of air and darkness and your liege she leaned closer and whispered mab has been tainted and has gone utterly mad my spine turned to brittle ice what lily looked up at me with a sad sober expression maeve let out a peal of giggles its true she said she means to destroy the mortal world wizard and to do it this very nightto unleash chaos and havoc that have not been known since the fall of atlantis and make no mistake she will destroy it lily nodded her eyes pained unless she began unless i finished the thought lily obviously did not want to complete unless i whispered someone destroys her first chapter twentyfive this day had begun so simply id nearly been killed at my birthday party and mab had ordered me to kill an immortal id survived the first and if id had the good sense to shut up and do the second without asking questions i might be somewhere reading a nice book or something and waiting out the clock until it was maevewhacking time instead i had this i love watching him think maeve told lily you can almost hear that poor little hamster running and running on its wheel you clubbed him over the head with it lily said what did you expect oh this maeve said her eyes sparkling wizards are always so sure of themselves i love seeing them off balance this one in particular why me i said i wasnt really participating in their conversation you did kill my cousin wizard maeve said aurora was a prissy little bint but she was family it makes me happy when you suffer i glowered at maeve and said one of these days you and i are going to disagree i turned to lily you say mab wants to hold an armageddonthon fine how is she going to do it we arent completely certain lily said her eyes earnest its something to do with that island maeve said carelessly gulp wrecking someones powerful and deadly ritual wasnt such a scary concept id done that before more than once but somehow knowing that it was mabs ritual i was supposed to derail made this situation a whole lot worse id seen mab before with the unadulterated perception of my sight and i remembered the kind of might she wielded with absolute clarity mab had the kind of power you had to describe using exponents i felt like a man with a shovel and a couple of gunnysacks who has just been told to stop an oncoming tsunami and mab knew the place shed taken care of me for months there she knew demonreachs strengths its defenses and its potential hell id been her ticket through the doorin fact i was the only one who could have gotten her onto that island you know i said aloud its just possible that i made a mistake in taking mabs deal the two ladies gave me level gazes neither of them said obviously but it hung on the spellmuffled air nonetheless then i had a thought cat sith had lied to me very effectively only moments ago because i assumed reasonable things and he allowed me to charge off down that line of thinking this was no time to make a rookie mistake like that okay i said im going to do something i know you both hate im going to get direct and im going to get direct answers from you answers that convince me that you arent trying to hide anything from me and arent trying to mislead me i know you both have to speak the truth so give me simple declarative answers or i assume youre scheming and walk away right now that made lily press her lips together and fold her arms her gaze turned reproachful maeve rolled her eyes casually gave me the finger and said wizards are such weasels deal with it i said lily are you sure that this contagion you speak of is real and works the way you say it does lily looked like opening her mouth exposed her taste buds to something foul but she answered absolutely are you sure mab has been been infected i am all but certain lily said but i have not examined her for myself i have maeve said calmly while you and my people were putting on such a garish distraction at that dreary little celebration of your birth sir knight she stretched and yawned making sure to pull her sweater tight against her chest that was the purpose of it after all i scowled you examined mab yes and youre sure shes infected i asked for just a fraction of a second maeves smug exterior changed becoming graver more somber in that instant she and lily looked as though they might have been fraternal twins with absolute certainty and youre sure she means to attack the mortal world as youve described that serious version of maeve met my eyes yes she said think wizard remember your godmother bound in ice at arctis tor that was when my mother trapped her and spread the contagion into her think of the creatures of faerie wyld who have been behaving irregularly and unpredictably think of the strange conduct of some of the houses of the white court changing their diets after centuries of stasis think of the fomor active and aggressive again for the first time in millennia she stepped up close to me none of these things is coincidence it spreads a force that will upend the world and all of us with it and what has happened until now is nothing compared to what will come if mab is not stopped before the sun rises once more maeve stepped back from me watching me her exotic eyes opaque silence fell within the little privacy spell well crap that was pretty much that neither of the ladies could speak a direct lie i hadnt left them any room to dance around the truth they were serious i guess it was possible that they might have been mistaken but they were damned well sincere neither of us can stop her lily said into that silence even working together we do not have anything like the power needed to overcome mabs defenses and she would never lower her guard for either of us but for you maeve said her knight lily said her champion she might not be quite so guarded maeve said her eyes shining feverbright you have power enough to smite her if you strike when she is unprepared what i blurted what we ask you is not fair lily said we know tha she glanced at maeve well i know that but we have no other options uh yes you do i said what about titania the queen of summer is an equal opposite isnt she mabs mirror the two ladies exchanged a guarded look out with it i said were way past word games here lily nodded she refuses to act i do not know why because shes terrified shell be infected too obviously maeve snapped guys i said i have seen what mab is even if i catch her off guard i dont have the kind of clout it takes to drop someone in her league lily blinked at me several times but but you do you have winter which is meaningful because because she is winter maeve said the winter within you is mab and she is it the one thing you can never protect yourself against is yourself you of all people should know this wizard i shuddered i did the winter knight is a useful weapon maeve said but it has ever been one with two edges mab stands no mightier than any of the sidhe against your hand sir knight i narrowed my eyes at maeve wait a minute i said why in the hell should i think youre trying to help me since when have you cared about the mortal world maeve her smile widened since i realized that should my mother fall i will have a very large and very exclusive chair to sit upon back at arctis tor wizard do not think for a moment that i do it from the kindness of my heart i want the throne now that was a scary thought mab was a force of nature sure but she also acted a lot like one she rarely took things personally she didnt play favorites and she was generally speaking equally dangerous to everyone maeve though that bitch was just not right the thought of her with mabs mantle of power was something terrifying to anyone with half a brainespecially the guy who would be her personal champion i dont dig the idea of serving you maeve i said at that the lazy sexkitten look came back into her eyes i havent yet begun to persuade you wizard but be assured that i would never ever throw away a tool so useful as you would be should you succeed even if it might slice into you next i asked maeve laughed oh i am going to love playing games with you sir knight but first things first you have no choice but to act if you do not millions of your fellow mortals will perish in the end you will act to protect them that is what you are lady maeve has a point lily said with evident reluctance there is very little time i understand your trepidation about the consequences of mabs passing but we have little choice she is simply too dangerous to be allowed to continue i made a low growling sound this is insane fun maeve said her nose wrinkling isnt it i eyed both of them what are you holding back from me lily twitched again and looked displeased at the question no one must realize that you know of the contagion she said you cannot know which of your allies or associates it has already taken if you demonstrate awareness anyone infected will either remove you or infect you anything else i asked her i will speak to fix lily said otherwise no i nodded at her then i eyed maeve what about you holding anything back i want to take you to my bower wizard maeve said and licked her lips i want to do things to you that give you such pleasure your brain bleeds uh i said her foxlike smile sharpened also she said my people are about to attempt to kill you lilys eyes snapped toward maeve widening i promised him nothing maeve said with a sniff and there are appearances to keep up after all i am certain my mother has eyes watching his every move he can hardly meet peaceably with me without making her suspicious ah lily said nodding oh dear maeve leaned toward me taking a confidential tone they dont know of the contagion either wizard so their attempts will be quite sincere i advise you to resist strenuously seven figures stepped around a corner of the garden on the far side of the bridge and began striding purposefully toward our little gathering sidhe the redcap strode along in the center hells bells i snarled taking an involuntary step back right here now you could have given me a couple of minutes to get clear dammit and what fun would that be maeve asked pushing out her lower lip in a pout i am who i am too i love violence i love treachery i love your painand the best part the part i love most is that i am doing it for your own good her eyes gleamed white all the way around her irises this is me being one of the good guys im so sorry harry lily said i didnt want this i think you should go she turned aside to maeve so that the winter lady can introduce me to her vassals this is the first time weve met maeve blinked and her expression darkened into a scowl oh oh you prissy bint lily said with utmost sincerity i regret that this inconveniences your enjoyment lady but protocol is quite clear maeve stomped one foot on the bridge scowled at me and then seized lily by the wrist she started dragging the summer lady toward her oncoming entourage lily gave me a quick wink the expression as pleasant as the warmth from a cup of hot chocolate and i started backing off once i was off the bridge i turned and began to run there was no telling how long lilys tactic would stall the redcap and his buddies and i wanted to be in the truck and gone before introductions were made that plan was going pretty well right up until i passed a huge wall of thick evergreen plants of some kind then something small and blurry shot out of the brush about half a step ahead of me i got a flash impression of captain hook in his miniature armor trailing some kind of heavy cord and then my feet were tangled in it and down i went i tried to be cool and roll into the fall and come back up on my feet but that works a lot better when you dont have one of your legs abruptly jerked out from beneath you so mostly i hit the ground in a clumsy sprawl then slid several feet forward on the damp concrete with my weight on my chest and my cheek ow i got back onto my feet moving as fast as i could i didnt feel like getting stabbed with more of those steel nails and my eyes went up to the open sky scanning quickly for any incoming hostile little folk as i got moving again so i wasnt as ready as i should have been when a man in biker leathers emerged from the brush at my side and slammed a baseball bat into the base of my skull my legs turned to jelly and i went down hard landing on my chin i sort of flopped over onto my back dazed lifting my hands in a vague and useless defensive gesture i took the tip of a motorcycle boot directly to the testicles and my whole world went bright with confusion and pain yeah snarled the man he was of medium height and had curly dark hair and a short goatee thats right bitch whos crawling on the ground now asking the question seemed to infuriate him he slammed a kick into my ribs then another right into the breadbasket and i curled around myself gasping i had to move the redcap was coming i hadnt made any noise to tip thomas off that i was in troublebut even as heavily boosted as i was it wasnt enough to instantly overcome the stunning pain of those blows shots like that mess around with your nervous system disrupting the machinery that sends signals around your body i wasnt going anywhere for a few more seconds nail him the man spat and those frozen spikes of raw agony id felt before blossomed into my body from my right arm my left calf and somewhere in my lower back i heard the buzz of little wings as my attackers zipped past me driving nails in like harpoons into a floundering whale it hurt so much that i could barely open my eyes and look up at my attacker i recognized him ace a changeling one of his parents mortal the other fae he was the onetime victim of lloyd slate the onetime betrayer of fix and lily and a girl named meryl he stared down at me with hatefilled eyes and bounced an aluminum baseball bat a few times in his hand ive been waiting years for this and then he started clubbing me over the head chapter twentysix taking a beating well is not for amateurs you have to get started early maybe by getting beaten up a lot as a child in school then you refine your raw talent by taking more beatings as you get older generally you can seek out almost any crew of athletic types and youll find several willing to oblige you under one guise or another true craftsmen then seek out gifted individuals with a particular skill set to deliver the most skilled and professional beatings thats how you learn to fight really you take beatings and you get tougher and if you dont start avoiding all the fights you continue taking beatings until you learn how its done or they kill you some guys are born lucky with mad natural fighting skills and they hardly ever take a beatingbut thats never been me ive had to learn the hard way like every other kind of pain beatings are educational ace started swinging the aluminum bat and i learned two things about him right away first he wasnt any stronger than any other guy about his sizedont get me wrong that was plenty strong enough to kill me at the moment but he wasnt going to deliver the coup de grâce by dropping a forklift on my head second he was emotionally invested see beatings have only a couple of purposes you are either deterring someone from somethingflirting with your girl stealing your wallet strangling you whateverin which case the point of the beating is to convey a very simple message stop it the second reason to deliver a beating is to simply inflict pain theres no actual reason involved of course its all an emotional drive a need to make someone hurt sometimes that kind of drive is well justified sometimes its misdirected rage and sometimes maybe more often than we really want to believe people just enjoy making someone else feel pain the third motivation for a beating is to kill someone theres some bleedover ah hah between the second reason and the third ace was handing me a beating of the second kind he wasnt thinking he had a need to make me feel pain and i was obliging the hell out of him the nails were the worst like frozen points of pure fire in my flesh beside that agony the first couple of blows from the bat were a dull ache i got my arms between my noggin and the bat getting the meat of my forearms in the way wherever i could arm bones are considerably less robust than broomsticks and a solid swing with a club will snap them get the muscle and soft tissue in the way though and it spreads out the impact both in surface area and in duration it disperses the forceand hurts like a son of a bitch he swung at me several times i blocked some one clipped my forehead i wriggled out of the way of the rest the bat throwing up chips from the concrete sidewalk i kicked at his knees with my feet though i was in a poor position to do it that was the part of the conflict that was important to me meanwhile i gave ace the part that was important to him i screamed it didnt take a lot in the way of method acting to make it convincing the nails hurt so badly i was pretty much going to start screaming anyway so i screamed bloody murder and he all but frothed at the mouth as he kept after me swinging faster more powerfullyand more erratically swinging a club down at a struggling target is harder work than everyone thinks it is and doing that and dodging clumsy kicks at the same time is the kind of aerobic workout you just dont get at the gym the longer it went on the heavier he would be breathing and the more intently he would be focused on me screaming howling very noisy me see surprises like this are exactly why you bring backup in the first place i knew i couldnt last more than a few seconds against aces onslaught i also knew how fast my brother could run but someone else got there first i heard a pair of light steps and then ace grunted i looked up through my impactnumbed arms and saw him swing the bat again this time at a standing target the bat lashed out and never stopped moving in its arc but suddenly there was a small figure rolling up close to ace coming between his chest and the bat in his extended arm they whirled in a circle following the spin of the bat and aces heels abruptly flipped up into the air over his head and he landed emptyhanded on the concrete with a gasp of pain a woman stood over him she was five nothing and built with the kind of lithe solid power that youd expect in an olympic gymnast who had stayed fit as she aged her blond hair was cut short to fingerlength shed had a pert upturned nose the last time id seen her it had been broken since then and while it had healed i could see the slight bump the break had left she had on jeans and a denim jacket and her eyes were blue and blazing ace started to get up but a motorcycle boot much smaller than his own slammed down on his chest karrin murphy scowled at him tossed the bat into the bushes and said in a hard voice stay down creep only warning it was difficult to translate frantic thought into verbalization through the pain of the cold iron piercing my skin but i managed to gasp incoming murphys eyes snapped around her scanning in every direction including up and she saw the first of the armored little folk diving down at her her hand snatched something out of her jacket pocket and with a flick of her wrist she snapped out a small collapsible baton the little folk darted down upon her like a squad of angry wasps she didnt try to evade them she planted her feet and began snapping the little baton with sharp precise motions there wasnt really time for her to aim at anythingshe was running on pure reflex murphyd been a martial arts practitioner since she was a child mainly in aikido along with several others aikido included all kinds of fun areas of study and one of them was learning how to handle a sword i knew that shed also been spending a lot of time training with a gang of ancient einherjaren postdead norse warriors of valhalla i doubt any of her teachers had trained her for this situation but theyd come close enough that little baton was a blur as it moved in half a dozen quick sharp strokes batting away the incoming little folk one by one there were several sounds of impact and then a sharp ping and then a miniature clatter as captain hook was struck from the air and went into a sprawling crash on the ground there were a series of highpitched shrieks of panic and the little folk vanished beginning to end that little fracas had lasted maybe five seconds i started fumbling at the nails still sticking out of me but ace and his baseball bat had left my fingers numb and useless i managed to pull the one in my arm out with my teeth which was unpleasant in a dimension i hardly knew existed i spit out the nail and heard myself making short desperate sounds of pain murphy took several steps back until her heel bumped my shoulder then she stepped carefully over my body never taking her eyes off the downed ace how bad i managed to grate out nails the bushes crashed and thomas appeared from them pistol in one hand that insanely big gurkha knife in the other his gun tracked to murphy then snapped upward and retrained upon the downed ace oh hi karrin thomas murphy said shortly she looked down at me i tried to gesture at the nails still sticking in me but given the state of my hands and arms i managed only to flail around weakly dammit harry hold still it didnt take her long two quick tugs and the nails were free the level of pain i was experiencing dropped to maybe a tenth of what it had been i sagged in relief how bad thomas asked one of these wounds is bleeding not bad murphy reported jesus his arms we need to get out i said my voice sounded raw to me trouble coming no said a beautiful sidhe baritone trouble is here they appeared from behind their veils one by one with so much melodrama that i was mildly surprised that they hadnt each struck some kind of kung fu pose the redcap with his red beret was in the center of the group the others were spread out around us in a semicircle pinning us against the hedge behind us they were all holding blades and guns they looked more like models at a photo shoot than actual warriors but i knew better the sidhe are prancy but fierce ace let out a croaking laugh you see he said toward the redcap you needed my help after all the redcap gave ace a glance and a small shrug that seemed to acknowledge the point well the vampire and the fallen woman i cannot comprehend how you manage to convince yourself that you are some kind of heroic figure dresden given the company you keep that got a laugh from the other sidhe who probably hadnt seen much comedy in the past few years i heaved a few times and managed to sit up murphy leaned back out of my way she said to thomas who are these clowns rambo there in the middle is the redcap thomas said pretty big hitter in faerieland i guess the others are his lickspittles ooh i said lickspittles nice thank you thomas said gravely and they have a problem with dresden i take it murphy asked wanna kill him or something i dont know thomas said nodding they tried it on jet skis earlier today roger moore bond villains murphy asked her tone derisive seriously be silent mortal cow snarled one of the sidhe murphy tracked her eyes calmly over to that one and she nodded once as if memorizing something yeah okay you the sidhe fingered his weapons beautiful features twisting into a scowl i tried to rise but by the time i got to one knee i felt like crawling into a dark room and crying while throwing up i stopped there and fought back the dizzies that tried to take me back down i was feeling stronger than before already if id had half an hour i think i could have been ready to do something vaguely like magical violence but i didnt have half an hour i couldnt fight our way out of this and if they didnt have me supporting them i was pretty sure karrin and thomas couldnt do it either we needed another option look red i said you made your play at my party and it didnt turn out so well for you thats fine no hard feelings you tried to kill me and my friends out on lake michigan this morning and i can see why you would that didnt go so swell for you either so what makes you think its going to turn out well for you now i like my chances said the redcap smiling no reason this has to get ugly i said in reply there was something playful in his voice as he responded is there not we can stop this right here turn around and walk away well do the same well let ace here go free as soon as we get to our cars oh kill him if you wish to the redcap said absently the halfblood is nothing to me ace let out a hissing sound and stared at the redcap you arent the redcap said calmly i have made that clear several times but i i snared him for you ace said i slowed him down if i hadnt you wouldnt have caught up to him the redcap shrugged without ever glancing at the young man and i find that extremely convenient but i never asked you to help and i certainly never asked you to be so incompetent as to be captured by the prey i was glad molly wasnt around because the hate that suddenly flared out from ace was so palpable that even i felt it i could hear his teeth grinding and the sudden flush of anger on his face was like something out of a comic book aces body tensed as though he were preparing to fling himself to his feet at that the redcap turned a toowide sidhe smile on his face and faced ace for the first time ah there you may not have talent but at least you have spirit perhaps if you survive the night we can discuss your future ace just sat there seething staring daggers at the redcap and everyone was focused on the two of them which was why no one but me noticed when the situation silently changed the redcap looked back at me and said have the vampire kill the halfblood if you wish ill happily trade my sons life for yours dresden there are sidhe who get all sentimental about their offspring but i cant say ive ever been one of them he focused on me and drew a small knife from his pocket snapping out the blade it was an instrument for killing at intimate distance companions he said a smug edge to his voice with whom should we begin the air crackled with sudden tension the sidhe stared with toobright eyes their fingers settling on the hilts and grips of various weapons this was going to be bad i couldnt fight karrin couldnt possibly keep up with attackers who both outnumbered her and operated with superhuman speed and nearinvisibility the sidhe could defend themselves against my magic unless i was able to throw absolutely everything at one of themand i wouldnt get that chance against half a dozen physically i was pretty much useless for the moment thomas might make it out but when this crystalline moment of stillness finally broke i was pretty sure karrin and i wouldnt unless someone broke it exactly right hey i said innocently werent there seven of you guys a minute ago the redcap tilted his head at me and then glanced left and right five other sidhe looked back at him except on the far side of their line on my left the sidhe warrior who had been there was gone the only thing remaining where hed been standing was a single expensive designer tennis shoe right then in the exact instant of realization screams truly agonized screams erupted from several yards away in the brush there was a crystalline almost belllike quality to the voice and the sound was terrifying nothing that a human would ever make then there was a horrible retching sound and the screams ended there was a stunned silence and then an object came sailing out of the brush and landed at the feet of the sidhe nearest to the one who had been taken it was a horrible collection of bloody bone maybe a foot and a half longa section of spine ripped clear of its body bits of tissue still clinging to it that got a reaction from everyone the redcap dropped into a crouch hands up in a defensive posture several sidhe took rapid steps back holy mother of god murphy breathed everyones eyes were fixed on the grisly missile lying on the sidewalk so their heads werent directed toward the future werent able to see that the situation was about to change again hey i said in exactly the same tone werent there six of you guys a minute ago eyes swept back up in time to see the brush swaying where something had dragged the sidhe from the opposite end of the line on my right side into the bushes and more screams erupted clawing at the raindrizzled air sith hissed one of the female sidhe her widened eyes darting everywhere followed by the barrel of her compositematerial pistol cat sith her attention wasnt on me and i took the opening i slammed my will down through my numbed right arm snarling forzare at the same instant thomas turned his gun on the redcap and opened fire invisible force hit the female sidhe with more or less the same energy as a small car doing twentyfive or thirty it should have been a lot more than that and focused on a smaller area but in my current condition it was everything i had thrown into the best single punch i could throw she hadnt been able to counter the spell as it struck and was flung back away from me she bounced once in a bed of flowers and then tumbled into the lake meanwhile the redcap and the other sidhe darted in every direction and blurred to nearinvisibility behind their veils thomas might have hit one of them it was hard to hear any sounds of impact or screams of pain over the thunder of the ridiculously large rounds used in his desert eagle other guns went off too adrenaline surged and i shoved myself to my feet shouting fall back something flashed by me and then cat sith appeared from behind his own veil leaping with all four paws extended his claws unsheathed he landed on what looked like empty air and his legs moved in a blur of ripping supernaturally powerful strikes blood fountained from the empty air and sith bounded away vanishing again as one of the sidhe appeared in the space where sith had been the sidhes upper body was a mass of blood and shredded flesh his expression shocked he crumpled slowly to the ground his eyes wide as if trying to see through complete darkness his hands clenched aimlessly a few times and then he went still i turned to run and staggered woozily karrin saw it and darted in close to my side preventing me from falling she didnt see ace behind her produce a small pistol and aim it at her back i shouted and lurched down on top of him the gun went off once and then i had his gun arm pinned to the ground beneath both of my forearms and the whole weight of my body ace cursed and swung a fist at me i slammed my forehead into his nose a bunch of times it took the fight out of him and his head wobbled dazedly there was a highpitched shriek and a tiny armored form covered in fishhooks hurtled into my face and neck my injuries swelled into agony again as the damned little metal hooks pierced my skin i got a quick glimpse of a miniature sword flashing toward my eye i flinched in a big roll that took me off of ace flinging my head in a circle to counter the motion of the little sword with centrifugal force it cut into my eyebrow and missed my eyeball and a flood of scarlet blocked out half of my vision after that things were fuzzy i swatted at captain hook with my forearm and on the third blow the barbed hooks tore free of my skin a hand with the strength of a hydraulic crane gripped the back of my coat and dragged me to my feet and then my brother was helping me move i sensed karrin on my blind side shouting something to thomas and then the desert eagle started thundering on that side of my body a sidhe exploded from the brush visible and wounded with cat sith in hot pursuit the sidhe leapt into the air shimmered and transformed into a hawk with golden brown feathers its wings beat twice gaining maybe ten feet of altitudeuntil cat sith sailed through the air in a spectacular pounce landed on the hawks back and they both plunged down into the waters of the lake after that there was a lot of movement that hurt like hell and i would have fallen a dozen times without my brothers support then i was being half thrown into the back of the hummer coming down on the custom leather seats hard and too exhausted to do more than pull my feet in so that they wouldnt get slammed in the door both of the front doors opened and closed and the engine already running roared to life the acceleration pressing me back against the seat for a moment we drove for a few minutes before i was able to start sitting up when i finally did i found thomas driving with karrin riding shotgun holding thomass desert eagle in her hands and turned in the seat to steadily watch the road behind us my brother glanced up at me in the rearview mirror and winced you look awful i could see out of only one eye i reached up to the other one with my hand and found blood smearing it shut and beginning to dry i leaned to look in the rearview mirror i had quite a bit of blood on that side of my head the hooks had made some messy if not large holes in my skin when they came out karrins eyes flicked toward me for just a second and she might have gotten a little pale but she didnt let any other emotion touch her face looks like were clear no one back there thomas grunted they can use magic and harry left a bunch of blood on the ground if they want to follow us they can dammit murphy breathed castle and have marcones people cleaning the blood off him thomas asked fuck that amen i agreed woozily where else then karrin asked your apartment thomas shook his head emphatically too many people will see us taking him in theyll call the authorities and lara has eyes on the place if i take a wounded wizard in there shed show up faster than jimmy johns he grunted in discomfort as the truck hit a bump in the road karrin turned toward him and leaned over to examine him youre hit only one thomas said calmly if it was bad id have bled out by now gut shot dont worry about it dont be an idiot karrin said you know how easy it is for these things to go septic youve got to take care of this yeah as soon as we stop somewhere mollys place karrin said its under the aegis of svartalfheim no ones getting in there without a major assault right i said the word slurring a little there dammit dresden karrin said her voice exasperated just lie down until we can look at you i threw her a salute with my right hand and paused feeling an unfamiliar weight on my arm i looked captain hook dangled from it half a dozen of his armors barbs caught in the denim of my jacket i peered at the tiny armored figure and then poked him with a fingertip he let out a semiconscious little moan but the hooks had effectively immobilized him huh i said then i cackled hah hah hah heh hahhah thomas glanced over his shoulder and blinked several times what the hell is that a priceless intelligence asset i replied thomas lifted his eyebrows youre going to interrogate that little guy if molly has a turkey baster maybe you can waterboard him murphy said in an acid tone relax i said and drive we need to i forgot what i had been about to say we needed to do i guess all that cackling had really taken it out of me the world turned sideways and the leather of the backseat pressed up against my unwounded cheek it felt cool and nice which was a stark contrast to the waves of pure ache and steady burn that pulsed through my body with every heartbeat the world didnt fade to black so much as turn a dark restless red chapter twentyseven i woke up when someone shoved a branding iron into my neck okay that isnt what happened but i was coming out of unconsciousness at the time and that was what it seemed like i let out a curse and flailed with my arms hold him hold him someone said in an intent voice hands came down on my arms pressing them back against a smooth rigid surface beneath me harry thomas said harry easy easy youre safe there were lights in my eyes they werent pleasant i squinted against them until i could see thomass upsidedown head looming over me there you are thomas said we were getting worried he lifted his hands from my arms and gave the side of my face something somewhere between a pat and a slap you werent waking up i looked around me i was lying on the table in mollys apartment the same spot where wed seen to toots injuries earlier in the day there was the sharp smell of disinfectant in the air i felt terrible but less terrible than i had in the car i turned my head and saw a wiry little guy with a shock of black hair a beaky nose and glittering intelligent eyes he picked up a metal bowl in one hand and moved a pair of needlenose pliers in the other dropping something into the bowl with a clink and he just wakes up waldo butters chicagos most polkasavvy medical examiner asked tell me that isnt a little creepy what are you talking about i said butters held up the metal bowl tilting it so that i could see inside several tiny bright sharp bloodied pieces of metal were inside barbs from those fishhooks he said several of them broke off in your skin i grunted my collapse in the car made more sense now yeah i said any kind of iron gets under my skin it seems to disagree with the winter knights bundle of awesome takes the gumption right out of me i started to sit up butters very calmly put his hands on my chest and shoved me back down hard i blinked at him i dont do assertive much he said apologetically i dont really like doctoring people who are still alive but if im going to do it dammit im going to do it right so you stay put until i say you can get up got it i uh i said yeah i guess smart butters said you have two giant bruises where the lower halves of your arms usually go youre covered in lacerations and a couple need sutures some are already inflamed i need to clean them all out thatll work best if you hold still i can do that i said but im feeling all kinds of better man look i held up my hands and wiggled my fingers they felt a little tight i glanced down at them they were a mottled shade of purple and swollen my wrists and forearms were blotchy with bruises and swollen too harry i once saw an addict pound his fist into concrete until hed broken nearly every bone in his hand he never even blinked im not on drugs i said no theres damage to your bodys machinery just because you arent feeling it doesnt mean it isnt there butters said firmly ive got a theory what theory i asked as he got to work on the cuts well lets say youre a faerie queen with a need for a mortal enforcer you want the guy to be effective but you dont want to make him too powerful to handle it seems reasonable to me that you might fiddle with his pain threshold hes not actually any more indestructible but he feels like he is hell ignore painful things like like knife wounds or gut shots thomas suggested or gut shots right butters said and most of the time that is probably a huge advantage he can energizer bunny his way right through your enemiesand then when its over there he is he feels great but in reality hes all screwed up and its going to take his body weeks or months to repair itself if you dont like the job hes done well there he is all weakened and vulnerable and if you do like it you just let him rest and use him again another day wow thats cynical i said and calculating im in the right ballpark arent i butters asked i sighed yeah it sounds very mablike especially if what maeve had said about me being dangerous to mab was true butters nodded sagely so as strong or quick or as fast to heal as it makes you just remember you arent any more invincible to trauma than before you just dont notice it when something happens he was quiet for a moment and then asked you didnt even feel that did you feel what i asked lifting my head he put the heel of his hand on my forehead and pushed it down again i just stitched up a threeinchlong slice over one of your ribs no anesthetic huh i said no i didnt i mean i felt something it just wasnt uncomfortable supports my theory he said nodding i already did that cut over your eye while you were out thats a beauty right down to the bone courtesy of captain hook i said he had this bitty sword i glanced up at thomas weve still got hook right hes being held prisoner on a ceramiclined cookie sheet in the oven thomas said i figured he couldnt jigger his way out of a bunch of steel and it would give him something to think about before we start asking questions thats an awful thing to do to one of the little folk man i said im planning to start making a pie in front of him nice thank you how long was i out i asked about an hour thomas said butters snorted id have been here sooner but someone broke into my house last night and i was cleaning up the mess i winced uh yeah right sorry about that man he shook his head im still kind of freaking out that youre here at all honestly i mean we held your funeral we talked to your ghost it doesnt get much more gone than that sorry to put a speed bump on your mental train track its more of a roller coaster lately but a good mind is flexible butters said ill deal with it dont worry he worked for a moment more before adding in a low murmur unlike some other people eh i asked him butters just looked up across the large apartment and then went back to work i followed the direction of his gaze karrin sat curled up in a chair beside the fireplace on the far side of the big apartment her arms wrapped around her knees her head leaning against the chairs back her eyes were closed and her mouth was open a little she was evidently asleep the gentle snoring supported that theory oh i said uh yeah she didnt seem to handle it real well when i was ghosting around understatement butters breathed shes been through a lot and none of it made her a bit less prickly thomas made a low sound of agreement shes run most of her friends off butters said never talks to cops anymore hasnt been speaking to her family just the viking crew down at the bfs im hanging in there so is molly i guess maybe we both know that shes in a bad place and now here i am i said man what thomas asked i shook my head you gotta know karrin karrin eh thomas asked i nodded shes real serious about order a man dying she can understand a man coming back thats different isnt she catholic thomas asked dont they have a guy i eyed him yeah and that makes it so much easier to deal with medically speaking butters said im pretty sure you were never dead or at least never dead and beyond revival what were you there i asked were you he countered i grunted from my end it went black and then i woke up ghosty then it went white and i woke up hurting then did a bunch of physical therapy to recover wow seriously pt butters asked how long eleven weeks yeah that really leans things toward coma for me and all the angels and ghost stuff i said which way does that make them lean in your medical opinion butters pressed his lips together and said no one likes a smartass harry i never liked him anyway thomas confided to him why dont you do something useful i said go outside see if anyone is lurking out there waiting to kill us the second we walk out because molly has to go with me each and every time or they wont let me back in and shes out dealing with your scouts thomas said you worried about that faerie crew using your blood to track you not sure using it is trickier than most people think i said youve got to keep it from drying out and youve got to get it undiluted it was raining so if someone wanted my blood theyd have had to get to it pretty quickand it looked like sith was keeping them busy sith butters asked not what youre thinking i said oh he said clearly disappointed besides i said to thomas im less worried about them using it to follow me than using it to make my heart stop beating or you know explode out of my chest thomas blinked they can do that oh my god butters said blinking is that what that was yes they can do that and probably if you mean all those murders around the threeeye drug ring bust i answered them butters whats the story here you done yet empty night thomas said his manner suddenly serious harry shouldnt we be putting up circles or something no point i said if theyve got your blood theyve got you period maybe if i ran and hid somewhere in the nevernever but even then it isnt certain how much blood do they need butters asked depends i said depends on how efficient their magic istheir skill level depends on how fresh the blood is depends on the day of the week and the phase of the moon for all i know it isnt something ive experimented with the more energy theyre sending your way the more blood they need meaning what butters asked sit up so i can dress these i sat up and lifted my arms out of the way as i explained a tracking spell is hardly anything in terms of energy input i said they wouldnt need much at all for that butters wound a strip of linen bandage around my midsection several times but if they want to make your head explode it takes a lot more depends how good they are i said they dont have to crush your head into paste sledgehammer style maybe they put an ice pick up your nose less force but concentrated into a smaller area see i shuddered a little if theyve got my blood and can use it im fucked and thats that but until that happens im going to assume that i still have a chance and proceed as if i do there was a silence then and i realized that both butters and thomas were just staring at me what magic is dangerous stuff guys i said yeah for all of us butters said but harry youre what bulletproof i shook my head magic is like the rest of life it doesnt matter how much a guy can benchpress or if he can break trees with his hands you put a bullet through his brain he dies im pretty good at figuring out where to stand so as to avoid that bullet and i can shoot back a lot better than most peoplebut im just as vulnerable as everybody else i frowned at that thought as vulnerable as everybody else something nagged at me from beneath the surface of my conscious calculations but i couldnt poke it into visibility yet point is i said if they were going to try to kill me with it theyve had time to do that already unless theyre saving it for the future butters said i made sure not to growl out loud yes thank you are you finished yet butters tore off a final piece of medical tape stuck the end of the bandage down with it and sighed yeah just try not to well move or jump around or do anything active or touch anything dirty or otherwise do anything else that i know youre going to do anyway in the next twentyfour hours twelve hours i said swinging my legs down from the table oy butters sighed wheres my shirt i asked standing thomas shrugged burned it you want mine after you got your guts all over it i asked ew butters blinked and looked at thomas my god he said youve been shot thomas hooked a thumb at butters check out dr marcus welby md here id have gone with doogie howser maybe i said split the difference at mccoy thomas asked perfect youve been shot butters repeated exasperated thomas shrugged well a little butters let out an enormous sigh then he picked up the bottle of disinfectant and a roll of paper towels and started cleaning off the table god i hate this frankensteinslashcivil war medicine crap give me a second then lie down i left them to pad across the apartment to my bedroom to mollys guest bedroom i opened the door as quietly as i could so that i wouldnt wake karrin and went in to put on another secondhand shirt i found one that was plain black with the spiderman emblem on it in white the black uniform the one that made spidey switch teams for a bit and which eventually gave him all kinds of grief it seemed fitting i slipped into it and turned and nearly jumped out of my boots when karrin quietly shut the bedroom door behind her i stood there for a long moment the only light was from a single small glowing candle karrin faced me with an opaque expression you dont call she said one corner of her mouth quirked into an expression that wasnt a smile you dont write yeah i said coma i heard she said she folded her arms and leaned back against the door thomas and molly both say its really you yeah i said howd you find me scanner the last time a bomb went off in this town it was in your office building i hear another one goes off in the street and then reports of explosions and gunfire out over the lake just after dawn this morning math wasnt hard to do howd you follow me i didnt murphy said i staked out thomass place and followed the guy who was following you she moved a foot absently touching the back of her other calf with it as if scratching an itch his name was ace something right i nodded you remember i try to keep track of the bad guys she said and on an entirely unrelated note i hear you belong to mab now the words hit me like a slap in the face karrin had been a detective for a long time she knew how to manipulate a suspect i guessed i was a suspect then im not a cocker spaniel i said quietly im not saying you are she said but there are creatures out there that can do things to your head and we both know it you think thats what happened i asked that mabs bent my brain into new shapes her expression softened i think shell do it slower she said youre an abrupt sort of person your solutions to problems tend to be decisive and to happen quickly its how you think im willing to believe that you found some kind of way to prevent her from just i dont know rewriting you i told her if she tried it id start being obstreperous god karrin said you havent started she half smiled for a second it was almost okay but then her face darkened again i think shell do it slower an inch at a time when you arent looking but even if she doesnt what im not angry at you harry she said i dont hate you i dont think youve gone bad a lot of people have fallen into the trap you did people better than either of us uh i said the evilqueenoffaerie trap christ harry murphy said quietly no one just starts giggling and wearing black and signs up to become a villainous monster how the hell do you think it happens she shook her head her eyes pained it happens to people just people they make questionable choices for what might be very good reasons they make choice after choice and none of them is slaughtering roomfuls of saints or murdering hundreds of baby seals or rubberroom irrational but it adds up and then one day they look around and realize that theyre so far over the line that they cant remember where it was i looked away from her something in my chest hurt i didnt say anything do you understand that she asked me her voice even more quiet do you understand how treacherous the ground youre standing on has become perfectly i said she nodded a few times then she said i suppose thats something that all i asked her i mean is that the only reason you came in here not quite she said you dont trust me i said her eyes didnt meet mine and didnt avoid them either that will depend largely on the next few minutes i inhaled through my nose and out again trying to stay calm clear even okay i said what do you want me to do the skull she said i know what it is so does butters and its too powerful to be left in the wrong hands meaning mine i asked ill tell you what i know i know you broke into his house when he was at work and took it i know you left andi with cuts and bruises and i know you wrecked the place a bit along the way you think that means ive gone bad she tilted her head slightly to one side as if considering i think you were probably operating under some kind of harebrained lonehero rationale lets say that im concerned that you have enough things to juggle already i thought about snapping at her but she had a point bob was a resource far too powerful to be allowed to fall into the hands of anyone who wouldnt use him responsibly and id been doing the winter knight gig full speed for about twelve hours and id already had some disturbing realizations about myself twelve hours what would i be like after twelve days twelve months what if karrin was right and mab got to me slow or worse what if i was just human she was right about that too power corruptsand the people being corrupted never seem to be aware that its happening id just told butters that i wasnt magically bulletproof what kind of arrogant ass would i be if i assumed i was morally infallible that i would be wise and smart and savvy enough to avoid the pitfalls of power traps that had turned better people than me into something horrible i didnt want her to be right i didnt like the idea at all but denial is for children i had to be a grownup okay i said my throat tight bobs in that satchel out in the living room give him back to butters thank you she said i found where you left the swords she meant the two swords of the cross two of three holy blades meant to fill the hands of the righteous in the battle against true evil id wound up babysitting them being their custodian mostly theyd sat around in my place gathering dust yeah i said i know how powerful they are she said and i know how vulnerable they are in the wrong hands im not telling you where they are im not giving them back to you im not negotiating i exhaled slowly a slow hard anger rolled into a knot in my guts those were my responsibility i said they were she said there was something absolutely rigid in her blue eyes not anymore the room suddenly felt too hot suppose i disagree suppose you do she said what would you do if you were in my position i dont remember moving i just remember slamming the heel of my hand into the door six inches from the side of karrins head it sounded like a gunshot and left me standing over her breathing harder and the difference in our sizes was damned near comical if i wanted to i could wrap my fingers almost all the way around her throat her neck would break if i squeezed she didnt flinch she didnt move she looked up at me and waited it hit me what i was thinking what my instincts were screaming at me to do and i suddenly sagged bowing my head my breath came out in uneven jerks i closed my eyes tried to get it under control and then she touched me she rested her hand lightly on my battered forearm moving carefully as if i were made of glass her fingers slid down my arm to my hand she took it gently and lowered it not trying to force anything then she took my right hand in her left we stood that way for a moment our hands clasped our heads bowed she seemed to understand what i was going through she didnt push me she just held my hands and waited until my breathing had steadied again harry she said quietly then do you want my trust i nodded tightly not trusting myself to speak then youre going to have to give me some im on your side im trying to help you let it go i shuddered okay i said her hands felt small and warm in mine i weve been friends a long time i said since that troll on the bridge yes my eyes blurred up stupid things and i closed them i know ive screwed up i said im going to have to live with that but i dont want to lose you in answer murphy lifted my right hand and pressed it against her cheek i didnt open my eyes i couldnt hear it in her voice or her breathing but i felt a slight dampness touch my hand i dont want to lose you either she said that scares me i didnt trust myself to speak for a long time she lowered my hands slowly and very gently let me go then she turned to the door karrin i said what if youre right what if i change i mean go really bad she looked back enough for me to see her profile and a quiet sad smile i work with a lot of monsters these days chapter twentyeight i picked up another jacket hanging in the closet an old surplus military garment with an eightiesstyle camouflage patternnot because i thought i would get cold as much as because i figured maybe the extra pockets would be handy if i found anything for which they would be needed i didnt have any money or id i didnt have a credit card hell i didnt have a business card what would it say harry dresden winter knight targets slain no barbecues waterslides or fireworks displays i could joke around with myself all i wanted but i would be doing it only because i didnt want to face a larger question a really hard one how the hell did i put my life back together assuming i could do it at all fortunately i had dire evil to fight at the moment which meant that i could think about the life thing later thank god for imminent doomsday id hate to have to face up to the really tough stuff so soon after getting back into the game i heard the front door of the apartment open and close and some quiet talk i came out of the bedroom to find that molly had returned toottoot was riding along on one of her shoulders hanging on to the top rim of her ear to keep his balance he looked none the worse for wear harry molly said smiling you look better how do you feel ill do i said major general i see youre back on your feet the last time i saw you i figured youd be down for weeks toot stiffened to attention and threw me a salute no my lord the little folk dont have enough time to waste weeks and weeks healing like you big people that probably shouldnt have surprised me id seen toot literally eat half his weight in pizza and his wings were powerful enough to lift him off the ground into flight anything that can put food away that quickly and produce such a prodigious amount of physical power relative to its size must have a ridiculously highburning metabolism and with the day id been having it did my heart good to see him upright again where are we on our scouts i asked molly theyre in a food coma she said i ordered twenty pizzas must have been five hundred of them in the parking lot theyll be ready to go as soon as you tell me where you want them to look i need a map i said molly reached into her back pocket and produced a folded map way ahead of you boss soon as theyre done lay it out on the table i said got it major general im glad youre here i said i need you to stay close toot saluted again and his wings blurred into motion lifting him up off mollys shoulder yes my lord what is the mission to prevent a prisoner from attempting escape i said i captured captain hook sort of karrin chimed in her voice amused shed returned to her seat by the fireplace i gave her a look we have him hes captured thats the main thing toot put his hand on his sword shall i dispatch him for you my lord he asked eagerly because i totally can if it needs to be done i said soberly ill make sure its your hand that does it but well give him a chance to talk first you are a man of mercy and grace my lord toottoot said clearly disappointed you bet your ass i said make sure youre in a good spot to stop our guest from leaving aye toot said saluting and darted across the apartment molly shook her head youre always so careful to make him feel involved he is involved i said and started back toward butterss makeshift examination table of course it hurts thomas was saying butters was stitching up a small puckered hole in his lower abdomen but not as much as it did before you got the bullet out and youre sure you can handle care this crude butters asked because if you were a regular human being i could pretty much guarantee you that this thing would go septic in a couple of days and kill you microorganisms arent a problem to my kind thomas said as long as i dont bleed out ill be fine my brothers tone was calm but the color of his eyes had changed growing lighter a shade of fine grey with almost no blue at all in it a vampire of the white court had superhuman strength and speed and resilience but not an infinite supply thomass eyes changed as his personal demon his hunger gained more influence over his actions at some point he would need to feed to replenish himself you about done i asked him i need the table what is it with you people butters groused for gods sake these are real injuries here there will be more of them than a thousand reluctant physicians could patch up if we dont get moving i said todays serious business man how serious cant think when its been grimmer i said freaking wasteofspace vampires lying around on tables you need to use useless wizards thomas said jumping on enemy guns and accidentally shooting their allies with them oh i said that was when i jumped ace he snorted yeah i winced ah sorry about that one of these days dresden thomas drawled pow right in the kisser talk is cheap i said table table table butters finished patching thomas up wrapping a long strip of gauze bandage around his middle thomas leaned back on his elbows as the doctor worked the pose made his muscles stand out sharply beneath pale skinbut then most poses seemed to do that with thomas his pale eyes lingered on molly for a long moment and my apprentice abruptly turned away with spots of color high up in her cheeks i uh molly said wow thomas i said sorry he said he didnt sound sincere he got up off the table with lazy grace say harry do you have any more shirts back there i bled nobly and sacrificially all over mine theyre mollys i said he looked at my apprentice oh what do i have to do to get one go ahead molly said her voice was not quite a squeak take one appreciate it thomas said and sauntered into the spare bedroom murphy watched him walk by openly then gave me a rather challenging look what she asked hes pretty i heard that thomas said from the other room map i said and molly hurried over to the table butters got his stuff off of it in rapid order hed evidently pulled the slug out of thomass guts without making a horrible bloody mess of things the bullet had to have been close to the surface aces gun must have been fairly lightweight a or a maybe hed been using cheap ammo and the round had been short on powder or maybe thomass superabs had stopped the bullet before it could sink in after the table was clean molly spread the map out on it it was a map of lake michigan and the shores around it including chicago and milwaukee and on up to green bay molly passed me a pen and i leaned over and started making marks on the map with my swollen fingers it hurt but i ignored it karrin got up and came over to watch thomas joined us a moment later freshly attired in a plain white tshirt which looked like it had been made to fit him hes a jerk like that what im doing here i said is marking out all the nodes i remember nodes butters asked my clumsy fingers made it a little hard to put the marks exactly where i wanted them the meeting points of one or more ley lines i said i got to know all about them a few years ago those are like magical power cables right karrin asked more or less i said sources of power that you can draw on to make major magic and there are a lot of them in the great lakes region im drawing from memory but im pretty sure these are right they are molly confirmed quietly auntie lea taught them to me a few months ago i looked up at her eyed my battered fingers and said then why am i doing this molly rolled her eyes and took the pen she started marking nodes rapidly and precisely on the map including the well on demonreach though the island didnt appear on the map whoever is going to attempt the spell on demonreach has to do it from somewhere near the shore of the lake i said theyre almost certainly going to be at one of these nodesthe closer to the edge of the lake the better i pointed out several nodes near the shore so we need to send the guard out to check these six locations near the edge of the lake first after that they go after the next nearest and so on some of those are a good way off karrin noted how fast can these little guys move fast i said faster than anyone gives them credit they can fly and they can take shortcuts through the nevernever they can get to the sites and back before sundown sundown which was when the big bad immortals would come out to play any questions so far i asked looking at murphy she jerked her chin toward my brother and said thomas filled me in good i said exposition gets repetitive fast a spell like this takes time to set up and they wont really be able to hide it if we can get eyes on the site once we know which of the sites shows signs of use we can get to it and thwart whatever lunatic is using it do we know who it is yet murphy asked answer unclear i said its got to be those outsiders right thomas asked stands to reason but the real question is who is helping them i got a bunch of looks at that outsiders cant just show up in our reality i said thats why theyre called outsiders in the first place someone has to open the door and let them in i took a deep breath which brings me to the next twist i talked to lily and maeve and they tell me that mab is the one planning to tinker with the island silence followed that thats a lie right butters asked they cant lie i said they physically cant and yes i got them to speak directly about it theres no confusion of signals no room for obfuscation thomas whistled quietly yeah i said uh molly said were up against mab your boss not necessarily i said lily and maeve may not be lying but they could still be wrong lily has never been a cerebral titan and maeve is maybe insane is the only word that really describes it but shes definitely firing on an odd number of cylinders its possible that theyve been deceived or thomas said maybe they havent or maybe they havent i said nodding what would that mean molly asked it would mean karrin said quietly that mab sent harry to kill maeve because either she wanted maeve out of the way or she wanted harry out of the way which is good because it means that shes worried that theres someone who could stop her right i said or maybe i frowned studying a new thought what thomas asked i looked slowly around the room if mab had been taken by the contagion which really needed a better name that certainly meant that lea had been taken as welland lea had been tutoring molly if it had spread into the white court my brother could have been exposed murphy was maybe the most vulnerableshe was isolated and her behavior had changed radically over the past couple of years hell butters was the person in the room least likely to have been exposed or turned or whateverwhich made him the most ideal candidate for being turned paranoiabecause why should the conspiracy theorists get to have all the fun i just couldnt see any of these people turning on me no matter the influence but if you could see treachery coming all that easily julius caesar might have lived to a ripe old age id always been slightly inclined to the paranoid i had a sinking feeling i was going to start developing my latent potential i picked my words very carefully over the past several years i said there have been several conflicts between two different interests several times events have been driven by internal conflicts within one or both of those interests like what butters asked dual interests inside the red court for one i said one of them trying to prevent conflict with the white council one of them trying to stir it up multiple houses of the white court rising up to vie for control of it the winter and summer courts posturing and interfering with each other when winters territory was violated by the red court i didnt want to get any more specific than that do you guys see what im getting at here oh butters said its a phantom menace ah molly said thomas grunted karrin glanced around at all of us and then said translate that from nerd to english please someone is out there i said someone who has been manipulating events playing puppet master stirring the pot stacking the deck mixing metaphors thomas suggested fuck off im just saying that this situation has the same shape as the others mab and maeve at each others throats with summer standing by ready to get involved and outsiders starting to throw their weight around the black council molly whispered exactly i said which it wasnt up until earlier today i had known someone was covertly causing the world a lot of griefand due to their connections with some grim events within the white council i had assumed it was a group of wizards which was both naturally arrogant and extremely nearsighted of me but what if id been wrong what if the black council was just one more offshoot of one enormous intangible enemy if what id gotten from lily was accurate the problem was a hell of a lot bigger than i had realized and i did not want that problem to know that i had spotted it the black council i said a group of practitioners using dark magic to influence various events around the world theyre powerful theyre bad news and if im right theyre here if theyre here i figure its a good bet that sharkface and his chums shark butters said chums funny thank you for noticing i said and continued the sentence are working for the black council the theoretical black council karrin said theyre out there definitely i said karrin smiled faintly if you say so mulder im going to ignore that the only question is whether or not theyre here now molly nodded seriously if they are how do we find them we dont i said there isnt enough time to go sniffing around methodically we know someones going to mess with the island it doesnt really matter whos pressing the button that sets off the bomb we just have to keep it from getting pressed the little folk find us that ritual site and then we go wreck it um butters said not that i lack confidence in you guys but shouldnt we be calling in the cavalry i mean doesnt that make more sense we are the cavalry i said in a flat tone the white council wont help even if i knew the current protocols to contact them it would take them days to verify that i am in fact alive and still me and we only have hours besides mollys on their mostwanted list i didnt add in the third reason not to contact the councilwhen they found out about my relationship with mab the monarch of a sovereign and occasionally hostile supernatural nation they would almost certainly panic and assume that i was a massive security risk which would for a variety of reasons and to a variety of degrees be an accurate assumption and now that i thought about it given how my ah induction had been psychically broadcast to all of faerie there was no chance whatsoever that the council didnt know knowing stuff is what they do butters frowned the paranetters no i said the last thing we need is a small army of newbies floundering around and stumbling into us thats asking for trouble in the short term the long term and every other term there might be we can go to them for information only we arent dragging them in the little me took off his glasses and cleaned them absently with the hem of his scrubs what about laras team or the einherjaren thomas shrugged i could probably convince lara to send the team somewhere ditto karrin said only with vikings good i said we might need more bodies and we might need to cover multiple sites can you two get that lined up when we break they nodded molly i said youll take the map up to our little scouts and tell them where to look and what to look for keep it simple and promise an entire pizza to whoever finds what were after my apprentice grinned drive their performance with competition eh millions of abusively obsessed sports parents cant be wrong i said butters youll go to the paranetters and ask if anyones seen or heard anything unusual anywhere even close to lake michigan no one investigates anything they just report get me all the information you can about any odd activity in the past week we need to collect data as quickly as possible right butters said ive got some now if you want i blinked i mean i knew the internet was the fast way to spread information but seriously well butters hedged sort of one of our guys is a little um imaginative you mean paranoid yes butters said hes got this internet lair in his mothers basement keeps track of all kinds of things calls it observing the supernatural through statistics sends me a regional status update every day and my spam blockers just cannot keep him out hngh i said as if i knew what a spam blocker was whats he got to say about today that boat rentals this morning were four hundred percent higher today than the median for this time of year and dark forces are bound to be at work boat rentals i muttered hes a little weird harry butters said i mean he has a little headshot photo tree of the people responsible for the cubs billy goat curse that kind of odd he blows the curve tell him to take the tree down the billy goat curse was a lone gunman i said but paranoid doesnt necessarily equal wrong boats i bowed my head and closed my eyes for a moment thinking but if butters paranoid basement freak was right then the puzzle piece hed handed me was woefully unhelpful i needed more pieces okay i said right get more data i looked up jerked my head at thomas and headed for the kitchen lets go talk to our guest about his boss i leaned down to look into the oven through the glass door there was no light inside but i could make out captain hooks armored form huddled disconsolately on a coated cookie sheet i knocked on the glass and captain hooks helmet turned toward me i want to talk to you i said youre my prisoner dont try to fight me or run away or ill have to stop you id rather just have a nice conversation do you understand me hook didnt give me any indications either way i took silence as assent okay i said im going to open the door now i cracked open the oven door and opened it slowly doing my best not to loom tough to do when youre the size of a building relative to the person over whom you are standing now just take it easy and we will id opened the door maybe six inches when captain hook all but vanished in a blur of speed i swiped an arm at him about a second and a half too late but i didnt feel too bad about missing because thomas tried to snatch the little maniac too and missed completely hook who worked for our enemies and who had been right there in the kitchen the whole time wed been scheming shot toward a vent on one wall crossing the room in the blink of an eye and none of us could react in time to stop him chapter twentynine none of us but the major general toot dropped down from where hed been crouched atop a bookcase intercepting hooks darting black form and tackled the other little faerie to the floor in the middle of the living room they landed with a thump on the carpeting wings still blurring in fits and starts and tumbled around the floor in irregular bursts and hops sometimes rolling a few inches sometimes bounding up and coming down six feet away toot had planned for this fight hed tackled hook into the carpet where the hooks on his armor would get tangled and bind him slowing him down furthermore toots hands were wrapped in cloth until it looked like he was wearing mittens or boxing gloves and he managed to seize hook by the hooks on the back of his armor he swung the other little faerie around in a circle and then with a highpitched shout flung him into the wall captain hook slammed into the wall putting gouges in the freshly painted drywall then staggered back and fell to the ground toot bore down with a vengeance drawing his little sword and the armored figure held up a mailed fist invocation he piped in a high clear voice i am a prisoner i invoke winter law toots sword was already in midswing but at those last two words he checked himself abruptly pulling the weapon back he hovered there over hook with his feet an inch off the ground gritting his teeth but then he buzzed back from hook and sheathed the sword uh i said toot what just happened toottoot landed on the kitchen counter next to me and stomped around in a circle clearly furious you opened your big fat mouth he screamed after a moment he added sullenly my lord i frowned at toot and then at hook the enemy sprite just sat there on the floor making no further effort to escape okay i said explain that you offered to take him prisoner toot said by winter law if he accepts your offer he may not attempt escape or offer any further resistance to you for as long as you see to his needs now you cant kill him or beat him up or anything and i was winning i blinked yeah okay fine so lets make with the questions already you cant toot wailed you cant try to make him betray his previous covenants or terrorgate him or anything i frowned wait hes a guest yes by winter law i asked yes sort of well i said starting toward hook i never signed on to that treaty so screw winter law and abruptly as if someone had just slammed a row of staples into my skin the mantle of the winter knight vanished completely pain soared back into my body inflamed tissue crying out my bruises throbbing the edemas beneath my skin pounding with a horrible tightness fatigue hit me like a truck the sensations were so intense the only way i could tell that i had fallen to the floor was by looking and my body abruptly went numb and useless from my stomach down that scared the hell out of me and confirmed one of my worst fears when id consented to serve mab my back had been broken my spine damaged taking up the mantle had covered what would probably have been a crippling and longterm injury but without it my body was only mortal better than most at recovering over time but still human without the mantle i wouldnt have legs bladder or bowel control or most important independence i was on the ground like that for a subjective week but it could have been only a few seconds before thomas reached my side with murphy butters and molly right behind him i knew they were there because i could see them but their voices swam down to me from what seemed like a great distance among the cacophony of raking sensations scouring my nervous system they lifted me to a sitting positionand then abruptly the pain was gone and my legs started moving again jerking in a single gentle spasm the mantle had been restored okay i said in a ragged voice uh maybe we wont screw winter law harry thomas said as if hed said my name several times already what happened uh i said i think its a side effect fallout from defying the order of things what he asked faeries i said theyre kind of insane and mischievous and dangerous as hell but they all share one traittheyre good to their word they obey what they recognize as law especially mab you arent making much sense right now thomas said the mantle of power comes from mab and now its in me but its still a piece of her if i go violating her own realms laws it looks like the mantle isnt going to have my back meaning what meaning id better figure out what the laws are pretty damned quick i replied help me up thomas hauled me to my feet and i looked at toot you know the winter law well toot said as if i were an idiot of course where can i learn it toot tilted his head what winter law i said where can i learn it i dont understand toot said tilting his head the other way oh for the love of i pinched the bridge of my nose between my thumb and forefinger toot can you read sure toot said i can read pizza and exit and chocolate all three huh absolutely youre a scholar and a gentleman i said but where did you learn winter law toot shook his head as if mystified you dont learn it harry you just know it everyone knows it i dont i said maybe youre too big toot said or too loud or you knowtoo human i grunted then i eyed hook who had continued to sit in the same spot during the entire conversation so ive gone and made him my guest eh well more like your vassal i frowned uh what thats what surrender is duh toot said his life is yours to do with as you please and as long as you dont starve him or make him an oathbreaker you can tell him to do whatever you want and if his liege wants him back he has to pay you for him ah medievalstyle ransom toot looked confused he did run some but i stopped him my lord like just now in front of you right over there there were several conspicuous sounds behind me the loudest from my apprentice and i turned to eye everyone else they were all either covering smiles or holding them backpoorly hey peanut gallery i said this isnt as easy as im making it look youre doing fine karrin said her eyes twinkling i sighed come on toot i said and walked over to hook the little faerie sat there apparently ignoring me which took considerable nerve if i fell or stepped on him it would be like a tree falling on a lumberjack if i were trying to hurt him physically i could twist him up like stretch armstrong on the other hand hook was a faerie it probably never even occurred to him that i might violate mabs laws the prisoner will stand and face the za lord toot shrilled hook obediently got up and turned to face me identify yourself please i said i dont want your name just something to call you by some i am called lacuna he replied suits me lacuna i said remove the helmet please i want to see who im supporting lacuna reached up and removed the faceshrouding helmet she was gorgeous fine black hair bound into a braid at least a foot long spilled down out of the helmet when she did her skin was paper white her huge eyes black all the way through there were small markings or tattoos of some kind in deep purple ink on her skin but they shifted slightly as i watched some fading from sight others appearing her features were long and very lean she had a straight razors elegant dangerous beauty toots jaw just about dropped off of his head wow hmmm karrin said thats the one who beat you up last night is it and tripped him this morning thomas reminded her and tripped me this morning i growled i turned back to lacuna and studied her for a moment she looked back at me without blinking actually she didnt move at allexcept for her braid which drifted upward like cobwebs over a heating vent huh i said was not expecting that lacuna stared her eyes flat i wont ask you to break your word i told her and i will treat you with respect and provide for your needs in exchange for your service do you understand i understand lacuna said wow said toot without breaking any oath i would like to know i said whatever you can tell me about the person you were serving until you were taken prisoner she stared i caught my mistake and rolled my eyes let me rephrase that tell me whatever you can about the person you were serving until you were taken prisoner without breaking any word youve given him lacuna nodded at that and frowned pensively then she looked up and said in a serious confidential tone he does not seem to like you very much i took a slow deep breath there were more titters behind me i noticed that too i said tell me what you know about whats happening tonight children she said in a sepulchral voice and her little face twisted up with unmistakable fury and candy lots and lots of candy wow toot said he zipped away in a flutter of wings without breaking your word tell me everything else you know about ace i said he owes me lacuna replied grimly for services rendered i sighed i dont suppose youd like to volunteer to offer me some more useful information the armored faerie stared at me without blinking it was a little creepy nah i didnt think so i said are you hungry she seemed to consider that for a moment then said yes do you want some pizza lacunas face twisted up in disgust ugh no my eyebrows went up that was a gradea first the little folk would quite literally go to war over pizza they liked it that much uh what would you like to eat then celery she replied promptly cheese green tea but mostly celery how random i said i looked over my shoulder molly ive got those she said and went to the kitchen okay lacuna i said weve got a bunch of business to take care of i want you to eat get some rest and make yourself comfortable you arent to leave this apartment understood lacuna nodded somberly yes her wings blurred and she darted across the apartment to the kitchen where molly was preparing a plate with lacunachow on it good ill figure out what to do with you later i rubbed the back of my neck and went back over to the others well that was a little frustrating whyd you take her prisoner then thomas asked i glowered at him dont you have a squad of mercenaries to round up or a bridge to jump off i guess so okay everybody i said youve got your assignments lets get them done molly youve got the apartment and the phone so after you send the search parties youre coordinating anyone learns something call molly with it otherwise meet back here by five there was a round of nods and agreements and butters thomas and karrin headed out into the city once they were gone molly asked whyd you ditch them like that i lifted my eyebrows again the grasshopper just kept getting cleverer i wasnt ditching them i said molly arched an eyebrow you werent not entirely i said that stuff needs doing too while you go somewhere dangerous all by yourself am i right i didnt answer her right away and she finished making lacunas meal she put the plate on the counter and the serious little faerie fell upon it like a ravening wolf something like that i said dont you have a job to do too molly eyed me then she picked up the map on the table folded it and walked toward the door im not going to fight you about it i just wanted you to know that i knew just then toot buzzed back into the apartment from somewhere he zipped in frantic dizzying circles starting at the point hed last seen lacuna until his spiral search pattern took him to the kitchen then he swooped down to lacuna landing neatly on the counter i peered at the two little faeries toot held out to lacuna a wrapped watermelon jolly rancher as if he were offering frankincense and myrrh to the christ child hi he said brightly im major general toottoot lacuna looked up from her food and saw toots gift her eyes narrowed and then she sucker punched toottoot right in the face my little bodyguard flew back a couple of feet and landed on his ass both of his hands went up to his nose and he blinked in startled bewilderment toot had dropped the jolly rancher lacuna calmly kicked it into the disposal drain of the kitchen sink then she turned her back on toot ignoring him completely and went back to eating her meal toots eyes were even wider as he stared at lacuna wow he said chapter thirty the montrose point bird sanctuary has a second namethe magic hedge there are about fifteen acres of trees brush and winding trails its been an established bird sanctuary for decades and is a major port of call for birds migrating south for the winter if you read some flyers about the place theyll tell you all about how the magic hedge is chockfull to bursting with the magic of birds and nature but the folks who live here also call it the magic hedge because its a fairly wellknown hangout for men who are hoping to hook up with other men the ratio of cruisers to birdwatchers and dont think i didnt consider an ironic joke about binoculars and watching birds varies depending on the time of the year when there are tons of birds and bird lovers around that means lots of people with binoculars and cameras that kind of thing really cuts down on the romantic mystique the place sticks out like a hook almost totally enclosing montrose harbor which is mostly a place for boats that are a lot less grubby than the water beetle theres a yacht club in there and a fairly busy beach nearby so occasionally nonbirdwatching noncruising people wander through the magic hedge too people like me at the end of october most of the migrating flocks had already gone by but the hedge was still a rendezvous for leftover flocks of sparrows which would gather together over a few days then merge and leave in an enormous cloud i spotted two dozen species on my walk in without binoculars i knew most of them if i had bothered to dig their names out of my memories i didnt ebenezar when he taught me had been very serious about making sure i learned the proper names of things the park was mostly empty today under the cold grey drizzling sky on the way in to where i wanted to go i passed a man dressed all in black with a black hat and black sunglassessunglasses for crying out loudwho tracked me with his needlessly cool gaze as i went by not here for that i said making a longdistance call be gone in half an hour one way or another he didnt say anything and as i passed he faded back into the brush theres a community here spotters runners the police run stings sometimes seems like an awful lot of fuss and trouble for everyone involved to me especially in the modern world bob wasnt in my shoulder bag anymore but id replaced him with what id need the lake nearby and the falling rain would do for water earth was there in plenty and i used a garden spade to dig a small pit the fitful cold winds from the northwest would do for air and once i got the few pounds of kindling id brought piled into a small hollow pyramid it didnt take me long to get a tiny fire going even in the rain i waited until it had begun to blaze up building it to make it burn hotter and faster i didnt want to cook on it a few minutes were all i needed i stayed low and moved as little as possible the song from hundreds of gathered sparrows was enthusiastic pervasive once the fire was burning i used the trowel to cut a circle into the soft earth around me i touched it with my finger and invested a minor effort of will and the magic of the circle snapped up around me it was a mystic barrier not a physical one something that would contain and focus magical forces and generally make it easier to do what i was about to do it couldnt be seen or touched but it was very very real a lot of important things are like that i gathered my will sinking into pure focus people think wizards use magic words for some reason there arent any magic words really even the ones we use in our spells are just symbols a way to insulate our minds from the energies coursing through them words have a power every bit as terrible and beautiful as magic and they dont need a special effects budget to do it either what drives magic is at the end of the day sheer will emotions can help reinforce it but when you draw on your emotions to fuel magic even that is simply a different expression of will a different flavor of your desire to make something happen some things you do as a wizard require you to set any emotion you have aside theyre good in a crisis but in a methodical deliberate effort they can wreak havoc with your intentions so i blocked out all my confusion doubt and uncertainty along with my perfectly intelligent terror until all that remained was my rational self and my need to reach a single goal only then did i lift my head and speak infusing every word with the power of my need casting the summoning forth into the universe the power made my voice sound strangelouder deeper richer lady of light and life hear me thou who art queen of the evergreen lady of flowers hear me dire portents are afoot hear my voice hear my need i am harry dresden winter knight and i needs must speak with thee i lifted my joined voice and will and thundered titania titania titania i summon thee the last syllable rebounded from every surface in sight with booming echoes it panicked the sparrows they flew up in a cloud of thousands of wings and little bodies gathering in a swarm that raced wildly in circles around the meadow come on i breathed to myself come on already i stood in silence for a long long minute and i was starting to think that nothing was going to happen and then i saw the clouds begin to rotate and i knew exactly what it meant ive lived in the midwest for most of my life tornadoes are a fact of life out here part of the background people think theyre scary and they are but theyre very survivable provided you follow some fairly simple guidelines warn people early and when you hear the warning head for the safest space you can reach quickly thats usually a basement or root cellar sometimes its beneath a staircase sometimes its in an interior bathroom sometimes the best you can hope for is the deepest ditch you can find but basically it all amounts to run and hide years of life in the midwest screamed at me to do exactly that my heart started speeding up and my mouth went dry while the clouds overheadand when i say overhead i mean directly over my headturned faster and faster birds exploded into the sky from all over the magic hedge joining the sparrows in their wild circling the air suddenly became close and the drizzling rain cut off as if a valve had been closed lightning with no thunder flickered weirdly through the clouds which turned every shade of white and blue and sea green as the water vapor separated the light into the visible spectrum then i felt ita warmth like that id felt in lily only a hundred times hotter and brighter and more intense the clouds started to lower and the frantic birds tightened their circle until they were a wall of shining feathers and glittering eyes around the meadow then there was a flash of light a toll of thunder that sounded weirdly musical like the aftertone of some vast gong and a shower of earth and glowing bits of charred autumn grass flew into the air i threw up an arm to shield my eyesbut i kept my feet planted when the dirt settled and the dust and ash cleared the lady of light and life and monarch of the summer court stood about fifteen feet away from me she was breathtaking i dont mean beautiful because she was that obviously but it was the kind of beauty that had so much scope so much depth so much power that it made me feel dwindling insignificant and very very temporary you feel it the first time you see the mountains the first time you see the sea the first time you see the vast bleak majesty of the grand canyonand every single time you look at titania the summer queen id say that the details of her appearance were unimportant except that they werentparticularly for me titania was dressed for a fight she wore a gown of mail made from some kind of silvery metal the links so fine that at first it looked like woven cloth it covered her like a second skin all the way to the top of her throat over that she wore a long robe of silk that shifted in colors from the yellow of sunlight to the green of pine needles in a slow strobelike pattern her silverwhite hair had been braided into a tail and then fixed in coils at the base of her neck upon her head was a crown of what looked like twisted vine with stillliving leaves she carried neither weapon nor shield but her wide sidhe eyes stared at me with the absolute certainty of one who knows she is armed well beyond the ability of her enemy to withstand oh and if i hadnt known better i would have sworn to you that it was mab standing there seriously they didnt look like sisters they looked like clones i started off by bowing to her deeply i held it for a beat before rising again she was a statue for a few seconds she didnt so much as nod back to me to any measurable degree but some microchange in her body language indicated acknowledgment you who slew my daughter titania said quietly you dare summon me the last word slashed through the air its fury palpable it struck the circle surrounding me and broke into a shower of gold and green sparks that vanished almost instantly ive had some experience with the queens of faerie when they get angry and start talking to you you freaking hear them and then if you survive it you hope you can make it to the emergency room in time i just hadnt seen any scenario in which my talking to titania wouldnt make her furiousso id drawn the circle as a precaution sometimes i use my brain crazy right i said but i needed to speak to you o queen her eyes narrowed the curtaincloud of birds continued their circling around us though they had fallen eerily silent the clouds overhead continued to spin we were as isolated from the rest of the world as if we stood in a private garden speak then i thought about my words and picked them carefully there are events in motion very large events with serious ramifications for basically the whole world i mean i thought the war between the white council and the red court was a big dealbut now it looks to me like it was more or less an opening act for the real band her eyes narrowed she nodded her head a fraction of an inch something is going to happen tonight i said the well will come under attack you know what could happen if it is opened a lot of people would get hurt in the short term and in the long term well im not sure i know what would happen but im almost certain it wouldnt be good titania tilted her head slightly to one side it reminded me of an eagle considering its prey and deciding whether or not it was worth it to swoop down on it out of nowhere im trying to make sure that doesnt happen i said and because of the nature of this problem i cant trust any of the information i get out of the people im working for ah she said you wish me to pass judgment upon my sister i need someone with knowledge of mab i said someone who knows the events are in motion who would know if she had uh changed and what makes you think that i would have the knowledge you seek because i saw you preparing the battlefield at the stone table years ago youre mabs equal i saw your power you dont get power like that without knowledge that is true i need to know i said is mab sane is she still mab titania did a statue impersonation for a long moment then she turned her head to one side and stared out toward the lake i do not know she gave me an oblique look i have not exchanged words with my sister since before hastings the nextbest thing to a millenniums worth of estrangement dysfunction on an epic scale this was exactly the kind of family tension into which sane people do not inject themselves im going to inject myself into your family business i said because im scared to death of what could happen if i dont and because it needs to be done i understand that youre mabs enemy i understand that if she says black you say white and thats the way it is but were all in a southbound handbasket together here and i need your help titania tilted her head the other way and took a step toward me i almost flinched back out of the circle i didnt want to do that i didnt think it would keep me safe for long if she decided she wanted to come at me but as long as it was there it meant that she would have to spend at least a little time bringing it downtime in which i could attack her it also meant that if i took the first swing id be sacrificing the circles protection and my only current advantage she looked down at my feet and then back up at me expectantly uh i said will you please help me something flickered over her face when i said that an emotion that i couldnt place maybe it wasnt a human one she turned abruptly away and seemed to consider her surroundings for the first time we shall see she said she turned back to me her eyes intent why did you come here for the summoning its a bird sanctuary i said a natural place intended to preserve life and beauty and birds seem kind of summery to me following summer to the south over the winter and then returning i thought that it might be close to some of summers lands in faerie that youd have an easier time hearing me she turned her head slowly as if listening there was no sound but the constant muffled white noise of thousands of wings beating but this place is more than that it is a location for unapproved liaisons i shrugged its just you and me i figured if you wanted to kill me you could do it here without hurting anybody else titania nodded her expression turning thoughtful what think you of the men who come here to meet with one another uh i said feeling somewhat off balance what do i think of gay guys yes boink and let boink more or less meaning meaning it doesnt have a lot to do with me i said its none of my business what they do i dont go over in their living room and get my freak on with women they dont come over and do whatever they do with other guys at my house you dont feel that they are morally wrong to do so i have no idea if its right or wrong i said to me it mostly doesnt matter and why not because even if they are doing something immoral id be an idiot to start criticizing them for it if i wasnt perfect myself smoking is selfdestructive drinking is selfdestructive losing your temper and yelling at people is wrong lying is wrong cheating is wrong stealing is wrong but people do that stuff all the time soon as i figure out how to be a perfect human being then im qualified to go lecture other people about how they live their lives an odd sentiment are you not only human will you not always be imperfect now youre catching on i said you do not see it as a sin i shrugged i think its a cruel world i think its hard to find love i think we should all be happy when someone manages to do it love titania said she had keyed on the word is that what happens here the guys who come here for anonymous sex i sighed not so much i think that parts a little sad i mean anytime sex becomes something so damned impersonal its a shame and i dont think its good for them but its not me theyre hurting why should that matter i just looked at titania for a second then i said because people should be free and as long as something they want to do isnt harming others they should be free to do it obviously is it titania asked it would not seem to be judging from the state of the mortal world yeah a lot of people dont get that i said they get caught up in right and wrong or right and left but none of that stuff matters if people arent free titania studied me intently why are you asking me about that of all things i asked because it felt appropriate because my instincts told me that your answers would tell me something about you that i needed to know titania took a deep breath what think you of my sister i debated for a second polite answer or honest one honest its almost always best to go with honest it means you never have to worry about getting your story straight i thought mabs wrath was pretty bad until i found out what her affection was like at that i think titania almost smiled oh she nursed me out of bed by trying to kill me every day for eleven weeks she scares the hell out of me you do not love her not by any definition of the word ive ever heard i said and why do you serve her needed her help i said that was her price sure as hell wasnt because i like the decor in arctis tor titania nodded she said you are unlike the other monsters she has shaped for herself over the centuries uh thank you she shook her head i have done nothing for you harry dresden she pursed her lips in many ways she and i are alike in many more ways we are entirely different do you know what my sister believes in flashy entrances i said titanias lips actually twitched in reason reason reason logic calculation the cold numbers the supremacy of the mind titanias eyes became distant it is another place where we differ i prefer to follow the wisdom of the heart meaning what i asked titania lifted her hand and spoke a single word and the air rang with power the ground buckled ripping my circle apart and flinging me from my feet onto my back meaning she said her voice hot and furious that you murdered my daughter birds flew shrieking in every direction as if released from a centrifuge titania raised a hand and a bolt of lightning fell from the tornadic sky and blew a smoking crater the size of my head in the ground a yard away you dare to come here to ask for me to interfere in my sisters business you who gave my aurora an iron death i tried to get up only to have titania grab the front of my jacket and lift me off the ground with one hand she held me straight up over her head so that her fist was pressed against my chest i could kill you in a thousand ways she snarled her opalescent eyes whirling with colors i could scatter your bones to the far corners of the earth i could feed you to my garden and make you scream the entire while i could visit torments on you that would make lloyd slates fate seem kind by comparison i want to eat your heart i hung there over the furious queen of summer and knew knew for certain that there was not a damned thing i could do to save my own life i can do things sureremarkable things but titania had no more to fear from me than a polar bear does a field mouse my heartbeat became something close to a solid tone and it was all i could do not to wet my freaking pants and then something really unsettling happened tears filled her eyes they came forth and spilled over her cheeks titania seemed to sag she lowered me to the ground and released me i could do these things but none of them she whispered would give me my daughter back none of them would fill the emptiness within me it took time but elder gruffs wise counsel helped me to see that truth hells bells elder gruff had spoken on my behalf i owed that guy a beer i am not a fool wizard i know what she had become i know what had to be done more tears fell shining like diamonds but she was mine i cannot forget that you took her from me i cannot forgive you for that take your life and leave this place i sounded a little unsteady to my own ears when i spoke if the well is ruptured your realm stands to lose as much as the mortal one does the wisdom of my heart tells me to hate you mortal titania said whatever my reason might say i will not help you no what does your heart tell you is going to happen if those things in the well are set free theyre immortals the fire in the failsafe might keep them down for a while but theyll be back titania didnt turn to face me her voice was weary my heart tells me that all things end she paused but this thing i will tell a winter knight who believes in freedom you must learn greater discretion the power you have come to know and fear has a name one should know the proper names of things she turned and walked toward me my body told me to run like hell but i told it to shut up that my legs were shaking too hard anyway titania leaned up onto her toes and whispered very close to my ear nemesis she breathed speak it carefullyor it may hear you i blinked it it what with that she turned and began walking away fare thee well wizard you say that people should be free i agree i will not shackle you with my wisdom make your choices choose what the world is to be i care not there is little light left in it for me thanks to you a relatively small flock of birds only a few hundred blurred by between me and titania when they had passed she was gone i stood there letting my heart rate slow down along with the spinning clouds i felt like crap when id killed aurora there hadnt been much in the way of a choicebut id still taken someones little girl away from her forever i felt like a man in a rowboat with only one oar no matter how hard i worked i wasnt really getting anywhere but at least i had a name now for the force the ladies had told me about nemesis and it was aware the rain that had been held back abruptly began to come down in a torrent and i sourly suspected that titania had made sure i was going to get drenched she hadnt killed me at least not yet but i knew she sure as hell didnt like me night was coming on fast and when it got here all hell was going to break loose and that was a bestcase scenario i bowed my head hunched my shoulders against the rain and started out of the magic hedge chapter thirtyone i whistled down a cab and went to my next destination graceland cemetery the place was actually kind of busy it being halloween and all graceland is one of the great cemeteries of the nation the atlantic city of graveyards its filled with monuments to men and women who evidently had too much money to throw around while they were still alive there are statues and mausoleums everywhere made from granite and ornate marble some of them in the style of ancient greece some obviously more influenced by ancient egypt theres one thats practically a fullsize temple the actual style of the various monuments ranges from incredible beauty to absolutely outrageous extravagance with artists and tycoons and architects and inventors all lying silently together now walk in graceland and you can find yourself lost in a maze of memories a cloud of names that no one living could attach to a face anymore i wondered passing some of the older monuments whether anyone ever visited them now if youd died in it would mean that your greatgreat or even greatgreatgreatgrandchildren were the ones living now did people visit the graves of those who had been gone that long no not for any personal reason but that was all right graves arent for the dead theyre for the loved ones the dead leave behind them once those loved ones have gone once all the lives that have touched the occupant of any given grave had ended then the graves purpose was fulfilled and ended i suppose if you looked at it that way one might as well decorate ones grave with an enormous statue or a giant temple it gave people something to talk about at least although following that logic i would need to have a roller coaster or maybe a tiltawhirl constructed over my own grave when i died then even after my loved ones had moved on people could keep having fun for years and years of course id need a slightly larger plot my grave was still open a sixfoot pit in the ground an old enemy had bought it for me as a form of murderous foreplay that one hadnt fallen out the way she had expected it would but apparently whatever mechanism she used to secure the grave and to have it illegally left open was apparently still in place because when i got there i found it just as gaping and threatening as it had always been a chill rolled up my spine as i read my headstone it was a pretty thing white marble with goldinlaid letters and a goldinlaid pentacle here lies harry dresden he died doing the right thing well i muttered once sure but i guess ill have to go best two out of three i looked around id passed several groups that might have been halloween haunted theme tours and a gaggle of kids wearing expensive black clothing and grim makeup smoking cigarettes and trying to look like they were wise to the world a couple of older people seemed to actually be visiting graves putting out fresh flowers i paused thoughtfully over my own grave and waited until no one was looking then i hopped down into it my feet splashed into an inch of water and another six inches of mud courtesy of the drizzling rain i crouched a little lower just to be sure no one saw me and got into my bag again my hands were shaking too much to get the bag open on the first try it wasnt the cold it wasnt even standing at the bottom of my own gravehell when id been a ghost my own grave had been the most restful place in the whole world and there was a certain amount of that reassurance that was still present i still had no desire to get dead dont get me wrong the scary thing was imagining what would happen to all the people i cared about if i died in the next few minutes if i was right this next interview might get me everything i needed if i wasnt well i could hope to wind up dead i guess but i had a bad feeling that wizards who pissed off people on this level didnt get anything that pleasant and gentle i made my preparations quickly earth and water were all around no problem there id have to hope that what little air i had was right for the calling fire would have been an issue if i hadnt planned ahead i needed to represent one other primal force too something that would call to the exact being i had in mind death if working the spell from your own grave on hallofreakingween wasnt deathy enough i wasnt sure what would be i stood on one foot and with a gesture and a word froze most of the water in the grave i put my free foot down on the ice and pulled my other foot out of the part id left as mostly slush then i froze that too i didnt have any problems slipping on the iceor rather i did slip a little but my body seemed to adjust to it as naturally as it would have to small stones turning underfoot on a gravel road no big deal once the water was nice and solid i got out my other props a bottle of cooking oil a knife and matches i took the knife and drew a short cut into the skin of my left hand in the fleshy bit between my thumb and forefinger over an old scar where i had been hurt at the bidding of a queen of faerie before while that welled up and began to bleed i reached up and slashed off a lock of my hair with the same knife i took the lock and used the freshly shed blood as an adhesive to hold it together and dropped it onto the surface of the ice more death just in case then i poured a circle of oil around the hair and the blood and set it quickly alight with the matches fire and water hissed and spit and wind moaned over the top of my grave i braced my hands on either side of it closed my eyes and spoke the invocation id chosen infusing my voice with my will ancient crone harbinger i began then raised my voice louder longest shadow darkest dream she of the endless hunger the iron teeth the merciless jaws i poured more of my wind and my will into the words and the inside of my grave rang with the sheer volume i am harry dresden the winter knight and i needs must speak with thee athropos skuld mother winter i summon thee i released the pentup power in my voice and as it rang out i could hear birds erupting up from where they sheltered all over the graveyard there were shouts and cries of surprise too from the tourists or the gothlings or both i ground my teeth and hoped that they wouldnt come my way getting killed by mother winter wouldnt be like being killed by titania that might at least have been huge and messynot really a fight but at least a proper slaughter if mother winter showed up and wanted to kill me id probably just fall into dust or something mother winter was to mab as mab was to maevepower an order of magnitude above the winter queen id met with her once before and shed literally knitted up some of the most powerful magic id ever seen while carrying on a conversation the echoes of my summoning bounced around the graveyard over my head a few times and then and then and then nothing i sat there for a moment waiting while the burning oil hissed and sputtered on the ice a running tendril of oil ran out to my blood and hair and a tongue of flame followed a moment later that part was fine by me it wasnt like i wanted to leave a target that juicy lying around for someone to steal anyway i waited until the fire burned out entirely and quiet settled over my grave again but nothing happened dammit i wasnt going to figure out what was really going on tonight by carefully sifting all the facts and analyzing how they all fit together not in the time i had left my only real chance was to get to someone who knew and get them to talk granted going to talk to mother winter was about half an inch shy of trying to call up lucifer or maybe death itself if there was such a beingno one was really sure but when you need information from witnesses and experts the only way to get it is to talk to them maybe my summons hadnt been deathy enough but i hadnt wanted to kill some poor animal just to get the old girls attention i might have to though there was just too much at stake to get squeamish i shook my head put my tools away and then the ice just beneath my toes shattered and a long bony arm covered in wrinkles and warts and spots and belonging to a body that would have been at least twenty feet tall shot up and seized my head not my face my entire head like a softball or maybe an apple stained black claws on the ends of the knobby fingers dug into me piercing my skin and i was abruptly jerked down into the freaking ice with so much power that for a second i was terrified my neck had snapped i thought i would be broken for certain when i hit the ice but instead i was drawn through it and down into the mud and through that and then i was falling screaming in sudden instinctive blind terror then i hit something hard and it hurt even through the power of the mantle and i let out a brief croaking exhalation i dangled there stunned for a moment with those cold cruel pointed claws digging into my flesh distantly i could hear a slow limping step and feel my feet dragging across a surface then i was flung and spun twice on the horizontal and i crashed into a wall i bounced off it and landed on what felt like a dirt floor i lay there not able to inhale barely able to move and either id gone blind or i was in complete blackness the nice part about having your bells rung like that is that mindnumbing horror sort of gets put onto a side burner for a bit that was pretty much the only nice thing about it when i finally managed to gasp in a little air i used it to make a whimpering sound of pure pain a voice came out of the darkness a sound that was dusty and raspy and covered in spiders me it said drawing the word out you attempt to summon me you have my sincerest apologies for the necessity i said or tried to say to mother winter i think it just came out ow you think i am a servant to be whistled for continued the voice hate and weariness and dark amusement were all mummified together in it you think i am some petty spirit you can command nnnngh ow i gasped you dare to presume you dare to speak such names to draw my attention the voice said i have a stew to make and i will fill it with your arrogant mortal meat there was a sound in the pitchdarkness steel being drawn across stone a few sparks went up blinding in the darkness they burned into my retinas the outline of a massive hunched form grasping a cleaver sparks danced every few seconds as mother winter slowly sharpened her implement i was able to get my breathing under control and to fight past the pain mmm i said mmother winter such a pleasure to meet with you again the next burst of sparks gleamed off of an iron surfaceteeth i nneed to speak to you speak then manling said mother winter you have a little time left the cleaver rasped across the sharpening stone again mab has ordered me to kill maeve i said she is always doing foolish things said mother winter maeve says that mabs gone insane i said lily concurs there was a wheezing sound that might have been a cackle such a loving daughter i had to believe that i was going to get out of this somehow so i pressed her i need to know which of them is right i said i need to know who i should turn my hand against to prevent a great tragedy tragedy said mother winter in a purr that made me think of rasping scorpions pain terror sorrow why should i wish to prevent such a thing it is sweeter than an infants marrow it is a good thing i am a fearless and intrepid wizardly type or that last bit of sentence would have set my flesh to crawling hard enough to carry me across the dirt floor i was kind of hosed anyway so i took a chance i crossed my fingers in the dark and said because nemesis is behind it the cleavers rasp abruptly stopped the darkness and silence were for a moment absolute my imagination treated me to an image of mother winter creeping silently toward me in the blackness cleaver lifted and i stifled an urge to burst into panicked screams so she whispered a moment later you have finally come to see what has been before you all this time uh yeah i guess i know theres something there now at least so very mortal of you learning only when it is too late rasp sparks you arent going to kill me i said im as much your knight as mabs there was a low quiet snort you are no true knight of winter manling once i have devoured your flesh and your mantle with it i will bestow it upon someone worthier of the name i should never have given it to mab uh wow i hadnt thought of that kind of motivation my guts got really watery i tried to move my limbs and found them numbed and only partially functional i started trying to get them to flip me over so that i could get my feet under me uh no i heard myself ask in a panicked cracking voice and why is that exactly mab said mother winter in a tone of pure disgust is too much the romantic which pretty much tells you everything you need to know about mother winter right there she has spent too much time with mortals mother winter continued withered lips peeled back from iron teeth as the sparks from her cleavers edge leapt higher mortals in their soft controlled world mortals with nothing to do but fight one another who have forgotten why they should fear the fangs and the claws the cold and the dark and thats bad what value has life when it is so easily kept mother winter spat the last word mabs weakness is evident look at her knight her knight was currently trying to sit up but his wrists and ankles were fastened to the floor by something cold hard and unseen i tested them but couldnt feel any edges the bonds couldnt have been metal and they werent ice i didnt know how i knew that but i was completely certain ice would have been no obstacle but there was something familiar about it something i had felt before in chichén itzá will mother winter was holding me down by pure stark will the leaders of the red court had been ancient creatures with a similar power but that had been a vague smothering blanket that had made it impossible to move or act a purely mental effort this felt like something similar but far more focused more developed as if thought had somehow crystallized into tangibility my wrists and ankles wouldnt move because mother winters will said that was how reality worked it was like magicbut magic took a seed a kernel of will and built up a framework of other energies around that seed it took intense practice and focus to make that happen but at the end of the day anyones will was only part of the spell alloyed with other energy into something else what held me down now was pure undiluted willthe same kind of will that i suspected had backed up events presaged by phrases like let there be light it was far more than human beyond simple physical strength and if id been the incredible hulk i was pretty sure there was no way id have been able to tear myself free ahhh said mother winter during one last stroke of the cleaver i like nice clean edges to my meat manling time for dinner and slow limping steps came toward me chapter thirtytwo a slow smile stretched my lips back from my teeth mortals had the short end of the stick on almost any supernatural confrontation even most wizards with their access to terrific forces had to approach conflicts carefullyrelatively few of us had the talents that lent themselves to brawling but mortals had everyone else beat on exactly one thing the freedom to choose free will it had taken me a while to begin to understand it but it had eventually sunk into my thick skull i couldnt arm wrestle an ogre even with the mantle i couldnt have won a magical duel with mab or titaniaprobably not even against maeve or lily i couldnt outrun one of the sidhe but i could defy absolutely anyone i could lift my will against that of anything and know that the fight might be lopsided but never hopeless and by thunder i was not going to allow anyones will to stretch me out on the floor like a lamb for slaughter i stopped pressing at my bindings with my limbs and started using my mind instead i didnt try to push them away or break them or slip free of them i simply willed them not to be i envisioned what my limbs would feel like coming free and focused on that reality summoning up my total concentration on that goal that ideal that fact and then i crossed my fingers and reached into me into the place where a covert archangel had granted me access to one of the primal forces of the universe an energy called soulfire i had no idea how it might interact with the winter knights mantle on an ongoing basis i mean it had worked out once before but that didnt mean that it would keep working out i felt certain that i was pretty much swallowing bottles of nitroglycerin then jumping up and down to see what would happen but at this point i had little to lose i gathered up soulfire used it to infuse my raw will and cast the resulting compound against my bonds soulfire according to bob is one of the fundamental forces of the universe the original power of creation it isnt meant for mortals we get it by slicing off a bit of our soul our life energy and converting it into something else bob is brilliant but there are some things that he just doesnt get his definition was a good place to get started but it was also something that was perhaps too comfortably quantifiable the soul isnt something you can weigh and measure its more than just one thing because soulfire interacts with souls in a way that im not sure anyone understands it stands to reason that soulfire isnt just one thing either and in this case in this moment i somehow knew exactly what the soulfire did it converted me my core everything that made me who i was into energy into light when i turned my joined will and the blazing core of my being together i wasnt supercharging a magical spell i wasnt cleverly finding a weak point in an enchantment i wasnt using my knowledge of magic to exploit what my enemy was doing i was casting everything i had done everything i believed everything i had choseneverything i wasagainst the will of an ancient being of darkness terror and malice a fundamental power of the world and the bonds and the will of mother winter could not constrain me there was a sharp shimmering tone like metal under stress and beginning to fail but more musical and a blinding white light that washed away the darkness and dazzled my eyes there was a thunder crack and a terrible force erupted from my wrists and ankles throwing a shock wave of raw kinetic energya mere shadow of the true forces at work a byproductout into the space around me in that whiteness i caught an image of a shrouded hunched dark form flung from her feet to impact something solid and then i was free and hauling myself up onto my feet i backed up hoping i hadnt gotten turned around in the flash and a surge of relief went through me when my back hit a stone wall i felt out along on either side of me and my hand brushed something solid maybe a small shelf made from a wooden plank i knocked it off its peg it fell to the dirt floor with a clatter and a clink of small heavy glass jars i leaned against the wall dazed panting and gasped in my deepest and most gravelly voice no one can chain the hulk i heard a stir of cloth in the darkness then a slight grunt of effort the faintest whistle in the air i cant claim credit for being smart or cool on this one some instinct pegged which way the cleaver was coming and i flung my head sharply to one side sparks flew as the cleaver struck the wall where my skull had been and sank into it as if it had been made of rotten pine not stone it stayed there making a faint vibrating sound as it quivered i have got to learn to keep my freaking mouth shut i clenched my teeth together and stayed still giving no indication of where i might be in the darkness for a long time there was quiet except for the breathing i fought to slow and silence and then a horrible slithering sound went through the blackness it caught in mother winters ancient throat clicking like the shells of swarming carrion beetles it wormed its way through the air like a swarm of maggots burrowing through rotten meat it brushed against me light and hideous like the touch of a vultures liceinfested feather and i struggled to press myself back a little closer to the stone at the sound of it mother winter was cackling so she said so so and so perhaps thou art not entirely useless after all eh manling for all i knew mother winter had a whole cutlery set over there i gathered my will into a shielding spell but i didnt release it magic was like air and water to the fae i had a feeling mother winter would have been able to home in on it that was a test i whisperedbehind my hand so that it might not make it utterly obvious where i was standing or a meal she rasped either would suffice and then brightness flooded the room i thought some massive force had inundated the area i stood in but after a second i realized that it was a door the light was sunlight with the golden quality that somehow felt like autumn i had to shield my eyes against it but after a moment i realized that i was standing in a small simple medievallooking cottageone in which i had been before everything in it was wooden leather clay and handmade the glass in the windows was wavery and translucent it was a neat tidy placeapart from one corner with a large ugly rawlooking rocking chair oh and a spilled shelf of small clay pots with waxsealed mouths you can be so overly dramatic betimes complained an old womans voice as gentle and sweet as mother winters was unpleasant she came into the house a moment later a grandmotherly matron dressed in a simple dress with a green apron her long hair silverwhite and thinning was done up in a small neat bun she moved with the slightly stiff bustling energy of an active senior and if her green eyes were framed by crowsfeet they were bright and sharp mother summer carried a basket in one arm filled with cuttings from what must have been a lateseason herb garden and as i watched she entered muttered a word and a dozen tiny whirlwinds cleaned thick layers of soot from the manypaned windows scattered around the cottage flooding it with more warm light well need a new cleaver now mother winter in her black shawl and hood bared her iron teeth in a snarl though it was a silent one she pointed one crooked warty finger at the window nearest her and blackened it with soot again then she shuffled over to a chair beneath the window and settled into the resulting shadow as if it were a comforting blanket i do what must be done with our cleaver mother summer said i suppose one of our knives wouldnt have done just as well mother winter bared her teeth again i wasnt holding a knife mother summer made a disapproving clucking sound and began unloading her basket onto a wooden table near the fireplace i told you she said calmly mother winter made a soursounding noise and pointed a finger a large mug decorated with delicately painted flowers fell from a shelf mother summer calmly put out a hand caught it and returned it to the shelf oh uh mother summer i said after a moment of silence i apologize for intruding into your home oh dear thats very sweet mother summer said but you owe me no apology you were brought here entirely against your will after all she paused for a beat and added rudely mother winter made another displeased sound i looked back and forth between them centuries of dysfunction in this family harry walk carefully i uh i think id prefer to think of it as a very firm invitation hah said mother winter from her hood her teeth gleamed the knight knows his loyalties at least mother summer somehow managed to inject her voice with profound skepticism im sure hes overjoyed to owe loyalty to you she said why did you bring him here now of all times more teeth showed he summoned me the precious thing mother summer dropped her herbs she turned her head toward me her eyes wide oh she said oh dear mother winters rocker creaked though it didnt really seem to move he knew certain names he was not wholly stupid in choosing them or wholly wrong in using them mother summers bright green eyes narrowed did he no croaked mother winter not that one but he has seen the adversary and learned one of its names calculation and thought flickered through those green eyes faster than i could follow ah yes i see mother summer said so many new futures unwinding too many bright ones mother winter said sullenly even you must think better that than empty night mother winter spit to one side it started eating a hole in the dirt floor a few inches from one of my feet im not kidding i took a small sidestep away and tried not to breathe the fumes i think mother winter said that he should be shown mother summer narrowed her eyes is he ready there is no time to coddle him she rasped he is a weapon let him be made stronger or broken mother summer asked time time winter breathed he is not your weapon it is not your world summer countered excuse me i said quietly green eyes and black hood turned toward me i dont want to be rude maam i said i picked up the fallen wooden shelf from where id knocked it down and put it back on its pegs then i bent and started putting the sealed jars back onto the shelf im still young i make mistakes but im not a child and im not letting anyone but me choose which roads ill walk that made mother winter cackle again precious little duck she wheezed he means it indeed mother summer said but her tone was thoughtful as she watched me restore the fallen shelf to order i kept on replacing jars lining them up neatly and spoke as gently and politely as i knew how you can take my body and run it like a puppet you can kill me you can curse me and torture me and turn me into an animal can said mother winter and might if you maintain this impertinence i swallowed and continued you can destroy me but you cant make me be anything but what i choose to be maam i dont know exactly what you both are talking about showing me maam but you arent going to shove it down my throat or put it up on a shelf out of my reach either one i decide for myself or i walk out the door oh will you said mother winter in a low deadly whisper her overlong nails scraped at the wood on her chairs arms is that what you think my lamb mother summer arched an eyebrow and eyed mother winter you test his defiance against his very life and yet when he passes you are surprised he does not leap to do your bidding she made another disapproving clucking sound he is brave and he is courteous i will show him what you askif he is willing winter bared her teeth and spit again into the same hole and more earth hissed and melted away she started rocking back and forth slowly and turned her gaze elsewhere i picked up the last fallen pot and was about to put it away when i frowned oh im sorry but theres a crack in this one i never heard or saw any movement but suddenly mother summer was there beside me and her bony capable hands were wrapping warmly around mine her touch was like lilys but gentler and more vast it made me think of miles and miles of prairie soaking up the summer suns heat storing it through the day only to give it back to the air in the long hours of twilight as gently as if handling a newborn she took the little clay pot from me and turned it slowly in her fingers examining it then she exhaled slowly closed her eyes for a moment and then put it reverently back onto the shelf when she took her hands from the little pot i saw letters written in silvery light upon it and upon neighboring pots as if the letters had been awakened by the warmth of her hands the writing on the cracked pot said simply wormwood the letters began to fade but i saw some of the others typhos pox atermors choleros malaros typhus smallpox the black death cholera malaria and wormwood and there were lots of other jars on the shelf my hands started shaking a little it is not yet the appointed time for that one to be born mother summer said quietly and her hard eyes flicked toward mother winter she didnt look back toward us but her teeth gleamed from within her hood mother summer slipped her hand through my arm i gave it to her more or less out of reflex and walked across the cottage she picked up her basket and then we went to the door i opened it for her and offered her my arm again and we walked together out of the cottage and into a modest clearing surrounded by ancient forest with trees the size of redwoods they blazed with the colors of fall their leaves carpeting the forest floor in glorious fire as far as the eye could see it was gorgeous but it wasnt anywhere on earth i think she likes you young man yes maam i said i could tell because of the cleaver it is her way mother summer said smiling she rarely leaves our cottage anymore she lost her walking stick while your summons was impertinent it was a necessity and you had the right but it is terribly painful for her to travel even briefly you a mortal hurt her mother summers words made the whole choppedupforstewmeat situation more understandable beings like mother winter tormented mortalsnot the other way around id injured her pride along with the rest of her and in the supernatural world such insults were rarely forgiven and never forgotten she was balancing the scales i said quietly is that what you mean mother summer nodded approval you phrase it simply but not incorrectly she stopped and turned to look up at me she cannot take you to the places we must walk if you are to understand understand what i asked her green eyes reflected the colors of the autumn forest what is at stake she said if you choose to walk with me what is seen cannot be unseen and what is known cannot be unknown it may harm you harm me how i asked you may never know a nights peace again knowledge is power young man power to do good and power to do harm some knowledge can hurt some can kill what happens if i dont have it mother summer smiled a gentle sadness in her eyes you keep the bliss of ignoranceand consign our fates to fickle chance do not choose lightly i pondered it for like ten whole seconds i mean come on im a freaking wizard people its better to know than not know i said quietly why mother summer challenged because you cant truly make a choice without knowledge maam even if it may haunt you harm you isolate you i thought about it some more and then said especially then show me an emotion flickered across mother summers facegentle pain and regret so be it she said quietly come with me chapter thirtythree i walked into the ancient forest with mother summer on my arm following a wide meandering footpath do you mind if i ask you a question while we walk mother summer asked not at all maam i said what do you suppose will happen to you if you do not heed mabs command command i asked dont be coy child mother summer sniffed what my counterpart knows i know mab commanded you to slay maeve what do you think will happen if you disobey her i walked for a while before i answered it depends whether or not mabs still around when the smoke clears i guess i said if she is shell be upset ill wind up like lloyd slate if she isnt yes maeve assumes mabs mantle and becomes the new winter queen exactly mother summer said in time the difference will hardly show but in the immediate future how do you think maeve will treat you i opened my mouth and closed it again i could imagine that vividly enoughmaeve high as a kite on her newfound power giggling and tormenting and killing left and right just because she could do it maeve was the sort who lived to pull the wings off of flies and i was pretty sure whose wings would be the first to catch her eye well crap i said quite so said mother summer and if you do heed mabs command maeves mantle gets passed on to someone else i said and if the adversary can i say that safely mother summer smiled thats why we use that word rather than a name sir knight yes if the adversary has taken mab i said then it gets to choose an agent to take the winter ladys mantle twothirds of the winter court will be under its influence i looked back toward the cottage and that seems like it might be bad for mother winter indeed said mother summer we are all vulnerable to those who are close to us i never figured granny cleaver was close to anyone maam the lines at the corners of mother summers eyes deepened oh she what is the phrase she talks a good game but in her own way she cares i may have arched a skeptical eyebrow kind of like how in her own way she likes me i asked mother summer didnt answer that as our steps carried us into a more deeply shadowed section of the forest it is at times very difficult to be so closely interwoven with mortals she said for you for all of faerie she replied what do you mean she gestured at herself we appear much as humans do we not most of our folk door else they resemble another creature of the mortal world hounds birds stags and so forth sure i said you are endlessly fascinating we conceive our children with mortals we move and sway in time to the mortal seasons we dance to mortal music make our homes like mortal dwellings feast upon mortal foods we find parts of ourselves becoming more like them and yet we are not like them many of the things they think and feel and a great many of their actions are inexplicable to us we dont really understand ourselves all that well yet i said i think it would be very difficult for you to do it mother summer smiled at me and it felt like the first warm day of spring thats true isnt it but youve got a point to make maam i said or you wouldnt have brought up the subject i do she said winter is cold sir knight but never so cold that it freezes the heart altogether youve got to have a heart before it can freeze maam you do i walked for a little while considering that youre saying that i have a chance to stay me im saying many things mother summer said do you have a chance to remain yourself despite the tendency of the mantle to mold your thoughts and desires all knights winter and summer have that chance most fail but its possible i said she looked up at me and her eyes were deeper than time anything is possible ah i said understanding were not really talking about me we are she said serenely turning her eyes away and we are not uh i said im getting a little confused here what are we talking about exactly mother summer smiled at me and then she just clammed up we are were not i kept a straight face while my inner neanderthal spluttered and then went on a mental rampage through a hypothetical produce section knocking over shelves and splattering fruit everywhere in sheer frustration screaming just tell me whose skull to crack with my club dammit flippin faeries they will be the death of me in the spirit of balanced scales i said would it be all right if i asked you a question maam i welcome the question i make no promises as to the answer i nodded who are you really mother summer stopped in her tracks and turned to look at me her eyebrows slowly lifted that is a very significant question i know i said blame it on halloween why should i do that i shrugged and we began walking again its just got me thinking masks i know of one figure from ancient tales who is alive and well and incognito why shouldnt there be more mother summer inclined her head more a gesture of acknowledgment or admission than agreement things change she said immortals deal poorly with change but it comes to everyone i called mother winter by the names athropos and skuld because they seemed to fit her i said i mean she likes her sharp implements apparently mother summers smile appeared for a moment dazzling me and then was gone again it was not an imbecilic guess she said and yes she has been known by such names before but youve only guessed the name of one of her masksnot our most powerful name our i said wait im confused i know she said here we are we stopped in the middle of a forest path that didnt look any different from anything around it mother summer stopped and frowned at me you really arent dressed for the climate dont worry about it i said i can handle cold she let go of my arm looked me up and down then put a hand on the handle of the basket she carried over one arm and said something a little less informal would be appropriate i think ive played ken doll to a faerie fashion adviser before so i wasnt entirely shocked when my clothing began to writhe and simply change when the leanansidhe had done it id sat in the car for half an hour suffering through one fanciful and undignified outfit after another not this time my clothes transformed from cloth into customfitted steel well probably not steel but whatever the equivalent was that the sidhe used in their armor the armor was plain and functional with no ornaments on ita breastplate vambraces and large pauldrons for my shoulders heavy tassets hung from the bottom of the breastplate protecting my thighs my lower legs were covered with greaves front and back the armor was black and gleaming and where light fell directly on it you could see shades of deep purple and dark blue i realized that i was holding a helmet under my left arm and i took it in both hands to look at it it was a corinthian helm like they wore in that movie about the spartans only without the fancy tail it was padded on the inside i slipped it on and it fit perfectly much better said mother summer stay near me at all times i looked around the perfectly serene forest it was a bit of an effort since the helmet kept me from turning my head very smoothly i looked up too im sure the armor made me look goofy uh okay mother summer smiled took my arm again and stretched out one foot she used it to brush a layer of dirt and fallen leaves from the pitted surface of a flat stone like a paving stone maybe three feet square she tapped it three times with her foot whispered a word and drew me along with her as she stepped onto it no drama ensued the landscape simply changed as swiftly and drastically as when you turn on a light while in a darkened room one second we stood in an autumnal megaforest the next ive seen movies and newsreels about world war i they didnt cover it as thoroughly in my schools because america didnt have a leading role in it and because the entire stupid avoidable mess was a continental clusterfuck that killed millions and settled nothing but the teams for the next world war but what they did show me i remembered miles and miles of trenches a smokehaunted nomansland strung with muddy rusty barbed wire and lined with machine guns and marksmen there was a pall of smoke that turned the sun into a dully glowing orb but the movies couldnt cover all the senses there was a constant rumble in the sky thunder born of violence and there was everywhere the smell of feces and death we stood atop a small barren mountain looking down near us only a few hundred yards away was an immense wall the kind youd use to hold out the mongols if they were the size of king kong it was built entirely from ice or some kind of translucent crystal even from here i could see that there were chambers and rooms in the wall rooms containing barracks hospitals kitchens you name it there were dim and indistinct forms moving around in them the walls were lined with what had to be tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of soldiers i peered trying to get a better look and then realized that they were armored sidhe all of them they all wore armor similar to mine its highlights throwing back the cool muted shades of winter out beyond the wall was a land made of dust and mud and loose shale it was covered in hillocks and steep gullies and the only plants that grew there looked like they were certain to poke scratch or sting you though the land was somehow lit the sky was as black as cat siths conscience without a single star or speck of light to be seenand it was an overwhelming sky enormous like in the open rolling lands of montana and wyoming there were more bodies of troops moving out there some of them looked like they might have been giants or maybe trolls larger groups containing smaller individuals were likely winters gnomes things flew in the air bands of what appeared to be mounted cavalry rode back and forth some of the soldiers looked suspiciously like animated snowmen from this vantage point i could see two major engagements happening each containing maybe forty thousand winter troops and they were fighting i couldnt make out the enemy there didnt seem to be any unity of form they were creaturescreatures whose physiologies made no sense were utterly without order i saw what appeared to be tentacles enormous mandibles claws fangs clublike limbs and tails they werent bipedal they werent quadrupeds in fact they seemed to have no regard for bilateral symmetry at all i peered a little closer and felt a sudden horrible pressure inside my head i felt dizzy for a second nauseated and at the same time part of me was screaming that i needed to ditch my escort and go look at these things for myself that there was something there something i wanted to see something i wanted to stare at for a while a cold somehow greasy tendril of energy slithered around inside my head something i had felt before when i jerked my eyes away with a short grunt of effort closed them and left them closed holy outsiders mabs fighting outsiders mother summer said nothing i dont i dont understand i said finally white council intelligence always estimated mabs troop count at around fifty thousand there are freaking formations out there with more troops in them than that mother summer said nothing but she did lift a finger and point off to the left i looked and saw a pair of towers the size of the chrysler building rising up over the wall between them was a pair of gates the gates were something amazing to look at they were huge bigger than most chicago apartment buildings they were made of a darker shade of the same ice or crystal and there were designs and sigils carved into them layer after layer after layer i recognized a couple of the ones i could see clearly they were wards protective enchantments there was a sudden sound a rising moan like the wind shaking trees or surf striking a cliff walland the horizon outside the walls was suddenly lined with dark grotesque figures all of them charging forward toward the winter troops faint horn calls sounded clear and valiant winters troops began to retreat back toward the gates gathering into a great arch on the ground outside them locking their formation into place while cavalry harassed the oncoming outsiders slowing their advance then the cavalry streaked from their engagement passing safely through the lines of infantry to come riding back through the gates the outsiders came on and crashed against the winter lines battle ensued from this far away it just looked like a big confusing mess with everyone jostling for a better position but i could see a few things i saw an ogre go down when an outsider spit acid that started eating through his eyes into his skull i saw the winter lines falter and the outsiders began pouring reinforcements into the weakness then a small crew of goblins exploded out of a pile of shale at precisely the right moment when the outsiders were pressed almost into the winter lines but before reinforcements arrived the surprise attack drove the outsiders forward when i could see that the weak regiment had been playing the outsiders for suckers falling back but doing so in good order the outsiders had overreached themselves and were now surrounded on all four sides by the savage troops of winter the wouldbe invaders didnt make it and that was only a tiny fraction of the battle my senses and mind alike simply could not process everything i was seeing but my heart was beating very swiftly and frozen fear had touched my spine like mabs fingers the outsiders wanted in when i asked when did this start oh harry mother summer said gently what i asked but i had noticed something those layers and mounds of shale they werent shale they were bones millions and millions and millions of fucktons of bones what the hell is going on here i breathed where are we the edge of faerie she said our outer borders it would have taken you a decade to learn to travel out this far oh i said and and its like this in essence mother summer said she stared sadly out over the plain did you think mab spent all her days sitting in her chair and dealing with her backstabbing courtiers no sir knight power has purpose what happens if they get in i asked mother summers lips thinned everything stops everything holy crap i muttered does summer have a place like this too then mother summer shook her head that was never its task your councils estimate was fairly close counting only those troops protecting the hearts of winter and summer mab has more than that she needs themfor this i felt like id been hit repeatedly in the head with a rubber hammer so mabs troops outnumber yours by a jillion indeed so she could run you over at any time she could mother summer said if she were willing to forfeit reality i scanned the length of the wall nervously it looked like it went on foreverand there was fighting all along its length youre telling me that this is why mab has her power to to protect the borders to protect all of you from the outsiders mortal then why does titania have hers i asked to protect all of you from mab i swallowed titania cannot match mabs forces but she can drag mab personally into oblivion with herand mab knows it titania is the check to her power the balance if mab dies i began she swept a hand along the length of the wall a spoiled sadistic murderous and inexperienced child will have control of all of that hells bells i rubbed at my eyes and as i did i connected some dots and realized something else this is a siege i said those guys out there are attacking the walls but there are others trying to dig their way in so that they can open the gates for their buddies thats what the adversary is right a sapper an infiltrator mother summer said there you see you possess the potential to be quite intelligent do stay beside me dear and she started walking firmly toward the massive gates it didnt take us long to get there but as we came up to the base of the wall and walked along it we started drawing the eyes of the walls defenders i felt myself growing tenser as a marching column of armored sidhe soldiers came stepping lightly along the ground behind us catching up quickly mother summer guided me slightly aside so that we werent in the columns way and they started going by us i didnt think much of it until someone at the front of the column called out in a clear voice and as one the sidhe came to a halt with a solid simultaneous stomp of a couple of hundred boots the voice barked another command and the sidhe all turned to face us uhoh i said mother summer touched my hand with hers and reassurance bathed me like june sunshine shhh the voice barked another command and as one the sidhe lowered themselves to one knee and bowed their heads good morrow cousins mother summer said her voice solemn she took her hand off my arm and passed it in a broad sweeping arch over the kneeling soldiers subtle subtle power thrummed delicately in the air go forth with my blessing one of the soldiers in the lead of the column rose and bowed to her somehow conveying gratitude then he snapped out another loud command and the column rose turned and continued its quickstep march huh i said yes asked mother summer i was sort of expecting something else winter and summer are two opposing forces of our world she said but we are of our world here that is all that matters and showing respect to ones elders is never unwise yes maam i said mother summer gave me a small shrewd smile we continued our walk in their wake and soon reached the gates there i saw a smaller set of gatessally portsbuilt into the main gates they were the size of the garage doors on a fire station as i watched someone shouted a command and a pair of heavily armored ogres each grabbed one of the sally ports and drew it open the column that had passed us stood waiting to march out but they did not immediately proceed instead a column of carts and litters entered bearing the groaning wounded of the fighting outside being watched over by several dozen sidhe dressed in pure white armor marked with bold green and scarlet trimsidhe knights of summer medics despite the massive numbers of troops id seen moving around there were fewer than a hundred casualties brought back to the gates evidently the outsiders were not in the business of leaving enemies alive behind them a lean figure came down a stairway built within the walls framing the gates at first a shadowy blur through the layers and layers of crystal he was a couple of inches taller than me which put him at the nextbest thing to seven feet but he moved with a brisk bustling sense of energy and purpose he wore a dark robe that looked black at first but as he emerged into the light highlights showed it to be a deep purple he carried a long pale wizards staff in one weathered hand and his hood covered up most of his face except for part of an aquiline nose and a long chin covered in a grizzled beard he spoke to the summer and winter sidhe alike in a language i didnt understand but they evidently did giving instructions to summers medics they took his orders with a kind of rigid formal deference he leaned over to scan each of the fallen closely nodding at the medics after each and they would immediately carry the wounded sidhe in question back behind the wall into what looked like a neat triage area rashid i murmured recognizing the man what is he doing here i froze and stared up at the massive gates rising above us rashid a member of the senior council of the white council of wizards had another title the name he went by most often the gatekeeper he finished with the last of the wounded then turned and approached us with long purposeful strides he paused a few steps away and bowed to mother summer who returned the gesture with a deep formal nod of her head then he came the rest of the way to me and i could see the gleam of a dark eye inside his hood his smile was wide and warm and he extended his hand to me i took it and shook it feeling a little overwhelmed well well he said his voice was a deep warm thing marked with an accent that sounded vaguely british seasoned with plenty of more exotic spices i had hoped we would see your face again warden rashid i replied uh were theyre the gatekeepers smile turned a bit rueful ah yes he said theyre impressive the first time i suppose welcome warden dresden to the outer gates chapter thirtyfour the outer gates arent real i said numbly theyre a theyre supposed to be a metaphor mother summer smiled very faintly ill leave mortal business to mortals she said ill be nearby young wizard um i said thank you she nodded and walked away toward the wounded sidhe well the gatekeeper said to me he seemed if not precisely cheerful it was something that lived on the same blockpositive confident and strong youve managed to travel a very long way from home mother summer drove i said ah he said still i cant recall the last time a wizard of your age managed the trip however it was done you take after your mother i blinked you knew her those of us who spend any amount of time walking the ways tend to develop a certain amount of camaraderie we would have dinner every so often compare notes of our walks and there were several of us who were friends of ebenezar who took it upon ourselves to watch over her i nodded keeping my face as blank as i could it was not general knowledge that maggie lefey had been ebenezars daughter if rashid knew it was because my grandfather trusted him the fresh armored column of sidhe began to move out and as they did horns began to call in the land beyond rashid turned his head toward them listening as if to a spoken language and the smile faded from his mouth theyre massing again he said i have little time he reached up and did something id seen him do only once before the gatekeeper lowered his hood he had short hair that was still thick and gleamed silver but his features were weathered as if from long years under harsh sunlight his skin was paler now but there was still something of the desert on his skin his face was long his brows still dark and full he had a double scar on his left eyebrow and cheek two long lines that went straight down a lot like mine only deeper and thicker and all the way to his jawline and they were much softer with long years of healing maybe he hadnt been as good at flinching as i was because hed lost the eye beneath the scar one of his eyes was nearly black it was so dark the other had been replaced with i looked around me yes definitely the other eye had been replaced with the crystalline material that was identical to that which had been used to create the gates and the walls around them steel i said pardon he asked your uh other eye it was steel before im sure it looked like steel he said the disguise is necessary when im not here your job is so secret your false eye gets a disguise i asked guess i see why you miss council meetings he inclined his head and ruffled his fingers through mussed tousled hoodhair it can be quiet for years here sometimes and others he spread his hands but they need a good eye here to be sure that the things that must remain outside do not slip in unnoticed inside the wounded i guessed or returning troops or medics youve become aware of the adversary he said his tone one of firm approval excellent i was certain your particular pursuits would get you killed long before you got a chance to learn how can i help i asked him he leaned his head back and then a slow smile reasserted itself on his face i know something of the responsibilities youve chosen to take up he said to say nothing of the problems youve created for yourself that you havent found out about yet and still in the face of learning that our world spins out its days under siege you offer to help me i think you and i could be friends wait i said what problems i havent been trying to create problems oh he said waving a hand youve danced about in the shadows at the edge of life now young man thats no small thing to go into those shadows and come back againyouve no idea the kind of attention youve attracted oh i said good because the pace was starting to slow down so much that i was getting bored at that rashid tilted his head back and laughed would you be offended if i called you harry no because its my name exactly he said harry i know you have questions i can field a very few before i go i nodded thinking okay i said first how do you know if the adversary has infested someone experience he said decades of it the sight can help but rashid hesitated i recognized it instantly the hiccup in ones thoughts when one stumbled over a truly hideous memory gained with the sight like id had with ugh the naagloshii i dont recommend making a regular practice of it he continued its an art not a skill and it takes time time or a bit of questionable attention from the fates and a ridiculously enormous tool he tapped a finger against his false eye i blinked even though he didnt and looked up at the massive gates stretching overhead hells bells the gates theyre some kind of spiritual cat scanner among many other things he said but its one of their functions yes mostly it means that the adversary cannot use such tactics effectively here as long as the gatekeeper is vigilant it rarely tries the horns sounded again and the muscles in his jaw tensed next question i hate trying to be smart under time pressure this i said pointing up at the gates what the hell how long has this attack been going on always he said there are always outsiders trying to tear their way in there are always forces in place to stop them in our age it is the task of winter to defend these boundaries with the help of certain others to support them think of them as an immune system for the mortal world i felt my eyes get wide an immune system what happens if it you know if it breaks down for a bit pardon the gatekeeper asked uh it gets a glitch like if somebody new took over or something and things had to reorganize around here most years it would pose no major difficulty he said what about this year this year he said it could be problematic problematic rather severely so rashid studied my face and then started to nod i see there are things happening back in winter thats why mother summer brought you here to show you what was at stake i swallowed and nodded no pressure or anything rashids face reacted at that i couldnt say what the exact mix of emotion on it was though one of them was a peculiar kind of empathy he set his staff aside and gripped my upper arms with his hands listen to me because this is important okay i said you get used to it he said i blinked what thats it he tilted his head to look at me obliquely with his good eye ill get used to it thats the important pep talk ill get used to it his mouth quivered he gave my arms a last maybe affectionate squeeze and released them pep what is needed in the warden is far more than pep harry what then i asked he took up his staff and poked my chest with it gently you it would seem what you he repeated firmly what we need is you you have what you have for a reason unwitting or not virtually your every action in the past few years has resulted in a series of wellplaced thumbs in the adversarys eye you want to know how you can help me harry engh i said frustrated yeah go back to chicago he said turning away and keep being yourself wait i said i need help at that he paused he looked back at me and gave me a quiet smile i know precisely how it feels to be where you are he gestured back toward the battleground precisely he seemed to think about it for a moment and then nodded i will do what i can if we both survive the next several hours i will settle matters between you and the council which knows only as much about our roles as it needs toand that isnt much i will verify your return and that you are indeed yourself and will see to it that your back pay as one of the wardens is forwarded to you theres some paperwork to fill out to get the councils office to reestablish your official identity with the government but ill see to it that it happens i think i remember all the necessary forms i stared at him for a second and said youll youll help me with white council paperwork he held up a finger do not underestimate the depth of this favor he said soberly but his eye was twinkling and on a similar note do not underestimate yourself you havent been given the power and the knowledge and allies and the resources you possess for no reason harry nothing i have to say can possibly make this task any easier for you the only way to do it is to do it he lifted his chin you dont need help warden you are the help were in trouble i said he winked at me restored his hood to its usual position and said we always are the only difference is now you know it god be with you my friend i will cover this end you see to yours he took several rapid paces out from under the towering gates and gestured a second later i kid you not a freaking woven carpet maybe ten feet by twenty came sailing neatly down out of the sky coming to hover about six inches off the ground beside him rashid stepped onto the carpet slipped his boots into some kind of securing straps on it and then lifted his staff the carpet and the gatekeeper rose serenely up out of sight and a second later went streaking out over the stormlit battlefield in a howl of whirling winds and thats when it hit me i mean when it really really hit me it was up to me there wasnt a backup plan there wasnt a second option there wasnt any cavalry coming over the hill the white council was the nextbest thing to clueless about what was happening and would never in a zillion years admit that they were tonight a catastrophe that could kill millions of people including my daughter was going to happen unless i stopped it and on top of that there was a deadly turbulence happening inside the winter court and depending on which side i threw in on i could save or destroy the world as we knew it walking away from this one was not an option no dodges no delays no excuses it would happen or it wouldnt depending on me i looked down at my bruised hands i slowly closed them into fists and then opened them again they were battered hands and they didnt have anywhere near as much skill as i could have wished were in thembut they were what i had i had earned the scars on them they were mine id done this before never on this scale maybe but id done it before id saved the day mostly more or less on several occasions id done it before and i could do it again there wasnt any other way it was going to happen the only good thing about having your back to the wall is that it makes it really easy to choose which way youre going to go i felt like throwing up but i stiffened my back and straightened my shoulders and walked quickly over to mother summer as she finished standing up from tending to the last of the wounded sidhe maam i said quietly id appreciate it if you could take me home i have work to do chapter thirtyfive with all the benevolence shed had going on i sort of forgot that mother summer wasnt human she took me from the gates back to her cottage in silence smiled touched my head with her handand sent me back to my freaking grave i landed on my ass in the muddy broken iceand could still hear the echoes of the crackling detonation when mother winters ugly mitt had smashed up through it and grabbed my noggin i could still hear the raucous cawing of startled crows time had all but stopped while i was goneor more accurately time had flown by extremely swiftly where i had been in the nevernever relative to chicago id been on the other side of that kind of time dilation while dealing with beings of faerie before but this was the first time id actually benefited from it gaining time rather than losing it which i hadnt even considered until now if things had gone the way they usually did when one got pulled into faerie business i could have been gone for an hour and come back a year later to what would presumably have been a blasted wasteland the thought made my stomach churn with anxiety but i suppose i hadnt exactly volunteered for the trip it wasnt like id taken a hideous risk on that scoreit had been something entirely outside of my control that was scary too while i was sitting there wondering whether that meant that i was a control freak or just sane a goth kid poked her head into view atop my grave and peered down at me she took a cigarette in one of those long holders out of her mouth exhaled smoke through her nose and said dude that is pretty hardcore down there are you like gonna cut yourself or something no i said selfconsciously hiding my hand behind my back i looked down and only then did i realize that my outfit had changed from the sidhe armor back to the secondhand clothes id been wearing before i fell other gothlings appeared the girl repeated herself and the others agreed that i was hardcore down there i sighed i gathered my things and clambered out with some reluctantly offered help i didnt need it but i thought it might be good for some kids selfesteem then i looked around at all the people staring at me hunched my shoulders up around my head and hurried out of the graveyard before anyone else could become helpful when i got back to mollys place she asked why do you smell like cloves kids today i said im just glad they werent smoking marijuana ah molly said goths so i guess thats grave dirt on you stop sherlocking me i said and yes it is and im showering any word not yet molly said toots waiting outside for his crew to get back i had to promise him extra pizza to keep him from going out to look himself i figured we needed him to coordinate the guard good thinking i said one sec i went into my temporary quarters and got clean it wasnt just because i had mud from a centuryold graveyard on me along with an open wound on my hand and because i feared about a million horrible things that could be made from those ingredients the whole wizardmetabolism thing means that our immune systems are pretty much topoftheline i doubted the winter knights mantle was slouchy in defending against such mundane threats either it was mostly because id been up close and personal with some extremely powerful creatures and such beings radiate magic like body heat its the sort of thing that can cling to you if you arent careful maybe coloring the way you think a bit and definitely having the potential to influence anything you do with magic it happens with people too but with people even wizards their aura is so much less powerful that the effect is negligible running water cleanses away the residue of that kind of contact and i wanted to be sure that whatever happened tonight i wasnt going to be handicapped by any mystic baggage from todays visits i hit the shower bowing my head under the hot water and thought about things the mothers had been trying to tell me something something they hadnt said outright maybe they hadnt wanted to just give me what i wantedbut way more likely maybe they were incapable of it i had bullied maeve and lily into straight talk such as it had been and it had obviously been uncomfortable for them i would never have tried the same thing on titania or mab for whatever reason it seemed that the essential nature of the queens of faerie was to be as indirect and oblique about things as possible it was built into them along with things like not being able to tell a direct lie it was who they were and the farther up the chain you went the more steeped in that essential nature the queens became maybe titania or mab could be a little bit straightforward at times but i doubt they could have laid out a simple declarative statement about the issue at hand without a major effort and if that was true then maybe the mothers couldnt have done it even if they wanted to thered been a message in all their talk especially mother summers but what the hell had it been or maybe this wasnt a humanfaerie translation problem at all maybe this was a malefemale translation problem i read an article once that said that when women have a conversation theyre communicating on five levels they follow the conversation that theyre actually having the conversation that is specifically being avoided the tone being applied to the overt conversation the buried conversation that is being covered only in subtext and finally the other persons body language that is on many levels astounding to me i mean thats like having a freaking superpower when i and most other people with a y chromosome have a conversation were having a conversation singular were paying attention to what is being said considering that and replying to it all these other conversations that have apparently been going on for the last several thousand years i didnt even know that they existed until i read that stupid article and im pretty sure im not the only one i felt somewhat skeptical about the articles grounding there were probably a lot of women who didnt communicate on multiple wavelengths at once there were probably men who could handle that many just fine i just wasnt one of them so ladies if you ever have some conversation with your boyfriend or husband or brother or male friend and you are telling him something perfectly obvious and he comes away from it utterly clueless i know its tempting to think to yourself the man cant possibly be that stupid but yes yes he can our innate strengths just arent the same we are the mighty hunters who are good at focusing on one thing at a time for crying out loud we have to turn down the radio in the car if we suspect were lost and need to figure out how to get where were going thats how impaired we are im telling you we have only the one conversation maybe some kind of relationship veteran like michael carpenter can do two but thats pushing the envelope five simultaneous conversations five shah that just isnt going to happen at least not for me so maybe it was something perfectly obvious and i was just too dumb to get it maybe the advice of someone less impaired than me would help i went back into my head and made sure that i remembered the details of my recent conversations putting them in order so that i could get a consult once my brain had resolved that it went straight down a road id been trying to detour around if i blew it tonight people i loved were going to die people who werent involved in the fight people like michael and his family and and my daughter maggie should i call them tell them to hit the road and start driving did i have the right to do that when so many other peoples loved ones were at risk too with no possible way to get them out of reach of harm did that matter was i going to be responsible for my daughters death the way i was for her mothers the lights didnt waver but it got really really dark in that shower for a minute and then i shook it off i didnt have time to waste moaning about my poor daughter and my poor life and gosh do i feel bad about the horrible things ive done i could indulge my selfpity after id taken care of business scratch that after id taken care of bidness i slammed the water off hard enough to make it clack got out of the shower dried and started getting dressed in a fresh set of secondhand clothes why do you wear those asked lacuna i jumped stumbled and shouted half of a word to a spell but since i was only halfway done putting on my underwear i mostly just fell on my naked ass gah i said dont do that my miniature captive came to the edge of the dresser and peered down at me dont ask questions dont come in here all quiet and spooky and scare me like that youre six times my height and fifty times my weight lacuna said gravely and ive agreed to be your captive you dont have any reason to be afraid not afraid i snapped back startled it isnt wise to startle a wizard why not because of what could happen because they might fall down on the floor no i snarled lacuna frowned and said you arent very good at answering questions i started shoving myself into my clothes im starting to agree with you so why do you wear those i blinked clothes yes you dont need them unless its cold or raining youre wearing clothes i am wearing armor for when it is raining arrows your tshirt will not stop arrows no it wont i sighed lacuna peered at my shirt aerosmith arrowsmith does the shirt belong to your weapon dealer no then why do you wear the shirt of someone elses weapon dealer that was frustrating in so many ways that i could avoid a stroke only by refusing to engage lacuna i said humans wear clothes its one of the things we do and as long as you are in my service i expect you to do it as well why because if you dont i i might pull your arms out of your sockets at that she frowned why because i have to maintain discipline dont i true she said gravely but i have no clothes i counted to ten mentally ill find something for you until then no desocketing just wear the armor fair enough lacuna bowed slightly at the waist i understand my lord good i sighed i flicked a comb through my wet hair for all the good it would do and said how do i look mostly human she said thats what i was going for you have a visitor my lord i frowned what that is why i came in here you have a visitor waiting for you i stood up exasperated why didnt you say so lacuna looked confused i did just now you were there she frowned thoughtfully perhaps you have brain damage it would not shock me in the least i said would you like me to cut open your skull and check my lord she asked someone that short should not be that disturbing i no no but thank you for the offer it is my duty to serve lacuna intoned my life hells bells i beckoned lacuna to follow me mostly so i would know where the hell she was and went back out into the main room sarissa was there she sat at the kitchen table her small hands clutched around one of mollys mugs and she looked like hell there was a dark red mouse on her left cheekbone one that was swelling and beginning to purple nicely her hands and forearms were scraped and bruiseddefensive injuries she wore a pale blue tshirt and dark blue cotton pajama pants both were soaked from the rain and clinging in a fashion that made me want to stare her dark hair was askew and her eyes were absolutely haunted they darted nervously toward me when i appeared and her shoulders hunched slightly molly said something quiet to her and rose from the table crossing the room to me she said you knew her molly said i do she all right shes a mess molly said showed up and begged security to call me before they called the cops and it isnt the first time this has happened to her shes terrified to be hereterrified of you personally i think i frowned at my apprentice molly shrugged her emotions are really loud im not even trying to pick anything up okay i said is she on the level i thought about it for a second before i answered shes mabs bff so that would be a no then molly said probably so i said theres bound to be an angle here even if she doesnt know that there is one shes a pawn in winter somebody has got to be moving her molly winced shes also a lifelong survivor in winter so dont let your guard down the last creature who did wound up as frozen kibble i jerked my head toward the exit heard anything from the scouts yet she shook her head okay well talk to her stay close i might need to pick your brain about something later right molly said blinking a little then she followed me back over to sarissa she gave me a nervous smile and her fingers resettled on the mug a couple of times harry i didnt realize you made house calls all the way to chicago i said i wish it were that she said i nodded how did you know where to find me i was given directions she said by who she swallowed and looked down at the tabletop the redcap i sat back slowly in my seat maybe youd better tell me what happened he came for me she said quietly without meeting my eyes he came this morning i was hooded bound and taken somewhere i dont know where i was there for several hours then he came back took my hood off and sent me here with this she reached down to her lap and put a plain white envelope on the table she pushed it toward me i took it it wasnt sealed i opened it frowned and then turned it upside down over the table several tufts of hair bound with small bits of string fell out along with a small metal object molly drew in a sharp breath he said to tell you that hes taken your friends sarissa said quietly i picked up the tufts of hair one at a time wiry black slightly crinkled hairs sprinkled with silver ones butters red hairs luscious and curly andi and a long soft slightly wavy lock of pure white hair i lifted it to my nose and sniffed strawberries i let out a soft curse who molly asked her voice worried justine i said oh god i picked up the metal object it was a plain bottle cap slightly dented where it had been removed and mac i said quietly he had someone following me everywhere i went he took someone from each place he told me to tell you sarissa said that hell trade them all for you if you surrender to him before sundown and if i dont i asked hell give their bones to the rawhead she whispered chapter thirtysix silence fell okay i said into it ive just about had enough of that clown molly looked up at me her eyes worried you sure guy gets his jollies dipping his hat in peoples blood i said you can bargain with the sidhe sometimes molly said but not this time i said my voice hard if we do hell keep the letter of his word and hell make sure they dont make it out anyway the only way were getting our friends back is to take them away from him molly grimaced but after a moment she nodded i picked up the clumps of hair and put them in a neat row on the table molly on it she said collecting them what are you doing sarissa asked her eyes wide the jerk was kind enough to give me some fresh cuttings from my friends i said im going to use them to track him down and thwart him thwart sarissa asked thwart i said to prevent someone from accomplishing something by means of visiting gratuitous violence upon his smarmy person im pretty sure that isnt the definition sarissa said it is today i raised my voice cat sith i need your assistance please sarissa went completely still when i spoke like a rabbit who has sensed a nearby predator her eyes widened then flicked around the room seeking escape its okay i told her im getting along with him youre a wizard and the winter knight sarissa hissed you have no idea how vicious that creature is and i dont have the queens aegis protecting me you have mine i said i raised my voice annoyed cat sith kittykittykittykitty are you insane sarissa hissed he might not be able to get through harry molly said its not just a threshold here the svartalves have wards over the building as well makes sense i said be right back i went out and looked around but sith didnt appear i called his name a third time which as we all know is the charm with beings of the nevernever its a literal truth i mean its not an irresistible force like gravityits more like a kind of obsessivecompulsive disorder that happens to be present to varying degrees in most of them they respond strongly to things that happen in threes be they requests insults or commands so in a way three really is a magic number hell just ask ménageàthomas jerk i waited for a while even going so far as to turn about and take a few steps backward before turning forward again just to give sith some really rich opportunities to appear abruptly and startle me except he didnt i got a slow squirmy feeling in the pit of my stomach the rain was still falling in spits and showers but the clouds had begun to gain the tint of a slow autumn sundown sith had always appeared almost instantly before had mab been setting me up had she given me the eldest malks assistance so that she could pull the rug out from under me when i needed sith the most had she gotten the nemesis brainmold i hadnt seen sith since the confrontation at the gardens had the enemy sidhe brought him down or worse the adversary i felt actively sick to my stomach if cat sith had been turned there was no telling how much damage he might cause especially to me i felt a little stupid about the kittykittykitty thing hopefully he hadnt been listening i went back into the apartment pensive molly gave me an inquiring look i shook my head molly frowned at that i could see the gears whirling in her brain okay i said plan b lacuna come here if you please after a moment a little voice said from the direction of my room what if i dont please you come here anyway i stated its a human thing she made a disgusted noise and came zipping out of the room on her blurring wings what do you want me to do you can read i said can you read a map write yes youre on house duty then i said if any of the little folk come back with a location where a rite is taking place i want you to write down their descriptions and mark the location on the map can you do that lacuna looked dubiously at the maps spread out on the table i think so probably maybe and no fighting or duels what about when im done writing things no lacuna folded her little arms and scowled at me you arent fun at all your breath smells like celery i replied molly how are those spells coming along i think theres some kind of counterspell hiding them she said its tricky so stop bumping my elbow im concentrating over here i let out an impatient breath and fought against a surge of anger she was the apprentice and i was the wizard there were wizards who would have beaten unconscious any apprentice who spoke to them like that id always been kind to hermaybe too kindand this disrespect was what i got in return i should educate her to respect her betters i made a low growling sound in my chest and clenched my fists that impulse wasnt mine it was winters molly and i had a relationship built on structure trust and respectnot fear we had always bantered back and forth like that but something in me wanted to i dont know put her in her place take out my frustrations on her show her which of us was the strongest and it had a really primitive idea of how to make that happen but that was unthinkable that was the mantle talking loudly hells bells as if i didnt have enough trouble thinking my way past the influence of my own glands already i heard a slight sound behind me and turned in time to see sarissa vanish into the bathroom moving in absolute silence the rabbit had given up the statue routine and bolted sarissa had good instincts when it came to predators i turned back to molly to find her looking at me her eyes wide molly was a psychic sensitive she could feel emotions the way most of us can feel the temperature of a room sometimes she could even pluck someones thoughts out of the air she knew exactly what i was feeling she had all along and she hadnt run are you okay she asked quietly its nothing i said i forced myself to think my way past the mantles influence find a steel needle to use as the focus i said should give you an edge against whatever magic the sidhe are using should have thought of that molly chided herself thats why they pay me the big bucks i turned and walked away from my apprentice to let her work without the distraction of my tangle of winters urges blaring into her skull like an airhorn i rummaged around in her fridge and made a sandwich from a bagel i split down the middle and a small mountain of two differentcolored deli meats i wolfed it down less than five minutes later molly tied a needle onto a piece of wood with one of each of the human hairs she then placed it gently into a bowl of water and performed the tracking spell without a hitch the needle slowly swung around to point east directly toward my abducted friends probably there were ways to futz about with tracking spells but it appeared that the addition of steel to our own spell had overcome whatever the redcap had cooked up i extended my senses and checked the tracking spell it was as solid as one of my own good work i said then i walked over to the bathroom door and knocked gently sarissa i said can you hear me yes she answered were going out i said i hope we wont be gone long you should be safe here but youre free to leave if you want to do so i think you might be followed if you do but you arent a prisoner or anything okay there was a hesitant moment of silence and then she said i understand theres food in the fridge molly called and you can sleep in my room if youre tired the door has a lock there was no answer lets get moving i said to molly i want to make a stop before we track them down the svartalves security guy stopped us before we could leave and informed us that my car had been repaired and delivered and that they would bring it around for me molly and i traded a glance um how sure are you that the vehicle is secure molly asked mr etri personally requested a security sweep the guard said its already been screened for weapons explosives toxins and any kind of enchantment miss carpenter right now theyre running it under a waterfall to wash away any tracking spells that might be on it its the same procedure mr etri uses to secure his own cars miss who brought it molly asked the guard took a small notebook from his pocket and checked it a local mechanic named mike atagi think theres a picture he thumbed through the pages and then held up a color printout that had been folded into the notebook this is him i leaned forward to peer at the photo well son of a gun it was my old mechanic mike mike had been a miracle worker when it came to repairing the blue beetle working with a talent that was the nextbest thing to sorcery to bring the car back from the dead over and over again did he say who delivered it to him i asked the guard checked his notes here that it was waiting at his shop when he got there along with a deposit and a rush order reading repair this for harry dresden and return it to the following address or suffer mortal smith cat sith i said well at least he was on the job while we were out at the island there was a low growling sound and the munstermobile came gliding up out of the parking garage dripping water from its gleaming surface like some lanterneyed leviathan rising from the depths there were still a few dents and dings in it but the broken glass had all been replaced and the engine sounded fine okay im not like a car fanatic or anythingbut the guitar riff from bad to the bone started playing in my head wheels i said excellent the munstermobile came gliding up to us and stopped still dripping water and another security guy got out of it left the driver door open and came around to open the passenger door for molly i touched mollys shoulder to stop her from moving to get in immediately and spoke to her very quietly how much do you trust your friend mr etri etri might oppose you molly said he might break your bones he might cut your throat in your sleep or make the ground swallow you up but he will never ever lie about his intentions hes not a friend harry but he is my ally hes good at it i wanted to say something smartass about not trusting anyone who lived anywhere near the faerie realms but i held back for one thing svartalves take paranoia to an art form and i had no doubt they would be listening to everything everyone said on their own property while not in private quarters it would have been stupid to insult them for another thing they had an absolutely ironclad reputation for integrity and neutrality no one crossed a svartalf lightlybut on the other hand the svartalves rarely gave anyone a good reason to cross them either that garnered them a boatload of respect they also had a reputation for rigid adherence to promises to bargains and to the law or at least to the letters it consisted of what are the terms of your alliance i asked walking around the car toward the driver side i get the apartment molly said i mean its mine i own it they handle any maintenance for the next fifty years and as long as im on their property they consider me to be a citizen of their nation with all the rights and privileges that entails i whistled as we got in and shut the doors and what did you give them for that their honor and there might have been this bomb problem i handled for them hells bells i said look at you all grownup you have been molly said all day i tried not to give her a guilty glance as we pulled out um i feel it you know she said the pressure inside you ive got it buttoned down i said and started driving dont worry im not going to let it make me take anything away from you molly folded her hands in her lap looked down at them and said in a small voice if its given freely offered you cant really take it away all youre doing is accepting a gift part of me felt like something had torn in my chest so deep was the ache i felt at the hope the uncertainty in the grasshoppers voice and another part of me wanted to howl and attack her take her now it didnt even want to wait to stop the car if i went purely by the numbers there was no reason at all not to give in to that urgeexcept for the car crashing i mean molly was an adult woman now she was exceptionally attractive id seen her naked once and she was really good at it she was willingeager even and i trusted her id taught her a lot over the years and some of that had been extremely intimate masterapprentice relationships were hardly unheardof in wizarding circles some wizards even favored that situation because on the spooky side sex can be a whole hell of a lot more dangerous than recreational they regarded the teaching of physical intimacy as something as inextricably intertwined with magic as it is with life its possible that from a standpoint of pure unadulterated reason they might even have a point but there was more to it than reason id known molly when she was wearing a training bra id hung out in her tree house with her after shed come home from high school she was the daughter of the man i respected most in this world and the woman whom i least wanted to cross i believed that people in positions of authority and influence especially those in the role of mentor and teacher had a mountainous level of responsibility to maintain in order to balance out that influence over less experienced individuals but mostly i couldnt do it because molly had been crushing on me since she was about fourteen years old she was in love with me or at least thought she wasand i didnt feel it back it wouldnt be fair to her to rip her heart out that way and i would never ever forgive myself for hurting her its okay she almostwhispered really there wasnt anything much to say so i reached over took her hand and squeezed gently after a while i said molly i dont think its ever going to happen but if it ever does the first time damned well isnt going to be like that you deserve better so do i then i put both hands back on the wheel and kept on driving i had someone else to pick up before i gave the redcap my version of a hostage crisis we got to chez carpenter around five and i parked the munstermobile on the street it was the single gaudiest object for five miles in every direction and it blended in with the residential neighborhood about as well as a goose in a crowd of puffer fish i turned off the engine and listened to it clicking i didnt look at the house i got out of the car shut the door and leaned back against it still not looking at the house i didnt need to id seen it often enough it was a gorgeous colonial home complete with manicured landscaping a pretty green lawn and a white picket fence the grasshopper got out of the car and came around to stand beside me dads at work the sandcrawler is gone molly noted nodding toward the driveway where her mother always parked their minivan i think mom was going to take the jawas trickortreating at the botanic gardens this afternoon so the little ones wont be home which was mollys way of telling me that i didnt have to face my daughter right now and i could stop being a coward just go get him i said ill wait here sure she said molly went up to the front door and knocked about two seconds after she did that something huge slammed against the other side of the door the heavy door jumped in its frame dust fell from the roof over the porch dislodged by the impact molly stiffened and backed away a second later there was another thump and another and the sound of the frantic scratching of claws on the door then more thumping i hurriedly crossed the street to stand beside molly on the lawn facing the front door the door wiggled then opened unsteadily as if being manipulated by someone with his hands full then the storm door flew open and something grey and shaggy and enormous shot out onto the porch it cleared the porch railing in a single bound hurtled across the ground and the little picket fence and hit me in the chest like a battering ram my dog mouse is a temple dog of tibet a foo dog of a powerful supernatural bloodline though he could have passed for an exceptionally large tibetan mastiff mouse can take on demons and monsters without batting an eye and he checks in at about two fifty he knocked me down as easily as a bowling ball does the first pin and superdog though he may be hes still a dog once i was down he planted his front paws on either side of my head and proceeded to give me slobbery dog kisses on the face and neck and chin making happy little sounds the whole time ack i said as i always did my lips touched dog lips get me some mouthwash get me some iodine i shoved at his chest grinning and managed to lever myself out from underneath him and stand that didnt diminish mouses enthusiasm in the least he cut loose with a series of joyous barks so loud that they set off a car alarm on a vehicle a hundred feet away then he sprinted in a tight circle came back to my feet and barked some more he did that over and over for about a minute his tail wagging so hard that it sounded like a helicopter might have been passing in the distance whupwhupwhupwhupwhup all right i said enough come on its not like i died or anything boy he quieted his jaws parted in a canine grin tail still wagging so hard that it pulled his hindquarters left and right with it i knelt down and put my arms around him if id been an inch or two shorter i doubt i could have done it damn pooch is huge and built like a barrel he laid his chin on my shoulder and panted happily as i hugged him yeah i said quietly i missed you too buddy i nodded toward the house anyone home he tilted his head to one side slightly one ear cocked at a slightly different angle from the other he says no molly said i blinked at her first sherlock now dolittle she blushed slightly and looked embarrassed its just something i picked up a dogs thoughts and emotions are a lot more direct and less conflicted than a humans its easier to listen for them it isnt a big deal mouse came over to greet molly by walking back and forth against her legs nearly knocking her down he stopped and looked fondly up at her tail wagging and made a little woofing sound youre welcome she said and scratched his ears i need your help boy i said bad guys took butters andi and justine mouse shook his head vigorously and half sneezed mouse thinks andi should be locked in the garage at night until she learns not to get abducted once we get her back well start calling her dangerprone daphne i promised him shes even got the hair for it you in scoob in answer mouse hurried to the street looked both ways then crossed it to sit down at the back door of the munstermobile then he looked at me as if asking me why i wasnt opening it for him of course hes in molly translated smiling good thing youre here i said hes tough to read chapter thirtyseven we used the spinning needle in the bowl of water like a compass driving north to south first to let us triangulate on our friends location as tracking spells went this one was a little clumsier than most we had to pull over the munstermobile and let the water settle to use itbut hey nothings perfect we tracked our friends and presumably the redcap and company to the waterfront the sun was setting behind us and had briefly appeared from behind the clouds the citys skyline cast deep cold shadows over us harry molly said you know that this is a trap i said yep the redcap knew exactly what i would do with those bits of hair molly looked a little relieved okay then whats the plan once we are sure where they are i said im going to go in the front door thats the plan im going to be very very noisy i said meanwhile you and supermutt are going to sneak in the back all sneakylike neutralize any guards that arent watching me and get our crew out oh molly said are you sure you dont want me to be the distraction it was a fair question mollys onewoman rave spell could get more attention than a crash at an airshow the sidhe know all about veils i said mine arent good enough to get anywhere near them yours are its that simple right she said and swallowed so were going to depend on me for the important part saving people youve been playing batman for a while now kid i said i think youve got this mostly i was the only one in danger if i screwed up molly said are you sure this is the right plan if you think you can handle it i said or if you dont oh i put a hand on her shoulder we dont have time to dance around on this one so we go dirt simple when it starts if someone gets in your way i want you to hit them with everything youve got right in the face mouse will be with you as muscle shouldnt he be with you i mean if youre going to fight im not going to fight i said no time to prepare no plan id lose a fight im going to be a big noisy distraction but what if you get in trouble thats my part you do your part keep focused on your objective get in get them get out signal then we all run away got it she nodded tightly got it woof said mouse huh i said a few moments later we had triangulated with the tracking spell and narrowed down their location to one building and we now lurked in an alley across the street ive actually been in there before you have yeah i said client had lost a kid or something to some halfassed wannabe warlock he had the cheesy dialogue and everything was gonna sacrifice the kid with this big cheap spiky knife how did it turn out if i remember it right i got beat up i said didnt make much money on it either the bad guy ran away and the client walked out threatening a lawsuit except she left the kid turns out she wasnt even his mom and his real parents tried to have me arrested never heard from her again no clue what it was about chalk molly reached into her bag and came out with a stick of chalk which she passed to me i crouched and quickly sketched a diagram of the rectangular warehouse heres the front door office door back door therere some windows up high but youd have to be a bird to get there the rear of the warehouse actually protrudes over the water but theres a wooden deck around the back thats where youll go in at the back door watch for trip wires mouse can help with that trust him were basically blind and deaf by comparison right molly said nodding okay dont get hung up on what could happen if it goes wrong i said focus concentrate just like we do for a spell get in get them get out lets just do it she said before i throw up ill give you five minutes to get into position dont go in until i get noisy right molly said come on mouse the big dog came up beside molly and she didnt even have to bend to slip the fingers of one hand through his collar stay this close to me okay she said to mouse he looked up at her and wagged his tail she gave him a shaky smile nodded at me then spoke a word and vanished i started counting to three hundred and briefly wondered why i kept running into repeat uses of various locations around town this wasnt the first time id dealt with the bad guys choosing to reuse a location different bad guys had used before them maybe there was a villainous timeshare association maybe my life was actually a basiccable television show and they couldnt afford to spend money on new sets all the time orand this seemed more likelymaybe there was a reason for it maybe the particular vibe of certain spots just felt more like home to predators predators like to lair in a place with multiple ways in and out isolated from casual entry near supplies of whatever it was they like to eat supernatural predators would also have some level of awareness of the nature of the nevernever that abutted any given part of our reality even if it was only an instinct it would make sense that they would be more at ease in places that joined parts of the nevernever where they would be comfortable i mean everyone likes to eat somewhere that feels like home if i lived through the next day or so i needed to start keeping track of where these jokers liked to get their bloodthirsty freak on it might give me an edge someday or at least a list of places that could use a nice burning down i hadnt burned down a building in ages two ninetynine three hundred ready or not i muttered here i come i strode out of the alley across from the warehouse gathering my will into a shield around my left hand and readied a lance of force in my right hells bells i missed my equipment mab had forced me to learn how to do without but that didnt mean i could do it as well i missed my shield bracelet i missed my blasting rod i missed my spellarmored coat with that gear this would be pretty simple i could protect myself better from every direction and have a lot more range on my spells to make the bad guys keep their heads down but it would take me weeks to build new ones and i had to work with what i hadwhich was pretty much just me my shields would be as strong but i couldnt sustain them for as much time or in every directionso i couldnt walk in with a nice comfortable bubble of force around me without the bracelet or a tool like it i could protect myself only from the front and only for a few seconds at a time my offensive spells would hit just as hard but theyd have a shorter range and they would take a few more crucial fractions of a second to enact man i missed my toys the warehouse had a little fence covered in plastic sheeting and topped with barbed wire there was a gated area in front of the main entryway though the gate had been blasted off its hinges by some deranged ruffian who did not look like me no matter what the witnesses said and apparently no one had replaced it since awful lot of open space out there id be a really juicy target which was sort of the point make myself so attractively vulnerable that no one was watching the back door it wasnt the best idea in the world to walk out into that but halloween night was maybe an hour away and there wasnt time to be smart that said theres a difference between being reckless and being insane i didnt especially like the idea of stumbling over a trip line tied to lets say an antipersonnel mine so before i went in i flung my right arm forward in a large sweeping underhand motion as if i were trying to throw a bowling ball at the pins two lanes over from where i was standing i muttered forzare as i threw the spell focusing on shaping the force id released into what i needed energy rippled across the ground in a shock wave that threw up dust and bits of gravel and irregular chunks of broken asphalt it rippled across the ground to the warehouse and landed against its front doorway with a giant hollow boom say whos there i shouted at the warehouse already walking forward rapidly while the dust still hung in the airit would make it more possible if not likely to spot any of the redcaps sidhe buddies who might be hiding under a veil inside it i dare you i doubledog dare you i hurled another blast of force at the big loading doors in the front of the warehouse something meant to make a lot of noise not to tear them down it succeeded a second enormous concussion made the buildings steel girders and metal walls ring like some vast dark bell the furious wizard thats who i shouted youve got ten seconds to free my friends unharmed or im going to fucking smite every last mothers son of you i had maybe half a seconds warning and then a streaking black form dived down from above me and raked at my eyes with its talons i snapped my head back out of the way only to see a hawk beating back up out of the nadir of its dive it rolled in the air and as it did it shimmered and in an instant the hawk was gone and one of the sidhe was there in its place arcing through the air in free fall holding a bow and an arrow in his hands he drew and shot in the same instant he shifted and i barely caught the arrow on my shield before he could begin to fall he completed the roll and shifted again back into hawk form then beat his wings and continued rising into the sky hells bells that looked awesome it took a serious mastery of shapeshifting to bring equipment and clothes and things with you when you changed form but that guy had made it look as easy as breathing i mean say what you will about the faeries but theyve got style not so much style that i didnt hurl another bolt of force after the flying archer but i missed him and he winged away with a mocking shriek then i felt a small sharp pain in my left leg i looked down to see a little wooden dart sticking out of the back of my calf it was carved perfectly smooth and round and fletched with a few tiny slivers of scarlet feather i snapped my gaze around behind me and caught a single glimpse of the redcap poised in a crouch atop the fence surrounding the warehouse balancing his weight with apparent effortless ease along a strand of barbed wire that had to have been a sixteenth of an inch wide his mouth was spread in a wide manic grin he held a short silvery tube in one hand and as my eyes found his face he touched two fingertips of his other hand to his lips blew me a kiss and plummeted back off of the fence and out of sight i whirled toward him and brought up my shield then spun around and angled it that way then jittered about rubbernecking everywhere at once but that was it assuming the sidhe werent simply undetectable to my senses they were gone a slow burning sensation began to spread from the wound in my leg a cold shiver oozed down my spine i tugged the dart out of my calf it hadnt done muchthe slender spear of wood had penetrated maybe a quarter inch into my skinbut when i rolled up my pant leg to look i found an inordinately large trickle of blood coming from the tiny wound and that burning sensation became an almost infinitesimally greater presence with each heartbeat this hadnt been a hostage crisis at all it had been an assassination or or something goddammit i snarled i just got played again i am so sick and tired of this backstabby bullshit i more or less stormed into the warehouse shoving open the office door and stalking out onto the main floor the place was just as empty as i remembered give or take the leavings of several apparent transients between the present and the past molly was at the very rear of the warehouse near the door she was helping justine to sit up mac was there too and he and butters were between them helping a wobblylooking andi to remain on her feet mouse was standing guard between the group and the front of the warehouse and he started wagging his tail when he saw me clear i called out to them hurrying over or at least clearish what happened they were under a sleeping enchantment molly reported pretty standard stuff i woke them up everyone okay andi got hit on the head when they took her she said other than that i think were good when she spoke mollys voice never quavered but her eyes flickered uncertainly toward mac i took a closer look at everyone andi butters and justine had all been bound justine was only now getting the ropes cut off of her wrists and as molly sawed them away with a pocketknife i could see the deep red marks theyd left on justines slender wrists butters and andi had them too visible even in the dimness of the warehouse mac didnt that was interesting why hadnt mac been tied up or if he had how come there wasnt a mark to show for it either way that was odd my first instinct was to grab him and demand answersbut the direct approach hadnt gotten me anything but more confused as i went through this stupid day i might have been a better thug than at any point in my life but that wouldnt matter if i couldnt figure out where to apply my muscle and i was damned tired of being sneaked up on so it was time to get sneaky i ground my teeth and pretended that molly hadnt clued me into anything all right people i said lets move i think theyre gone but they could be back thats it molly asked i was expecting more trouble than th she broke off staring at the floor behind me my leg throbbed and burned a little more and i glanced down at it in irritation to my shock i saw a long line of small smears of my blood on the tile floor the little wound had continued bleeding soaked through my sock and my shoe and dribbled down onto my heel what happened molly asked it was another stupid trick i said the point wasnt to hold them for ransom it was to get me here under pressure and too keyed up to defend myself from every direction i held up the dart wed better find out what this thing is and what kind of poison is on it oh my god molly breathed ill take whatever help i can get i said lets g but before i could finish the sentence there was a loud crunching whoomp of a sound and the entire warehouse shook i barely had time to think demolition charges before there was a deafening crack and the floor tilted and then the back twenty feet of the warehouse including all of us fell right off of the street and into the cold dark water of lake michigan chapter thirtyeight we didnt drop straight down instead there was a scream of shearing bolts and our part of the building lurched drunkenly and then plunged into the water at an oblique angle the confusion of it was the worst part the loud noise the disorientation inherent in the uneven motion and then the short surge of terror as gravity took over all served to create a panic reaction in my headand im not a guy who panics easily thats what most people dont understand about situations like this one people are just built to freak out when something goes wrong it doesnt matter if youre a kindergarten teacher or a special forces operatorwhen lifethreatening stuff happens you get scared you freak out thats just what happens when its because youve woken up to a hungry bear in your camp thats usually a pretty good mechanism but being dropped into black water in an enclosed area is not a place where panicked adrenaline is going to help you out thats when you have to somehow set that fear aside and force yourself to use your rational mind to guide you out of the situation there are two ways to get yourself into that terrifiedbutrational state of mind first is training where you drill a reaction into yourself so hard and so many times that it becomes a form of reflex you can perform without even thinking and the other way you get there is to have enough experience to have learned what you need to do so the first thing i did as the cold water swallowed me was to close my eyes for a second and focus just as i would if i were preparing a spell relaxing my limbs and letting them float loosely in the water i gathered my thoughts and laid out my options first i had time but not much of it i had gotten a good breath before i went under the others might or might not have done the same so i had about two minutes to act before people started trying to breathe lake michigan two minutes doesnt sound like long but it was enough time to spend a few seconds thinking second we were surrounded by steel siding i wasnt getting through that with anything short of a fullpower blast and that wasnt going to happen while i was surrounded by water water tends to disperse and ground out magical energies just by being nearby when water is all around you its all but impossible to direct any energy out of your body without it spreading out and diluting to uselessness the edges of the building might or might not have grounded themselves into the mud at the bottom of the lake trapping us all like bugs under a shoe box lid there wasnt time to search through them systematically not before people started drowning that meant that we had to go out through the only way i could be sure was availablethe back door except that everyone was spread out in the blackness now and at least one person andi was already disoriented from the blow to her head it was possible others had been hurt in the fall or would get hurt as they struggled to get out there seemed to be very little chance that i could find the door then find all of them in the dark then get them pointed at the door and out it seemed just as unlikely that everyone would stop to think and come to the same conclusion i had there was a very real chance that one or more of my friends might be left behind but what other options did i have it wasnt as though i could lift the entire thing out of the water no i couldnt but winter could i opened my eyes into the darkness made a best guess for down and swam that way i found mud within a few feet i thrust my right hand into the mud thrashing rather awkwardly to get it done then i went limp again floating a bit weirdly tethered by my hand in the mud and focused my mind i wasnt going to try to lift the freaking building that was just insane id known things that might have been able to pull it off but i was certain i wasnt one of them not even with the power of the winter knights mantle besides why do it the stupid way i felt myself smiling maybe smiling a little too widely in the dark water and unleashed the cold of winter directly into the ground beneath me through my right hand i poured it on holding nothing back reaching deep into me to the source of cold power inside me and sending it out into the muck of the lake bottom lake michigan is a deep lake and only its upper layers ever really warm up beyond a few feet of the surface the cold is a constant an absolute and the mud at the bottom of what i was guessing to be fifteen or twenty feet of water at the most was clammy as the power poured out of me the water did what it always did with magicit began to diffuse it to spread it out which was exactly what i was going for ice formed around my hand and spread into a circle several feet wide in the first instant conducted more easily through the mud than through the water i poured more effort in and the circle widened more ice forming spreading out i kept up the cold and the water touching the bottom began to freeze as well my heart began to beat harder and there was a roaring sound in my ears i didnt give up sending more and more cold into the lake around me building up layer after layer of ice across the entire bottom of the lake beneath the collapsed warehouse at sixty seconds the ice was three feet deep and forming around my arm and shoulder at ninety seconds it had engulfed my head and upper body and had to have been five or six feet deep and when my internal count reached a hundred and ten the entire mass of ice tore loose from the lakes bottom with a groan and began to rise i never let up on it building it into a miniature iceberg and the steel beams and walls of the warehouse moaned and squealed as the ice began to lift them free i felt it when my feet came out of the water though most of the rest of me was still stuck in the ice i tore and twisted and seemed to know exactly where to apply pressure and torque without being told the ice crackled away and i slipped out of it with a minimum of fuss when i pulled my head out go ahead make a joke i was sitting in dim light atop a sheet of ice floating several inches out of the waters of the lake i was still in the rear section of the warehouse the back door was open straight above my head and was letting in most of the light the broken ends of the room the floor and the two walls had been embedded in ice but crookedly the ragged edge of the ceiling was a couple of feet out of the water several very startledlooking people and one furplastered dog were shivering on the ice i took a quick head count everyone was there i sagged down onto the ice in relief fatigue making my body feel like it weighed an extra ton and just lay there for a moment as the wreckage bobbed gently in the water after a few seconds i became aware of eyes on me and i looked up my friends were all sitting or kneeling on the ice damp and shivering and staring at me with wide eyes mollys eyes were bright and intense the expression on her face unreadable justines mouth hung slightly open and her big dark eyes looked afraid butters stared first at me and then down at the ice his eyes flicking around the wheels clearly churning in his head as he calculated how much ice there was and how much energy it would have taken to freeze it mac regarded me impassively still supporting the dazed andi sweetly curved andi was the most vulnerable if i could isolate her from the herd things could get interesting id just saved her life after all she owed me i could think of a few ways that she could express her gratitude i pushed the predator thought out of my head and took a deep breath when i exhaled it condensed into a thick foggy vapor more so than it ever would have naturally even on the coldest days i looked down at my hands and they were covered in frost and my fingertips and nails were turning blue i put a hand to my face and had to brush away a thin layer of frost hells bells what did i look like to make my friends stare at me like that time for mirrors later i stood up my feet sure even on the wet ice and found the nearest point of the shoreline i extended a hand murmured infriga and froze a tenfootlong bridge from my improvised iceberg to land come on i said as i started walking toward the shore my voice sounded strange rough we dont have much time the sun had slipped below the cloud cover and the sky was a bank of hot coals slowly burning down toward ember and ash when we got back to mollys apartment thomas and karrin were waiting outside the two of them were leaning against the wall near the security checkpoint thomas had a tall coffee cup in one hand and a bagel in the other karrin was staring down at a smartphone her thumbs flicking over its surface thomas took note of the car as it pulled up and nudged karrin she looked up then did a double take at the munstermobile she rolled her eyes then apparently turned the phone off and slipped it into a case on her belt i stopped the car and rolled down the window youve got to be kidding me karrin said eyeing the car this i think its a company car i said karrin leaned down and looked at everyone in the back what happened insideill explain we got parked and everyone made their way to mollys place some of them more slowly than others youre limping thomas noted walking beside me and bleeding no im i began then i sighed yeah redcap shot me with some kind of dinky dart maybe poisoned or something thomas made a low growling sound in his chest im just about done with that clown tell me about it molly opened the door and the moment i stepped in lacuna came zipping over to me the little armored faerie hovered in the air near my face her dark hair flying wildly in the turbulence of her own beating wings you cant do it she cried you cant just give them all that pizza do you have any idea how much harm youre doing can i please fight now whoa i said leaning back and holding up my hands hey shortcake my brother snapped back off you arent important lacuna declared to thomas evidently dismissing him entirely as she turned back to me i wrote down everything just like you said and now theyre going to get that awful pizza all over themselves without the least regard for properly protecting themselves and im going to fight them for the pizza in the first place that is not a fight you are going to win i said and in the second placethey found something and i wrote it down like you said and now i want to duel them no duels i said and headed for the dining table sure enough lacuna had drawn precise little xs at all of the sites marked on the map most of them had been done with a green pen but two locations were marked in red one of them was next to one of the primary sites id marked earlier on this side of the lake north of town the next was at one of the secondary sites a little farther inland and on the far side of the lake lacuna were they sure that ritual preparation was under way at both of these locations and the others were clear the little faerie replied impatiently yes yes yes crap i muttered molly time twentyfive minutes to sundown more or less she replied she came to the table with a firstaid kit in her hands waldo can you take a look at this the minute im sure andi isnt bleeding into her brain butters snapped ive already sent for an ambulance molly said back in a calm iron tone that sounded creepily like her mother andi will die with all of the rest of us if harry doesnt stop things from going boom so get over here and see to him butters turned toward molly with absolute murder in his eyes but then he looked at me and back to the dazed andi in her chair mac was supporting her the bartender looked up at butters and nodded i hate this butters said his voice boiling with anger but he came over to the table grabbed the kit and said try to hold still harry i planted my foot and kept standing still as he started cutting away my jeans at the knee okay i said karrin was already standing beside me and thomas joined us across the table whats the word from marcones vikings strike team standing by murphy said waiting for my word i grunted thomas laras team is ready too he said butters what do we have from the paranet dammit dresden im a medical examiner not an intelligence analyst he gave the little wound a prod with something and a whitehot needle went up my leg to the hip nngh i said nothing he took a wipe to the wound and that didnt feel very good either about half a dozen sightings of the little folk all over arent those yours murphy asked some probably i said but i think theyre the rest of aces crew murphy grunted i thought the prisoner wouldnt tell you anything about him i shrugged i figure it was ace who threw the explosives at the munstermobile last night when the little folk jumped me afterward he showed up right when lacuna ambushed me at the botanic gardens then when i go to get my friends back from his dad something else blows up hes learned to play with explosives karrin said yeah but youve barely seen this guy thomas said it makes sense i said especially if hes playing smartwhich he is just by rounding up a group of the little folk as allies he knows he couldnt handle a straight fightso hes kept his distance weve barely seen him and hes nearly killed me three times in the past sixteen hours hngh thomas said whats he got against you molly asked he was part of lily and fixs crew back when they were all just folks i said they were friends with aurora and the last summer knight when mab hired me to find ronald reuels killer ace pitched in with this ghoul hitter and the winter knight to stop me betrayed his friends billy and his crew almost killed him but i let him skate and he hates you for it molly asked i killed aurora i said his friend meryl died in that same fight and you can be damned sure that lily and fix havent wanted anything to do with him since so from where hes standing i killed one of his friends got another one killed in battle and took the ones who were left alive away from him then i beat him up in front of his dad guys got a forest of bones to pick with me cheery image thomas said i grunted what about your nutjob butters whats his name gary gary turn up anything else about twenty updates in all capital letters about boats boats boats i thought about that one for a moment then i said hah we have to move harry karrin said i grunted gard still have her chopper yes right i said i thumped my finger on the site on the far side of lake michigan lacuna whats the word on this one the little faerie was still flitting about in the air around the table fairly bursting with impatience its behind big stone walls on a humans private land right where i marked it i nodded vikings get that site then get them moving right murphy said and headed for the door reaching for her phone on the way thomas frowned were going to depend on laras people to back us up hell no i said no offense but i dont trust your sister send her crew to the second site this is damned odd butters muttered i looked down at him what the bleeding wont stop he said its not really all that dangerous in a wound this small but it isnt clotting up its like some kind of anticoagulant was introduced do you still have the dart dart i said i patted my pockets i guess not it was in my hand when the warehouse dropped into the water bah butters said inflammation in the skin around it this hurt he poked me it did i told him so huh he said i cant be sure without tests but i think this might be some kind of allergic reaction how i asked im not allergic to anything im just saying what it looks like on your skin butters said the trickle factor seems to imply some kind of toxin though you need a hospital tests later i said just get it wrapped up and keep it from running down my leg butters nodded so thomas asked if laras crew has one site and marcones the other which one are we going to neither what were not going to either one why not because all day long i said ive been moving in straight lines and its gotten me nothing but grief i pointed at the locations marked on the map see those those are the perfectly rational places for our bad guy to make something happen thomas rubbed at his chin and narrowed his eyes theyre a distraction its how the sidhe think how they move how they are they put pressure on you get you to look over there and then kapow sucker punch what if theyre expecting you to expect that thomas asked gah i said waving my hands on either side of my head as if brushing away wasps stop it if im wrong weve got professional badasses to cover it but im not wrong didnt you say that they required a ley line site to perform a ritual that big butters asked he had taped a pad over the little injury and was securing it with a roll of gauze yes i said and the little folk cleared all of them but those two no i said they cleared almost all of them there was one place the little folk couldnt check thomass eyes widened as he got it boats he said yeah i said boats chapter thirtynine thomas rose glancing around the room and said in a quiet voice she needs fuel and id better talk to lara about the second site but his eyes had drifted over to where justine now sat by the fire basking in warmth after our icy dunk and staring at it with a peaceful expression on her lovely face get moving i said i lowered my voice you taking her with you you kidding bad guys have been all over us today that creep took her right off the street in front of our apartment im not letting her out of my sight look if you leave her here the building has security that so does my building and cat sith breezed right past all of it when he came in thomas said im not letting her out of my sight until this thing is settled i grimaced but nodded all right go well be right behind you my brother arched an eyebrow all of you well see i said did you talk to her thomas asked i gave him a steady look and said no maggie was out trickortreating right shes what nine years old she might as well have vanished into the bermuda triangle how could you possibly be expected to find her magic he gave me a sour look what about the other one he meant karrin weve both been kinda busy maybe later later bad habit to get into thomas said lifes too short it almost sounded like you were attempting to enlighten me about bad habits the path of excess leads to the palace of wisdom he said and turned for the door at the exact moment he moved even though she was not looking at him and though he said nothing to her justine rose from her seat by the fire and started toward the door the pair of them met halfway there and she slipped herself beneath his arm and up close to him in a motion of familiar unconscious intimacy they left together my brother the vampire whose kiss was a slow death sentence had a stable and loving relationship with a girl who was crazy about him by contrast i could barely talk to a woman at least about anything pertaining to a relationship given that my only longterm girlfriends had faked their own death died and broken free of enslaving enchantments to end the relationship the empirical evidence seemed to indicate that he knew something i didnt keep your life tonight harry complicate it tomorrow murphy came back in with a pair of emts i recognized lamar and simmons they got andi loaded up onto a stretcher and lamar blinked when he saw me he didnt look as young as he had the last time id seen hima few threads of silver in his hair stood out starkly against his dark hair and skin dresden he said that you mostly i heard you were dead close it didnt take he shook his head and helped his partner secure andi to the stretcher they picked up the stretcher and toted her outside with butters hurrying along beside them his hand on andis arm once they were gone i stood in the room with the grasshopper karrin and mac mouse dozed on the floor near the door but his ears twitched now and then and i doubted he was missing anything molly i said would you ask sarissa to join us please she went off to her room and returned a moment later with sarissa the slender beautiful woman came into the room silently and didnt meet anyones eyes hers were focused in the middle distance as she tried to keep track of everyone in the room through peripheral vision all right i said things are about to hit the fan theyre confusing as hell and im getting tired of feeling like i have no idea whats going on there are some unknown quantities here and some of you arent telling me everything but there isnt enough time to pry it all out of each of you i pointed a finger at sarissa maybe you really are everything you say you are maybe not but i figure therere about two chances in three that youre playing me somehow and i think youre way too good at backstabbing to leave you standing around behind me everything ive told you sarissa began i slashed a hand at the air dont talk this isnt an interrogation its a public service announcement im telling you how its going to be she pressed her lips together and looked away mac i said much as it pains me to level suspicion at the mastercraftsman of the best beer in town youre hiding something that outsider talked to you as if it knew you and i dont think it was an aficionado of your ale do you want to tell me who you really are mac was silent for a moment then he said no thats mine i grunted didnt think so i figure its more likely that you are an ally or at least neutral than it is that youre a plant for somebody but im not completely sure about you either i looked at them both and said im not sure if youre my friends or my enemies but i heard something once about keeping them close and closer so until things have shaken out youre both staying where i can keep track of you and you both should be aware that im going to be ready to smack you down if i pick up on the least little hint of treachery i am not sarissa began i stared at her she bit her lip and looked away i turned my eyes to mac he didnt look thrilled about it but he nodded okay i said well be on the lake there are a couple more coats in the guest bedroom closet better grab one mac nodded and beckoned sarissa with a tilt of his head miss they went to the guest bedroom and that left me facing murphy with the grasshopper hovering in the background i made a little kissing noise with my puckered lips and mouse lifted his head from the ground you pick up anything weird about either of them i asked mouse sneezed shaking his head and laid it back down again i grunted guess not i took a deep breath grasshopper maybe its good time to take mouse for a walk mouses head snapped up molly looked back and forth between karrin and me and sighed yeah okay maybe take those two with you when you go and have security bring the car around too well leave shortly right molly said she collected mac and sarissa now clad in badly fitting secondhand coats and they left it was just me and karrin the fire crackled karrin said you picked up mouse did you get to see maggie christ everyone wants to know about i shook my head she was out she nodded did you get out of the car or just wait at the curb i gave her a flat stare she looked back at me with her cop face i failed to terrify her off the subject curb i said she smiled faintly ive seen you walk into places that should have killed you seven eight times you didnt flinch but now youre petrified with fear not fear i said so quickly and with such vehemence that it became immediately clear to me that fear was exactly what i was feeling when i thought of approaching maggie sure it isnt karrin said look i said we dont have time for my dad said that a lot karrin said i cant right now well do that later he was busy too then he was gone i am not going to deal with this right now karrin nodded right not right now later christ i said karrin looked down at the floor and smiled briefly then looked back up at me i never liked being shrunk had to a couple of times after i shot denton stuff like that so i said some things cant just sit inside you she said not when she spread her hands harry youre dealing with serious pressures here with something that could change who you are i dont blame you for being afraid ive got the winter knight thing under control i said winter knight mab whatever she said as if it were an everyday annoyance magic stuff youll deal with it fine im talking about something real im talking about maggie oh i said i figure itll take thomas at least ten minutes to fuel the boat she said its been about five since he left which gives you five minutes with no city to save no evil queens and no monsters no one to protect right in front of you no apprentices to look strong for i looked at her blankly and felt my shoulders sag i hadnt slept in too long i wanted to find a nice bed somewhere and pull the covers over my head i dont what are you looking for here what do you expect from me she stepped closer and took my hand talk to me why didnt you go see maggie i bowed my head and let my fingers stay limp i cant i just cant why not i tried to speak and couldnt i shook my head karrin stepped closer to me and took my other hand in hers too im right here she said what if i whispered what if she remembers remembers what she was there i said she was there when i cut her mothers throat i dont know if she was conscious if she saw but what if she did in my head ive run this scenario about a thousand times and if she saw me and started screaming or crying i shrugged that would be hard you know whats going to be harder karrin asked quietly what not knowing she shook my hands gently leaving a hole in that little girls life shes your daughter harry youre the only dad shes ever going to have yeah but if i show up and she remembers me im not her father im her father the monstrous villain im darth dresden shell learn better murphy said eventually if you try you dont understand i said i cant i cant do anything that might hurt her i just cant i barely know that little girlbut shes mine and id rather doublekneecap myself with a frying pan than bring her an ounce of pain pain passes karrin said if you think about it you dont get it i half snarled shes blood karrin shes mine thinking has no place in this shes my little girl i cant see her get hurt again i stopped suddenly with my mouth hanging open hells bells how could i have missed what the mothers were trying to tell me i couldnt bear to see my child in pain and maybe i wasnt the only one who couldnt stars and stones i breathed thats whats happening here karrin blinked up at me several times excuse me i kept thinking about it following the logic thats why mab sent me to kill maeve shes no different from titania she knew it needed to be done but but what karrin asked maeve is still her little girl i said quietly mab isnt human but there are remnants in all the sidhe mother winter called mab a romantic i think this is why mother summer went on and on about how humans have influenced the sidhe thats what this whole thing is about i dont understand karrin said mab loves her daughter i said simply she wont kill maeve because she loves her i let out a bitter little laugh and theres the kind of symmetry here that the faeries are crazy about i killed the last summer lady its only fitting that the same hand deal with the winter lady my brain was running along with my mouth and i stopped talking so that i could poke at the logic of the theory that my instinctsor maybe my hearttold me was obviously true if mab wasnt out to wreck the world if she hadnt been taken by the adversary then someone else had been lying to me someone who shouldnt have been able to lie okay karrin said if not mab then who is going to pull off this apocalypse ritual magic i kept following the lines of logic and felt myself grow abruptly cold oh oh god all this time i turned and started for the door outsiders at the end of the day this is all about the outsiders weve got to go right now harry karrin said i turned to face her why wont you explain she frowned you dont trust me so youre going to keep me close just like the others i looked down at the floor dont take it hard i dont trust myself right now she shook her head this is the thanks i get its halloween i said its the night when everyone looks like something that they arent i turned toward the door but im about to start ripping off masks and well both see where everyone stands come on chapter forty i had a word with toottoot once we were outside and by the time the munstermobile rolled out of the lot we had a ring of tiny nighinvisible escorts pacing us making it their business to dislodge any enemy tiny observers our foes might have sent to keep tabs on us it didnt make me think that we would avoid the attentions of enemy little folk altogether but every little thing i could conceal from the people working against me could prove to be a critical edge karrin saw the cars paint job again rolled her eyes and declined my offer of a ride she followed us on her harley molly rode shotgun with me holding her backpack on her lap molly was a big believer in shaping the future by way of carrying anything you might need in a backpack tonight it looked particularly stuffed as i drove the burn in my calf continued every time i worked the clutch or pumped the brake getting slowly worse beneath the layers of gauze butters had wrapped it in the rest of my lower leg was tingling and itching too but at least the wound wasnt soaking through the bandages what the hell had that dart been why plug me with it unless the redcap thought it would kill me i uh molly said as i pulled the caddy into the marina parking lot i got you something eh i asked i had them rush it out this morning and we got it this afternoon i mean you know as long as i was using thomass card anyway i blinked you embezzled funds from the white court to get me a present i like to think of it less as embezzling and more as an involuntary goodwill contribution she said careful i told her you dont want to get entangled with lara and her crew even owing them money isnt smart i didnt borrow it boss i stole it if they werent cautious enough to stop me that isnt my problem they should be more careful who they hand those cards to besides they can afford it the entitled younger generation i swear i said welldone i found a space big enough for the munstermobile and parked then set the emergency brake and killed the engine what is it molly got out of the car come see i started to but she hurried impatiently around to meet me digging into her backpack i shut the car door behind me and she presented me with a papercovered package tied with string i opened it by tearing paper and snapping string and a long leather garment unrolled dunh nuh nah nah nunh molly sang singing the opening riff from bad to the bone i found myself smiling and held up a long coat of heavy black leather like one of those old cowboy dusters except for the long mantle hanging down over its shoulders it smelled like new leather and shone without a scuff mark to be seen where the hell did you find an inverness coat i asked her internet she said security guy helped me shop for it you dont know his name i asked his name is guy and hes building security molly said security guy and he did this for you why i asked because im pretty and because he might have gotten a gift certificate out of the deal remind me to never give you one of my credit cards i said and i put the coat on the weight of the leather settling around me was familiar and comforting but this coat wasnt the same as my old coat the sleeves were a little longer and fit better the shoulders were a little narrower and actually matched up with mine the mantle hung down a bit more the pockets were in a slightly different place most significantly it didnt have the layers of protective enchantments that took about half a working week to lay down but yeah i decided i could get used to it i looked up to see my apprentice grinning widely i put my hand on her shoulder for a moment smiled and said thanks molls her eyes shone mouse piled out of the car and hurried over to sniff the coat tail wagging what do you think i asked him woof he said seriously he thinks it suits you molly said smiling goofy motorcycle cowboy meets scotland yard mouse wagged his tail i grunted as karrin pulled in and parked her harley far down the row from the munstermobile in a motorcycle parking space she eyed me as she came walking up to us then molly and gave her an approving nod thats more like it she said feels good i said i nodded toward the water where the water beetle was chugging slowly back into its berth thomas was at the wheel maneuvering the tub deftly i waved at him and he replied with a thumbsup gesture the boat was ready to go i turned to speak to the others but before i could i felt my concentration disrupted an eerie cool frisson rolled down my spine all the way down my body to my legs there was a flicker and a chill from the little wound and the pain became a little less at the same moment i sensed the air grow a fraction of a degree colder something i would never have noticed on my own sundown thats it i said a second later suns down its on what if youre too late sarissa asked what if theyre starting right now then were wasting time talking about it molly said lets get to the boat she beckoned mac and sarissa this way please i glanced at mouse and jerked my chin toward molly he heaved himself up and went after her walking just behind our two unknown quantities karrin had opened a storage compartment on her harley she shrugged out of her jacket and then slipped into a tactical harness and clicked it shut around her she added a number of nylon pouches to it then took out a gym bag and dropped heavy objects in before shutting the compartment and locking it she looked up at me and nodded all set i miss my gear i said p in there his name is george karrin said you want my backup gun nah ive already got the finest killing technology had to offer on the boat glad i didnt name it george how embarrassing would that have been george isnt insecure she said what about ah the swords the swords no karrin said why not she frowned and then shook her head this isnt their fight that doesnt make any sense i said ive wielded one she said and it makes perfect sense to me to use them tonight would be to make them vulnerable no but i began harry karrin said remember the last time the swords went to the island when their actual adversaries were there remember how that turned out my best friend mollys dad had been shot up like a tennessee speed limit sign the swords had a purpose and as long as they kept to it they were invulnerable and the men and women who wielded them were avenging angels but if they went off mission bad things tended to happen trust me karrin said quietly i know it doesnt make sense sometimes faith is like that this isnt their fight its ours i growled fine but tell the almighty that hes missing his chance to get in on the ground floor of something big murphy punched my chest but gently and smiled when she did it the two of us turned toward the dock and began to follow molly and the others i was just about to step out onto the dock when i heard something i stopped in my tracks and turned it started low and distant a musical cry from somewhere far away it hung in the darkening air for a moment like some carrion bird over dying prey and then slowly faded the wind started picking up again the tone sounded nearer and the hairs on my arms stood straight up thunder rumbled overhead the rain a fitful drizzle most of the day began to fall in chilly earnest and again the hunting horn sounded my heart started revving up and i swallowed footsteps approached and then thomas was standing beside me staring out the same way i was without speaking he passed me the winchester rifle and the ammunition belt is it i asked him his voice was rough yeah dammit how soon soon coming right through the heart of downtown fuck i said karrin held both hands up wait wait the both of you what the hell is happening the wild hunt is coming i said my throat dry um i sort of pissed off the erlking a while back hes not the kind of person to forget that the king of earls karrin asked now who isnt making sense hes a powerful lord of faerie thomas explained hes one of the leaders of the wild hunt when the hunt comes to the real world it starts hunting prey and it doesnt stop you can join it you can hide from it or you can die wait karrin said harrytheyre hunting you my heart continued to beat faster pumping blood to my muscles keying my body to run run run it was hard to think past that and answer her question uh yeah i can i think i can feel them coming i looked at thomas water theyll run over it like it was solid ground how do you know that karrin asked i joined thomas said harry justine i clenched my hands into fists on the heavy rifle get on the boat and go im not leaving you oh yes you are i said raith and marcone have the other two sites covered but we are the only ones left to get to demonreach if we blow it there and the ritual goes off were all screwed if i go with you the hunt follows me and then goes after whoever is close well never pull off an assault with them on our heels my brother ground his teeth and shook his head lets go harry karrin said if they follow us out over the lake well take them on you cant take them on i said quietly the hunt isnt a monster you can shoot its not some creature you can wrestle with or some kind of mercenary you can buy off its a force of nature red in tooth and claw it kills thats what it does but karrin began hes right thomas said his voice rough dammit hes right its chess i said weve been checked with that ritual on the island we have no choice but to try to stop it with everything weve got if that means sacrificing a piece thats how it has to be i put a hand on my brothers shoulder go get it done he put his cold strong hand over mine for a second then he turned and ran for the boat karrin stared up at me for a second the rain plastering her hair down her face was twisted with agony harry please she swallowed i cant leave you alone not twice there are eight million people in this city and if we dont shut the ritual down those people will die karrins expression changedfrom pain to shock from shock to horror and from horror to realization she made a choking sound and ducked her head her face turned away from me then she turned toward the boat i watched her for a second longer then i sprinted for the munstermobile as the haunting cry of the wild hunts horn grew nearer i jammed my key into the door lock and and it wouldnt fit i tried it again no joy halfpanicked i ran to each of the others but every single one of the locks was out of commission i was going to bust out a window but i checked the cars ignition through it first it had been packed with what looked like chewing gum the munstermobile had had been sabotaged with gum and superglue it was a trick id had toot and company play on others more than once and now what i had done unto others had been done unto me at the damnedest moment imaginable aggggh i screamed i hate ironic reversal the za lords guard had been escorting us along the way but i hadnt said anything about staying on the job once we reached our destination given the distance id had them covering today theyd probably dropped down exhausted the second id set the parking brake the thunder rolled closer my unthinking panic rose and my wounded leg felt like it might burst into flames my leg my eyes widened with horror of my own the redcap had killed me at that ambush and i was only now realizing it the trickle of blood flowing steadily from that tiny wound would leave a powerful olfactory and psychic trail behind me tracking me would be easier than whistling i could run but i couldnt hide thunder roared and i saw a cluster of dim forms descend from the cloud cover overhead and into the city light of chicago i could run but the hunt was moving at highway speeds i wouldnt even be able to significantly delay the inevitable shadowy hounds rushed down at me from the north along the shoreline and behind them came a blurry cluster of dark figures on horseback carrying bows and spears and long blades of every description i couldnt beat the hunt not even with mabs roids in my system but maybe then there was another roarthis time not of thunder but of a hundred and forty horses americanmade karrin murphys motorcycle slid to a stop close enough to me to throw gravel over my shoes and i turned to find her revving the engine karrin what the hell are you doing get on the bike bitch she called over the next horn blast lets make them work for it she smiled a fierce bright smile and i found my own face following her example fuck yeah i said and threw myself onto the back of the harley as darkness death and fire closed in around my city chapter fortyone i dropped the cartridge belt for the winchester over one shoulder and hurried to rake in the tail of my new duster before the motorcycles rear wheel snagged it and killed me i damn near fell off as karrin accelerated but managed to cling to her waist with the arm holding the rifle karrin scowled at me grabbed the rifle from my hand and slipped it down into a little section on the side of the harley that fit the short rifle suspiciously well i held on to her with a free hand and with the other made sure my coat wouldnt get me killed which way she shouted back at me south fast as you can she stomped one of her feet onto something twisted a wrist and the harley which had been doing around fifty leapt forward as if it hadnt been moving at all i shot a quick glance over my shoulder and saw the nearest elements of the hunt begin to slowly fade back i guess maybe the wild hunt hadnt ever heard about harleydavidson but she couldnt maintain the speed not even on a wide chicago street in chilly rainy weather there were just too many other people around forcing her to weave between traffic and she had to slow down to keep from splattering us all over some familys sedan indignant car horns began to blare as she slipped in and out of lanes adding an abrasive harmony to the horns of the wild hunt how we doing she called i looked back the wild hunt was less than a hundred yards awayand they didnt have to contend with traffic the jerks were racing along fifty feet off the freaking ground up in the dark and the rain unseen by the vast majority of people going about their everyday business theyre cheating go faster head for the bush karrin turned her head enough to catch me in the edge of her vision is there a plan it isnt a very good plan i shouted but i need a big open area for it to work away from people in chicago she shouted then her eyes widened the mills go i shouted karrin blitzed a red light narrowly avoiding a leftturning car and continued her furious rush down lake shore drive chicago is a city of terrific demands demand for a military presence helped establish the early colonialera forts which in turn provided security for white settlers traders and missionaries they built houses churches and businesses which accreted over time into a town then a city chicagos position as the great crossroads of the emerging american nation meant that more and more people arrived building more homes businesses and eventually heavyduty industry by the end of the nineteenth century chicago was a booming industrial cityand its steel mills were nearly legendary us steel youngstown steel wisconsin steel republic steel all thriving and growing on the shore of lake michigan down by calumet city the lakefront in that entire area was sculpted to accommodate the steel works and much of the steel that would fuel the allied efforts in two world wars was produced in that relatively tiny portion of the city but all things wither away eventually the american steel industry began to falter and fade and by the end of the twentieth century all that remained of an ironmongery epicenter was a long stretch of industrialstrength wasteland and crumbling buildings on lake michigans shore a decade later the city started trying to clean the place up knocking down most of the buildings and structuresbut here and there stone and concrete ruins remained like the bones of some vast beast that had been picked clean by scavengers nothing much grew there as the city around it thrivedjust weeds and property values that portion of the waterfront was slated for renewal but it hadnt happened yet and right now it was blasted heath a flat dark empty and desolate stretch of level land dotted with lonely reminders of former greatness there was no shelter from rain or cold there and on a miserable night like this there shouldnt be anyone hanging around all we had to do was make it that far we flew by the museum of science and industry on our right then flashed over the bridge above the fiftyninth street yacht harbor moving into a section of road that had a little distance between itself and the nearest buildings and a decided lack of foot traffic on a cold autumn evening as if theyd been waiting for an opening away from so many prying eyes the wild hunt swept down on us like a falcon diving onto a rabbit but they were not attacking a rabbit they were attacking a wabbit a wascally wabbit a wascally wabbit with a winchester something that looked like a great gaunt hound made of smoke and cinders with glowing coals for eyes hit the ground just behind the harley and began sprinting keeping pace with us it came rushing in dark jaws spread to seize the back tire the same motion it might have used had it been attempting to hamstring a fleeing deer mindless animal panic raged inside my head but i kept it away from the core of my thoughts forcing myself to focus think act i saw karrins eyes snap over to her rearview mirror as it closed and felt her body tensing against mine as she prepared to evade to the left i gathered my will but waited to unleash it and as the charhound closed to within inches of the tire karrin leaned and took the harley left the charhounds jaws clashed closed on exhaust fumes and i unleashed my will from the palm of my outstretched right hand with a snarl of forzare force hit the charhound low on its front legs and the beasts head went into the concrete at breakneck speedliterally there was a terrible snapping sound and the charhounds limp body went tumbling end over end bouncing up into the air for a dozen yards before landing shedding wisps of darkness all the way what landed in a boneless sprawl on the road was not a dog or a canine of any sort it was a young mana human wearing a black tshirt and torn old blue jeans i barely had time to register that before the body tumbled off the road and was out of sight good shot karrin cried grinning fiercely she was driving she hadnt seen what was under the hounds outer shell so that was how one joined the wild hunt it was a mask a huge dark terrifying maska masquerade and id just killed a man i didnt get any time to feel angst over it karrin gunned the engine of the harley and it surged ahead running along the spit of land that bifurcates jackson harbor even as she did two riders descended one on either side of the road their steeds hooves hammering against empty air about five feet up like the charhound the steeds and riders were covered in a smoky darkness through which shone the amber fire of their eyes karrin saw the one on the right and tried to move left againbut the second rider pressed in closer the dark horses hooves nearly hammering onto our heads and she wobbled and gunned the accelerator i recognized another hunters tactic the first had forced us to close distance with the second they were driving us between them trying to make us panic and think about nothing but running straight aheadin a nice smooth predictable line the second rider lifted an arm and he held the dark shape of a spear in his hand he hurled it forward leading the target perfectly i flung up my left hand extending my shield spell it got mixed results the spear flew into it and through it shredding my magic as it wentbut instead of flying into my face the spear was deflected just enough that its blade sliced across the back of my neck leaving a line of burning pain behind it the adrenaline was flowing and the pain didnt matter hell it really didnt matter if the wound had opened an arteryit wasnt as though i could stop to get medical attention if it had i twisted around to fling another bolt of force at the rider but he lifted a hand and let out an eerie screech and my attack was dispersed doing little more than inconveniencing my target his horse lost a step or two but he dug black spurs into the beasts hide and it soon made up the pace big surprise magic wasnt a big threat to the huntsmen solution winchester i drew the rifle from the rack on the harley thumbed back the hammer while still holding it in one hand then twisted at the waist to bring it to bear on the rider the heavy weapons forearm falling into my left hand i didnt have much time to aim and it might have actually been counterproductive given our speed the irregularities of the chase the darkness and the rain plus im not exactly annie oakley so i made a best guess and pulled the trigger the rifle let out a crack of thunder and a burst of disintegrated shadow flew up from the shoulder and neck and jawline of the rider i got a look at the armor beneath the mask and a portion of his face and realized with renewed terror that id just put a bullet into the erlking and an instant later i realized with a surge of incandescent hope that id just put a bullet into the erlking on halloween night the erlking reeled in the saddle and his horse faltered and veered away gaining altitude again i levered a new round into the chamber gripped the weapon like a pistol and whirled it back over karrins ducked head to point it onehanded at the rider on the right who was even now making his own approach spear uplifted i guessed again and shot i didnt hit him but the thunder of the gun came just as he flung the spear i didnt rattle the rider but the flameeyed horse flinched and the spear flew wide of us the rider was not deterred he brought his steed under control firstthen he let out a weird bubbling screech and swept a long darkbladed sword from the scabbard at his side he started closing the distance again it was impossible to lever another round into the rifle quickly while riding behind karrin that thing john wayne does whirling the rifle onehanded to cock it it really helps if you have one of those enlarged oblong lever handles to do it with and mine was the smaller traditional rectangle also it helps to be john wayne i had to draw the rifle into my chest and hold it steady with my left hand to get it done the rider swerved in at us and i shot againand missed as his steed juked and abruptly changed speed briefly falling back before boring in again i repeated that cycle three times before i realized that the rider was playing me for a sucker he respected the gun but knew its weakness me he wasnt dodging bulletshe was dodging me tempting me into taking shots with little chance of success in an effort to get me to use up my ammo and all the while the rest of the hunt kept pace with us dozens of riders like this one plus maybe twice that many shadowy hounds all keeping about fifty yards back and up clearly giving the first two hunters the honor of first attempt his horse karrin screamed shoot the horse i ground my teeth i didnt want to do that for all i knew that thing was only a horse costumethere could be another human being underneath that shadowy outer shell the rider screeched again the sound weirdly familiar and completely hairraising again and again he came in on us and i kept holding him off as we raced at insane speed through the rainy night trading bullets for time there i shouted suddenly pointing off to our left over there the walls we had reached the old steelwork grounds karrin gunned the engine and swept the harley out onto the open ground racing frantically toward one of the only structures remaininga trio of concrete walls maybe thirty or forty feet high running parallel to one another for at least a quarter of milethe last remains of us steel as the steeds hooves started hitting the ground they abruptly threw off clouds of angry silver sparks with every strike the dark horse screeched in agony and i let out a howl of defianceafter a century of labor in the steel mills there had to be unreal levels of trace steel and iron in the ground where they had stoodand whatever power sustained the wild hunt didnt like it any more than the other beings of faerie did between the walls i shouted go go go thats crazy karrin shouted i know she guided the harley around a pile of rubble and raced into the heavy shadows between two of the walls and the rider was right on us as she did closer i screamed force him to the wall why a quarter of a mile goes by fast on a roaring harleyand the only thing in front of us was the cold water of lake michigan hurry i shrieked agh karrin howled and abruptly the harley slowed and cut right in an instant we were even with the rider and though no expression could show through the darkness surrounding his face his body language was one of shock now for the dangerous part i thought which made me start giggling now it was getting dangerous before the rider could change speed or take on altitude and while the harley was still leaning toward the rider i hauled my left foot up onto the seat and sprang at him still holding the nowemptied winchester in one hand i slammed into the rider but whoever he was he was strong i had the power of the winter knight at my disposal but compared to the rider my strength was that of a child he threw a stiffarm into my chest and nearly sent me tumblingbut i grabbed onto his sleeve and as he fell i simply hung on that changed things it wasnt an issue of strength against strength this made it a contest of mass and leverage versus muscle and muscle lost i dragged the rider from his saddle and we both hit the rough ground at speed my hand was torn from his arm on impact and i remember trying to shield my head with my arms the winchester flew clear of me too i could see the rider tumbling as well silver fire blowing up from the shadowy mask around him i stopped tumbling yards later and frantically staggered back to my feet i spotted the winchester lying a few yards away and leapt for it i grabbed the weapon but before i could load it i heard a footstep behind me and i spun raising the gun up over my head parallel to the ground it was in the nick of time i felt the staggering power of an enormous blow and a sword rang against the steel of the winchesters octagonal barrel kringle recovered from the block swiftly scraps of shadow mask hung from him but he still wore the armor and a bloodred cloak and hood trimmed in white fur his sword was silvery and unadorned and he whipped it through a swift series of strikes i blocked frantically with the winchester but i knew enough about fighting to know that i was utterly outclassed hed have that sword in me in a matter of seconds so i ducked sprang back from a backhanded slash and raised the rifle to my shoulder as if i were about to shoot that stopped him forcing kringle to twist to one side to avoid the theoretical bulletand when he did i slammed every bit of will i had into a lance of magical force forzare kringle slipped aside incredibly nimble for a man his size and the strike missed him completely it did not miss the base of the ruined wall behind him what must have been a couple of tons of aged concrete collapsed with a roar kringle was fast and skilled but he wasnt perfect he kept himself from being crushed but several large stones clipped him and sent him staggering i let out a primal scream and rushed him i hit him at the shoulders and he was too off balance to bring the sword into play we both crashed to the ground but i wound up on top kneeling over him gripping the steel barrel of the winchester in both hands holding it like a club kringle froze staring up at me and i suddenly realized that the night had gone utterly silent i glanced around the wild hunt had surrounded us horses coming to a stop their riders watching intently hounds paced nervously around at the horses feet but came no closer the erlking was there too his shadow mask tattered greenish blood smearing the visible armor on his shoulder his right arm hung limply i turned back to kringle join hide or die i growled those are your options when the wild hunt comes for you kringle narrowed his eyes everyone knows thats true not anymore it isnt i growled i got to my feet slowly and just as slowly i lowered the rifle then i extended a hand to kringle tonight the hunt is joining me i swept my gaze around the silent assembly filling it with all the steel and resolve i had i just put the erlking on the bench and laid a beatdown on freaking santa claus i told them so you tell me whos next who comes to make an end of the winter knight a peer of the winter court and mabs chosen who is at the top of this food chain because tonight is halloween and i am damned well not afraid of any of you firelight eyes stared at me from all around and nothing stirred then kringles chuckle began rumbling up out of his throat a pulsating sound of deep and hearty mirth one of his huge hands closed on mine and i hauled him back to his feet i glanced over at the erlking as i did i could see nothing of his face but he nodded his head toward me very slightly there was something ironic about the way he did it and i sensed a kind of quiet amusement there was a low rumble as the harley came purring slowly over the ground toward us karrin stared at the scene her eyes wide and drew the bike to a stop next to me harry she asked what just happened a change of leadership i said and swung one leg over the harley to hop up behind her even as i did shadows began to whirl and slither they crawled up kringles legs restoring the concealing maskand as they did they also started climbing the harley and both of the people sitting on it it was a bizarre sensation everything about my physical perception sharpened and i could suddenly sense the world around me with perfect clarity i could feel the other members of the hunt knew exactly where they were and what they were doing on sheer instinctan instinct that guided them as well the night brightened into a silvery fairyland that remained night while being as bright as the noonday sun the shadow masks became something translucent so that if i peered closely enough i could see what was behind it i didnt do much peering i had a feeling that i didnt want to know what was behind all of those shadows karrin twisted the throttle on the harley nervously gunning the enginebut instead of a roar it came out as a primal screech the cry was instantly taken up by every single member of the hunt even as kringle his shadow mask restored remounted his steed and whirled it to face me sir knight kringle said inclining his head slightly to me what game amuses you this fine stormy evening i started loading shells from the ammo belt into the winchester until the rifle was full again then i levered a shell into the pipe slipped a replacement into the tube shut the breach with a snap and felt a wolfish smile spreading my mouth tonight i asked i raised my voice to address them all tonight we hunt outsiders the bloodthirsty screech that went up from the wild hunt was deafening chapter fortytwo pipe down i shouted were going quiet until we get there the hunt settled down though not instantly karrin revved the harleys engine and it was completely entirely silent i could feel the vibration of the increased revolutions but they did not translate into sound the shadows around the harley shifted and wavered and after a second i realized that they had taken on a shapethat of an enormous black cat muscled and solid like a jaguar that was astounding to me magic was not some kind of partially sentient force that did things of its own volition it wasnt any more artistic than electricity okay i said to karrin lets move uh she asked without turning her head move where the island i said harry this is a motorcycle itll work i said look at it karrin jerked as she noted the appearance of the harley you want me to drive into the lake you have to admit i said it isnt the craziest thing ive ever asked you to do it isnt even the craziest thing ive asked you to do tonight karrin thought about that one for a second and said youre right lets go she dropped the harley into gear threw out a rooster tail of dirt and gravel and we rushed toward the shore of the lake the steel mills had been engaged in actual shipping traffic in their day and the level field of construction marched right up to the waters edge and dropped off abruptly the water four or five feet straight down karrin gunned the engine covering the last two hundred yards in a flatout sprint and the torque on that harleys engine was something epic its bellow too loud to be wholly contained by the shadow mask emerging from the shadow tigers mouth as a deepthroated roar karrin let out a scream that was two parts excitement to one part terror and we flew twenty feet before the tires crashed down onto the surface of the lakeand held the bike jounced a couple of times but i held on to karrin and kept from flying off it was an interesting question though if i had would the water have supported me like an endless field of asphalt or would it have behaved as it normally would the entire hunt swept along behind us silent but for the low thunder of hooves and the panting of the houndswhen suddenly the silver starlight turned bright azure blue whoa karrin said did you do that i dont think so i said i looked over my shoulder and found kringle and the erlking riding along behind me i jerked my head at them in a beckoning gesture and they obligingly came up on either side of the harleytiger what is that i asked pointing at the sky a temporal pressure wave the erlking said his flaming eyes narrowed a wha i asked the erlking looked at kringle this is your area of expertise explain it someone is bending time against us kringle said i stared at him for a second and then it clicked were being rushed forward so that well get there too late i said were looking at a doppler shift is what he said correct the erlking asked kringle curiously essentially aye weve already lost half of an hour by my count who could have done this i asked you have encountered this before wizard kringle said can you not guess one of the queens i muttered or someone operating on their level can we get out of this wave the erlking and kringle traded a look you are the leader of the hunt kringle said what you wright with your power will grace each of us would you like to do it was he kidding me i had almost as much of an idea of how to screw around with the fabric of time as i did which of my clothes could be safely washed in hot water i probably need to save myself for whats coming i said kringle nodded if it is your will he said diffidently we can set our hands against it do it i said they both nodded their heads at me in small bows and then their steeds raced out in front of the pack sparks began to fly from their horses hooves first blue then abruptly darkening to scarlet the air seemed to shimmer and strange twisted sounds writhed all around us then there was a reverberating crash that sounded like something between thunder and the discharge of a blaster the air split in front of the two of them like a curtain and as the hunt hurtled through it the stars washed out to their normal silver hue again welldone i guess i shoutedand then i noticed that kringle was no longer there though the erlking still raced along over the next few moments he slowed enough to pace karrin and me hey whered bowlfullofjelly go kringle was our steppingstone out of the rapids of the stream he called back to lift us out he had to remain behind he will rejoin us farther down the shore harry karrin said how much farther down the shore the erlking shrugged with his uninjured arm time may hold no terror for us immortals sir knight but it is a massive force all but beyond even our control it will take as long as it takes harry karrin snapped i turned my eyes front and felt them widen we had arrived at demonreachand the island was under attack the first thing i saw was the curtain wall around the islands shoreline it was nothing but a flicker of opalescent light like a dense aurora borealis stretching from the waters edge up into the october sky it cast an eerie glow over the trees of the island steeping them in menacing black shadow and its reflection in the waters of the lake was three or four times bigger and more colorful than it should have been as the hunt rushed closer i could make out other details too there was a small fleet of boats surrounding the islandit looked like something out of wwiis pacific theater some of the boats were modest recreational models several at least the size of the water beetle and three looked like tugboatbarge units the kind that could ferry twenty loaded train cars around the lake i could see motion in the waters around the shore things were swarming up out of the lake hideous and fascinatinghundreds of them they smashed into demonreachs curtain wall light pulsed in liquid concentric circles where they touched it and shrieks of alien agony stretched the air toward a breaking point the waters within twenty feet of the shore bubbled and thrashed in a demonic frenzy i felt a pulse of power stir in the air and a bolt of sickly green energy lashed across the waters and slammed into the curtain wall the entire wall dimmed for a second but then resurged as the island resisted the attack i tracked the bolt back to the barge and saw a figure in a weird writhing cloak standing on the deck facing the islandsharkface as i watched i saw a zodiac boat carrying a team of eight men in dark clothing rush in toward the shore the man in the nose of the boat lifted something to his shoulder there was a loud foomp and a fire blossomed in the brush burning with an eyesearing chemical brilliance then the zodiac whirled and rushed back out again as if to escape a counterstrikeor maybe they just didnt want to stay anywhere close to waters full of piranhalike frenzied outsiders while sitting in a rubber boat half a dozen other boats were doing the same thing and several other similar craft were sitting still full of armed men waiting silently for the chance to land onshore i stared in shock the recent rain meant that the island wasnt likely to burst into flame anytime soon but i had utterly underestimated the scope of tonights conflict ye gods and little fishes this wasnt just a ritual spell this was an allout amphibious assault my very own miniature war erlking i said can you veil the hunt please the erlking glanced at me and then back at the hunt and suddenly the cold weirdly flatsounding dimness of a veil against both sight and sound gathered around us like a cloud this doesnt make any sense i said the ritual would still need a platform and that would take time and work to set upat least a day it would show they havent even gotten onto the island y then the truth hit me in a flash the barges i said they set up a ritual platform on one of the barges its the only thing that makes sense the waters of the lake would diminish the power they could draw from the ley lines running beneath it the erlking said yeah i said thats why theyre assaulting the shore theyre going to force a breach and then run the barge aground on the island thatll put them in direct contact with the ley line there are many outsiders here sir knight he noted more than enough to do battle with the hunt if we become bogged down in their numbers they will react to us as one beast once they know the danger we pose to them have a care for where we enter the fray wed better make the first punch count i said three barges which one has the platform why assume theres only one karrin asked if it was me id set the spell upon all three of them for redundancy they might have set the spell up on all three of them for redundancy i said she drove one of her elbows back against my stomach lightly we start this by sinking a barge i decided then i blinked and looked at the erlking can we sink a barge the shadowmasked erlking tilted his head slightly to one side his burning eyes narrowed wizard please right i said sorry eeny meeny miney moe catch a sharkface by the toe i pointed at the barge in the middle where id seen the outsider a moment ago that one and once its down well split into two groups youll lead half the hunt for the barge on the far side and ill take my half to the nearer one if we can nix any possibility of the ritual happening maybe theyll call it a night and go home that seems unlikely said the erlking he slowly flexed the arm id shot him in and i could sense that while it was not comfortable the lord of the goblins was already functionally recovered from the injury never know until you try i said i looked back at the hunt and pointed toward the center barge i repeated my instructions to them and soot black hands drew dozens of shadowy weapons i leaned into karrin a little and said next to her ear you ready for this only a lunatic is ready for this she said i could hear her smile as she spoke then she turned her head and before i could react planted a kiss right on my mouth i almost fell off the harley she drew her head back flashed me a wicked little smile and said for luck star warsstyle you are so hot right now i told her i lifted my winchester overhead then dropped it to point forward and the hunt surged ahead at its full insane speed silent and unseen and inevitable go right past its rear end i told murphy you mean its stern yes that i said rolling my eyes and then i began to gather in my will it was hard a slow strain like trying to breathe through layers of heavy cloth it was like holding a fistful of sandevery bit of energy i drew in wanted to slip away from me and the harder i tried to hold it the more trickled through my fingers so i gritted my teeth accepted that i wasnt going to have a lot of energy to work with and tried to hold it loosely gently as we closed in on the barge we were the first to pass it and as we did i flung out my hand crying out forzare raw will leapt through the air shattering our concealing veil the energy was focused into the shape of a cone needlepointed at the top and widening gradually to about six inches acrossan invisible lance i couldnt have done any more with the limited energy i had at my disposal it hit the hull of the barge with a clang and a shriek of tearing metal and then we were past it and karrin was tugging the harley into a tight leaning turn i checked over my shoulder and saw the erlking his sword in hand lean over the saddle and strike there was a hissing sound and a howl of screeching steel and starting at the hole id punched in the barges hull a straight line of redhot metal appeared where his sword had simply sheared through it behind him the next riders struck their weapons carving steel like soft pine slashing at the weakened section and tearing the original hole id made wider and wider i heard a howl of rage and looked up on the deck of the barge to see sharkface there already gathering energy to hurl at the riders of the hunt he didnt take the hounds into consideration before he could unleash his power a dozen of the beasts hit him all together in a single psychotic canine wave since they were running fast enough to get themselves a speeding ticket in most of illinois the impact was formidable hounds and outsider alike flew out over the rails of the barge and vanished into the waters of lake michiganand somehow i knew the fight continued beneath its waves the erlking let out a shriek of encouragement one that was echoed by the other riders as the tail end of the column passed the barge as the last rider struck a column of eerie green fire rose up from the glowing edges of the shredded steel hull and with a groan of strained seams the barge started to list badly to the rightstarboard i guessas water rushed in through the hole the hunt had made karrin had already wheeled the harley into a snarling turn one that let us see the deck of the ship as it began to sink smart shed been thinking farther ahead than me i could clearly see the dozens of lines and figures that had been painted onto the barges deck along with burning candles incense and the small still remains of animal sacrificesmostly rabbits cats and dogs it looked like rituals whatever form they take always involve the use of a circle explicit or otherwisethe circle had to be there to contain the energy that theyd been building up with all the sacrifices if nothing else this one had been established invisibly maybe originally set up with incense or somethingbut as the water lapped over the edge of the circle it immediately began to disperse the pentup energy visible as clouds of fluttering sparks like static that danced along the surface of the water and for just a second everything in the night went silent then there was a disturbance in the water with more ugly green light pouring up from below water suddenly rushed up displaced by something moving beneath the surface and then sharkface exploded up from the depths his freaky ragcloak spread out around him in an enormous cloud of tentaclelike extrusions he turned his eyeless face toward meme exactly not karrin and not the erlkingand let out a howl of fury so loud that the water for fifty feet in every direction vibrated and danced in time with it and a wave of pure violent blinding nauseating pain blanketed the face of lake michigan chapter fortythree suddenly i wasnt on the bitch seat of karrins harley i was hanging suspended in midair and i was in agony i opened my eyes and looked wildly around me barren icy earth cold grey sky my arms and legs were stretched out into an x shape and ice the color of a deep blue sky encased them holding them stretched out against what felt like an old knotted tree muscles and ligaments from my everywhere were at the trembling breaking point my own heartbeat was torment my face burned exposed to cold so severe that it hurt even me i tried to scream but couldnt a slow gargling moan came out instead and i coughed blood into the freezing air you knew this was coming said a voice a voice that still made my entire body thrum in response something simple and elemental that did not care how long she had held me in torment you knew this day would come i am what i am as are you mab walked into my vision from the left i barely had enough strength to keep my eyes focused on her you saw what happened to my last knight she said and began to take slow steps closer to me i didnt want to give her the satisfaction but i couldnt help iti heard myself make a soft noise felt myself make a feeble effort to move or escape it made her wide eyes glint for an instant i gave you power for a purpose and that purpose is complete she turned her hand over slowly and showed me something she held in ita small metal spike too large to be a needle too small to be a nail she walked closer to me rolling the finepointed etcher between two fingers and smiled her fingertips traced over my chest and ribs and i shuddered shed carved the word weak upon my body in dozens of alphabets and hundreds of languages etching it into my flesh the palms of my hands the soles of my feet with miles upon miles of scars i wanted it to be over i wanted her to kill me she leaned close to my face today she breathed we start carving your teeth cold enveloped me and water slithered into my mouth though i tried to keep it out some seeped through my cracked lips more went up my nostrils and took the long way aroundand then it froze into ice slowly forcing my jaws apart mab leaned in close to me lifting the etcher and i caught the faint scent of oxidation as the instrument began scratching at my incisors oxidation the smell of rust rust meant steelsomething no faerie id ever seen apart from mother winter could touch this wasnt actually happening to me it wasnt real the pain wasnt real the tree wasnt real the ice wasnt real but i still felt them i could feel something behind them a will that was not my own forcing the idea of pain upon me the image of helplessness the leaden fear the bitter vitriol of despair this was a psychic assault like nothing id ever seen before the ones id felt before this one were feeble shadows by comparison no i thought nnngh i moaned and i then i drew a deep breath this was not how my life would end this was not reality i was harry dresden wizard of the white council knight of winter i had faced demons and monsters fought off fallen angels and werewolves slugged it out with sorcerers and cults and freakish things that had no names i had fought upon land and sea in the skies above my city in ancient ruins and in realms of the spirit most of humanity did not know existed i bore scars that id earned in dozens of battles made enemies out of nightmares and laid low a dark empire for the sake of one little girl and i would be damned if i was going to roll over for some punk outsider and his psychic haymaker the words first damned near everything begins with words i am i breathed and suddenly the ice was clear of my mouth i am harry i panted and the pain redoubled and i laughed as if some freak who had never loved enough to know loss could tell me about pain i am harry blackstone copperfield dresden i roared ice and wood shattered frozen stone cracked with a sound like a cannons blast a spiderweb of tiny crevices spreading out from me the image of mab flew away from me and blew into thousands of crystalline shards like a shattering stainedglass window the cold and the pain and the terror reeled away from me like some vast and hungry beast suddenly struck on the nose the outsiders loved their psychic assaults and given that this one happened about two seconds after sharkface came up out of the water it was pretty clear who was behind it but that was fine sharkface had chosen a battle of the mind so be it my head my rules i lifted my right arm to the frozen sky and shouted wordless and furious and a bolt of scarlet lightning flashed from the seething skies it smashed into my hand and then down into the earth frozen dirt sprayed everywhere and when it had cleared i stood holding an oaken quarterstaff carved with runes and sigils as tall as my temple and as big around as my joined thumb and forefinger then i stretched my left arm down to the earth and cried out again sweeping it up in a single beckoning gesture i tore metals from the ground beneath me and they swirled like mist up around my body forming into a suit of armor covered in spikes and protruding blades okay big guy i snarled out at the dark will that even now gathered itself to attack again now we know who i am lets see who you are i took the staff and smote its end down on the ground who are you i demanded you play in my head you play by my rules identify yourself in answer there was only a vast roaring sound like an angry arctic wind gathering into a gale oh no you dont i muttered you started this creep you want to get up close and personal lets play who are you a vast sound like something youd hear in the deep ocean moaned through the sky thrice i command thee i shouted focusing my will sending it coursing into my voice which boomed out over the landscape thrice i bid thee by my name i command thee tell me who you are and then an enormous swirling form emerged from the clouds overheada face but only in the broadest roughest terms like something a child would make from clay lightning burned far back in its eyes and it spoke in the voice of gale winds i am gatebreaker harbinger i am feargiver hopeslayer i am hewhowalksbefore for a second i just stood there staring up at the sky shocked hells bells it worked the thing spoke and as it did i knew i knew what it was as if id been given a snapshot of its core identity its quintessential self for one second no more than that i understood it what it was doing what it wanted what it planned and and then that moment was past the knowledge vanished the way it had comeexcept for one thing somehow id held on to a few crumbling fragments of insight i knew the thing trying to tear my head apart was a walker i didnt know much about them except that nobody else knew much about them either and that they were extremely bad news and one of them had tried to kill me when i was sixteen years old hewhowalksbehind had nearly done it except from where i stood now i wasnt sure hed really been trying to kill me hed been shaping me i dont know for what but hed been trying to provoke me and this thing in my head the thing id named sharkface was like him a walker a peer it was huge powerful and in a way utterly different from the kinds of power i had seen before this thing wasnt bigger than mab but it was horribly unbearably deeper than her like a photograph of a sculpture compared to the sculpture itself it had power at its command that was beyond anything i had seen beyond measure beyond comprehensionjust plain beyond this thing was power from the outside and i was a grain of sand to its oncoming tide but you know what that grain of sand might be the last remnant of what had once been a mountain but that which it is it is the tide comes and the tide goes let it hammer the grain of sand as it may let lofty mountains fear the slow constant assault of the waters let the valleys shudder at the pitiless advance of ice let continents drown beneath the dark and rising tide but that grain of sand it isnt impressed let the tide roll in the sand will still be there after it rolls out again so i looked up at that face and i laughed i laughed scorn and defiance at that vast swirling power and it didnt just feel good it felt right go ahead i shouted go ahead and eat me and then well see if youve got the stomach to keep me down i lifted my staff and golden white fire began to pour from the carved runes as i gathered power into it the air grew chill with winter and frost formed on the razoredged blades in my armor i ground my feet into place setting them firmly and the glow of soulfire began to emanate from the cracks in the earth around me i bared my teeth at the hungry sky flew the bird at it with my free hand and screamed bring it on a furious voice filled the air a sound that shook the earth and sky alike that made the ground buckle and the swirling clouds recoil and then i was back on the harley clutching karrins waist in one hand and clinging to the winchester with the other the motorcycle was still in motion but it wasnt accelerating it felt like we were coasting karrin let out a low gurgling cry and suddenly sagged forward panting i pulled her back against me helping her to sit up and after a few seconds she gave her head a few quick shakes and snarled i hate getting into a vulcan mind meld it hit you too i asked it she cast a look over her shoulder up at me and shuddered yeah you okay now im starting to get angry she said a hideously mirthful sound spread over the airthe sound of the erlkings laughter his great steed swerved in close to the motorcycle and he lifted his sword in a gesture of fierce defiance then his burning eyes turned to me and he spoke in a voice that was murderously merry welldone starborn uh i said thank you the lord of the goblins laughed again it was the kind of sound that would stick with youand wake you up in the middle of the night wondering whether perhaps poisonous snakes had surrounded your bed and were about to start slithering in i looked back the hunt had spread out into a ragged semblance of its former cohesion but even as i watched the riders and hounds poured on extra effort to gather together again i looked around but saw no sign of sharkface i did see something elsevshaped ripples coming toward us through the water a whole lot of them here they come i shouted to the erlking good hunting that much seems certain he called in that same cheerfully vicious voice and wheeled his horse to the right half of the riders and hounds split off with him while the other half continued streaming after me i pointed at our target as the erlking headed toward his there i called lets do it the harleytiger let out another snarling roar and karrin raced toward the second barge hellish shrieks went up from both groups of the huntand the oncoming things in the water smoothly split into two elements as they came forward we raced the enemy toward the barges this time we didnt have surprise on our side it couldnt have been more than a minute or two since the hunt had announced its arrival but i saw figures stirring on the deck of the barge ahead of us gun shouted karrin incoming crap out over the water like this i didnt have access to anywhere near enough magic to provide a continuous shieldand i couldnt try to slap down individual bullets either by the time i saw the gunfire the round would already be going through us which meant that this was going to happen the vanilla way the way soldiers worldwide have done it for a few centuries now advance advance advance and hope that you didnt get shot then karrin snatched the rifle out of my hand and screamed take the bike i fumbled for a moment but found the handlebars reaching around her to make it happen i gunned the throttle as karrin raised the winchester to her shoulder half rose and squinted through the buckhorn sights flashes came from the boat and something that sounded like an angry hornet flicked past my ear i saw bits of spray coming up from the water ahead of us as the shooters misjudged their range and i kept on racing straight ahead when we got to within a hundred yards karrin started shooting the old rifle boomed and sparks flew up from the barges hull she worked the lever action without lowering it from her shoulder and fired again one of the dark shapes on the deck vanished and two more flinched away more gunfire came from the boatpanic fire splashing wildly everywhere and mostly nowhere close to us whoever was over there they didnt like getting shot at any more than i did as we closed the last yards karrin fired three more times in a rapid assured pace i couldnt see whether she hit anyone else until we went roaring past the barge no more than ten feet away when a man holding the distinctive shape of a shotgun rose into sight karrin was covering the barges stern with the winchester when he popped up the old gun roared again and the gunman fell away and out of sight we raced by unharmed but the enemy gunfire had done its work the riders and hounds of the hunt had been distracted by the flying bullets and they didnt do nearly as much damage to the barge as in the initial attack even as i watched more and more figures with guns appeared on the barge and started shooting i checked the oncoming rush of outsiders we werent going to sink the barge before they got here to sink it karrin was shouting what we dont have to sink the barge she shouted it cant move on its own we just have to kill the boat thats pulling it right i said and leaned the harley into a turn that would take us arching back toward the bargethis time at its front or prow or bow or something where a rig containing a tugboat a bit bigger than the water beetle had been built on it also brought us closer to the oncoming outsiders and i couldnt tell which of us would get there first as i sped up karrin dug into the compartments on the harley reaching around me then said hold it steady then she stood up and i couldnt see a damned thingbut i did see the way she pulled the pin out of a freaking hand grenade and let the spoon spin off into the night the harley buzzed past the tugboats rig maybe ten feet ahead of the outsiders and karrin gave the grenade a rather feeble little flick as we went by i heard it smash into glass like a stone thrown against a window and then we were past the barge and a huge sound thudded through the air like an entire library of books all dropped flat at the same instant and an incandescent white light flared from the tug i looked back over my shoulder and saw that the tugboat was on fire pouring out thick black smoke and leaning sharply to one side murphy saw it too and let out an ululating war cry before she sat back down and pushed my hands off the handlebars reassuming control of the harley two down she said one to go i looked back behind me the outsiders had begun swarming at the barge and one of them actually came out of the water at one of the rearmost riders of the huntthis horrible thing that was all pustules and multiple limbs with too many joints as it leapt the rider raised a shadowy bow and loosed a darkling arrow it struck the outsider and burst into redamber flame the same color as the burning eyes of the hunt the outsider let out an unearthly wail and plunged back beneath the surface come on i said to karrin head for the other boat should we she asked that erlking guy seems a little doityourselfy she was right about that like any of the other seriously powerful beings of faerie the erlking had a strong sense of prideand you crossed that pride at your own risk if i showed up and the erlking thought i was making the statement that i judged him unfit to finish the task it could come back to haunt me on the other hand id already insulted him once and there was a lot on the line if he didnt want me making calls like this he shouldnt have let me shoot him and take over his hunt i said i turned to beckon the riders and hounds behind me and shouted come on my voice came out as both my own and in the howling screech of the hunt the two interwoven and the rest of my group joined in the shriek and formed up around the harley as it raced across the water toward the third barge where the fight wasnt going well there were several long straight streaks of molten steel where the erlking and his riders had struck the barges hull the edges marked with flickering tongues of eerie green fire but they had not torn a hole in it like we had the first barge either and the outsiders had gotten to this barge faster than they had to mine even as we approached i saw a racing hound of the hunt vanish in a spray of water as things plural too twisted and too confusing to count surged up from below and began to drag the hound down a shriek loud enough to cause spray to rise from the water shook the air and the erlking himself plunged down from overhead leading a trio of hunters behind him blades and arrows struck at the outsiders in plumes of ember fire the erlking seized the hound by the scruff of its neck and dragged it up out of the grasp of the creatures beneath the surface the erlking and his riders had fallen into a formation a great tilted wheel at the far end the riders were maybe fifty feet above the waves circling in the air to then charge down at the surface of the water where it met the hull of the barge the outsiders would throw themselves up out of the waves meeting each individual rider hounds would in turn try to throw themselves on the outsiders smothering their defense so that the rider could strike the barge meanwhile figures aboard the barge fired rifles wildly into the night though the deck of the thing was actually bobbing with the thrashing of the outsiders in the water around it whoever they were they struck me as amateurishthough maybe it was only because id been exposed to real soldiers before who were a deadly threat even on the scale of supernatural conflict these guys werent the einherjarenbut at the end of the day they still had deadly weapons and more than one rider and hound had been struck by rounds and bled molten light from their shadowmasked bodies the piercing screech of the hunt met with the howls of outsiders and the crack of rifle fire and bit by bit the barges hull bled redhot steel but it wasnt happening fast enough with a groan the barges tugboat this one mounted behind it began shoving the thing forward through the water and toward the shore of demonreach i shouldnt have split us up i said we didnt cover twice as many targets we just got twice as halfassed karrin made a sputtering sound then said you and math are not friends regret later lead now right i said the barge wasnt exactly leaping into motionbut it wouldnt stop on a dime once it got moving either do you have any more grenades i asked karrin i used them a couple of weeks ago she said with kincaid i asked there was an edge to it she and the assassin were kind of an item the last time i looked harry she said focus hells bells she was right i didnt need the winter mantle turning me into a territorial alpha dick right now i stared at the barge for a long second pushing that instinct away and then said to the hunt join the erlking attack the barge hounds and riders streamed past us joining the madmans wheel of death in the sky and i lowered my voice speaking only to karrin as i reloaded the winchester get me to the tugboat she gave me a quick wideeyed glance and then seemed to get it she gunned the motor sending the harley shooting past the erlkings very large very threatening and very distracting formation as we raced alone toward the chugging tugboat she brought us right alongside it and once again i leapt from the back of the harley i hit the side of the tug pretty hard but was able to get the fingers of my left hand around the top of the rail and with a few kicks managed to swing myself up onto the deck i landed in a crouch clutching the rifle got my bearings and headed toward a stairwell that would lead me to the boats bridge i went up it as quietly as i could which is pretty damned quiet for a guy my size winchester at the ready the bridge of the tug was big enough to merit its own enclosed space and i slipped up to the door took a breath then ripped it open lifting the winchester as i did the bridge was empty the wheel secured with a pair of large plastic ties there was a piece of paper taped to the wheel and on it was written in large black marker look behind you i started to turn but a cannonball hit me between the shoulder blades i flew forward onto the bridge and slammed my head against the plexiglas forward windows i fell back from that stunned and a heavy weight hit me from the side slamming me into a bulkhead which felt almost exactly like being slammed into a steel wall i wound up prone my face to the deck and once more the heavy weight slammed into me landing on my back and cat sith who had told me not to turn my back on anyone purred wizard knight fool too ignorant even to know how to die properly his skincrawling voice came out in a throaty buzz next to my ear allow me to educate you chapter fortyfour the reasonable thing to do would have been to whimper or flinch or just freak out and look for the nearest exit but instead of doing any of those things i felt a chill settle over my brain and a very cold calm part of me studied the situation objectively join hide or die i said i heard the faint echo of the wild hunts screech in my voice excuse me cat sith said you have excellent hearing i said but i will repeat myself join hide or die you know the laws of the hunt i do know them wizard and once i have slain you the hunt will be mine to do with as i please the real cat sith wouldnt be having this conversation with me you know hed have killed me by now a blow struck the back of my head sharp painful but not debilitating i am cat sith the one the only i turned my head slightly and said so why do i still have a spine and i threw an elbow at the weight on my back i connected with something hard and slammed it off me it hit the other wall of the bridge and i flung myself to my feet in time to see the large lean form of cat sith thrash his tail and bound at me i ducked him moving forward under his leap and spun and it left the two of us facing each other across the full length of the bridge slow i said ive seen him move cat sith is faster than that a hideous growling sound came from the form of the malk i am he get me a coke i snarled what you heard me mittens get me a freaking coke and do it now sith remained in place as if locked to the floor though his whole body was quivering his claws sheathing and unsheathing in rhythm but he didnt fly at me ripping and tearing either you see i said cat sith is a creature of faerie and he swore an oath to queen mab to obey her commands she commanded him to obey mine and i just gave you a command kitty did mab release you from her command did she suspend the duties of her vassal sith snarled again his eyes getting wider and rounder his tail thrashing around wildly they got to you didnt they i said they jumped you back at the botanic gardens while you were covering my exit freaking sharkface was watching the whole thing and he got you sith began quivering so hard that he was jitterbugging back and forth in place on the floor his head twitching his fur standing on end and then abruptly lying flat again fight it sith i urged him quietly it doesnt have to win fight it for a second i thought i saw something of cat siths smug contemptuous selfassurance on the malks face and then it was gone just gone everything went away and the malk stood for a second with its head down then it lifted its head and the motion was subtly wrong something that simply didnt have the grace id seen in the elder malk before it faced me for a moment and then it spoke its voice absent of anything like personality a pity i would have been more useful to them as an active covert asset i shuddered at the utter absence in that voice i wasnt talking to sith anymore i was speaking with the adversary like mab wouldnt have figured it out i said like she did when you infected lea further conversation is not useful to our design notsith said and then the malks form flew at me in a blur it was a testament to the power of the winter knights mantle and the wild hunts energy that i survived that first leap at all sith struck straight at my throat i got my arms in the way the black shadow mask of the hunt over my arms and chest blew apart into splinters dispersing some of the impact energy of the malks spectacular leap and instead of pulping me against the wall behind me he just pounded me into it with toothrattling force sith bounced off me which was what i had hoped would happen in my line of work ive dealt with more than one critter that is faster than fast when theyve got their feet underneath them its the nextbest thing to impossible to land anything on thembut when theyre in the air theyre moving at the speed gravity and air resistance dictate like everybody else for that one portion of a second sith was an object moving through space not a blindingly fast killing machine someone who didnt know that wouldnt have known to be ready for it but i did and i was the blast of raw force i summoned wasnt my very best punchbut it was the best i was going to get out here over the lake it slammed into the creature that had been cat sith and plowed it out through the plexiglas window the plastic didnt break it came entirely out of its housing and the malk and a slab of plexiglas the size of a door went whirling out into the madness of the night sith flew out over the bow of the tugboat and plunged down into the water through the open spaces of the pipesteel rig between it and the barge i stared hard after the departed malk for a few seconds to be sure he wasnt going to bounce right back into my face somehow as i did i watched in the other half of the bridges forward window while the shadow mask of the hunt slithered back up over my arms and face i gave it to a three count nodded and then went to the tugs wheel i snapped the plastic ties securing it with a pair of fast jerks then started rolling the wheel as far as it would go to the right there was a big lever that looked like a throttle and when i pushed it forward the boats engines started to roar with effort the barge groaned as the tug changed the direction in which it applied force and the barges back end began slowly slewing out and to the left that drew shouts of consternation from the deck of the barge i didnt feel like getting shot in the face so i knelt down out of sight while i pulled the secondhand belt off of my old jeans and used it to secure the wheel in position then i recovered the winchester and backed out of the bridge hurrying away from it as quietly as i could what id done was a delaying tactic at best it wouldnt turn the barge aroundbut it would set it to spinning in place and maybe cost the enemy time to turn it around if they took control of it again but that was exactly what the hunt needed to sink hertime the longer the barge played sitandspin the better so i found a nice quiet patch of shadow where i could see the stairs leading up to the tugs bridge and where i could stand behind a very large steel pipe i rested the winchester on the top bend of the pipe sighted on the doorway and waited it didnt take long for the first couple of crewmen to arrive i wasnt sure whether they came up from belowdecks or somehow swarmed over from the barge but two men in dark clothing carrying pistols at the ready came hurrying along and started up the stairs im not a great shot but when youre resting a rifle on a solid surface one that is perfectly still at least relative to all the solid surfaces around it and when the range is about forty feet you dont have to be an expert you just have to take a breath let it out and squeeze the winchester cracked with thunder and the first man arched into a bow of agony just as he reached the top of the stairs that ended up working in my favor he fell back into the second man just as the second guy spun and raised his pistol the first man fell into the second sending his first shot wild and knocked him about halfway over the second man couldnt hold the gun with both hands but he kept pulling the trigger as fast as he could at forty feet terrified in the dark unsure of his targets exact location and sprawled out with the deadweight of another man flopping against him the poor bastard didnt have a chance he got off seven or eight rounds none of them coming anywhere close i worked the action on the winchester took a breath let half out and squeezed the trigger it wasnt until the flash of light from the shot illuminated him that i recognized ace his expression panicked his gun aimed at a point ten feet to my left the light flashed and burned his face into my retina for a moment as the dark returned and the tugboat was silent again it didnt take long for the erlking to finish his work maybe three minutes later a chorus of hideous screams went up from the lakes surface and the hunt howled its triumph and circled into the sky horns blaring hounds baying i saw green fire burning fiercely from the spot the hunt had started carving and then the barge started to list toward that side as the water poured into her barges arent warships or even maritime vessels if they have belowdecks spaces at all they generally arent fitted with flood compartments and sealable doors they sure as hell dont have automatic systems theyre just soup bowls poke a hole in the bottom and a bowl isnt gonna hold much soup i didnt feel like getting titanicked so i hustled over to the spot where id boarded the tug there was a roar from the shadowtiger mask around the harley and murphy swept up alongside the boat i leapt down onto the back of the bike in a single smooth motion which i felt was cool and landed with way too much of my weight on my genitals which i felt was not go go go i gasped in a pained falsetto and murphy peeled away from the doomed ships within moments the hunt had fallen into formation around me again and the erlking was laughing maniacally whirling his sword over his head the shadow mask over one leg and a section of his ribs had been torn away and i could see wounds beneathbut already the shadows were stretching over them again i love nights like this he bellowed i love halloween yeah its pretty badass i said in my wobbling creaky voice sir knight he said that was passably done but from here i believe it shall take more experience and expertise than you possess to continue the hunt do i have your leave to resume command and pursue these outsider vermin in a more appropriate fashion he asked me uh i squeaked you arent going to come after me with it are you he broke into laughter that could have been heard for miles he was smiling so hard it went right through the shadow mask turning his face into a crazed jackolantern of soot and fire not this night i give you my word have i your leave rather than answer the erlking in my mickey mouse voice i gave him the thumbsup the lord of the goblins threw back his head and let out another screech and his steed began to gain altitude the rest of the hunt followed him uh harry karrin said yeah this is a motorcycle it didnt register for a second and then i blinked we were cruising down the surface of lake michigan and it was chockfull of monstery goodnessand we had just left the wild hunt oh crap i said head for the island go go go murphy leaned hard into a turn and opened up the throttle i looked over my shoulder at the erlking wheeling in the skies above the lake spiraling higher and higher the hunt following after we went by a couple of zodiacs so fast that their occupants didnt have time to shoot at us before we were gone then the motorcycle slowed what are you doing i screamed we cant hit the beach at this speed karrin shouted back well pancake ourselves into those trees i dont really feel like taking a swim tonight dont be such a pussy karrin snapped she leaned the bike into another turn one that angled our direction to run parallel to the shore and cut out the accelerator i felt the harley slowing and for a second i thought i felt it beginning to sink then the erlking cried out again and dived his horse sprinting straight down trailing the fire of the hunt from its hooves the rest of the hounds and riders followed in formation and their horns and cries rebounded around the night then maybe a second before they hit the water the hunt changed suddenly the erlking wasnt mounted on a horse but on a freaking killer whale its deadlylooking blackandwhite coloration stark in the night behind him the other steeds shifted too their riders screeching with excitement the hounds changed as well their canine bodies compressed into the long lean powerful shape of large sharks then the whole lot of them hit the water in a geyser of spray and the harley promptly fell into the water of the lake and onto sand just under its surface the bike slowed dramatically pushing me up against karrin nearly pushing her over the handlebars but she locked her arms straight and held drawing the bike up onto the shore of the island she rode the brake until wed come to a halt about five feet short of hitting one of the big old trees on the island see karrin said you were right i said she looked back up at me her eyes twinkling you are so hot right now i burst out into a hiccuping laugh that felt like it could have veered off into manic or depressive at any second the pressure and terror of this entire stupid ugly day finally getting to mebut it didnt there were no enemy ships right on hand and no one had launched grenades at the island since the wild hunts attack had begun there might have been outsiders in the water but apparently the hunt was occupying their total attention for the moment we were alone and karrin started laughing too we laughed like that for several moments we each tried to speak to say something about the day but it kept getting choked off by the halfhysterical laughter grenades i said as if a date has to have look on mollys face know hes a dog but i swear that santa claus smackdown murphy gasped finally and it set us both into gales of laughter that had no wind to support them until finally we were just sitting with her small warm form leaning her back against my chest in the darkness then she turned her head slowly and looked up at me her eyes were very blue her mouth was very close then i noticed something the second barge whose tug murphy had torched with her grenade was moving i stood up and climbed off the bike my eyes widening oh crap i said from there i could see that sharkface stood calmly on the surface of the lake at the rear of the barge his cloak twining and writhing all around him his arms stretched forward in what was clearly a gesture of command the waters at the rear of the barge boiled with outsiders most of them at least partly out of the water and it took me only a second to work out what was happening they were doing an evinrude impersonation slamming their combined mass and preternatural strength against the rear of the barge the burning tug was still a massive column of smoke and flame in front of the barge but the barge was definitely movingand it was close to shore eerie green and scarlet light flashed in the depths of the lake soundless and random sharkface had been smart when the hunt entered the water he must have sent the lions share of his outsiders against themwhile he and a few others came back up to the surface to ruin the crap out of my potential romantic moment oh stars and stones i breathed if they get that boat to shore the harley cant get us there karrin said not through this terrain and brush you cant keep up with me here i said murphy gritted her teeth at that but nodded go she said ill come as fast as i can and then i thought to myself that if i kept on waiting for things to quiet down and be more appropriate and safer before i took action i was never going to get anywhere in life so i slipped a hand behind her head leaned down and kissed her on the mouth hard she didnt stiffen she wasnt surprised she leaned into it and her mouth tasted like strawberries i gave it two heartbeats three four then we both drew away at the same time her eyes were slightly wide her cheeks high with color im not going anywhere i told her then i turned and sprinted toward the stretch of shore at which sharkface had pointed the last barge chapter fortyfive for me running across the island wasnt a physical effort it was mostly a mental one my awareness of the place was bonedeep a total knowledge that existed as a single whole body in my minda kind of understanding that some medieval scholars had called intellectus it came to me on the level of reflex and instinct when i ran i knew where every branch stood out where every stone lay ready to turn beneath my foot moving happened as naturally as breathing and every step seemed to propel me forward a little faster like running across the surface of one of those bouncy cages at a kids pizza place i didnt have to run across the island i just had to think about it and let my body effortlessly follow my mind i came out of the woods on the beach above where the barge was headed which was roughly twentythree yards one foot and six and one half inches from the nearest edge of the whatsup dock one of the three major pulsing ley lines ran out from the island at almost that exact point and if the barge managed to ground itself in contact with the line chicagoans were going to have a really rough morning commute now that the hunt and the outsiders had taken their fight mostly below the waves it was quiet enough to hear the barge approaching someone had already begun chanting on the deck of the barge i couldnt see them through the smoldering wreckage of the tug out in front of the barge but voices were certainly being raised in unison in a steady chant of some language that sounded as if it were meant to be spoken while gargling crisco whatever happened to ia ia cthulu fhtagn i muttered no one has a sense of style anymore behind the chanting i could hear the bubbling sloshing water as the outsiders pushed the barge nearer and nearer i rested the butt of the rifle on the ground next to my foot crouched down and squinted out at the boat it was going to be here shortly but not instantly and i was pretty sure id get only one chance to stop it i started gathering power to myself an action id done so many times over the years that it was all but a reflex now and squinted at the barge if the ritual was already in progress then there was a chance that they were simply in a holding pattern maintaining the skeleton of the spell with their own limited energy and waiting until the right moment once they were close enough to use it theyd drop their circle and channel the energy of the ley line shaping it into the spells muscles and organs filling out the frame that was prepared to accomodate it i had to make sure they never got that chance a hole in the hull would work but by the time the barge came within my limited range it would be too late to drown it id already tried killing its engine once so i wasnt terribly excited about the prospect of taking out the creatures pushing it i had to stop it for destruction i said aloud ice is also great and would suffice i nodded once to myself rose and said okay harry get this one right i went down to the shore using the butt of the rifle i inscribed a circle in the mud and closed it with a touch of my hand and a whisper of will once i felt its presence snap into place i took the will id been gathering reached down into the earth and gathered more drawing it up like water from a well i could feel the seething power of the ley line beneath me could feel how close i came to it in my quest to gather as much energy as i could before i unleashed my attack the earth trembled with a subterranean river of dark power the spirit of violence havoc and death expressed as energy and if i tapped into it i could potentially direct its terrible strength at the enemy there would be consequences to an action like that chain reactions and fallout i couldnt predict but it would sure as hell get the job done for a second i almost did it there was so much on the line but you cant go around changing your definition of right and wrong or smart and stupid just because doing the wrong thing happens to be really convenient sometimes it isnt easy to be sane smart and responsible sometimes it sucks sucks wang camel wang but that doesnt turn wrong into right or stupid into smart id kinda gotten an object lesson in that so i left that power alone the magic continued to pour into me more than i usually used more than was comfortable after thirty seconds i felt as if my hairs were standing on end and sparks were shooting between them i ground my teeth dug into the cold power of winter and kept drawing more i began directing it down toward my right hand and cold bluewhite fire abruptly wreathed my fingers like the flame from a newly lit gas burner the burned tug was only about a hundred yards away when i lifted my hand stepped forward out of the circle and cried out rexus mundus and a globe of blindingly intense blue light the size of a soccer ball flew out into the night it spewed mist from every inch of its surface and flashed through the night like a dying comet it landed in the water twenty yards in front of the slowmoving barge there was an abrupt screech as the sphere of condensed absolutezero cold hit lake michigan ice formed almost instantly and large crystals of it shot out in every direction sharp as spears kind of like supermans fortress of solitude one instant it was clear sailing for the bargethe next the mutant spawn of an iceberg and a giant porcupine bobbed in the water directly in front of it a barrier of ice the size of a tractor trailer i could have gone bigger but there just wasnt enough time id needed it to happen fast to get that weight into positionbut i wasnt a complete dummy my pointy iceberg was the size of a semi but the barge could have carried twenty of them i just had to get the first piece into the right spot again i reached for winter and again i lifted my hand howling infriga pure cold screamed from my hand into the air spreading over the surface of the lake in a field shaped like a folding fan the surface crystallized and froze and i poured more and more into it thickening the ice spreading it toward the little iceberg the wreckage of the tugboat hit my obstacle first and the spears of ice punched through the weakened wooden hull of the tug nailing the iceberg to it the barge slowed and pieces of the tugs rig screamed and bent in protest then as it approached it started hitting the thinnest ice at the edge of the fanbut as it kept coming the ice got thicker and thicker providing increasing resistance to the barges forward motion it began to grind to a halt a furious shriek ripped the air sharkface id just pissed the walker off bigtime it probably says something about my maturity level that it made me grin from ear to ear i saw him jump into the airnot like a bunny hop but a fullon kung fu theater leap way up over the barge his ragstrip cloak spread out like dozens of little wings as gravity turned his jump from an ascent into a dive i was starting to feel the effort of using so much brutepower magic in such a short amount of time but i had enough left to handle this thing i prepared a blast of force ready to swat him away from my barrier of ice and unleash it on him the moment he came within range i missed well i didnt miss exactly but just before the bolt slammed home sharkface split into dozens of identical shapes that splintered off in every direction so one of those shapes got hit with a slap of force that would have rocked a car up onto two wheels and that one went soaring away but the other forty or fifty crashed down onto my field of ice like cannonballs smashing through in most places in some only sending wide cracks through the ice when that happened the copies of sharkface just started tearing it apart with their claws thick ice is no joke as an obstacleunless youre a walker of the outside i guess because these things ripped it apart like it was styrofoam there were so damned many of them i started slamming more of them but it was heavy work and there were just too many targets while some of them ripped apart the remaining ice others began to tear apart the iceberg and the tugboat rending them into scrap with an inexorable strength and claws like steel knives i might have hit seven or eight of them but it just didnt matter i was the wrong tool for the job so to speak this was a much larger problem and i had no idea how to solve it the chanting on the barge rolled upward an octave gaining frenzied volume outsiders thrashed through the water pushing the barge surging ahead of it to push pulverized chunks of ice out of its way their howls and weird clicks and ululations like their own horrible music other outsiders came rushing toward me on the shoreonly to smash uselessly against the glowing barrier of demonreachs curtain wall they couldnt get to me which seemed fair enough because i couldnt seem to get to them either id slowed them down cost them maybe a couple of minutes and that was all the water near me stirred and then a sharkface rose up out of it as if on an elevator slow his mouth tilted up into a small smile he stood there on the water perhaps five feet away from me his eyeless face looked smug warden he said asshat i replied that only made his smile wider the battle is over you have failed but you need not be destroyed this day youre kidding i said youre trying to recruit me the offer is made the walker said we always appreciate new talent im no ones puppet i said the walker actually barked out a short laugh at what point have you been anything else you can forget it i said im not working for you then a truce sharkface said we do not need you to fight our battles for us but if you stand aside we will accord you respect and leave you in peace you and those you love take them to a safe quiet place stay there you will not be molested my boss might not go along with this plan i said after tonight mab will no longer be a concern to anyone i was going to say something badass and cool but take the people i love somewhere take maggie somewhere safe somewhere without mad queens or insane sidhe and just get out of this entire thankless painful hideous business wizarding just isnt what it used to be not so many years ago id think it was a busy week if someone asked me to locate a lost dog or a wedding ring it had been horribly boring id had lots and lots of free time i hadnt been rich but id gotten to buy plenty of books to read and id never gone hungry and no one had tried to kill me or asked me to make a horrible choice not once you never know what you have until its gone peace and quiet and people i love isnt that what everyone wants ah hell the outsider probably wasnt good for it anyway and i did have one more option i had been warned not to use the power of the well but what else did i have i might have done something extra stupid at that moment if the air hadnt suddenly filled with a massive sound two loud horrible crunching sounds followed by a single short sharp clap of thunder it repeated the sequence again and again crunch crunch crack crunch crunch crack no wait i knew this song it was more like stomp stomp clap stomp stomp clap what else did i have i had friends i looked up at sharkface who was scanning the lakes surface an odd expression twisting his unsettling face i smiled widely and said you didnt see this coming didja stomp stomp clap stomp stomp clap this was somebodys mix version of the song because it went straight to the chorus of voices pure human voices loud enough to shake the groundand i lifted my arms and sang along with them singin we will we will rock you the halloween sky exploded with strobes of scarlet and blue light laser streaks of white and viridian flickering everywhere forming random flickering impressions of objects and faces filling the sky with light that pulsed in time with the music and as it did the water beetle the entire goddamned ship exploded out from under a veil that had rendered it and the water it had displaced and every noise it had made undetectable not only to me but to a small army of otherworldly monstrosities and their big bad walker general too the walker let out another furious shriek his hideous features twisted even more by the frenetic explosion of light in the sky and that was all he had time to dothe water beetle slammed into the last barge at full speed the mass differential between the two ships was significantbut this was different from when the barge had hit my iceberg for one thing it was almost entirely still having only barely begun to pick up speed again for another the water beetle didnt hit it headon instead it struck the barge from the side and right up by its nose with less than ten yards to spare before the barges prow ground up onto demonreachs shore the water beetle brutally slammed her nose away from contacting the power of the outgoing ley line i couldnt hear the collision over the thunder of queens greatest hit but it flung objects all over both ships around with the impactmore so on the beetle than on the barge the barge wallowed stunned its nose turned away from the beach its long side being presented to the island while the water beetle rebounded violently drunkenly and crunched up onto her hull in the shallows listing badly to one side mac and molly were up at the wheel she had nearly been thrown from the craft but mac had grabbed my apprentice around the waist and kept her from getting a flying lesson im not sure she even noticed her face was contorted in a concentration so deep it was practically dementia her lips moving frantically and she held a wand in either hand moving them in entirely disconnected movements as if directing two different orchestras through two different speedmetal medleys and as i watched two other forms bounded up onto the water beetles rail then into graceful leaps that carried them over onto the bargedirectly into the center of the ritual that was still running at a frantic pitch thomas had gone into the fight with his favorite combination of weaponsa sword and a pistol even as i watched my brother whirled into a mass of figures on the deck blade spinning blood flying out in wide clean arcs he moved so swiftly that i could barely track him just a blur of steel here a flash of cold grey eyes there his gun fired in quick rhythm between strokes of his falcata scything down the outsiders mortal henchmen like sheaves of wheat the second figure was grey and shaggy and terrifying mouses lionlike ruff of fur flew out like a true mane as he whirled and lunged into the rituals participants wherever thomas hadnt i saw him rip a shotgun from the hands of a stunned guard and fling it with a snap of his head into another one before bounding forward and bringing half a dozen panicked men to the deck under his weightand smashing them through the circle that had surrounded the ritual the reduced energy the ritual had been able to use the framework that the ley line would have turned into a deadly construction vanished released into the night sky to be shaken to pieces by the music we will we will rock you hey sharkface i shouted stepping forward gathering winter and soulfire as i went the furious walker whirled back to me just in time to have the heavy octagonal barrel of the winchester slam through the ridge of bone that he had instead of front teeth and drive all the way to the back of his mouth get rocked i said and pulled the trigger along with the caliber bullet i sent a column of pure energy and will surging down the barrel and into the walkers skull his head exploded literally exploded into streamers and gobbets of black ichor his cloak of rags went mad throwing the headless body into the air and sending it thrashing through the shallow water like a halfsquashed bug dark vapor began issuing from the frantically twitching bodythen suddenly gathered into a single cloud all in a rush and shot away emitting a furious and agonized and terrorized scream as it went alien but unmistakable then the body went limp in the water the cloak continued flopping and thrashing for a few seconds before it too went still a unified howl of dismay rose from the surface of the lake from the outsiders and vshaped wakes appeared on the surface retreating from the island in every direction chased by flickering spears of light and musicand the horns of the hunt began to blare in a frenzy ringing up from the waters quivering surface i saw a massive blackandwhite form seize a fleeing outsider and roll while a shadowmasked rider lashed out over and over with a long spear in another place a shark exploded from the waves hanging against the sky for a second jaws gaping before plunging down directly atop another outsider driving it beneath the waves where a dozen wickedly sharp fins abruptly converged the woods stirred behind me and murphy came panting out of them her p hanging from its sling she came to my side staring at the chaos i couldnt blame her it was horrible it was unique it was glorious it was suddenly it felt like my heart had stopped it was distracting molly i screamed molly mac heard me through that mess and shook molly when she didnt react he grimaced and then delivered a short sharp smack to her cheek she gasped and blinked her eyes and the sky show and sound track abruptly vanished right in the middle of the guitar solo get them out of the water i screamed get onto the shore hurry molly blinked at me several times then she seemed to get it and nodded her head quickly she and mac hurried down to the beetles slanted deck to the door to below she called out and sarissa and justine appeared both looking terrified molly pointed them at the island and the three jumped from the ship to the waistdeep water and started wading ashore mouse caught what was happening and let out a short sharp bark mouse doesnt bark often but when he does he can make bits of spackle fall from the ceiling he and thomas plunged from the bloodied deck of the barge into the water and began swimming swiftly toward the island the cries of the hunt and frantic outsiders filled the air now and even as they did i forced myself to calm my thoughts to take slow breaths to focus on my intellectus of the island i couldnt sense anything specifically but an instinct dragged my chin around turning me to stare up toward the crest of the island where the old ruined lighthouse stood among the skeletal forms of the lateautumn trees then it hit me i shouldnt have been able to see the lighthouse or the trees from down here not on a cloudy night but their silhouettes were clear there was light up there and as my friends reached the shore and hurried over to me i realized that there was an empty place in my awareness of the island i would never have sensed it if i hadnt been looking i couldnt feel anything from around the top of the hill the walker was just the distraction i breathed dammit theyre not pulling that same trick on me this time i turned to them and said i think someones up at the top of the hill and whatever theyre doing it aint good stay right behind me come on i was pretty sure i knew who was up there and i wasnt about to do this alone so i started toward the top of the hill taking the agonizingly slow route that i knew would enable my friends to keep up with me chapter fortysix whoever was up at the top of the hill had things ready to stop me from getting there it didnt work out well for them i knew about the trip lines that had been strung up between the trees at ankle level and knew where the gaps weremore harassmentlevel opposition from the enemy little folk i was guessing the people with me didnt even realize that there were any trip lines after that was a trio of particularly viciouslooking fae hounds the little cousins of black dogs i had taken a black dog on once in my calmer days and didnt care for a rematch i clipped one of the hounds with a shot from the winchester while it was crouching in the brush ahead waiting for me to come a few steps closer and i set on fire a thicket where another one hid before we got within thirty feet ambush predators become unnerved when their wouldbe prey spots them fae hound number three hustled out of a hollow log where hed been planning to rush out and attack with his buddies and retreated with the two wounded hounds to the far side of the island how did they get on the island molly asked as we kept moving she was breathing hard both from her efforts on the lake and from the hike up i thought it kept everyone away demonreach was meant to keep things in not out but i didnt want to blab about that in front of mixed company it encourages everyone to stay away and turns up the heat slowly for anyone who doesnt i said back but thats when it isnt being attacked by an army of cultists and a horde of howling freaks from beyond reality it was busy making sure none of the outsiders could come up onto shoreand none of them could it just outmuscled an army led by something that could go toetotoe with mab everything has its limits i checked with my intellectus and realized that mac and sarissa were bringing up the rear that wouldnt do i still didnt know the role they were playing in this game mouse i called take rear guard in case those hounds circle around and try to sneak up on us the big furball made a huffing sound an exhalation somewhere between a bark and a sneeze but chewier heh chewie i reminded myself to keep track of mac and sarissa as we went but i felt better once mouse was back there intellectus was handy as a reference guide but not as an earlywarning system if either of them tried anything shady the shaggy tibetan guardian was probably the one most likely to notice first anyway might as well have him close whos up there karrin asked her voice low and tense faerie queens i think plural whoa thomas said why complicated no time i said no one does anything until i do dont even talk if the balloon goes up go after whoever i light up first after that improvise then i continued increasing the pace a little the trees near the crown of the island were older thicker and taller the spreading canopy of their branches had shaded out most of the brush beneath them and the ground was easier to move across being mostly an irregular soggy carpet of years and years worth of fallen leaves the scent of molds was thick as we went through disturbing them we emerged into the clearing at the top of the hill and i stopped in my tracks six inches before i would have come out of the shadow of the forest thomas bumped into me i looked partly over my shoulder with a little push of air through my teeth he elbowed me in the lower back the hilltop had been closed in a circle of starlight i didnt know how else to describe it i didnt know what i was looking at twelve feet off the ground was a band of illumination glowing rather than glaring something that filled the hilltop with gentle light like an enormous ring floating above the earth it was of precise width as if drawn with a compass and i knew that it was exactly one foot thicktwelve inches the color was something i had never seen before changing subtly moment to moment holding silver and blue and gold but it wasnt any of those things and and words fail but it was beautiful like love like music like truth something that passed through the eyes and plunged straight to the soul gentle softly glowing light slid from the outer edge of the circle like a sheet of water from an elegant fountain falling to the ground in a slowmotion liquid curtain of pure light hiding what was behind it i felt the grasshopper move up beside me her eyes wide boss she whispered this would make my mom talk in her church voice what are we looking at merlins work i think i breathed that circle i think its part of the islands architecture wow i its beautiful sarissa murmured ive never seen anything like it and ive been looking at incredible things my whole life i spoke something i was certain was true in the same moment that i understood it it had to be beautiful it had to be made from beauty there is too much ugly inside for it to be made of anything else what do you mean ugly karrin asked her voice hushed later i said i shook my head and blinked my eyes several times city to save i tried to find something about the circle in my intellectus but i had apparently already learned everything i could learn about it that way i knew its exact dimensions i knew it was part of the structure of the massive spell that made the well exist and that was it it was like the entire thing had been classified top secret needtoknow onlyand apparently i didnt need to know which i supposed made sense we were talking about a massive security system molly stooped and picked up a rock she gave it a gentle underhand toss at the wall of light and it passed through without making a ripple safe she asked i doubt it give me something that isnt a part of the island i said i heard her slip her backpack off her shoulder and open a zipper then she touched my arm and passed me a granola bar wrapped in plastic i tossed it at the wall and when it touched it was destroyed it didnt go violently it simply became a flicker of softly glowing light in the precise shape of the bar of food then it was gone that also was pretty thomas noted in a completely lethal kind of way look whos talking molly said its not all that high he said maybe i could jump it molly i said she passed me another granola bar and i threw it over the wall the wall destroyed it in midair maybe not thomas said okay karrin said so how do we get through it i thought about it for a second then i licked my lips and said we dont i do alone thomas said sort of defeats the point of bringing us also death bad plan i think it will let me through i said you think look i said me and the island are kind of partners oh right thomas said he looked at karrin and said harrys a geosexual karrin arched an eyebrow and gave me a look you cant go alone molly said her voice worried looks like its the only way i can go i said so we do this ulyssesstyle i go in i figure a way to let down the gate and then we sack troy can you do that karrin asked i licked my lips and looked at the wall of light id better be able to youre tired molly said im fine your hands are shaking were they they were they are fine also i didnt feel tired given how much magic id been throwing around this day i should have been comatose with fatigue hours ago but i just didnt feel it that wasnt a good sign maybe butters had been right no matter how much juice i got from the mantle of winter bodies have limits i was pushing mine i passed the winchester to thomas and took off my new duster at his lifted eyebrow i said not of the island hold em for me he exhaled and took them no reruns okay pfft i said be like sneaking into the movies karrin touched my arm just dont say that youll be right back youll jinx it i am a professional wizard i said i know all about jinxes having said that i checked to make sure my shirt wasnt red it wasnt then i realized i was putting this off because if i was wrong i was about to go join yoda and obiwan in bluelight country so i took a deep breath and strode forward into the beautiful deadly barrier chapter fortyseven i lived just in case anyone was wondering i stepped through and the liquid light poured over me like warm syrup there was a little bit of a tingle as it passed over the surface of my body and then it was gone as were my clothes like completely i had sort of hoped that they would staythe way supermans unitard stays mostly invincible because its really close to his skin plus i hadnt felt like stripping in front of everyone for something so relatively trivial as preserving my garagesale wardrobe and more important i didnt think i had time to start playing mr rogers while someone screwed around with my island city to save check out my focus of course going into battle full commando could be problematic on the other hand every single time mab had come at me during my recoveryevery timeid been just like this without resources of any kind except what i carried within me i wasnt a big believer in coincidence had she been trying only to strengthen me generally or had she been preparing me for this exact situation could mab see that far ahead or was this simply a case of superior preparedness proving itself in action what was it id heard in a martial arts studio at some point learn to fight naked and you can never be disarmed which is fine i guess as long as there arent mosquitoes i got low and stayed still and opened my senses first thing i was inside a ritual circle one that was currently functioning being used for a spell it wasnt the cheap and quick kind i was used to i guessed or it would have been broken when i crossed it maybe it had kept its integrity because as part of the island i already existed on either side of the circle there were certain creatures who could move back and forth across boundaries like that without disturbing them in the slightestmost notably the common cat it was one reason practitioners so often kept cats as house pets from a technical standpoint they are very magicfriendly maybe i hadnt broken it because it had been set up in such a way as to consider the islands warden one of those creatures or maybe it was the continual rippling liquid nature of the circle itself whatever the case i was standing inside an active circle possibly the most active circle i had ever seen magic hummed through the air and the ground so much that i felt my hair standing on end and some primitive instinctlevel awareness from the winter knights mantle the same part that had given me so much trouble all day started advising me to get the hell out of there along with the rest of the islands animals that was why my intellectus hadnt been able to tell me what was happening here as a form of magical awareness an active circle had blocked my intellectus out now it worked just fine for what was inside the circleit was everything outside of it that it could no longer touch i learned all of that at the same time my regular old five senses registered what was happening i was not alone the crown of the hill was covered with faeries all right that wasnt literally true there were twenty of them plus one other mortal and demonreach the islands spirit made manifest stood in the ruins of the lighthouse in the opening in the wall that led to the entrance to the stairs down to the well its vast form was planted braced like a man standing against a strong wind hunched bent forward slightly but not in a stance of battle the spirit did not exist for such things instead i realized it did only what it always had it endured but even as i watched i saw bits of demonreach flying backward away from its mass but slowly as if a current of thick syrup flowed past the spirit slowly wearing it away the spirit stood at one point of an equilateral triangle at one of the other points stood lily the summer lady she stood with her right arm the arm that projects energy upraised she wore the same simple dress id seen her in earlier it was pressed against the front of her body and her silverwhite hair was blown back as if in a strong wind there was no visible display of energy coming from her other than that but the ground between her and demonreach was covered in fresh green grass and i could feel that she was pouring out power against spirit behind her stood a pair of sidhe of the summer court each with a hand on her shoulder behind them were three more and four more were behind them each with their hands on the shoulder of someone in front of them forming a pyramid shape they were all projecting power forward focusing it through lily making her even stronger than she already was maeve stood at the third point of the triangle with her own pyramid of supporters she wore leather shortshorts military boots and a bikini top all of midnight blue she stood in the same stance as lily the same unseen power flaring from her outstretched hand but her face was set in a wide manic smile and the ground between her and demonreach was covered in a layer of frost the redcap stood at her right hand one hand on her shoulder the massive rawhead from my birthday party was there too and its bony claws drenched in and dripping fresh blood rested on her other shoulder eight other winter sidhe were behind them forming a power pyramid of their own then i heard footsteps and a second later fix the summer knight stepped around the corner of my partially completed cottage and walked toward me he was wearing faerie mail gleaming draping over a wiry hardmuscled frame and he carried his sword in his hand fix stopped between me and the triangle at the top of the hill hey harry he said quietly hey fix cold not so much you know whats happening here what must happen he said according to whom my lady shes wrong fix stood there for a time quiet then he said doesnt matter why not because she is my lady you will not raise your hand against her i stared at fix who had suffered under the office of lloyd slate and behind him at lily who had been slates frequent victim i wondered how many times back then fix had ached to be able to save her to have the power to stand up to the winter knight and now he did there comes a time when no amount of talk can change the course of eventswhen people are committed when their actions are dictated by the necessity of the situation their choices have created fix had put his faith in lily and would fight to the death to defend her nothing i had to say would change that i could see that in his face go back he said cant stand aside cant so its like that i said fix exhaled then he nodded yeah and for the first time in a decade the winter knight and summer knight went to war fix hurled a bolt of pure summer fire that scorched the ground beneath it as it flew at me i didnt have time to think but some part of me knew this game dodging the bolt wouldnt be enoughthe bloom of heated air coming off that fire would burn me if it even came close that was why fix would have the advantage in this match if he kept the distance open and just threw bolt after bolt so i called upon winter to chill the air around me as i ducked to one side fire and cold met clashed and filled the air with mistmist that would give me the chance to close to grips with my foe part of me the part of me that i was sure was me viewed these tactics with alarm i was freaking naked and unarmed fix had the mantle of the summer knight and it made him just as strong and fast and tough as i was he was armored and toted a freaking sword and hed had ten years of training with the summer court to learn how to fight and use the mantle plus he presumably hadnt spent all day pushing his abilities to the limit but the winter mantle didnt care about that it simply saw its enemy and wanted to destroy it the best way to do that was to get in close and rip out fixs throat except that wasnt how the last winter knight had killed the last summer knight lloyd slate had iced the stairs underneath the other guys feet and pushed him down and slate had been young and in good shape whereas the other summer knight had been an old man so i thought it would be smart to assume that the instinctual knowledge of the winter mantle while it could be handy was basically that of a starving predator a wolf in winterit wanted blood lots of it now and if i played it like that fix was going to leave my guts on the ground instead of charging ahead i veered to one side for several steps and then froze an instant later another bolt of fire lit up the mist right through where i would have been if id followed the mantles instinct of courseit had to be that way winters knight was the mountain lion the wolf summers was the stag the bison winter was oriented to stalking hunting and killing prey summer to avoiding a confrontation until an advantage could be had then savagely pressing that advantage for all it was worth fix would have a wealth of instinctive knowledge to draw on if i went after him winters way and would be at his most dangerous the same way as for example a student of pure aikido he would use the strength of an attack to assist his own defense turning it back on the attacker but if i didnt give him that kind of aggressive assault i would rob him of his instinctive advantage screw being the winter knight before everything else i was a wizard so i flicked my wrist whispered obscurata and vanished behind a veil my veils arent much good compared to the grasshoppers or almost anyone elses really but when youre standing in a giant fog bank they dont need to be very good to make you effectively invisibleand i know how to move very quietly i wouldnt have trusted them against one of the sidhe but fix wasnt one he was a changeling with one mortal parent and one fae one but except for the summer mantle he was as human as the next guy i prowled ahead listening sharpening the acuity of my ears to a far greater level than that of which they were normally capable and heard fixs smooth breathing before id taken a dozen steps i froze in place i couldnt locate him exactly but i kept myself from making an impatient sound and consulted my intellectus fix was standing thirtysix feet four inches away about twentytwo degrees to the left of the way my nose was facing if id had a gun i was pretty sure i could have shot him fix had frozen in place too bah his mantle was probably advising him to be patient just as mine was screaming at me to stop waiting stalk him and pounce i took advantage of it for maybe a minute consulting my intellectus and moving fifty feet to one side where i could pick something up off the ground then i went back and waitedbut he still hadnt stirred this wouldnt work if he stood his ground i had to make him move i retreated a few more steps into the mist and spoke away from him hoping the lousy visibility and my veil would confuse the exact origin of my voice i get lloyd slate a little better now you know i said the mantle it drove him made him want things lloyd slate was a monster came fixs voice i hated to do it but i had to push his buttons he was as human as the next man i said it just made his desires louder and louder there wasnt anything he could have done about it do you hear yourself harry fix called there was an edge in his voice you sound like a man making excusesor justifications yeah but im not slate i shot back my voice hotter slate was some pathetic bully i had as much power as a hundred slates way before i cut his throat fixs breathing came faster he had it under controlbut he was scared the harry dresden i knew never would have said something like that that was ten years a persecution complex and a war ago fix i told him and you havent got room to get all righteous with me i know youre feeling things too just like i am time to sink the right barb to goad him into movement aggression what do you see when you look at lily man shes gorgeous i have a hard time thinking about anything else when shes there shut up he said in a quiet voice seriously i continued the dialogue came easilytoo easily the winter mantle was talking to a part of me that did not have much in the way of restraint that hot little ass i mean gosh just thinking about it if you could see me now id be a little embarrassed shut up he said again come on bros before hos man that summer mantle got a herd instinct going cause for something as sweet as that im thinking we could share i if my intellectus hadnt been focused on him to let me see what was coming id have been burned alive i flung myself to one side as he turned and hurled another bolt of fire at me i had to gather more winter around myself to protect my vulnerable hide thickening the mists even moreand fix seemed to key on the surge of cold he pivoted toward me took two steps and leapt with his sword held in both hands thirtyseven feet that was how far he jumped and it had come effortlesslyhe could have done more i knew exactly how much force he pressed the ground with when he left it exactly what angle hed jumped at my intellectus could track the air and the mist he was displacing as he leapt through it i took two steps away just as he leapt i felt sick like i was fighting a blind man fix landed exactly two feet short of where id been and his sword came down through the space where id been standing if id still been there he would have split me into two gruesome halves but i wasnt i was standing behind him within inches of his back and before he could rise i struck a moment before id used my intellectus to locate an old nail on the ground about four inches long partly coated in rust thomas or i must have dropped it while walking to or from the cottage back when wed been beginning repairs on it and building the whatsup dock the nail had lain out through several seasons only lightly touched by them i put my thumb behind its head used the strength of the winter mantle and drove it straight through mail that had never been designed to stop such a small point and two inches into the muscle of fixs shoulder blade fix let out a scream of shock and pain and swung his sword at mebut with cold steel piercing his skin and his access to the summer mantle disrupted he had only his own reflexes strength and skill to rely on he hadnt trained in them without the power of the summer knight to back them up and he hadnt learned in the brutal school of hard knocks that mab had put me through the swords slash was slowed and clumsy and i struck him twiceonce on the wrist breaking it with a clear snap sending the sword tumbling away and once on the jaw not quite as hard sending fix to the ground in a senseless heap knight takes knight i called into the cloudy night air check the struggle between the queens and demonreach had already been a silent one but now the air abruptly went still i couldnt see them but i knew that lily had turned her body partly away from demonreach toward me breaking her connection with one of the two sidhe supporting her demonreach for its part had altered its facing to square off against maeve i could sense that the little bits of its body that had been eroding away were now moving in the opposite direction reaccruing to its main mass fix the summer lady called her voice vaguely confused then it was touched by sudden cold fear fix what are you doing maeve snarled you stupid cow i cannot defeat the guardian alone lily ignored her i sensed her move her hand an almost absent gesture and a sudden wind brushed the fog fix and i had created from the hilltop as easily as a young mother sweeping fallen cheerios from a toddlers tray holy crap i knew the ladies were powerful but i hadnt realized what that meant in practical terms making that much air move that precisely and that suddenly is hard and it would take a serious investment of energy to make it happen i could have done it but it would have been enough heavy lifting to make me want a cold beer and a nice sitdown when i was finished if id had to do it two or three times in a row id have been too tired to lift the beer lily had done it with a comparative flick of her fingers and there i was standing naked on the hilltop over the unmoving form of fix i still had my veil up but it was so rudimentary as to be useless against someone as savvy as the sidhe i shouldnt have bothered to hold on to it at all but some irrational instinct made me condense it instead to a small field of blurry energy around my hips hes alive lily i said quickly we need to talk the whites showed all the way around lilys eyes what she demanded fury swelling in her tone what did you say to me whoa on my worst diplomatic day i still shouldnt have garnered a reaction like that from what id said lily calm down fix is alive but i think youre still you over there and i dont think youve been given the whole truth lets talk before things happen that everyone regrets how dare you she snarled her rage turning incandescent literally fire burst from her hands and wreathed her forearms how dare you i held up my own hands in front of me empty i was pretty sure i looked confused hells bells lily what the hell i do not want a fight here lily screamed and summer fire engulfed her causing her courtiers to leap away gold and green and starlight silver the fire danced around her mesmerizingand swelling suddenly i saw the same rage that id seen in titanias eyes but that had been the smoldering coals left over after the passing of years after mourning and grief had eased the power lily held on to now came from the same kind of passionbut it was fresh and whitehot and it wasnt going to cool anytime soon then i realized what was going on maeve had extended her other hand toward me and her fingers were dancing merrily she gave me the briefest flash of a look and it was poisonously amused i reached into the air in front of me and felt it there an elegant little glamour simple enough that maeve could have done it in her sleep complex enough to slip by anyone not looking for it even one of the sidhe id been talking but it hadnt been my words getting to lily maeve had chosen my words for me i dont know what shed said but shed picked something exactly right to drive her summer counterpart mad with rage lilys gentler more compassionate nature had been used against her maeve had employed her simple little glamour with exquisite timing at the one instant when there was no way the relatively inexperienced lily would have expected itwhen she was full of concern for the fallen fix with a sinking feeling i realized that the passionate young lady of summer was no titania she had all the heat but none of the restraint the balance and there was no way in hell that she was going to be able to think to reason to hold back her fury destroy him she screamed trees shook and rocks cracked as she spoke the sound of it ripped at my ears and i felt a sudden hot wetness in them destroy harry dresden she threw forth her hands and a wall of fire twenty feet high and as wide as a football field roared toward me chapter fortyeight for a fraction of a second my brain squealed like the last little piggy running all the way home a spinallevel fear reaction i had an experience with fire once its the kind of memory that sticks pretty hard fires tough to defend against thats one of the reasons its always been my favorite form of attack even if you dont actually set your target on fire you can still roast it by heating up the air around it unless it just throws away everything to get out of your way in which case it isnt thinking about doing anything back to you as weapons go fire is topdrawer but fires tricky and fickle without focus its just chaos the random release of stored chemical energy it isnt enough to just have fire youve got to know when and where and how to use it to best effectand lily didnt i threw myself down over the unconscious fix and focused thrusting my hands out to either side shouting defendarius as i formed a shield around us in a bubble the firestorm roared down onto us washing over us like an ocean tide my shield held the fire back but it couldnt stop it entirely and heat began to burn through that was why i reached for winter and filled the little bubble around us with the cold that wave of fire was too massive for me to overcomebut i didnt have to overcome it it was spread out over such a huge area that all i had to do was beat a relatively tiny portion of it to hold out against it like a large stone on a beach i didnt have the strength to beat itbut i did have the strength to hold it away and to keep just the air within my shield from becoming an oven the fire washed over us and i held on to the shield for a few seconds more as long as i thought i could without my bracelet or my staff to help direct the energy a few seconds were all i could dobut it was enough to survive it left me on my hands and knees gasping on a small circle of frostcovered earth but i made it and so did fix go me maeves mocking laughter rang out over the hilltop hot air touched the side of my face and grew gently along with an approaching light i looked up to see lily walking toward me over the scorched earth naked now but for the flames curling around her body her own clothing burned away in the firestorm her eyes werent there there were only a pair of searing fires burning where they had been wisps of orange and scarlet flame rising up from them as she came closer her silken white hair rose into a wavering column like a flame itself lifted by the hot air and colored golden green and orange by the light of her fiery nimbus behind her the other summer sidhe were shadows with fire dancing in the reflection of silvery weapons and with the echoes of it flickering in their hands and upon their brows power and weapons alike spreading out around me to leave me no escapebut at the flick of a hand from lily they stopped and withdrew back to their original positions near the tower i guessed that she didnt want to incinerate her summer buddies along with me i started to lift my hand to ready another shield but my other arm couldnt take the weight of my body and i nearly collapsed that was it then i was out of gas i managed to get myself up onto my knees and sat back on my heels panting then i tugged the nail out of fixs back gripped it grimly and faced lily she stopped about six feet away from me covered in living fire and stared down her eyes like spotlights hes okay lily i said fix is okay god lily can you even hear me evidently she could not lily lifted a hand and a minuscule sphere of whitehot light formed in the air above it a tiny star now there that was focus i couldnt have stopped something that concentrated without a major amount of preparation i could appreciate it in a professional sense even if it was about to kill me horribly and suddenly i felt very stupid what the fuck had i been thinking the queens of faerie even the least of them were elemental powers something that was simply out of the league of any mortal i should have tried to contact my grandfather and the grey council should have at least put out a scream to the white council even if they were less likely to help and i should have sent michael and his familyand maggieout of town the second id realized the danger id saved the day before maybe often enough to make me overconfident i sneer about the white council being arrogant all the time but id walked into the exact same stupid trap hadnt i confident of my ability to handle anything that came along id gathered together my little band of enablers and cruised right into this disaster lily i said wearily listen to me weve both been set up by maeve white fire stared at me the adversary i said its in her its been in her for a long time think it makes the things it takes act against their natures and you know what its done for maeve i leaned forward holding my weary hands palms up its let her lie she can lie her ass off and never blink an eye think how much of your trust in her of your awareness of whats going on in the world is based on knowing that she cant speak an untruth fire staredand did not consume me so i kept talking dont take me at my word i said just look at what she is doing and lily spoke her voice burning with the unleashed power of summer we are working together we are destroying the largest source of dark energy and corruption in this world the source you are so desperate to protect that you call outsiders to defend it oh god lily didnt know what was in the well she understood that it was a source of dark energy but not why i kept forgetting that she had had the job for only a comparatively tiny amount of time before id killed aurora and left poor lily holding the mantle of the summer lady shed been a young woman no older than molly only without mollys skills and training shed been putting her life back together while dealing with the massive power of her mantle taking a crash course in faerie leadership struggling to learn and if someone had been there to feed her lies as part of her basic education in the supernatural someone whose word she had trusted god only knew how much her knowledge had been twisted and colored who told you i called up outsiders i asked maeve so arrogant lily said you reek of arrogance and deception like all wizards even the famous merlin who built this abomination her eyes narrowed but as complex as it is it is still made of mortal magic this circle that we used to stop your interferenceits a part of the architecture here all we had to do was feed power into it to close this place against your allies while we tore it down from inside if you keep going i told her you are going to destroy yourself lily and everyone you brought with you and a lot of innocent people are going to die finish it lily maeve called i told you they would lie mortals always lie and that is why we must stand together we cannot allow ourselves to be divided put him down and we will complete what we have begun lily please i said dont take my word for it dont believe me but be certain find out for yourself then youll know you dont have to do this the summer fire vanished abruptly lily stood over me her hair mussed her naked body so beautiful it hurt she spoke in a quiet dreadfully numb voice you cant tell me that she said not you do you think i wanted this do you think i wanted pain and death and fear and war do you think i wanted this mantle this responsibility her eyes welled though her expression didnt change i didnt want the world i didnt want vast riches or fame or power i wanted a husband children love a home that we made together and that can never happen now the tears fell and as the heat the fury came back into her voice the fire gathered around her again because of you because you killed aurora because you made me into this you raise your hand against my champion my friend and when you are defeated you dare tell me what i must and must not do lily please i said you have a choice maeve was laughing again in the background an arkham asylum kind of laugh that echoed across the bare burned ground now lily said her burning voice bitter now you give me a choice the ministar flared to life in her palm again thus do i choose you son of a bitch knight of winter burn and die i got it i think or at least i got most of it lily had spent her life a victim because of her luminous beauty lloyd slate had been the last man to abuse her but i doubted he was the first all her life she had been shut away from making choices but she clearly had not wanted to be part of the world of faerie as a changeling she could have chosen to become a full faerie being at any timeand she hadnt then when i killed aurora i had even taken the choice to remain human away from her i hadnt meant to do that when i killed aurora but that fact made no difference in the outcome i hadnt just killed aurora that night in many ways id effectively killed lily too id thrown her into a world where she was lost and afraid a grieving and furious titania had doubtless not been the supportive mentor figure lily had needed and even if shed been a newly minted immortal she must have been horribly angry and sad and afraidand lonely easy prey for maeve easy prey for nemesis i wasnt sure whether there was anything about that entire situation that i could have changed even if id known that it needed changing but i still felt like i was the one at fault maybe i was it had been my choice that changed everything maybe it was fitting that lily kill me in turn her fiery eyes seared into mine as she launched the little star at my heart chapter fortynine there was a flash of silver and the little star bounced off of the mirrorbright flat of fixs long sword it soared into the earth a dozen yards away and hit the ground with a flash and a howl of heated air creating a brief column of white flame that presumably had been intended to replace my head and neck fix was holding himself up on one elbow and held the sword in his left hand he looked like hell but he made a single deft rolling motion and came onto his feet as if he didnt weigh anything and he came to his feet between lily and me lily fix said what is wrong with you eyes of flame regarded him you youre all right i said that i said my voice might have squeaked a little my heart rate was up harry shut up fix said lily look at him he isnt a threat to anyone i guess i must have looked kind of bad but still hey i said fix twitched his hips and kicked me in the chest it wasnt hard but in my condition it didnt need to be it knocked me over sir knight lily said i fix it burns stop this he urged quietly lets get out of here find someplace quiet for you to meditate until youve got it under control again i need to he tried to hurt you fixs voice hardened the ground is burned black lily he said and theres frost all over my mail there are burns all over his arms and shoulders but i wake up fine lying in the only grass left on the hilltop he held up his sword the last six inches or so of the blade were simply gone ending in a melted mess the point must have been lying outside the area my shield had covered but it was hot enough to do this forget what anyone said who was protecting me lily she stared at fix the furious fire still curling around her lifting her hair burning from her eyes then she closed them with a groan and the fires went out lily turned her head sharply away from me this is too much i heard her whisper im going to fly apart my lady fix asked lily made a snarling sound turning eyes that still flickered with embers toward me stay where you are sir knight she said spitting the last word if you move or lift weapon or power against our purpose i will not show mercy a second time then she turned and swept back toward the pyramid formation of sidhe assaulting demonreach her feet left clear imprints in the soot and ash on the ground and little fires flickered up in the wake of her steps dying away again when she had passed she did not say a word just lifted her hand and again something like an invisible sandblaster started pouring into demonreach i watched too drained to move more i did i noted have burns on my arms i didnt feel them they didnt look like anything epic but they were there fix i said thank you he looked at me his expression guarded but nodded his head slightly it seemed i was in your debt winter his eyes sparkled just for a second couldnt have that i found myself laughing weakly no no it might break something it broke my damned wrist he snorted my jaw isnt happy either good punch i cheated i said our business theres no such thing he said i should have known you were goosing me talking like that most of the fighting ive done there hasnt been much in the way of taunt and insult raise your standards theres almost always time for an insult or two he smiled though it was a bit pained he waggled the fingers of his right hand experimentally are you done i exhaled slowly and didnt answer how much of what you told her is true he asked what did you hear i asked him pretty much everything after you took the knife out of me nail i corrected him and held it up so he could see it still had his blood on it he looked a little pained harry would you mind no i said and wiped the blood into the earth scrubbing it off the nail thanks he said he squinted at the wall and then at me how the hell did you get in here trade secrets i said how did you guys get here i know you didnt take a boat flew in fix said shapeshifters i dropped from a hang glider over the lake and parachuted in damn you got extreme im getting there he said so you landed here and put the circle up trade secrets he said cautiously you realize we still arent sitting in the same dugout right i can do the frenemies thing its kind of traditional but we are not on the same side no youre on the wrong side i said maybe more than one thats what every conflict sounds like he said not everyone can be equally right harry but believe you me everyone can be equally wrong i said fix this is about more than winter and summer he frowned at that tell me this i said im not asking for anything specific anything that i might be able to use against you later as if maeve would let me have a later just tell me has maeve ever asked you to take something at her word and just told you something was true straight up fixs frown deepened and you thought to yourself hey thats odd she never just tells anyone anything straight up his lips parted slightly and his eyes fixed on maeve and you thought that if anyone but one of the ladies had said it you would wonder if she was lying but she didnt leave any wiggle room so it had to be the truth so he asked very quietly so let me ask you this i said if you assume that she can lie even if it was just that oncehow does it change the picture fix might have had some foolish idealism going but hed never been anywhere close to stupid oh he breathed um remember when lily opened the door to arctis tor for us back when sure when we got inside the leanansidhe was popsicled in mabs garden i said because something had invaded her and influenced her actions mab was in the middle of some kind of exorcism based on the model of an ice age and and what if this invader got into the water before mab caught it i asked what if it got into maeve thats crazy he said mabs the one whos gone mental is she i asked him is it so crazy remember that meeting at macs remember how we found out that mab had cracked a gasket maeve told he stopped speaking suddenly yeah i said a minute ago you told lily to ignore the words and look at the actions you know as well as i do which speaks louder you know who i am and what ive done so im going to ask one more question i said whose idea was it to be here tonight lilys or maeves the blood drained from his face oh fuck i bowed my head then i said fix i saved you because youre a decent guy and i dont care if were on different teams i dont want you dead yeah he said quietly it speaks pretty loud but maybe you knew id think that maybe you did it so that you could play me maybe youre giving me way more credit for cunning than im due you know how i work how often do i get to a neat elegant solution that ties everything up can you look at me right now and honestly say to yourself dresden that wily genius this must be a part of his master plan i spread my hands and looked up at him expectantly fix looked at me dirty naked shivering burned bruised covered in soot and ash fuck he said again and looked back at the ladies i dont think maeve did anything to lilys head i said i dont think she needed to i think lily was insecure and lonely enough that all maeve needed to do was act sort of like a person give lily someone who she felt understood what she was going through someone she thought would have her back a friend fix said yes everyone wants to have a friend he said quietly is that so bad thelma and louise were friends i said i pointed at the triangle canyon the muscles along his jaw jumped several times even if even if youre being honest and youre rightand im not copping to eitherso what those coteries with them are their inner circles theyll obey without question youve got nothing left to fight with and i sure as hell cant take them all on alone i didnt want to say it to give away anything to a potential enemy nemesis could have taken fix for all i knew it could be there inside him right then smirking at the rapport it was establishing with me that was the ugly fact but sometimes you have to ignore the math and and follow the wisdom of your heart my heart told me that fix was a decent guy fix i know about this island its kind of my stomping grounds thats how i got through and i know that if maeve has her way this island is going mount saint helens and taking chicago with it he stared at me frowning pensive my daughter is in town i said in a whisper shell die he blinked you have a then he rocked back a little as he realized what id entrusted him with oh christ dresden i took a deep breath and pressed on the hunt is out there taking it to the outsiders right now i said and theyre winning and my crew is here outside the circle murphy molly thomas mouse if i can take the circle down we arent alone when did we happen he asked in a flat hard tone i looked up at him and saw laughter at the corners of his eyes sometimes the wisdom of the heart is not at all a bad thing i wont let anything hurt lily he said for any reason period agreed i said maeves the bad guy he tested his right hand again and got a little more motion out of it before he winced i dont know where this will get you he said but as far as i could tell this was just a ritual circle like any other how so when we landed maeve sent some hounds and some little folk after you and went straight for that lighthouseand the guardian just popped up out of the ground where it is now maeve assaulted the spirit just like right now she kept it busy while lily walked a circle of the hilltop singing ive seen her set up circles like that a thousand times but once shed gone all the way around kaboom up came the wall i grunted then its a preinstalled defense that can be triggered like hells bells not like a ward it is a ward a huge one but if anything of the island passes through the circle without disturbing it and anything that isnt of the island is destroyed i followed the logic through and sagged what fix asked then theres no way to break the circle i breathed its like a timelock safe it isnt coming down until sunrise meaning what i swallowed sunrise was too late so i gathered whatever scraps of strength i had left in me and pushed myself slowly wearily to my feet meaning i said were on our own fix eyed the center of the clearing he passed me a silvery knife he drew from his belt and said there you go with that we again chapter fifty i started walking it was iffy for a couple of steps but i got the hang of it is there a plan fix asked keeping up with me maeve i kill her which had been mabs freaking order in the first place he glanced aside you know shes an immortal right yeah his eyes narrowed what do i do theyve got the guardian pinned down i said i think one of those crews has got to stay on it or it will break loose otherwise maeve would have been stomping on me right next to lily fix nodded she never passes up the chance to tear the wings off a fly he frowned what happens if the guardian gets loose i wasnt sure demonreach had enormous power an absolute dedication to purpose and no sense of proportion i had very little idea of its tactical capabilities it might or might not be able to help in a fight actually i was sort of hoping it wouldntimagine trying to kill specific ants in a crowd of ants with a baseball bat i was pretty sure that if demonreach ever started swinging at someone i wanted to be over the horizon at the very least in fact i realized that was probably the problem here demonreach existed on an epic scale it was neither suited to nor capable of effectively dealing with beings of such relative insignificance standing off a walker and a small army of outsiders had not been a huge problem for the island but maeve and lily had slipped inside its guard they and their personal attendants were sparrows attacking an eagle the eagle was bigger and stronger and capable of killing any of them and it didnt matter in the least not only that but demonreach was a genius loci a nature spirit the fae were intimately connected to nature on a level that no one had ever been able to fully understand one could probably make an argument that demonreach was one of the fae or at least a very close neighbor either way the mantles of the ladies of winter and summer would carry a measure of dominion and power over beings like demonreach clearly they were not sovereign over the guardian spirit because it was withstanding them just as clearly they had something going for them because it wasnt trying to crush them either im not sure i answered but the point here is that if we jump maeve lily is going to be too busy keeping a lid on the guardian to get involved the two of us fix said are going to take on all ten of them nah i said i take maeve you get the other nine what if they dont cooperate chastise them fix snorted thatll be quick one way or the other and its going to mean war if the summer knight assaults nobles of the winter court not at all i said they arent nobles theyre outlaws i just outlawed them by the authority invested in me and stuff i also hereby declare us a joint task force were a task force as of now i said fix bobbed his head amiably if we dance fast enough maybe we can sell that then what if were both alive well figure it out we took a few more steps before fix said you cant take maeve wizard not in the shape youre in not even if she was alone no i said i cant but maybe the winter knight could ever since id gotten out of my bed in my quarters in arctis tor id felt the power of the winter mantle inside me and held it back id felt the primal drives that were its power the need to hunt to fight to protect territory to kill winters nature was beautiful violence stark clarity the most feral needs and animal desires and killer instinct pitted against the season of cold and deaththe will and desire to fight to live even when there was no shelter no warmth no respite no hope and no help id fought against that drive repressed it held it at bay that savagery was never meant for a world of grocery stores and electric blankets and peaceable assembly it was meant for times like this so i let winter in and everything changed my weariness vanished not because my body was no longer weary but because my body was no longer importantonly my will my fear vanished too fear was for prey fear was for the things i was about to hunt my doubts vanished as well doubt was for things that did not know their purpose and i knew mine this was a winter matter a faerie matter a family matter and it was precisely correct that only beings of faerie resolve it i knew exactly what i had to do there was a throat that needed ripping harry asked fix uh are you okay i looked aside at him as hunting partners went fix didnt look like much but id seen him in action before he was no one to underestimate and i needed him once i didnt things might change because he was on my island and that wasnt something i could let slide but for now i could do worse than to have him at my side im a little hungry i said and smiled here dont need it i tossed the knife to him point first he caught it deftly by the handle i saw the minor shifts in shadow on his neck as his shoulders tensed up remember youve got iron i didnt sneer at him because what would be the point but i did roll the nail back and forth between my fingers and heard it scraping on ice i looked down and found that ice had condensed out of the water in the air and formed over my fingertips i put the nail between my teeth so that i could hold up my fingers as i watched icicles began to form guided by raw instinct stretching out from my fingertips i flexed my fingers a few times and saw the edges form the ice hard and razor sharp nice i debated armor too too heavy this needed to happen fast besides i wouldnt want the armor to be in the way for what would come after that was going to be the good part time to play i said around the nail i took four steps building up to a run and leapt into the air toward maeve fifty feet no problem it was glorious the freedom the certainty and i could not imagine what had made me so squeamish about embracing winter in the first place bad things kept happening to me it was high fucking time i started happening to them maeve must have sensed something at the last instant despite her focus on demonreach i was a fraction of a second away before she moved with the serpentine quickness of the sidhe throwing herself to one side my claws missed her throat by inches they did slice off one of her dreadlocks and it whirled through the air as i hit the ground legs absorbing the shock as my feet dug into the muddy ground near the lighthouse there was an instant of complete shock from maeves coterie and i used it to slice at the redcaps eyes just as fix landed on the rawheads shoulders and overbore the creature sending it toppling forward to the ground i felt my claws hit the redcap screamed and reeled away from most of the blow darting back brushing past one of the sidhe from the botanic gardens behind him the sidhe had a blank confused look on his face as he tried to fight his way out of the concentration of supporting maeve in her suddenly interrupted spell no time to think claws of bloody ice flashed at him and i opened his throat to the windpipe he went down with a choked scream and i stepped on his chest to fling myself at the two behind him one a twisted figure inside a droopy grey cloak and hood the other a lean gangling thing with the head of a boar covered in tattoos and bone beads i stomped a foot down onto the cloak slammed my clawed hand into the body behind it and ripped out something ropy and hot and slippery the boarheaded thing tore at my body with its tusks and i felt bright distant pain on my ribs i drove a foot up between its legs in a kick that lifted it six inches off the ground and took off an ear and half its face with my claws i sensed fix at my back and heard him grunt down i dropped to my knees and bounced back up again in the time i was down his sword flicked out over my head drove into the chest of the boar thing and whistled out again taking hearts blood with it then there was a roar a sound that came from something truly enormous and someone slammed a tree trunk into my lower back it took me off my feet and sent silver pain through my body i landed in a roll and came up to mostly steady feet one hand supporting some of my weight the other up in a defensive posture it was the rawhead rawheads are parasites creatures that assemble bodies for themselves out of the bone and blood of freshly dead beings they were more common when every farm and village did some slaughtering each day back before grocery stores and fast food as i noted before this one was enormous bigger than a couple of large steers twelve feet tall and weighing at least a ton the cloak had been torn from it and now it looked like a bizarre sculpture of bones of various creatures drenched in fresh blood it had the skull of something big maybe a hippo or a rhino and luminous lights danced in the empty eye sockets it drew in a huge wheezing breath and roared again fix was picking himself up off the ground bounding up as if he hadnt been hurt at allbut the redcap and four other sidhe were stalking toward him with weapons drawn fix faced them squarely blade in hand a small smile on his plain face my my my maeve said she stepped around the leg of the rawhead into sight giving me a frankly appraising stare who would have thought you would dirty up so well wizard i mean the claws the blood the eyes she shivered it gets to me ive always had a thing for bad boys i smiled around the nail funny because ive got something for you too yeah she asked and licked her lips you finally gonna nail me big guy youve been so coy im done teasing i said maeve slipped both hands behind her back arching her body thrusting her chest toward me it wasnt a particularly impressive chest but it was well formed and pale and lovely and hidden beneath entirely too much bikini for my taste a snarl bubbled up out of my throat thats right maeve said her wide eyes unblinking i know what youre feeling the need to fight to kill to take to fuck she took a pair of slow steps toward me making her hips shift back and forth this is right its exactly what you should be feeling i flexed the fingers of my free hand and prepared to strike she just had to come a little closer can you imagine this all the time wizard maeve purred steel began to ring out back where fix was but i ignored it two more steps can you imagine feeling this strong all the time can you imagine being so hungry she took another step and another deep breath and feeding that hunger sating it quenching it in flesh and screams she slid her left hand out from behind her back and ran her palm slowly over her stomach and side this flesh i would not give it to you i would fight dare you to do your worst you could unleash your every aching need and that would just be the beginning i was breathing hard now though i hadnt been a moment before my eyes had locked onto the interplay of muscle and skin over her vulnerable belly the claws would tear through her guts so easily there or i could use my teeth or just my tongue sex and violence maeve purred she had taken a couple more steps toward me but i wasnt sure when or why it mattered hunger and need take me here on this ground dont give me pleasure wizard just take let it out the beast inside you i wish you to i dare you to her fingers popped the snap on the little shorts stop denying yourself stop thinking this feels right hell yeah it did maeve might have been one of the sidhe and fast and have all kinds of magic powers but she wasnt stronger than me once i took her to the ground i could do as i pleased with her i felt my mouth water some might have come out of one corner maeve stepped closer yet and breathed you came for my throat didnt you she let her head tilt bonelessly to one side and slid her hand up her lithe body to push her hair back and away from her neck her hips were making small slow shifts of her weight a constant distraction her throat was lean and lovely here it is come to me my knight its all right let it out and i will make everything worth it her throat i had wanted it for something i thought but now i just wanted that would be how to do it set my teeth on her throat while i took her if she struggledor didnt struggle enoughi would be able to start ripping my way toward the blood this is how it is supposed to be maeve purred knight and lady together fucking like animals taking what we please her mouth turned up into a smile i thought youd never let it in let it in deep where i could touch her lovely face took on a feigned youthful innocence but i can touch it now cant i i growled id forgotten how to do whatever that other thing was all i could think about was the need claim her as a mate take whatever i pleased from her make her mine except wait a fluttering surge of pure terror went through me and it was energy enough to let me rip the winter from my thoughts to push it back it didnt want to go it fought me every inch of the way howling filled with raw lust for flesh and for blood my ribs suddenly ached my head spun a little i suddenly needed that hand on the ground to keep my balance maeve saw it the second i regained control her eyelids lowered almost closed and she breathed ah so close but perhaps there is still time is that your staff wizard or are you just happy to see me i bared my teeth and said maeve this is perfect she said in one night im going to unleash the sleepers slay a starborn put an end to this troublesome mortal city and begin a war between summer and winter by the time the real assault on the gates begins winter and summer will be hunting one another in the night and be so busy gouging out one anothers eyes that theyll never see what is comingall thanks to me and you of course i couldnt have done this at all without you she leaned a little closer as she spoke that last and i ripped at her throat with my ice claws i was exhausted and it was slow entirely lacking in the focused power and precision id felt under the influence of winter she bobbed her head back a fraction of an inch and the swipe missed and sent me down into the dirt maeve let out a little peal of laughter and clapped her hands then she flicked a couple of fingers negligently toward me and said to the rawhead tear him to pieces the rawhead took two lumbering steps forward and reached down toward me with bony bloody claws but before it could grab me there was a rush of footsteps and a fourlegged form consisting entirely of what looked like mud slammed into its rearmost leg the mud creature hit the rawhead hard the power of its impact cracked bones and blew the leg out from beneath the rawhead the fae giant bellowed a groundshaking roar a ton of bloody bones fell and the mud creature white teeth flashing kept after it snarling and a nimbus of blue light gathered around its muddy jaws i looked up to see more mud creatures rushing up the hill though the others were bipedal of various sizes and shapes the first one to reach me drew a steel sword from a muddy scabbard and went after the rawhead as well falcata being used with the brutal power strikes normally employed with a freaking ax silver eyes flashed in the blobby mudcovered face thomas maeve snarled and stepped toward me bringing her right hand out from behind her back she gripped a tiny little automatic in her fingers though god only knew where shed been concealing it she half lifted it but before she could shoot gunshots rang out sharp and clear one of them hit the ground maybe three feet away and maeve bolted aside vanishing behind a veil as she went the smallest mud figure came to my side lowering a mudcovered p she hooked a little hand beneath one of my arms her blue eyes reddened and blinking rapidly with surprising strength she dragged me back from the rawhead while thomas and mouse fought it the others hurried up to join karrin and while karrin covered us muddy mac got a shoulder underneath me and with a grunt of effort picked me up in a firemans carry come on karrin said the cottage while she kept her p at the ready and mac toted me the other two mud figures sarissa and justine hurried along beside us a moment later mac dumped me gently more or less onto the floor of the cottage karrin kept her gun pointed at the door karrin i managed to gasp her eyes didnt waver from the door got tired of waiting on you im here i spit the nail out of my mouth and into my hand how i asked then i eyed them all and said mud you covered yourselves in mud everywhere she confirmed nostrils eyes ears everywhere the light could touch we figured out that if you completely covered something it could make it through that wall god im going to shower for a week oh that was clever the defense mechanism wasnt a thinking being capable of making judgment calls it was simply a machine albeit one made of magic a combination detector and bug zapper by covering themselves with mud theyd tricked it into thinking they were of the island outside the cottage the rawhead bellowed and mouses snarling battle bark rang out defiantly this is insane sarissa breathed the stones of the cottage have protections on them i said not sure how well they work but they should help i looked back at karrin wheres molly out there playing invisible girl there was the sound of a heavy impact and mouse let out a terrible painedsounding yelp then it was quiet karrins breathing started coming faster she resettled her grip on the weapon oh god sarissa said oh god oh god oh god i would have gotten terrified too but i was just too tired for it to stick there was no warning nothing at all the rawhead shoved its arm into the cottage seized karrin by the gun and hauled her out the weapon barked several times as she went and then it got quiet again we have to run sarissa said in a whisper harry please we should run open a way into the nevernever get us out of here ive got a feeling we wouldnt like the part of the nevernever this place borders i said oh sir knight maeve called from outside come out come out wherever you are you and everyone with you or im going to start playing with your friends hey why dont you come in here maeve i called back well talk about it i waited for an answer i got one a minute later karrin let out a pained gasping sound dammit i muttered then i started to climb to my feet again come on what sarissa asked no i cant go out there youre about to i said quietly mac we go out mac said shell kill us if we dont shell kill us anyway starting with karrin i said maeve likes hurting people maybe we can string her along until until what sarissa asked sunrise thats hours away justine put her hand on sarissas shoulder but well stay alive a little longer where theres life theres hope you dont understand sarissa said not for me not for me karrin let out another gasp of pain and i ground my teeth sarissa i said we dont have a choice lily just about roasted the top off the hill in a moment of pique maeve can do worse if we stay in here she will die now or be tortured to death in a few hours she said those are our choices we buy time i said we buy time so that i can think and maybe figure some way for us to get out of this clusterfuck now get up or so help me ill carry you out there a flash of anger went through sarissas eyes but she got up all right maeve i called you win were coming out i held up my hands palms out and walked out of the meager makeshift protection of the ruined cottage chapter fiftyone maeve was enjoying her victory tremendously she stood on a pile of stone fallen from the lighthouse next to the summer lady and her coterie who were still focused upon restraining demonreach on the ground in front of her lay thomas karrin and mouse mouse had been hogtied and his muzzle held shut with thick bands of what looked like black ice he wasnt struggling but his deep dark eyes were tracking everyone who moved karrin sat with her hands tied behind her back scowling so ferociously that i could see the expression even through the mud and my brother lay on the ground bound up like mouse was but it didnt look like he was conscious the rawhead loomed over them minus one of its arms the arm lay over on the ground a jumble of brittle cracked bones held together by withered strands of some kind of reddish fiber the rawhead didnt have an expression to read but i thought the glow of its eyes looked sullen and satisfied the redcap was standing off to one side half of his face was a bloody mess and he had only one good eye now he was holding karrins p casually with much of the mud knocked off of it next to him two of the sidhe held fixs arms behind his back the summer knight had a bruise blackening the entire left side of his face running right to the hairline but molly was not visible so i might have been dealt a bad hand but i still had a hole card out there somewhere maeve hopped down from the fallen stones still holding that little automatic in her hand and smiling widely you made it interesting dresden ill give you that your merry band is just soshe kicked karrin in the small of the back drawing nothing but a hard exhalefeisty she eyed the people standing with me now lets see who do we have here maeve made a gesture with one hand and the air suddenly felt thick mud started plopping off of everyone covered in it as if it had begun to rain again and gotten wetter and runnier lets see lets see she murmured ah the bartender irony there getting a good view are you mac stared at maeve without speaking please allow me to make sure you dont get bored this is a participation sport maeve said and shot him in the stomach mac grunted and rocked back onto his heels he stared at maeve his expression completely impassive then he exhaled a groan and fell to one knee oh maeve said her eyes glittering that just never gets old justine made a quiet sound and went to macs side maeves eyes fastened on her and the vampires crumpet luscious little thing arent you and so close to lady raith you and i are going to have a long talk after this darling i just know youre going to start to see things my way justine didnt look at maeve and didnt answer she didnt look frightenedjust concerned for mac maybe because justine was not the most balanced and dangeraware person i knew or maybe her poker face was just way better than mine maeves eyes stopped on the last person with me and her smile became positively vulpine well well well sweet little sarissa isnt this luscious theres nothing i have that you dont want to ruin is there maeve sarissa said she didnt seem frightened either just tired maeve for gods sake how many times have we had this talk and yet you keep spoiling things for me sarissa rolled her eyes and gave a helpless little lift and fall of her hands maeve what could i possibly have ruined for you did finally moving out of that studio apartment destroy your life did getting my nursing degree somehow diminish your power did i steal some boyfriend of yours that you accidently left breathing after the first night it always goes back to that doesnt it maeve said her tone waspish how important you think men are and here you are trying to impress mother by bedding this one it was work maeve therapy i could see how therapeutic that dress was at his party my dress you were wearing rhinestones and nothing else maeves face contorted in rage they were diamonds karrin looked back and forth between them with an expression of startled recognition harry she said quietly yeah i got it i said i turned to sarissa who looked younger than molly mabs bff eh i asked her you said that not me she said quickly right i said youre just a young single rehabilitative health professional this decade sneered maeve what was it last time mathematics you were going to describe the universe or some such and before that what was it environmental science did you save the earth sarissa and before that an actress you thought you could create art which soap opera was it again it doesnt matter sarissa said she saw me staring at her and said it was before your time i blinked what she looked embarrassed i told you i was older than i looked finally i realize who you remind me of i sighed looking back and forth between sarissa and maeve it must have been the scrubs that threw me off maeve is always dressed like a stripper and shes always had the piercings and the club lighting and the crazy rasta hair i looked back and forth between the two hells bells youre identical twins not identical twins they both said at exactly the same time in the exact same tone of outrage they broke off to glare at each other how does that work exactly i asked i was curious but it was also an effort to buy time ive yet to meet a megalomaniac who doesnt love talking about him or herself if you give them half a chance especially the nonmortal ones to them a few minutes of chat in several centuries of life is nothing and they let things build up inside them for decades at a time you two were born changelings werent you what happened i chose to be sidhe maeve spat and you chose humanity i asked sarissa sarissa shrugged a shoulder and looked away hah maeve spat no she never chose at all just remained between worlds never making anything of herself never committing to anything maeve sarissa said quietly dont just floating along pretty and empty and bored maeve went on in a sweet poisonous tone unnoticed unremarkable maeve said lily in a harsh voice looking up from where she stood the summer lady kept a hand extended toward demonreach and her face was covered in sweat and she seemed to be leaning back against the hands of the sidhe behind her to stay upright i cant hold the spirit alone all night we have to talk about this before it gets any more out of control hurry and lets finish this maeve whirled toward lily stamping her foot on the ground this is my night do not rush me you stupid cow always so charming sarissa noted maeve turned back to sarissa and her right arm the one holding the gun twitched several times oh keep it up darling see what happens you arent going to let me live anyway maeve sarissa said im not stupid and i am not blind maeve spat back do you think i did not know about all the time she has been spending with you all the intimate talk the activity together do you think i dont know what it means shes doing with you what she always meant to do with youusing you as a spare preparing you as a vessel for the mantle preparing my replacement as if i were a broken piece of a machine sarissa looked pale and nodded slowly maeve she said her voice very soft youre youre sick youve got to know that maeve stopped tilting her head and her hair covered most of her face somewhere you have to realize it she wants to help you she cares in her way maeve maeve moved her left arm alone pointing a finger straight at me yes i can see how much she cared it isnt too late sarissa said you know how she lays her plans she prepares for everything but it doesnt have to happen that way the leanansidhe was sick and mother helped her but her power alone isnt enough to heal you you have to want it maeve you have to want to be healed maeve quivered where she stood for a moment like a slender tree placed under increasing strain we need the winter lady now sarissa said we need you maeve youre a vicious goddamned lunatic and we need you back maeve asked in a very small voice does she talk about me sarissa was silent she swallowed maeve said her voice harsher does she talk about me sarissa lifted her chin and shook her head she wont say your name but i know she fears for you you know that she never lets things show its how shes always been maeve shuddered then she lifted her head and stared venomously at sarissa i am strong sarissa stronger than i have ever been here now stronger than she is her lips quivered and twitched back from her teeth into a hideous mockery of a smile why should i want to be healed of that she cut loose with one of her psychotic laughs again i am about to unmake every precious thing she ever valued more than her own blood her own children and where is she maeve stuck her arms out and spun around in a pirouette her voice became pure vitriol where i have closed the circle of this place and she may not enter of course these stupid primates sussed out a way through it but she the queen of air and darkness could not possibly stoop to such a thing not even if it costs her the lives of her daughter and the mortal world too oh maeve sarissa said her voice thick with compassion and something like resignation where is she sarissa maeve demanded there were tears on her cheeks freezing into little white streaks forming white frost on her eyelashes where is her love where is her fury where is her anything while that drama was going on i thought furiously i thought about the mighty spirit who was my ally who was being held immobile and impotent i thought about the abilities of all of my allies and how they might change the current situation if they werent all incapacitated molly was the only one at liberty and she had worn herself out over the lake she wouldnt have much left in herif she appeared now the fae would defeat her handily she couldnt change this situation alone someone would have to set things into motion give her some chaos to work with i just didnt have much chaos left in me i was bonetired and we needed a game changer the mantle of the winter knight represented a source of power true but maeve had damned near talked me into joining her team when id let it have free rein i wasnt going to help anyone if i let myself give in to my inner psychopredator if we werent all inside the stupid circle at least i could send out a message a psychic warning i was sure i could get it to my grandfather to elaine and maybe to warden luccio but while i was sure a mud coating could get us out of the circle there was no way the fae would give us time to coat ourselves and do it we were effectively trapped in the circle until sunrise just like a being summoned from the nevernev wait a minute circles could be used for several different things they could be used to focus the energy of a spell shielding it from other energies they could be used to cut off energy flows to contain or discorporate a native being of the nevernever and if you were a mortal a genuine native of the really real world they could be used for one thing more summoning the hilltop was one enormous circle one enormous summoning circle she is not here maeve was ranting she sends her hand to deal with me so be it let me send her a message in reply the little automatic swiveled toward my head i shouted as swiftly as i could putting whatever will i had left into the shortest and most elemental summons there is mab mab mab i summon thee chapter fiftytwo its impossible to know how something is going to arrive when you summon it sometimes its huge and dramatic like it was with titania sometimes they come in a burst of thunder or flame once this thing id summoned arrived in a shower of rotting meat and it took me a month to get the smell out of my old lab less often they simply appear like a slideshow image suddenly projected on the wall dramafree mab came in a bell tone of sudden awful absolute silence there was a flashnot of light but of sudden snow of frost that abruptly blanketed everything on the hilltop and gathered thick on my eyelashes i reached up a hand to flick the snowflakes out of my eyes and when i lowered it mab was there again in her crow black dress with her midnight eyes and ebon hair floating three feet off the ground the frost was spreading from her covering the hilltop and the temperature dropped by twenty degrees in the same instant everything on the hilltop ceased moving there was no wind there were no fitful drops of rain just pure brittle crystalline silence and a sudden bleak black presence that made me feel like hiding behind something very quietly mabs dark bleak gaze took in the hilltop at a glance and stopped on lily and her supporting coterie mabs left eye twitched once and she spoke in a low dreadfully precise voice cease this rudeness at once lily suddenly stared at mab with wide eyes like a teenager who had been walked in upon while making out in the living room the confidence of her stance faltered and she abruptly lowered her hand there was a sigh as of completed labor from her crew i checked demonreach the guardian spirit had ceased to look slowmotion windblown and simply stood in the opening to the lighthouse motionless lily stared at mab for a few seconds then she lifted her chin in defiance and took a few steps until she stood shoulder to shoulder with maeve mab made a low disgusted sound and turned to face me i have heeded your summons yet i would not enter this domain unless specifically bidden have i your permission to do so yes i said yes you do mab nodded her head slightly and descended to the ground from me she turned to demonreach i thank you for your patience and your assistance in this matter you could have reacted differently but chose not to i am aware of the decision it will not be forgotten demonreach bowed its head barely a gesture of acknowledgment not cooperation or compliance once she had seen that something seemed to ease out of mab it was hard to say what gave me that impression yet i had the same sense of relief i would have felt upon seeing someone remove his hand from the grip of a firearm mab turned back to me and eyed me up and down she quirked one eyebrow very slightly somehow conveying layers of disapproval toward multiple aspects of my appearance conduct and situation and said finally theres been a lot on my mind i replied it seems unlikely that your cares will lighten queen mab replied improve your mind i was going to say something smartass but said mind noted that maybe i could wait until my bacon was entirely out of the fire before i did i decided to pay attention to my mind and bowed my head in mabs direction instead i felt like id gotten a little smarter already baby steps then mab turned to maeve the winter lady faced the queen of air and darkness with cold fury in her eyes and a smile on her lips so maeve said you come in black you come as a judge but then you always did that with me but its just a game how a game mab asked you have already judged passed sentence and dispatched your executioner you have duties you have neglected them what did you expect from you maeve said bitterly nothing nothing is precisely what i have done mab said for too long yet to lose you presents a danger of its own i would prefer it if you allowed me to assist you to return to your duties im sure you would maeve sneered im sure you would enjoy torturing me to the brink of sanity to make me a good little automaton again mabs reply was a second slower coming than it should have been no maeve maeve ground her teeth no one controls maeve frost formed on mabs soot black lashes oh child the words had weight to them and finalitylike the lid to a coffin i will never be your good little hunting falcon again maeve continued i will never bow my knee to anyone again especially not to a jealous hag who envies everything she sees in me envy mab asked maeve cut loose with another one of those lithiumlaced laughs envy the great and mighty mab envious of her little girl because i have something you will never have mother and what is that mab asked choice maeve snarled stop mab snappedbut not in time maeve bent her elbow to point her little gun casually across her body and without looking put a bullet into lilys left temple no fix blurted suddenly struggling against the sidhe holding him lily froze into absolute stillness for a second her beautiful face confused then she fell like the petal of a dying flower lily fix screamed his face contorted with agony he fought wildly though he couldnt escape lunging toward maeve paying no attention whatsoever to his captors for their part winter and summer fae alike seemed stunned into nearparalysis eyes locked onto lilys fallen form mab stared at lily for a long second her eyes wide with an echo of the same shock what have you done maeve threw back her head and howled mocking triumphant laughter lifting her hands into the air did you think i did not know why you prepared sarissa hag she half sang you wrought her into a vessel of faerie rejoice thy will is done i didnt know what the hell she was talking about for a secondbut then i saw it fire flickered to life over the late summer lady it did not consume lily rather it gathered itself into green and gold light a shape that vaguely mirrored lilys own arms spread out as she lay prostrate upon the frostcovered earth then with a gathering shriek the fire suddenly condensed into a form the shape of something that looked like an eagle or a large hawk blinding light spread over the hilltop and the hawk suddenly flashed from lilys fallen form directly into sarissa sarissas eyes widened in horror and she lifted her arms in an instinctive defensive gesture the hawkshaped summer fire the mantle of the summer lady plunged through sarissas upraised arms and into her chest at the heart her body arched into a bow she let out a scream and green and gold light shone from her opened mouth like a spotlight throwing fresh sharp shadows across the hilltop then her scream faded into a weeping gurgling moan and she fell to the earth body curling into a shuddering fetal position mantle passed maeve tittered nearest vessel filled the seasons turn and turn and turn mabs eyes were wide as she stared at maeve oh oh maeve said her body twisting into a spontaneous little dance of pure glee you never saw that coming did you mother it never even occurred to you did it her own eyes widened in lunatic intensity and how will you slay me now whither would my mantle go where is the nearest vessel now some hapless mortal perhaps ignorant of its true nature the instrument of some foe of yours in alliance with me ready to steal away the mantle and leave you vulnerable maeve giggled i can play chess too mother better now than ever you could and i am now less a liability to you alive than dead you do not understand what you have done mab said quietly i know exactly what i have done maeve snarled i have beaten you this was never about the sleepers or this accursed isle or the lives of mortal insects this was about beating you you hidebound hag about using your own games against you kill me now and you risk destroying the balance of winter and summer forever throwing all into chaos sarissa lay on the ground moaning and it was about taking her away from you maeve gloated how many mortal caterwauls or sporting events will the winter queen attend with the summer lady and every time you think of her you remember her you will know that i took her from you mabs black eyes went to sarissa for a moment the blame for this lies with me mab said quietly i cared too much i realized something then in that moment when mab spoke she wasnt reacting as she should have been cold rage seething anger megalomaniacal outrageany of those would have been something i would have considered utterly within her character but there was none of that in her voice or face just regret and resolution mab knew somethingsomething maeve didnt remember that when this world is in ashes mother maeve said for you cannot risk my death this night and i will not lift a finger to aid you in the night to come without the winter ladys power your downfall is simply a matter of timeand not much of that after this night you will not see me again yes mab said though to which statement was unclear i have choice mother while you will be destroyed in your shackles maeve said you will die and i will have freedom at last to fulfill ones purpose is not to be a slave my daughter mab said and you are not free child any more than a knife is free because it leaves its sheath and is thrust into a corpse choice is power maeve spat in reply shall i make more choices this night to demonstrate she lifted the little pistol again and pointed it at me karrin drew a sharp breath and i suddenly understood what was happening i understood what mab knew that maeve didnt sarissa wasnt the only faerie vessel on the hilltop she was simply the one maeve had been meant to see there was one other person there who had been spending time with a powerful fae who had a relationship with one that was deeper and more significant than a casual or formal acquaintance whose life had been methodically deliberately and covertly reshaped for the purpose who had been extensively prepared by one of the sidhe maeve i said in a panic dont youre killing yourself you havent won you just cant see it maeve cackled in delight cant i being able to choose to tell lies isnt a freaking superpower maeve i said because it means you can always make the wrong choice it means you can lie to yourself maeves smile turned positively sexual her eyes bright and shining two plus two is five she said and rotated the gun sideways the barrel still pointed at my eye mab moved her little finger karrins hands flew out from behind her back in a shower of broken chips of black ice she tore her little holdout gun from a concealed ankle holster no i shouted two shots rang out almost simultaneously something hissed spitefully past my ear a neat round black hole appeared just to the side of maeves nose at the fine line of her cheekbone maeve blinked twice her face fell into what was almost precisely the same expression of confusion lilys had a trickle of blood ran from the hole and then she fell like an icicle in a warm sunbeam dammit no i whispered deep blue fire gathered over the fallen winter lady it coalesced with an ugly howl into the outline of a serpent which coiled and then lashed out in a strike that carried its blazing form fifteen feet to the nearest corner of the ruined cottage where molly behind her veil had been crouched and waiting for a chance to aid me the serpent of winter cold plunged into her chest shattering her veil as it struck and my apprentices expression was twisted in startled horror she didnt even have time to flinch it struck and she fell back against the side of the cottage her legs buckling as if the muscles in them had forgotten how to move molly looked up at me her expression bewildered confused and she barely managed to gasp out harry and then she too collapsed to the ground shuddering and unconscious oh god i breathed oh god molly chapter fiftythree two queens of faerie lay dead long live the queens everyone was shocked still i turned to the retinues of the fallen queens and said let fix go now they released the smaller man and he went at once to lilys side his face still wrenched with grief you will put down anything you took from my friends i told the fae in a level voice then you will withdraw as far down the hill as the wall will allow if i see any of you try anything violent you will never leave this island am i understood i didnt look like much but mab was looming right over one of my shoulders and demonreach over the other so they took me seriouslyeven the rawhead they all moved away breaking into two groups as they went harry karrin said what just happened is molly all right i stared hard at mab i dont know i said to karrin can you and justine get them both into the cottage just make sure they dont swallow their own tongues or something i looked over at justine how you doing mac mac gave me a weary shaky thumbsup justine looked up from tending to him i dont think theres too much bleeding but we need to get this dirt washed off of him theres a pump by the door to the cottage i said i looked around and frowned at demonreach hey make yourself useful and help them carry the wounded inside demonreach eyed me but it did so lumbering forward to pick molly and then sarissa up very carefully the way a person would carry an infant one in each arm then it walked over to the cottage carrying them karrin meanwhile went to justine and between the two of them they were able to get mac on his feet and hobbling into the cottage i went and managed to drag thomas over my shoulder i toted his unconscious form to the cottage too and told mouse stay with him boy mouse made a distressed noise and looked over at molly he sat down on the floor halfway between the two of them and looked back and forth just have to have a little campout until dawn i said well take care of them mouse sighed harry karrin began gun i said quietly and held out a hand she blinked at me but she checked it engaged the safety and handed it over stay here i said moving toward the door harry what are y stay here i snarled furious i took the safety off and left the cottage to stalk over to mab as i crossed to her her black gown and hair became stormcloud grey then silver then white again yes my knight she asked me i started walking around the base of the tower away from the cottage could you please come this way she arched a brow but did moving over the ground with the same approximate weight as moonlight i walked until we were out of sight of the cottage and the fae down the hill then i thumbed back the hammer on the little gun spun and put the barrel against mabs forehead mab stopped and regarded me with luminous unblinking eyes what is the meaning of this its still halloween i said shaking with exhaustion and rage and i am in no mood for games i want answers i have turned villages to stone for gestures less insulting than this one mab said in a level tone but i am your guest here and you are clearly overwrought youre goddamned right im overwrought i growled you set me up thats one thing i walked into it with open eyes i get it and ill deal with it but you set molly up give me one good reason not to put a bullet through your head right now first mab said because you would not survive to finish pulling the trigger but as threatening your life has never been a successful way to pierce your skull i will provide you with a second miss carpenter will have difficulty enough learning to cope with the ladys mantle without you handing her mine as well dont you think right i hadnt thought about that part but i wasnt feeling terribly rational why i demanded why did you do it to her it was not my intention for her to replace maeve mab said frankly i would have considered her a better candidate for summer you still havent told me why i said i meant sarissa to take maeves place mab said but one does not place all ones hopes with any one place person or plan like chess the superior player does not plan to accomplish a single gambit a particular entrapment she establishes her pieces so that regardless of what her enemy does she has forces ready to respond to adapt and to destroy molly was made ready as a contingency in case something happened to your own daughter i asked something had already happened to my daughter mab said it was my intention to make sarissa ready for her new role much as i made you ready for yours thats why you exposed her to all of those things alongside me i have no use for weakness wizard the situation here developed in a way i did not expect molly had originally been positioned with another purpose in mindbut her presence made it possible to defeat the adversarys gambit positioned i spat gambit is that what molly is to you a pawn no mab said calmly not anymore that rocked my head back as surely as if shed punched me in the nose i felt a little bit dizzy i lowered the gun shes a kid i said tiredly she had her whole life ahead of her and you did this to her maeve was always overly dramatic but in this instance she was quite correct i could not risk killing her if i did not have a vessel on hand to receive her mantleand the lack of the winter ladys strength would have been critical it is one of the better plays the adversary has made you dont get it do you i said i do not she said i do not see how what i have done is substantially different from what you have been doing for many years what i asked i gave her power she said as if explaining something simple to a child that is not what i have been doing i spat is it not mab asked have i misunderstood first you captured her imagination and affection as an associate of her fathers you made her curious about what you could do and nurtured that curiosity with silence then when she went to explore the art you elected not to interfere until such time as she found herself in dire straitsat which point your aid placed her deep within your obligation you used that and her emotional attachment to you to plant and reap a follower who was talented loyal and in your debt it was actually very welldone i stood there with my mouth open for a second that that isnt what i did mab leaned closer to me and said that is precisely what you did she said the only thing you did not do is admit to yourself that you were doing it which is why you never availed yourself of her charms you told yourself lovely idealistic lies and you had a powerful talented loyal girl willing to give her life for yours who also had nowhere else to turn for help as far as your career as a mentor goes you grew into much the same image as dumorne that that isnt what i did i repeated harder what youre doing to her will change her did she not change after you began to indoctrinate her mab asked you were perhaps too soft on her during her training but had she not already begun to become a different person a person she chose to be i said did she choose to be born with her gift for the art did she choose to become someone so sensitive that she can hardly remain in a crowded room i did not do that to heryou did i ground my teeth consider mab said that i have done something for her that you never could have whats that exactly i have put her beyond the reach of the white council and their wardens mab said again as if explaining something to an idiot while they might howl and lecture as much as they wish about an apprentice wizard they can do nothing at all to the winter lady i took a deep breath that was also true youve made her life so much harder i said quietly i wasnt saying it to mab really i was just sounding out loud the chain of argument in my head but so have i especially after chichén itzá you trusted her with your mind and your life mab said i took that as a statement of confidence in her abilities you will be working frequently with the winter lady it seems to me that this would be a most appropriate match and her duties i asked what is the purpose of the winter lady that is for her to know mab said know this my knight had i not considered her an excellent candidate i would never have had her prepared she has the basic skills she will need to master the power of the mantleespecially if one she trusts is there to advise and reassure her you should have spoken to me about this first i said you should have spoken to her mab moved so quickly that i literally never saw it the gun was suddenly simply gone from my hand and was being pushed into my facein exactly the same spot where maeve had been shot i mab said coolly am not your servant dresden you are mine demonreach i said if our guest pulls that trigger take her below and keep her there the guardian spirits vast shadow fell over us even though there was nothing actually casting it and mabs eyes widened servant i said i dont like that word i suggest that you consider where you stand and choose a different term my queen and you will be gentle with that girl or so help me i will make you regret it mabs mouth quirked very slightlyher eyes more so she looked up at me almost fondly exhaled and said finally a knight worth the trouble she lowered the gun and calmly passed it back to me i took it from her have you any other questions she asked i frowned thinking yeah actually someone called thomas and told him to be ready at the boat when i first got back to town do you know anything about that i arranged it of course mab said in a voice that sounded exactly like mollys as a courtesy to the ancient one just before your party started at that i shuddered mollys voice coming from that inhumanly cold face was just wrong lily i said she waved her hand over my chest as if she could detect the influence of the adversary mabs lips pressed into a firm line yes could she i asked of course not mab said were it so simple a task the adversary would be no threat not even the gatekeeper at the focus of his power can be absolutely certain then why would she think she could i asked then i answered my own question because maeve led her to believe that she could all maeve had to do was lie and maybe sacrifice a couple of the adversarys pawns to make it seem real then she could have lily wave her hands at her and prove to her that maeve was clean of any taint and lily wasnt experienced enough to know any better after that lily would have bought just about anything maeve was selling obviously mab said her tone mildly acidic have you any questions you cannot answer for yourself i clenched my jaw and relaxed it a couple of times then i asked was it hard for you tonight hard mab asked she was your daughter i said mab became very silent and very still she considered the ground around us and paced up and down a bit slowly frowning as if trying to remember the lyrics of a song from her childhood finally she became still again closing her eyes even tonight with everything going to hell you couldnt hurt her i said mab opened her eyes and stared down through a gap in the trees at the vast waters of lake michigan a few years back you got angry so angry that when you spoke it made people bleed from the ears that was why because you figured out that the adversary had taken maeve and it hurt to know that the adversary had gotten to her it was the knife mab said knife morganas athame mab said in a neutral tonebut her eyes were far away the one given her by the red court at biancas masquerade that was how the leanansidhe was taintedand your godmother spread it to maeve before i could set it right oh i said id been at that party mab turned to me abruptly and said i would lay them to rest upon the island the fallen ladies if that does not offend you it doesnt i said but check with the island i shall please excuse me she turned and began walking away you didnt answer my question i said she stopped her back straight was it hard for you to kill maeve mab did not turn around when she spoke her voice had something in it i had never heard there before and never heard againuncertainty vulnerability i was mortal once you know she said very quietly and then she kept walking toward her daughters body while i stared angrily sadly thoughtfully after her the rest of the night passed without anyone getting killed i sat down with my back against the outside wall of the cottage to keep an eye on my guests down the hill but when i blinked a few seconds later my eyes stuck shut and then didnt open again until i heard distantly a bird twittering footsteps came crunching up the hill and i opened my eyes to see kringle approaching his red cloak and gleaming mail were stained with black ichor the hilt of his sword was simply missing a chunk as if it had been bitten away and his mouth was set in a wide pleased smile dresden he said calmly kringle long night long day i said someone during the night had covered me with an old woolen army surplus blanket that had been in a plastic storage box in the cottage i eyed him have fun a low warm rumble of a laugh bubbled in his chest very much so if i dont get into a good battle every few years life just isnt the same even if its on halloween i asked he eyed me and his smile became wider and more impish especially then he said hows the leg i grunted and checked butterss dressing had stayed on throughout the events of the night the constant burning sting was gone and i peeled off the dressing to see that the little wound on my leg had finally scabbed over looks like ill live hawthorn dart kringle said nasty stuff hawthorn wood burns hot and doesnt care for creatures of winter his expression sobered ive a message for you ah i asked mab has taken the new ladies with her he said she said to tell you that the new winter lady would be returned safely to her apartment in a few days after some brief and gentle instruction mab is on excellent terms with the svartalves and anticipates no problems with your apprentices new position thats good i guess i said it is kringle replied dresden this is the business of the queens i advise you not to attempt to interfere with it i already interfered i said kringle straightened and his fierce smile became somehow satisfied aye like to live dangerously do you he leaned a little closer and lowered his voice never let her make you cringebut never challenge her pride wizard i dont know exactly what passed between you but i suspect that if it had been witnessed by another she would break you to pieces ive seen it before terrible pride in that creature shell never bend it shell never bend i said thats okay i can respect that could be that you can kringle said he nodded to me and turned to go hey i said he turned to me pleasantly the whole winter knight thing i said its made me stronger true enough he said but not that much stronger i said you could have beaten me last night oh kringles smile fadedexcept from his eyes and ive seen goblins move a few times i said the erlking could have gotten out of the way of that shot really you meant me to have the wild hunt no one can be given a power like the wild hunt dresden kringle said he can only take it really i said as drily as i knew how that got another laugh from kringle you have guts and will mortal it had to be shown or the hunt would never have accepted you maybe ill just punch you out whenever i feel like it then i said maybe youll try kringle replied amiably he looked out at the lightening sky and let out a satisfied breath it was halloween dresden you put on a mask for a time thats all he looked directly at me and said many many mantles are wornor discardedon halloween night wizard you mean masks i asked frowning masks mantles kringle said whats the difference he winked at me and for the briefest fraction of a second the shadows falling from the tower and the cottage in the gathering morning behind us seemed to flow together the eye he winked with vanished behind a stripe of shadow and what looked like a wide scar his face seemed leaner and for that instant i saw vadderungs wolfish features lurking inside kringles i sat straight up staring kringle finished his wink turned jauntily and started walking down the hill humming here comes santa claus in a rumbling bass voice i stared after him son of a bitch i muttered to myself i stood up and wrapped the army surplus blanket around myself before i walked into the cottage i smelled coffee and soup and my stomach wanted lots of both there was a fire going in the fireplace and my coffeepot was hanging near the fire the soup kettle was hanging on its swinger too the soup would be made from stock and freezedried meat but i was hungry enough not to be picky everyone else there probably felt the same way thomas was sacked out on one of the cots snoring justine had spooned up behind him her face pressed into his back they both had clean faces and hands at least mac was snoozing on the other cot bare to the waist his chest and stomach evidently washed free of any dirtand any blood or any injury as well sarissa was gone molly was gone fix was gone i felt confident they had left together karrin sat at the fire staring in a cup of coffee in her hands mouse sat beside her when i came in he looked over at me and started wagging his tail you leave the blanket i asked quietly once we got the fire going she said i suppose i could go get you your duster now though id look like a flasher i said she smiled very slightly and offered me two mugs i looked one had coffee the other very chunky soup she passed me a camp fork to go along with the soup it isnt much she said dont care i said and sat down on the hearth across from her to partake of both the heat gurgled into my belly along with the food and the coffee and i started feeling human for the first time in a while i ached everywhere it wasnt at all pleasant but it felt like something id come by honestly christ dresden karrin said you could at least wash your hands she picked up a towelette and leaned over to start cleaning off my hands my stomach thought stopping was a bad idea but i put the mugs aside and let her she cleaned my hands off patiently going through a couple of towelettes then she said lean over i did she took a fresh towelette and wiped off my face slowly and carefully there were nicks and cuts it hurt when she cleaned one of them out but it also felt right sometimes the things that are good for you in the long run hurt for a little while when you first get to them there she said a moment later you almost look human she paused at that and looked down i mean i know what you mean i said yeah the fire crackled whats the story with mac i asked karrin looked over at the sleeping man mab she said she just came in here a few minutes ago and looked at him then before anyone could react she ripped off the bandage stuck her fingers into the wound and pulled out the bullet dropped it right on his chest no wound now i noted yeah started closing up the minute she was done but you remember the time he got beaten so badly in his bar why didnt his injuries regenerate then i shook my head maybe because he was conscious then he did turn down the painkillers i remember it seemed odd at the time karrin murmured what is he i shrugged ask him i did she said right before he passed out whatd he say he said im out i grunted what do you think it means she asked i thought about it maybe it means hes out we just let it go she asked its what he wants i said think we should torture him point she said and sighed maybe instead we just let him rest maybe we should let him make beer i said what about thomas woke up ate she frowned and clarified ate soup been asleep for a couple of hours that big bone thing really clobbered him theres always someone bigger than you i said she gave me a look more true for some than others i clarified she rolled her eyes so i said a moment later so she said um should we talk about what mouse looked back and forth between us and started wagging his tail hopefully quiet you i said and rubbed his ears bad guy made of bones and he gets the drop on you charity giving you too many treats or something that fight should have been like scoobydoo versus the scooby snack ghost mouse grinned happily unfazed still wagging his tail dont be so hard on him karrin said theres always someone bigger then she shook her head and said wow we are such children well grab at any excuse not to talk about us right now my soup did a little flipflop um i said yeah i swallowed we we kissed theres a song about what that means karrin said yeah but i dont sing she paused as if her soup had just started doing gymnastics too then she spoke very carefully there are factors like kincaid i said without any heat or resentment hes not one of them she said not anymore oh i said a little surprised its you harry pretty sure im supposed to be a factor yeah she said just not against she took my hands ive seen things in you over the past day that concern me concern you they scare the holy loving fuck out of me she said calmly by way of clarification this winter knight thing youre not changing youve already changed i felt a little chill what do you mean tonight hell karrin when havent we done monsters and mayhem weve done it a lot she said but youve always been scared of it before you did it anyway but you thought it was scary thats the sane thing to think so i asked what was different about it tonight the way your erection kept pressing into my back she said wryly uh i said really yeah a woman kind of notices i hadnt gulp its just karrin look that thing hardly ever does something that isnt illadvised doesnt mean its going to make the calls i will never understand why men do that she said do what talk about their genitals like theyre some other creature some kind of mindcontrolling parasite she shook her head its just you harry its all you and part of you was really loving everything that was going on and thats bad i asked yes she said then she made a short frustrated sound no maybe its a change do changes have to be bad of course not but i dont know if this one is bad or not yet she said harry you are the strongest man i know in more than one sense of the word and because you are it means that if you do change you think id be some kind of monster i said she shrugged and squeezed my hands with hers im not saying this right its not coming out right but i felt you when we were with the hunt i knew what was driving you what you were feeling and in the moment i was down with itand that scares me too so am i too much of a monster or are you i asked im getting confused join the club she said youre saying that the problem is you think i could go bad i said i know you could she said anyone can and youve got more opportunity than most and maybe you shouldnt be rocking your emotional boat right now when susan broke your heart right after she was changed you went into a downward spiral if that happened now with the kinds of things youre facing harry im afraid you might not be able to pull out of it that much sure as hell was true you arent wrong i said but we havent even gone on a date yet and youve already skipped ahead to the ugly breakup there are factors she repeated in a firm steady voice like what i asked like this thing with molly karrin said theres no thing with molly i said theres never going to be a thing with molly she sighed youre a wizard shes a wizard now youre the winter knight and shes the winter lady karrin i began and im going to get old and die soon karrin said very very quietly relatively soon but youre going to keep going for centuries and so is she the two of you are closeand even if nothing ever happens its one more thing you know we held hands and the fire crackled oh i said she nodded so there are things stacked against us i said what else is new you are the captain of disaster in the supernatural world she acknowledged but im the one who has repeatedly taken relationships into icebergs ive done it enough to know that you and i are the titanic were people i said not some fucking ship were also people she said a kiss when were both ramped up on adrenaline is one thing a relationship is harder a lot harder she shook her head if it ends in tears im afraid it could destroy us both and theres a lot on the line right now i dont think this is something we should rush into i need time to think to i just need time i swallowed she still wasnt wrong i didnt like what she had to say not one bit but she wasnt wrong is this where you tell me we need to be friends i asked she blinked and looked up at me she touched my face with her fingertips harry were we went past that a long time ago i dont know if we can if we should be lovers but im your friend your ally ive seen what you want and what youre willing to sacrifice to make it happen she took one of my hands between hers pressing hard i feel lost since they fired me i dont know what im meant to do or who i ought to be but what i do know is that ive got your back always tears fell from her blue eyes so goddammit dont you start taking the highway to hell because im going to be right there with you all the way i couldnt see her face after that i felt her head underneath my chin and i put my arms around her we sat together like that for a while things are going to get bad i said quietly i dont know how or when exactly but theres a storm coming being near me isnt going to be sane lets just agree that im not all the way together and save us both some time arguing she said always harry im there end of story okay i said one condition what thats not the end of the story i said i mean maybe neither one of us is ready but we could be one day and maybe we will be optimistic idiot she said but i could hear the smile and if we get to that place i said you dont chicken out you dont run away no matter how it looks to you we set course for the fucking iceberg full speed ahead she started shaking she was weeping and the sex i said it will be frequent possibly violent youll be screaming neighbors will make phone calls she started shaking harder she was laughing those are my conditions i said take them or leave them youre such a pig dresden karrin said then she drew back enough to give me a look through tearstained blue eyes maybe youll be the one screaming you sure about this asked thomas out here by yourself cold isnt really an issue anymore i said untying the first of the lines from the water beetle to the whatsup dock i was wearing some of his clothes from the ship the sweats were too short and the shirt was too tight but the duster hid most of that and ive got supplies for a week or so until you can make it back you sure that tubs going to make it back to town put three patches on the hull after i got her off the beach and the pumps are working thomas said we should be fine what about you that thing the island said was in your head another reason to stay here i said if mollys the one who can help me im on my own for now but demonreach seems to be able to make it leave me alone at least while im here pretty much means i need to stay until molly gets herself back together my brother exhaled unhappily and squinted up at the noonday sun south of us hidden behind grey clouds heard from lara on the radio and both her team and marcones found rituals in progress at the two sites they broke them up someone really wanted this place to get screwed up or something i said with a melodramatic waggle of my eyebrows he snorted you joke around but i cant help but think that fix is going to hold you responsible for some of what happened last night he said he might show up to explain that to you he shows up here theres nothing he can do i said quietly i can take him on neutral ground here it wont even be a fight still thomas said out here alone i think its important i said ive got to know more about this place and what it can do the only way to do that is to invest the time and its got nothing to do with facing mollys parents he said i bowed my head it isnt my place to tell them molly should decide who they hear it from first once she has yeah theres going to be a really hard talk until that time i need to be here and its got nothing to do with facing maggie thomas said i looked away out at the grey water of the lake fix knew that maggie existed if he wanted to hurt me shes with michael because hes got an nfl lineup of angels protecting his house and family i said and supermutt too am i going to be able to provide a real home for her man an education a real life whats her college application going to look like raised on spooky island by wizard with ged please help i shook my head and when the fallout from the white council about molly and about this place starts hitting its going to be a nightmare i might as well have a target tattooed on her forehead as keep her near me michael is awesome thomas said hell i wish hed raised me but he isnt her dad i had sex with her mother i said thats not the same as being her father thomas shook his head youd be a good dad harry youd spoil her and youd indulge her and youd embarrass her in front of her friends but youd do right by her this is me i said doing right by her for now maybe someday things could change thomas eyed me then he shook his head and said kids change into adults way faster than it seems like they should dont take too long deciding how much change is enough hell he was right about that much at least i sighed and nodded slowly ill keep it in mind i know he said and smiled at me because im not going to shut up about it i rolled my eyes and nodded good dont i offered my fist for bumping thomas ignored me and gave me a ribcracking hug which i returned glad youre back he whispered loser you gonna start crying now wuss i said back see you in a few days he said well get the cottage finished off make it someplace maggie wont need to learn shapeshifting to survive in just dont forget the books i said or the pizza for the guard wont he let go of me and hopped up onto the water beetle any messages molly i said when she gets back ask her to send toot and lacuna to me and tell her that when shes ready to talk im here thomas nodded untied the last line and tossed it to me i caught it and started coiling it thomas climbed up onto the bridge and took the ship out chugging away at the sedate pace he would use until he cleared the stone reefs around demonreach karrin came out of the cabin and stood on the deck mouse came with her looking solemn she leaned back against the cabins wall and watched me as she went i watched too until i couldnt see her anymore thunder rumbled over lake michigan unusual in november i settled the new black leather duster over my shoulders picked up the long rough branch id cut from the islands oldest oak tree a few hours before and started back up the hill toward the former lighthouse and future cottage i had preparations to make there was a storm coming in
