jonathan kellerman private eyes the sixth book in the alex delaware series special thanks to beverly lewis whose sharp eye and soft voice make a big difference to gerald petievich for an insiders view of lots of things and to terri turner california parole department for her efficiency and good cheer to my children who put everything in perspective for all of us our own particular creature lurks in ambush hugh wapole a therapists work is never over which isnt to say that patients dont get better but the bond forged during lockeddoor threequarter hours the relationship that develops when private eyes peek into private lives can achieve a certain immortality some patients do leave and never return some never leave a good many occupy an ambiguous space in the middle throwing out occasional tendrils of reattachment during periods of pride or sorrow predicting wholl fall into which group is an iffy business no more rational than vegas or the stock market after a few years in practice i stopped trying so i really wasnt surprised when i came home after a july nightrun and learned that melissa dickinson had left a message with my service first time id heard from her in what it had to be nearly a decade since shed stopped coming to the office i once maintained in a coldblooded highrise on the east end of beverly hills one of my longtermers that alone would have made her stand out in my memory but there had been so much more child psychologys an ideal job for those who like to feel heroic children tend to get better relatively quickly and to need less treatment than adults even at the height of my practice it was rare to schedule a patient for more than one session a week but i started melissa at three because of the extent of her problems her unique situation after eight months we tapered to twice at years anniversary were down to one finally a month shy of two years termination she left therapy a changed little girl i allowed myself a bit of selfcongratulation but knew better than to wallow in it because the family structure that had nurtured her problems had never been altered its surface hadnt even been scratched despite that thered been no reason to keep her in treatment against her will im nine years old dr delaware im ready to handle things on my own i sent her out into the world expecting to hear from her soon didnt for several weeks phoned her and was informed in polite but firm nineyearold tones that she was just fine thank you would call me if she needed me now she had a long time to be on hold ten years would make her nineteen empty the memory banks and be prepared for a stranger i glanced at the phone number shed left with the service an area code san labrador exchange i went into the library dug into my closed files for a while and finally found her chart same prefix as her original home number but the last four digits were different change of number or had she left home if she had she hadnt gone very far i checked the date of her last session nine years ago a birth date in june shed turned eighteen a month ago i wondered what had changed about her what was the same wondered why i hadnt heard from her sooner the phone was picked up after two rings hello voice of a stranger young female melissa yes this is dr alex delaware oh hi i didnt thanks so much for calling back dr delaware i wasnt expecting to hear from you until tomorrow i didnt even know if youd call back whys that your listing in the phone boo excuse me hold on for one second please hand over the phone muffled conversation a moment later she came back on theres no office address for you in the phone book no address at all just your name no degree i wasnt even sure it was the same a delaware so i didnt know if you were still in practice the answering service said you were but that you worked mostly with lawyers and judges thats basically true oh then i guess but im always available to former patients and im glad you called how are things melissa things are good she said quickly clipped laugh having said that the logical question is why am i calling you after all these years right and the answer is that its not about me dr delaware its mother i see not that anything terribles oh darn hold on hand over the phone again more background conversation im really sorry dr delaware this just isnt a good time to talk do you think i could come and see you sure whats a good time for you the sooner the better im pretty free schools out i graduated congratulations thanks it feels good to be out bet it does i checked my book how about tomorrow at noon noon would be great i really appreciate this dr delaware i gave her directions to my house she thanked me and hung up before i could complete my goodbye having learned much less than i usually do during a preappointment call a bright young woman articulate tense holding back something remembering the child shed been i found none of that surprising its mother that opened up a realm of possibilities the most likely shed finally come to grips with her mothers pathology what it meant to her needed to put her feelings in focus maybe get a referral for her mother so tomorrows visit would probably be a oneshot deal and that would be it for another nine years i closed the chart comfortable with my powers of prediction i might as well have been playing the slots in vegas or buying penny stocks on wall street i spent the next couple of hours on my latest project a monograph for one of the psych journals on my experiences with a school full of children victimized by a sniper the previous autumn the writing was more of an ordeal than id expected the trick was to make the experience come alive within the confines of a scientific approach i stared down at draft number four fiftytwo pages of defiantly awkward prose certain id never be able to inject any humanity into the morass of jargon scholarly references and footnotes i had no clear memory of creating at eleventhirty i put my pen down and sat back still unable to find the magic voice my eyes fell on melissas chart i opened it and began reading october the fall of i remembered it as a hot and nasty one with its filthy streets and septic air hollywood hadnt worn its autumns well for a long time id just given grand rounds at western pediatric hospital and was itching to get back to the west side of town and the half a dozen appointments that made up the rest of my day id thought the lecture had gone well behavioral approaches to fear and anxiety in children facts and figures transparencies and slides in those days id thought all that quite impressive an auditorium full of pediatricians most of them private practitioners an inquisitive practicalminded bunch hungry for what worked with little patience for academic nitpicking i fielded questions for a quarter of an hour and was on my way out of the lecture hall when a young woman stopped me i recognized her as one of the frequent questioners thought id seen her somewhere else as well dr delaware eileen wagner she had a pleasant full face under cropped chestnut hair good features bottomheavy figure a slight squint her white blouse was mannish and buttoned to the neck her skirt kneelength tweed over sensible shoes she carried a black gladstone bag that looked brandnew i remembered where id seen her before last years house staff roster thirdyear resident md from one of the ivy league schools i said dr wagner we shook hands hers was soft and stubby bare of jewelry she said you gave a lecture on fears to the four west staff last year when i was plthree i thought it was quite good thank you i enjoyed today too and ive got a referral for you if youre interested sure she shifted the gladstone bag to another hand im in practice now out in pasadena have privileges at cathcart memorial but the kid i have in mind isnt one of my regular patients just a phonein through cathcarts help line they didnt know how to handle it and sent it over to me because im listed as having an interest in behavioral pediatrics when i heard what the problem was i remembered last years talk and thought it would be right up your alley then when i read the grand rounds schedule i thought perfect id be glad to help but my office is on the other side of town no matter theyll come to you they have the means i know because i went out a few days ago to see her its a little girl were talking about seven years old actually i came here this morning because of her hoping to learn something that could help me help her but after listening to you its clear her problems go beyond office management she needs someone who specializes anxiety problems emphatic nod shes just racked with fears multiple phobias as well as a high level of general anxiety im talking really pervasive when you say you went out there do you mean a house call she smiled didnt think anyone did them anymore at yale public health they taught us to call them home visits no actually i dont make a habit of it wanted them to come into the office to see me but thats part of the problem they dont travel or rather the mother doesnt shes an agoraphobic hasnt left her house for years how many years she didnt get any more specific than years and i could see even that much was hard for her so i didnt push she really wasnt prepared for being questioned at all so i kept it brief focused on the kid makes sense i said what did she tell you about the kid just that melissa thats her name was afraid of everything the dark loud noises and bright lights being alone new situations and she often seems tense and jumpy some of its got to be constitutional genetics or maybe shes just imitating the mother but im sure some of its the way she lives its a very strange situation big house huge one of those incredible mansions on the north side of cathcart boulevard out in san labrador classic san labrador acres of land huge rooms dutiful servants everything very hushhush and the mother stays up in her room like some victorian lady afflicted with the vapors she stopped touched her mouth with a fingertip a victorian princess actually shes really beautiful despite the fact that one side of her face is all scarred and there appears to be some mild facial hemiplegia subtle sagging mostly when she talks if she werent so beautiful so symmetrical you might never notice no keloiding though just a mesh of fine scars id be willing to bet she had toplevel plastic surgery years ago for something really major most likely a burn or some kind of deep flesh wound maybe thats the root of her problem i dont know whats the little girl like i didnt see much of her just caught a glimpse when i walked in the front door small and skinny and cute very well dressed your basic little rich girl when i tried to talk to her she scampered away i suspect she actually hid somewhere in her mothers room its a bunch of rooms actually more like a suite while the mother and i were talking i kept hearing little rustles in the background and each time i stopped to listen theyd stop the mother never remarked on it so i didnt say anything figured i was lucky enough just getting up there to see her i said sounds like something out of a gothic novel yes thats exactly what it was gothic sort of spooky not that the mother was spooky she was charming actually sweet in a vulnerable way your basic victorian princess i said she doesnt leave the house at all thats what she said what she confessed shes pretty ashamed not that shames convinced her to try to leave the house when i suggested she see if she could make it to my office she started to get really tense her hands actually started shaking so i backed off but she did agree to have melissa be seen by a psychologist strange strange is your business isnt it i smiled she said have i piqued your interest do you think the mother really wants help for the girl she says she does but more important the kids motivated shes the one who called the help line seven years old and she called herself the volunteer on the line couldnt believe it either the lines not intended for kids once in a while they get a teenager they refer to adolescent medicine but melissa must have seen one of their public service commercials on tv copied down the number and dialed it and she was up late to do it the call came in just after ten pm she lifted the gladstone bag chesthigh popped it open and pulled out a cassette i know it sounds bizarre but ive got the proof right here they tape everything that comes over the line i had them make me a copy i said she must be pretty precocious must be i wish id had a chance to actually spend some time with her what a neat kid to take the initiative she paused what a hurt she must be going through anyway after i listened to the tape i phoned the number she gave the volunteer and reached the mother she had no idea melissa had called when i told her she broke down and started to cry but when i asked her to come in for a consultation she said she was ill and couldnt i thought it was something physically debilitating so i offered to go out there hence my gothic home visit she held the tape out to me if youd like you can have a listen its really something i told the mother id be talking to a psychologist took the liberty of giving her your name but dont feel any pressure i took the cassette thanks for thinking of me but i honestly dont know if i can make home visits to san labrador she can come to the other side of town melissa can a servant will bring her i shook my head in a case like this the mother should be actively involved she frowned i know its not optimal but do you have techniques that can help the girl at all without maternal involvement just lower her anxiety level a bit anything you did might reduce her risk of turning out totally screwed up it would be a real good deed maybe i said if the mother doesnt sabotage therapy i dont think she will shes antsy but seemed to really love the kid the guilt helps us there think how inadequate she must feel the kid calling in like that she knows this isnt the right way to raise a child but cant break out of her own pathology its got to feel horrible for her the way i see it this is the right time to harness the guilt if the kid gets better maybe momll see the light get some help for herself is there a father in the picture no shes a widow it happened when melissa was a baby heart attack i got the impression he was a much older man sounds like you learned a lot from a brief visit her cheeks colored one tries listen i dont expect you to disrupt your life and drive out there on a regular basis but getting a referral closer to home wouldnt make any difference mom never leaves to go anywhere for her half a mile might as well be mars and if they do try therapy and it doesnt work they may never try it again so i want somebody competent after listening to you im convinced youre right for the case id greatly appreciate it if you could accept less than optimal ill make it up to you with some solid referrals in the future okay okay i know i sound overinvolved and maybe i am but the whole idea of a sevenyearold calling in like that and that house she raised her eyebrows besides i figure it wont be long before my practice really gets crazy and i dont have the time to give anyone this kind of individual attention so i might as well enjoy it while i can right another reach into the gladstone anyway heres the relevant data she handed me a piece of note paper topped with the logo of a pharmaceutical company on it shed printed pt melissa dickinson dob mom gina dickinson and a phone number i took it and put it in my pocket thanks she said at least payment wont be a hassle theyre not exactly medical i said are you the physician of record or do they have someone theyve been seeing according to the mother theres a family doctor in sierra madre that melissas seen occasionally in the past immunizations school physicals nothing ongoing physically shes a very healthy girl but hes not really in the picture hasnt been for years she didnt want him contacted whys that the whole therapy thing the stigma to be perfectly frank i had to do a selljob this is san labrador were talking about theyre still fighting the twentieth century but she will cooperate i got a commitment out of her as to whether or not ill end up being their regular doc i dont know either way if you want to send me a report id sure be interested in finding out how she does sure i said you just mentioned school physicals despite the fears does she attend classes regularly she did until recently servants drove her and picked her up parentteacher conferences were conducted over the phone maybe in that neck of the woods its not that strange but it cant have been great for the kid the mother never showing up for anything despite that melissas a terrific student straight as the mother made a point of showing me the report cards i said what do you mean by until recently lately shes been starting to exhibit some definite symptoms of school phobia vague physical complaints crying in the morning claiming shes too scared to go to school the mothers been letting her stay home to me thats a big fat danger sign sure is i said especially with her role model yup the old biopsychosocial chain take enough histories and all you see is chains chain mail i said tough armor she nodded but maybe we can break one this time huh wouldnt that be uplifting i saw patients all afternoon finished a stack of charts as i cleared my desk i listened to the tape female adult voice cathcart help line childs voice barely audible hello adult voice help line how may i help you silence childs voice is this breathy

however she said to tell you that melissa can be at your office any weekday between three and fourthirty do you know when shell be available to talk no im afraid i dont dr delaware but ill apprise her

sir now in the matter of your fee is there a preferred mode of payment a check would be fine mr dutchy and the fee itself i quoted him my hourly rate very good doctor goodbye doctor the next morning a legalsize manila envelope arrived at the office by messenger inside was a smaller rosecolored envelope within that a sheet of rosecolored stationery folded over a check the check was for and was annotated medical treatment for melissa at my rate over forty sessions worth the money had been drawn on a savings account at first fiduciary trust bank in san labrador printed in the upper left corner of the check was rp dickinson trustee dickinson family trust udt sussex knoll san labrador california the stationery was heavy stock folded in half with a crane watermark i opened it at the top in embossed black script regina paddock dickinson below that in a fine graceful hand dear doctor delaware thank you for seeing melissa ill be in touch faithfully yours gina dickinson scented paper a mixture of old roses and alpine air but it didnt sweeten the message dont call us plebe well call you heres a juicy check to suppress any protests i dialed the dickinson residence this time a woman answered middleaged gallic accent voice pitched lower than dutchys different pipes same song madame wasnt available no she had no idea when madame would be available i left my name hung up looked at the check all those digits treatment hadnt even begun and id lost control it wasnt the way to do business wasnt in the best interests of the patient but id committed myself to eileen wagner the tape had committed me a doctor who can help me without shots i thought about it for a long time finally decided id stick it out long enough to do an intake at least see if i could get a rapport with the little girl get some sort of progress going enough to impress the victorian princess dr savior then id start making demands during my lunch hour i cashed the check dutchy was fiftyish midsize and plump with slickeddown tooblack hair parted on the right apple cheeks and razorslash lips he had on a wellcut but oldfashioned doublebreasted blue serge suit starched white shirt linen pocket square windsorknotted navy tie and mirrorbright black bluchers with extra heel when i came out of the inner office he and the girl were standing in the middle of the waiting room she looking down at the carpet he examining the artwork the look on his face said my prints werent passing muster when he turned to face me his expression didnt change all the warmth of a montana hailstorm but the girl clutched his hand as if he were santa claus she was small for her age but had a mature wellformed face one of those children endowed early with the countenance theyll grow old with an oval face just this side of pretty beneath bangs the color of walnut shells the rest of her hair was long almost to her waist and topped with a pink flowered band she had big round graygreen eyes with blond lashes an upturned nose lightly freckled and a pointy pixie chin under a narrow timid mouth her clothes were too formal for school puffedsleeve dress of pink dotted swiss sashed with white satin tied in a bow at the back pink lacetopped socks and white patentleather buckle shoes i thought of carrolls alice encountering the queen of hearts the two of them stood there immobile a cello and a piccolo cast in odd duet i introduced myself bending and smiling at the girl she stared back to my surprise no terror no response at all other than flat appraisal considering what had brought her to the office i was doing great so far her right hand was swallowed by dutchys meaty left one rather than have her relinquish it i smiled again and held out my hand to dutchy he seemed surprised by the gesture and took it with reluctance then let go at the same time he released the girls fingers ill be off now he announced to both of us fortyfive minutes correct doctor correct he took a step toward the door i was looking at the girl bracing myself for resistance but she just stood there staring down at the carpet hands pressed to her sides dutchy took another step and stopped chewing his cheek he turned back and patted the girls head she gave him what appeared to be a reassuring smile bye jacob she said high breathy voice same as on the tape the rose tint spread from dutchys cheeks to the rest of his face he chewed his cheek some more lowered his arm stiffly and mumbled something one last glare at me and he was gone after the door closed i said looks like jacobs a good friend she said hes my mothers retainer but he takes care of you too he takes care of everything everything our house she tapped her foot impatiently i dont have a father and my mother doesnt leave the house so jacob does lots of things for us what kinds of things house things telling madeleine and sabino and carmela and all the service people and the delivery people what to do sometimes he makes food snacks and finger food if hes not too busy madeleine cooks the big hot meals and he drives all the cars sabino only drives the truck all the cars i said do you have a lot she nodded a lot my father liked cars and bought them before he died mother keeps them in the big garage even though she doesnt drive them so jacob has to start them and drive them so they dont get sticky inside the engine theres also a company that comes to wash them every week jacob watches them to make sure they do a good job sounds like jacob keeps busy he does how many cars do you have just one what kind its a dodge dart dodge dart she said pursing her lips and thinking we dont have one of those its not very fancy kind of beatup actually we have one like that a cadillac knockabout cadillac knockabout i said dont think ive ever heard of that model its the one we took today to here a cadillac fleetwood knockabout its black and old jacob says its a workhorse do you like cars melissa shrug not really what about toys do you have any favorites shrug not really ive got toys in my office how about we go check them out she shrugged a third time but allowed me to usher her into the consult room once she was inside her eyes took flight darting and alighting upon desk bookshelves toy chest back to the desk never settling she knitted her hands pulled them apart and began a curious rolling kneading motion turning one set of tiny fingers over the other i walked over to the toy cabinet opened it and pointed ive got lots of stuff in here box games and dolls and clay and playdoh paper and pencils too and crayons if you like to draw in color why should i do that she said do what melissa play or draw mother said we were going to talk your mother was right we are going to talk i said but sometimes kids who come here like to play or draw before they start talking while they get used to this place the hands kneaded faster she looked down also i said playing and talking can help kids express how they feel help get their feelings out i can get my feelings out she said by talking great i said lets talk she took a place on the leather sofa and i sat opposite her in my chair she looked around some more then placed her hands in her lap and stared straight at me i said okay why dont we start by talking about who i am and why youre here im a psychologist do you know what that means she kneaded her fingers and kicked the couch with her heel i have a problem and youre the kind of doctor who helps children who have problems and you dont give any shots very good did jacob tell you all that she shook her head my mother dr wagner told her about you shes my mothers friend i remembered what eileen wagner had said about a brief chat about a little girl wandering and hiding in a big spooky house and wondered what friendship meant to this child but dr wagner met your mother because of you didnt she melissa because of your call to the help line her body tightened and the little hands kneaded faster i noticed that her finger pads were pink slightly chafed yeah but she likes my mother her eyes left mine and stared at the carpet well i said backtracking dr wagner was right about the shots i never give shots dont even know how to give shots unimpressed she looked at her shoes sticking her legs straight out she began bobbling her feet still i said even going to a doctor who doesnt give shots can be scary its a new situation you dont know whats going to happen her head shot up the green eyes defiant im not scared of you good i smiled and im not scared of you either she gave me a look that was part bafflement mostly scorn so much for the old delaware wit not only dont i give shots i said but i dont do anything to the children who come here i work with them as a team they tell me about themselves and when i know enough about them i show them how not to be scared because being scared is something we learn so we can unlearn it spark of interest in the eyes her legs relaxed but more kneading faster she said how many other kids come here lots how many between four and eight a day what are their names i cant tell you that melissa why not its a secret just like i couldnt tell anyone that you came here today unless you gave me permission why because kids who come here talk about things that are private they want privacy do you know what that means privacy she said is going to the bathroom like a young lady all by yourself with the door closed exactly when kids talk about themselves they sometimes tell me things theyve never told anyone part of my job is knowing how to keep a secret so everything that goes on in this room is a secret even the names of the people who come here are secret thats why theres that second door i pointed it goes out to the hall so people can leave the office without going into the waiting room and seeing other people would you like to see no thank you more tension i said is something bothering you right now melissa no would you like to talk about what scares you silence melissa everything everything scares you look of shame how about we start with one thing burglars and intruders reciting without hesitation i said did someone tell you the kinds of questions id be asking you today silence was it jacob nod and your mother no just jacob did jacob also tell you how to answer my questions more hesitation i said if he did thats okay hes trying to help i just want to make sure you tell me how you feel youre the star of this show melissa she said he told me to sit up straight speak clearly and tell the truth the truth about what scared you uhhuh and then maybe you could help me accent on the maybe i could almost hear dutchys voice i said thats fine jacobs obviously a very smart person and he takes good care of you but when you come here youre the boss you can talk about anything you want i want to talk about burglars and intruders okay then thats what well do i waited she said nothing i said what do these burglars and intruders look like theyre not real burglars she said scornful again theyre in my imagination pretend what do they look like in your imagination more silence she closed her eyes the hands kneaded furiously her body took on a faint rocking motion and her face screwed up she appeared to be on the brink of tears i leaned in closer and said melissa we dont have to talk about this right now big she said eyes still closed but dry i realized that the facial tightness wasnt a presage to tears just intense concentration her eyes moved frantically beneath their lids chasing images she said hes big with this big hat sudden stillness beneath the eyelids her hands untangled floated upward and made wide circles and a long coat and and what the hands stopped circling but remained in the air her mouth was slightly parted but no sound came out a slack look came onto her face dreamy hypnotic spontaneous hypnotic induction not uncommon in children her age young kids readily cross the boundary between reality and fantasy the bright ones are often the best hypnotic subjects combine that with the solitary existence eileen wagner had described and i could see her visiting the cinema in her head on a regular basis sometimes though the feature was a horror flick the hands dropped back into her lap found one another and began rolling and kneading the trancelike expression lingered she remained silent i said the burglar wears a big hat and a long coat unconsciously id lowered my voice and slowed it taking her cue the dance of therapy more tension no reply anything else i said gently she was silent i played a hunch an educated guess born of so many other fortyfiveminute hours hes got something else besides a hat and a coat doesnt he melissa something in his hand bag barely audible i said yes the burglar carries a bag for what no reply to put stuff in her eyes snapped open and her hands clamped down on her knees she began rocking again harder and faster head held stiff as if her neck were jointless i leaned over and touched her shoulder bird bones beneath cotton do you want to talk about what goes into the bag melissa she closed her eyes and kept rocking trembled and hugged herself a tear rolled down her cheek i patted her again got a tissue and wiped her eyes half expecting her to pull away but she allowed me to dab the tears dramatic first session movieoftheweek perfect but too much too fast it could jeopardize the therapy i dabbed some more searching for some way to slow it down she killed that notion with a single word kids the burglar puts kids in the sack uhhuh so the burglar is really a kidnapper she opened her eyes stood up faced me and held up her hands as if praying hes a murderer she cried emphasizing each word with a shake a mikoksi with acid a mikoksi a mikoksi with acidthatmeanspoison burning poison mikoksi threw it on her and hes going to come back and burn her again and me too who did he throw poison on melissa mother and now hes going to come back where is this mikoksi now in jail but hes going to get out and hurt us again why would he do that because he doesnt like us he liked mother but then he stopped liking her and he threw poison acid on her and tried to kill her but it only burned her on the face and she was still beautiful and could get married and have me she began pacing the office holding her temples stooped and muttering like a little old woman when did all this happen melissa before i was born rocking face to the wall did jacob tell you about it nod did your mother talk to you about it too hesitation shake of head she doesnt like to whys that it makes her sad she used to be happy and beautiful people took pictures of her then mikoksi burned her face and she had to have operations does mikoksi have another name a first name she turned and faced me truly puzzled i dont know but you know hes in jail yes but hes getting out and its no fair and no justice is he getting out of jail soon more confusion did jacob tell you he was getting out soon no but he did talk to you about justice yes what does justice mean to you being fair she gave me a challenging look and put her hands on the flat place where one day her hips would be tension rumpled the sliver of brow beneath her bangs her mouth curled and she wagged a finger it was no fair and stupid they should have a fair justice they should have killed him with the acid youre very angry at mikoksi another incredulous look at the idiot in the chair i said thats good getting really angry at him when youre angry at him youre not so scared of him both hands had fisted she opened them dropped them sighed and looked at the floor more kneading i went over to her and kneeled so that wed be at eye level if she chose to raise her eyes youre a very smart girl melissa and youve helped me a lot by being brave and talking about scary things i know how much you want not to be afraid anymore ive helped lots of other kids and ill be able to help you silence if you want to talk some more about mikoksi or burglars or anything else thats okay but if you dont thats okay too weve got some more time together before jacob comes back how we spend it is up to you no movement or sound the second hand on the banjo clock across the room completed half a circuit finally she lifted her head looked everywhere but at me then homed in suddenly squinting as if trying to put me in focus ill draw she said but only with pencils not crayons theyre too messy she worked the pencil slowly a tongue tip extending from one corner of her mouth her artistic ability was above average but all the finished product told me was that shed had enough for one day happyface girl next to happyface cat in front of red house and a fattrunked tree full of apples all of it under a huge golden sun with prehensile rays when she was through she pushed it across the desk and said you keep it thank you its terrific when am i coming back how about in two days friday why not tomorrow sometimes its good for kids to take some time to think about what happened before they come in i think fast she said and theres other stuff i didnt say yet you really want to come in tomorrow i want to get better all right then i can see you tomorrow at five if jacob can bring you he will she said he wants me to get better too i saw her out through the separate exit and spotted dutchy walking down the hall a paper bag in one hand when he saw us he frowned and looked at his watch melissa said were coming back to him at five tomorrow jacob dutchy raised his eyebrows and said i believe im right on time doctor you are i said i was just showing melissa the separate exit so other kids wont see me or know who i am she said its privacy i see said dutchy looking up and down the hall i brought you something young lady to tide you over until dinner the top half of the bag was accordionfolded neatly he opened it with his fingertips and drew out an oatmeal cookie melissa squealed took it from him and prepared to bite into it dutchy cleared his throat melissa held the cookie midair thank you jacob youre quite welcome young lady she turned to me would you like some dr delaware no thank you melissa sounding to myself like a charm school candidate she licked her lips and went to work on the cookie i said id like to talk to you for a moment mr dutchy he glanced at his watch again the freeway the longer we wait i said some things came up during the session important things he said really its quite i forced a patient grin and said if im to do my job im going to need help mr dutchy from the look on his face i might have passed wind at an embassy dinner he cleared his throat again and said one moment melissa and walked several feet down the corridor melissa her mouth full of cookie followed him with her eyes i smiled at her said well just be one second hon and joined him he looked up and down the hall and folded his arms across his chest what is it doctor from a foot away he was shaven clean as palmar flesh smelling of bay rum and fresh laundry i said she talked about what happened to her mother some person named mikoksi he flinched really sir its not my place this is important mr dutchy its obviously relevant to her fears its best that her mother true the problem is ive left several messages with her mother that havent been returned normally i wouldnt even see a child without direct parental participation but melissa obviously needs help lots of help i can provide that help but i need information he chewed his cheek so long and hard i was afraid hed gnaw through it down the hall melissa was munching and staring at us he said whatever happened was before the childs time chronologically maybe but not psychologically he stared at me for a long moment a hint of moisture appeared in the corner of his right eye no bigger than the diamond on a budget engagement ring he blinked and made it disappear really this is quite awkward im an employee i said all right i dont want to put you in a difficult position but please deliver the message that someone needs to talk to me as soon as possible melissa scuffed her feet the cookie was gone dutchy gave her a grave but oddly tender look i said i do want to see her tomorrow at five he nodded took a step closer so that we were almost touching and whispered in my ear she pronounces it mikoksi but the damned villains name was mccloskey joel mccloskey lowering his head and pushing it forward like a turtle peeking out of its shell waiting for a reaction expecting me to know something i said doesnt ring any bells the head drew back were you living in los angeles ten years ago doctor i nodded it was in the papers i was in school concentrating on my textbooks march of he said march third a pained look crossed his face this is thats all i can say right now doctor perhaps some other time all right i said see you tomorrow five it is he let out his breath and drew himself up tugging at his lapels he cleared his throat getting back to the present i trust everything proceeded as planned today everything went fine melissa was coming our way the white satin sash had come loose and hung from a single loop scraping the floor dutchy rushed over and tied it brushed crumbs from her dress braced her shoulders and told her to stand up straight young lady a curved spine simply wouldnt do she smiled up at him they held hands as they left the building i saw another patient a few minutes later managed to put the cello and the piccolo out of my mind for three quarters of an hour leaving the office at seven i took a fiveminute drive to the beverly hills library the reading room was crowded with retirees checking out the final stock quotations and teenagers doing their homework or faking it by sevenfifteen i was sitting at a microfilm viewer with a march spool of the times march rolled into view what i was looking for was on the upper left quadrant actress the victim of acid attack hollywood a quiet hillside neighborhood above hollywood boulevard was the scene of a grisly earlymorning assault upon a former fashion model currently under contract to apex motion picture studios that left neighbors of the victim horrorstruck and wondering why regina marie paddock beachwood drive apartment was awakened at home by her doorbell at am by a man claiming to be a western union messenger when she opened the door the man brandished a bottle and flung its contents in her face she collapsed screaming and the assailant described as a male negro five eleven to six two pounds escaped on foot the victim was taken to hollywood presbyterian hospital where she was treated for thirddegree facial burns a hospital spokesman described her condition as serious but stable shes in no mortal danger but is in considerable pain having sustained extensive tissue damage to the left side of her face miraculously her eyes were unaffected an apex spokesman expressed the studios shock and deep regret over the vicious unprovoked attack on the talented gina prince miss paddocks stage name we will do everything within our power to work with the authorities in swiftly apprehending the perpetrator of this heinous crime the victim was born in in denver colorado moved to los angeles at the age of was hired as a photographic and fashion model by the prestigious flax agency and quickly advanced to feature spreads in glamour and vogue after leaving flax she switched to the now defunct belle vue agency eventually left modeling signed with the william morris agency and received an acting contract at apex although she has not yet been cast in a film the studio spokesman said she had been under consideration for several important roles shes a very talented and beautiful young lady well do everything to see that her career remains untainted by this tragic occurrence police are actively searching for the assailant and request that any information be directed to detectives savage or flores at the lapds hollywood division at the center of the article was a head shot that could have been reduced from a vogue cover oval face on a long stalk of neck framed by straight pale hair worn long and layered in a complex style sophisticated for the time arched eyebrows high cheekbones huge pale eyes pouty mouth the shadowy perfection of a study by avedon or someone almost as good i thought of what acid could do to perfection backed away from that and tried to look at the photo as if it were just a photo the features taken singly were almost identical to melissas but the gestalt added up to a good deal more than just this side of pretty i wondered whether puberty would bring melissa to her mothers level of beauty i turned the knob on the viewer a brief summary of gina paddocks medical status appeared in the next days paper condition downgraded to stable no leads another message of sympathy from the studio augmented by a reward for information leading to capture but no more pledges of an untainted career i kept dialing two weeks later suspect in acid attack nabbed apprehended after police receive anonymous tip los angeles police announced the arrest of a suspect in the march earlymorning acid attack that left actress gina prince regina marie paddock permanently disfigured the arrest in south los angeles of melvin louis findlay was announced at an pm press conference at parker center by hollywood division squad commander bryce donnemeister who described findlay as a known felon and recent parolee from the mens colony at chino where he served eighteen months of a threeyear sentence for extortion findlays other arrests and convictions include aggravated assault robbery and vehicular grand theft physical evidence in our possession leads us to believe we have a strong case against this individual said donnemeister he refused to elaborate on whether the victim had identified findlay and offered no details on the arrest other than to say that an anonymous phone tip had led the police to findlay and that subsequent investigation confirmed that the information provided to us was valid miss prince continues to convalesce at hollywood presbyterian hospital where her condition is described as good plastic surgeons have been called in to consult on the reconstruction of her face three days after that former employer arrested in acid assault on actress las vegas the former employer and onetime companion of acid attack victim gina prince regina marie paddock was arrested last night by las vegas police as a prime suspect in the march assault that left the former fashion model and actress with extensive facial disfiguration joel henry mccloskey was arrested in his room at the flamingo hotel where he had registered under a false name and was placed in the custody of the las vegas police department in compliance with a warrant issued by the criminal division of the los angeles superior court lapd hollywood division commander bryce donnemeister said that information provided by another suspect in the case melvin findlay arrested march had incriminated mccloskey it appears at this time that findlay was hired help and mccloskey did the alleged hiring donnemeister added that findlay had worked for mccloskey in in a janitorial capacity but declined further comment pending a full investigation mccloskey a native of new jersey and a former nightclub singer came to los angeles in with aspirations of being an actor when those failed he opened the belle vue modeling agency after luring miss prince away from the larger more established flax agency he tried to serve as her film agent according to hollywood sources mccloskey and miss prince are reported to have developed a personal relationship that ended when miss prince left belle vue and in an attempt to trade fashion modeling for screen stardom signed with the william morris agency shortly after belle vues fortunes plummeted and mccloskey declared bankruptcy on february of this year when asked whether revenge figured as a motive in the attack police commander donnemeister said were reserving comment until the suspect has been fully and properly questioned miss prince continues to recuperate at hollywood presbyterian hospital where plans are being made for her to undergo extensive reconstructive surgery there was a photo with this one too a small dark slender man being led away by two detectives who dwarfed him he had on a sport coat slacks and an openneck white shirt his head was lowered and his longish hair hung down over the top half of his face what was visible of the bottom half was angular grim james deanish and in need of a shave it took a while to locate the conclusion of the case mccloskeys extradition and arraignment melvin findlays agreement to plead guilty and testify against mccloskey in return for a simple assault conviction mccloskeys indictment for attempted murder conspiracy to commit murder and mayhem arraignment proceedings then a threemonth lag until the trial the judicial process was swift the prosecutor distributed selections from gina princes modeling portfolio to the jurors followed by closeups of her ravaged face taken in the emergency room a brief appearance by the victim bandaged and sobbing testimony by medical experts to the effect that her face would be scarred permanently melvin findlay testified that mccloskey had hired him to trash the obscenity girls face make sure she was no obscenity good for nobody and if she died he wouldnt have no obscenity problem with that too the prosecution produced a taped confession that the defense tried unsuccessfully to challenge the tape was played in open court mccloskey tearfully admitting to hiring findlay to maim gina prince but refusing to explain why the defense didnt dispute the facts but attempted an insanity defense which was hampered by mccloskeys refusal to talk to the hiredgun psychiatrists the prosecutions psychiatric pistol testified to observing mccloskey in the county jail and finding him uncooperative and depressed but lucid and free of serious mental disease it took two hours for the jury to bring in guilty verdicts on all charges at the sentencing hearing the judge called mccloskey an abject monster one of the most despicable defendants it has been my displeasure to encounter in my twenty years on the bench and handed down a combination of sentences that added up to twentythree years in san quentin everyone seemed satisfied even mccloskey who fired his lawyers and refused to appeal after the trial the press tried to interview the jurors they chose to have their foreman speak for them and he was concise only a semblance of justice could be accomplished said jacob p dutchy an executive aide at dickinson industries pasadena this young ladys life will never be the same but we did what we could to ensure that mccloskey pays the harshest penalty possible under the law a mikoksi with acid twentythree years in san q time off for good behavior could cut it in half a belated appeal might shave off more meaning mccloskeys release could be imminent if it hadnt already taken place no doubt dutchy would know the precise release date hed be the type to follow that kind of thing closely i wondered how he and the childs mother had explained it all to melissa dutchy interesting fellow throwback to another age from juror to retainer i was curious about the evolution but had little hope of satisfying my curiosity the way things were going id be lucky to get an accurate history on my patient i thought of dutchys secretiveness and devotion gina dickinson had the ability to inspire strong loyalties was it the helplessness the same princessindistress frailty that had brought eileen wagner out on a house call what did growing up with a mother like that do to a child men with sacks same dream id heard from so many other children almost an archetype children id cured but i sensed this child would be different no easy heroism here i had a deli dinner at nate n al on beverly drive corned beef on rye accompanied by the tapeloop blather of hollywood types shmoozing about pending deals drove home and phoned a san labrador exchange that had stuck in my head this time an answering machine with jacob dutchys voice informed me no one was available and invited me halfheartedly to leave a message i repeated my urgent desire to speak with the lady of the house at sussex knoll no callback that evening nor the following day and as pm approached i resigned myself to pumping dutchy for information again awkward position be damned but he didnt show up instead melissa was accompanied by a mexican man in his sixties broad and lowslung hard and muscular despite his age with a thin gray mustache beak nose and hands as rough and brown as cedar bark he wore khaki work clothes and rubbersoled shoes and held a sweatstained beige canvas hat in front of his groin this is sabino said melissa he takes care of our plants i said hello and introduced myself the gardener smiled uncomfortably and muttered hernandez sabino today we took the truck said melissa and looked down on everyone i said wheres jacob she shrugged doing stuff at the mention of dutchys name hernandez stood up straighter i thanked him and told him melissa would be free in fortyfive minutes then i noticed he wasnt wearing a watch take a seat if youd like i said or you can leave and come back at five fortyfive okeh he remained standing i pointed to a chair he said ohh and sat down still holding his hat i took melissa into the consult room healers challenge put aside my annoyance at the way the adults were fancydancing around me and concentrate on the child plenty to concentrate on today she began talking the moment she sat down looking away from me and reciting her terrors nonstop in a singsong oralreport voice that told me shed studied hard for therapy closing her eyes as she went on and climbing in power and pitch until she was nearly shouting then stopping and shivering with dread as if shed suddenly visualized something overwhelming but before i could say anything she was off again fluctuating between blurt and whisper like a radio with a broken volume control monsters big bad things what kinds of big bad things melissa i dont know just bad she went silent again bit down on her lower lip began rocking i put my hand on her shoulder she opened her eyes and said i know theyre imaginary but they still scare me imaginary things can be very scary saying it in a soothing voice but shed reeled me into her world and i was flashing mental pictures of my own gibbering hordes of fanged and hooded shadowthings that lurked in the nightgloom trapdoors unlatched by the death of light trees turned to witches shrubs to hunched slimy corruptions the moon a looming voracious fire the power of empathy and more memories of other nights so long ago a boy in a bed listening to the winds whip across the missouri flatlands i broke away from that and focused on what she was saying thats why i hate to sleep going to sleep brings the dreams what kinds of dreams she shivered again and shook her head i make myself stay awake but then i cant stop it anymore and i sleep and the dreams come i took her fingers in mine and stilled them with touch and therapeutic murmurings she turned silent i said do you have bad dreams every night yes and more mother said one time there were seven seven bad dreams in one night yes do you remember them she liberated her hand closed her eyes and retreated to a detached tone a sevenyearold clinician presenting at case conference the case of a certain nameless little girl who woke up cold and sweating from her sleeping place at the foot of her mothers bed lurching awake heart pounding clawing the sheets to keep from falling endlessly uncontrollably into a huge black maw clawing but losing her grip and feeling everything float away like a kite with a broken string crying out in the darkness and rolling hurtling toward her mothers warm body a loveseeking missile mothers arm reaching out unconsciously and drawing her near lying there frozen staring up at the ceiling trying to convince herself it was just a ceiling that the things crawling up there werent couldnt be real inhaling mothers perfume listening to mothers light snores making sure mother was deep asleep before reaching out and touching satin and lace a stretch of soft armflesh then up to the face the good side somehow she always ended up next to the good side freezing again as she said good side for the second time her eyes opened she threw a panicky glance at the separate exit a convict weighing the risks of jailbreak too much too soon leaning in close i told her shed done well we could spend the rest of the session drawing again or playing a game she said im scared of my room whys that its big too big for you a guilty look crossed her face guilty confusion i asked her to tell me more about her room she painted more pictures tall ceiling with pictures of ladies in fancy dresses on it pink carpets pinkandgray lamb and pussycat wallpaper that mother had picked especially for her when she was a baby in a crib toys music boxes and miniature dishes and glass figurines three separate dollhouses a zoo of stuffed animals a canopy bed from somewhere else far away she forgot where with pillows and a fluffy comforter filled with goose feathers lacetrimmed windows that were round on top and went almost up to the ceiling windows with bits of colored glass in them that made colored pictures on your skin a seat in front of one of the windows that had a view of the grass and the flowers sabino tended all day she wanted to call down and say hello to him but was afraid to get too close to the window sounds like a huge room i said not just one room a bunch theres a sleeping room and a bathroom and a dressing room with mirrors and lights all around them next to my closet and a playroom thats where most of the toys are but the stuffed animals are in the sleeping room jacob calls the sleeping room the nursery which means a baby room frown does jacob treat you like a baby no i havent used a crib since i was three do you like having such a big room no i hate it i never go inside it the guilty look returned two minutes until the session was over she hadnt budged from her chair since shed sat down i said youre doing a great job melissa ive really learned a lot but how about we stop for now she said i dont like to be alone ever no one likes to be alone for a long time even grownups get afraid of that i dont like it ever i waited until my birthday till i was seven to go to the bathroom by myself with the door closed and privacy sitting back daring me to disapprove i said who went with you till you were seven jacob and mother and madeleine and carmela kept me company till i was four then jacob said i was a young lady now only ladies should be with me so he stopped going then when i was seven i decided to go there alone it made me cry and hurt my stomach and once i threw up but i did it with the door closed a little then all the way but i still dont lock it no way another dare i said you did great frown sometimes it still makes me nervous id still like to have someone there not looking just there keeping me company but i dont ask them good for you i said you fought your fear and beat it yes she said astonished translating ordeal into victory for what appeared to be the first time did your mother and jacob tell you you did a good job uhhuh dismissive wave they always says nice things well you did do a good job you won a tough fight that means you can win other fights beat up other fears one by one we can work together and pick the fears you want to fight then plan how well do it step by step slowly so its never scary for you if youd like we can start the next time youre here on monday i got up she stayed in her chair i want to talk some more id like to too melissa but our time is up just a little hint of whine we really have to end now ill see you on monday which is only i touched her shoulder she shrugged me off and her eyes got wet i said im sorry melissa i wish there she shot out of the chair and shook a finger at me if your job is to help me why cant you help me now stamping her foot because our sessions together have to end at a certain time why i think you know cause you have to see other kids yes whatre their names i cant talk about that melissa remember how come theyre more important than me theyre not melissa youre very important to me then why are you kicking me out before i could answer she burst into tears and headed for the door to the waiting room i followed her wondering for the thousandth time about the sanctity of the threequarter hour the idolatry of the clock but knowing also the importance of limits for any child but especially this one who seemed to have so few whod been sentenced to live out her formative years in the terrible unbounded splendor of a fairytale world nothing scarier than fairy tales when i got to the waiting room she was tugging at hernandezs hand crying and insisting come on sabino he stood looking frightened and puzzled when he saw me puzzlement changed to suspicion i said shes a little upset please have her mother call me as soon as possible blank look su madre i said el teléfono ill see her monday at five lunes cinco okeh he glared and squeezed his hat melissa stamped her foot twice and said no way im never coming back here never yanking at the rough brown hand hernandez stood and continued to study me his eyes were watery and dark and had hardened as if he were considering retribution i thought of all the protective layers surrounding this child how ineffectual all of it was i said goodbye melissa see you monday no way she ran out hernandez put on his hat and went after her i checked with my service at days end no messages from san labrador i wondered how hernandez had communicated what hed seen prepared myself for a cancellation of the monday appointment but no message to that effect came that evening or the next day maybe they wouldnt offer that courtesy to a plebe i phoned the dickinson household and got dutchy on the third ring hello doctor that same formality but no irritation im calling to confirm melissas appointment on monday monday he said yes i have that five oclock correct thats it is there anything available earlier by chance the traffic from our side of thats all ive got mr dutchy five it is then thank you for calling doctor and good eve one second i said theres something you need to know melissa got upset today left the office in tears oh she seemed in fine spirits when she got home did she say anything to you about not wanting to come on monday no what was the trouble doctor nothing serious she wanted to stay past the appointed time and when i told her she couldnt she burst into tears i see shes used to having her way isnt she mr dutchy silence i said im mentioning it because that may be part of the problem lack of limits for a child it can be like drifting in the ocean without an anchor some changes in basic discipline may be in order doctor im not in any position to of course i forgot why dont you put mrs dickinson on the phone right now and ill discuss it with her im afraid mrs dickinson is indisposed i can wait or call back if you can let me know when she will be disposed sigh doctor please im not able to move mountains i wasnt aware i was asking you to silence throat clear i said are you able to deliver a message certainly tell mrs dickinson this is an untenable situation that although i have compassion for her situation shes going to have to stop avoiding me if she wants me to treat melissa dr delaware please this is quite you really mustnt give up on the child shes so such a good smart little girl it would be a terrible waste if if what please doctor im trying to be patient mr dutchy but im really having trouble understanding what the big deal is im not asking mrs dickinson to leave her house all i want to do is talk i understand her situation i did my research march does she have a phobia of the telephone too pause its doctors she had so many surgeries so much pain they kept taking her apart like a jigsaw puzzle and putting her back together again im not denigrating the medical profession her surgeon was a magician he nearly restored her externally but inside she just needs time dr delaware give me time ill get her to see how vital it is she contact you but please be patient sir my turn to sigh he said shes not without insight into her into the situation but after what the womans been through shes afraid of doctors i said yet she met with dr wagner yes he said that was a surprise she doesnt cope well with surprises are you saying she had some sort of adverse reaction just to meeting with dr wagner lets just say it was difficult for her but she did it mr dutchy and survived that could be therapeutic in and of itself doctor is it because im a man would it be easier for her to deal with a female therapist no he said absolutely not its not that at all just doctors i said of any gender thats correct pause please dr delaware his voice had softenedplease be patient all right but in the meantime someones going to have to give me facts details melissas developmental history the family structure you deem that absolutely necessary yes and it needs to be soon all right he said ill fill you in within the limitations of my situation what does that mean i said nothing nothing at all ill give you a comprehensive history tomorrow at noon i said well have lunch i dont generally have lunch doctor then you can watch me eat mr dutchy youll be doing most of the talking anyway i picked a place midway between the west side and his part of town one i thought sufficiently conservative for his sensibilities the pacific dining car on sixth near witmer just a few blocks west of downtown dim rooms polished mahogany paneling red leather linen napkins lots of financial types and corporate attorneys and political backstagers eating prime beef and talking zoning variances sports scores supply and demand hed arrived early and was waiting for me in a back booth dressed in the same blue suit or its twin as i approached he halfrose and gave a courtly bow i sat down called for the waiter and ordered chivas straight up dutchy asked for tea we waited for the drinks without talking despite his frosty demeanor he looked out of his element and slightly pitiable a nineteenthcentury man transported to a distant vulgar future he couldnt hope to comprehend caught in an awkward position my ire had faded since yesterday and id pledged to avoid confrontation so i started by telling him how much i appreciated his taking the time to see me he said nothing and looked thoroughly uncomfortable small talk was clearly out of the question i wondered if anyone had ever called him by his first name the waiter brought the drinks dutchy regarded his tea with the inherently disapproving scrutiny of an english peer finally raised his cup to his lips sipped and put it down quickly not hot enough i said no its fine sir how long have you worked for the dickinson family twenty years long before the trial then he nodded and raised his cup again but didnt put it to his lips being assigned to the jury was a stroke of fate not one that i welcomed at first i wanted to apply for exemption but mr dickinson preferred i serve said it was my civic duty he was a civicminded man his lip trembled when did he die seven and a half years ago surprised i said before melissa was born mrs dickinson was expecting melissa when it he looked up startled and swung his head to the right the waiter was approaching from that direction bearing the blackboard imperious and wellspoken and black as coal dutchys african cousin i chose the tbone steak bloody rare dutchy asked if the shrimp was fresh that day and when informed that it certainly was ordered shrimp salad when the waiter left i said how old was mr dickinson when he died sixtytwo how did he die on the tennis court the lip trembled some more but the rest of his face remained impassive he fumbled with his teacup and tightened his mouth did your serving on the jury have anything to do with getting them together mr dutchy nod thats what i meant by a stroke of fate mr dickinson came with me to court sat in during the trial and was entranced by her hed followed the case in the papers before i was impaneled had commented several times over his morning paper on the profoundness of the tragedy had he known mrs dickinson before the attack no not in the least his concern in the beginning was thematic and he was a kind man i said im not sure i understand what you mean by thematic grief for beauty lost he said like a teacher announcing an essay theme mr dickinson was a great aesthete a conservationist and a preservationist hed spent much of his life dedicated to beautifying his world and was terribly hurt by the degradation of beauty however he never allowed his concern to cross ethical bounds when i was selected for the jury he said hed be accompanying me to court but that both of us needed to be quite scrupulous about not discussing the case he was also an honest man dr delaware diogenes would have rejoiced an aesthete i said what kind of business was he in he looked down his nose at me im referring to mr arthur dickinson sir once more no bells this guy had a way of making me feel like a d student rather than come across a complete philistine i said of course the philanthropist he continued to stare at me i said so how did the two of them finally meet the trial intensified mr dickinsons concern hearing her testimony seeing her face bandaged he visited her in the hospital as chance had it hed been a benefactor of the very surgical wing in which shed been placed he conferred with the doctors and made sure she was receiving the very best care brought in the top man in the plastics field professor albano montecino from brazil a true genius the man had done pioneering work in facial construction mr dickinson arranged for him to obtain medical privileges and exclusive use of an operating room sweat had glossed dutchys brow he pulled out a handkerchief and patted such pain he said facing me squarely seventeen separate surgeries doctor someone with your background can appreciate what that means seventeen invasions each one excruciating months of recuperation long stretches of immobility you can understand why shes taken to solitude i nodded and said were the operations successful professor montecino was pleased pronounced her one of his grand triumphs does she agree with him disapproving look im not privy to her opinions doctor over how long a period was she operated on five years i did some mental calculations so she was pregnant during part of it yes well the pregnancy interrupted the surgical process tissue changes brought about by hormones physical risks professor montecino said shed have to wait and be monitored closely he even suggested termination but she refused was the pregnancy planned dutchy blinked hard and drew back his head the turtle once more as if unable to believe what hed heard good lord sir i dont pry into the motivations of my employers i said excuse me if i wander into uncharted territory from time to time mr dutchy im just trying to get as full a background as possible for melissas sake he harrumphed shall we talk about melissa then all right shes told me quite a bit about her fears why dont you give me your impressions my impressions your observations my observations are that shes a terribly frightened little girl everything frightens her such as he thought for a moment loud noises for one they can literally make her jump even those that arent very loud at times it seems to be the suddenness of it that sets her off a tree rustling or footsteps or even music has the ability to put her in a crying fit the doorbell it seems to occur when shes been in a period of unusual calm sitting by herself daydreaming yes she daydreams a lot talks to herself closing his mouth wanting a comment from me i said what about bright lights have they ever scared her yes he said surprised yes they have i can recall a specific incident several months ago one of the maids purchased a camera with a flashbulb and was traipsing around the house trying it out another disapproving look she surprised melissa as the child ate breakfast and snapped a picture the sound and sight of the bulb going off distressed melissa greatly distressed her in what way tears screaming breakfast rejected she even started hyperventilating i had her breathe into a paper bag until her respiration returned to normal shift in arousal i said more to myself than to him pardon me doctor sudden changes in arousal in her psychophysiologic level of consciousness seem to bother her yes i suppose they do what can be done about that i held out my hand in a restraining gesture she told me she has bad dreams every night thats true he said often more than once a night describe what she does while shes having them i cant say doctor when they occur shes with her moth i frowned he caught himself however i do recall observing a few incidents she cries a lot cries and screams thrashes around and fights comfort refusing to go back to sleep thrashes around i said does she ever talk about what she saw in the dream at times but not always no when she does are there any consistent themes monsters ghosts that kind of thing i dont really pay much mind my efforts are concentrated on getting her settled one thing you can do in the future i said is pay close mind keep a written record of what she says during these incidents and bring it in to me i realized i sounded imperious wanting to make him the d student power struggle with a butler but he was comfortable with the subservient role said very well sir and raised his teacup to his lips i said does she seem completely awake after having a nightmare no she doesnt he said not always sometimes she sits up with a horrid frozen look on her little face screaming inconsolably and waving her hands we i try to wake her but its impossible shes even gotten out of her bed and walked around still screaming impossible to wake we just wait until it subsides then return her to bed to her own bed no her mothers she never sleeps in her own bed shake of the head no she sleeps with her mother okay i said lets get back to those times when she cant be awakened does she scream about anything in particular no there are no words just a terrible howling wince its really quite disturbing youre describing something called night terrors i said theyre not nightmares which take place as do all dreams during light sleep night terrors occur when the sleeper arouses too quickly from deep sleep rudely awakened so to speak its a disorder of arousal related to sleepwalking and bedwetting does she wet the bed occasionally how often four or five times a week sometimes less sometimes more have you done anything about it shake of the head does it bother her that she wets the bed on the contrary he said she seems rather casual about it so you have talked to her about it only to tell her once or twice that young ladies need to be careful about their personal hygiene she ignored me and i didnt pursue it how does her mother feel how does her mother react to the wetting she has the sheets changed its her bed being wet that doesnt bother her apparently not doctor what do these attacks these terrors mean medically speaking theres probably a genetic component involved i said night terrors run in families so do bedwetting and sleepwalking all of it probably has something to do with brain chemistry he looked worried i said but they arent dangerous just disruptive and they usually go away by themselves without treatment by adolescence ah he said so time is on our side yes it is but that doesnt mean we should ignore them they can be treated and theyre also a warning sign theres more than just pure biology involved stress often increases the number of attacks and prolongs them shes telling us shes troubled mr dutchy telling us with her other symptoms as well yes of course the waiter arrived with the food we ate in silence and though dutchy had said he didnt take lunch he consumed his shrimp with genteel fervor when we finished i ordered a double espresso and he had his teapot refilled after finishing my coffee i said getting back to the genetic issue are there any other children from a previous marriage no though there was a previous marriage for mr dickinson but no children what happened to the first mrs dickinson he looked annoyed she died of leukemia a fine young woman the marriage had only lasted two years it was very difficult for mr dickinson thats when he plunged himself more deeply into his art collection what did he collect paintings drawings and etchings antiquities tapestries he had an exceptional eye for composition and color sought out damaged masterpieces and had them restored some he restored himself hed learned the craft as a student that was his true passion restoration i thought of him restoring his second wife as if hed read my mind dutchy gave me a sharp look what else i said besides loud noises and bright lights is melissa afraid of the darkness being alone and at times nothing at all what do you mean shell throw a fit with no provocation what does a fit look like very similar to what ive already described crying rapid breathing running around screaming sometimes shell simply lie on the floor and kick her feet or clutch the nearest adult and hold on like a a limpet do these fits generally occur after shes been refused something not typically there is that of course she doesnt take kindly to being restricted what child does so she has tantrums but these fits go beyond that im referring to genuine fear doctor panic it seems to come out of nowhere does she ever say whats scaring her monsters bad things sometimes she claims to hear noises or see and hear things things no one else hears or sees yes tremble in his voice i said does that bother you more than the other symptoms one does wonder he said softly if youre worried about psychosis or some sort of thought disorder dont unless theres something else going on that you havent told me like selfdestructive behavior or bizarre speech no no nothing like that he said i suppose its all part of her imagination thats exactly what it is shes got a good one but from what ive seen shes very much in touch with reality children her age typically see and hear things that adults dont he looked doubtful i said its all part of play play is fantasy the theater of childhood kids compose dramas in their heads talk to imaginary playmates its a kind of selfhypnosis thats necessary for healthy growth he remained noncommittal but was listening i said fantasy can be therapeutic mr dutchy can actually reduce fears by giving children a sense of control over their lives but for certain children those who are highstrung introverted those living in stressful environments that same ability to paint mental pictures can lead to anxiety the pictures simply become too vivid once again there may be a constitutional factor you said her father was an excellent art restorer did he show any other sort of creativity most definitely he was an architect by trade and a gifted painter in his own right when he was younger whyd he stop he convinced himself he wasnt good enough to justify devoting much time to it destroyed all his work never painted again and began collecting traveling the world his architecture degree was from the sorbonne he loved europe he built some lovely buildings before he invented the strut the strut yes he said as if explaining the abcs the dickinson strut its a process for strengthening steel used extensively in construction what about mrs dickinson i said she was an actress any other creative outlets there i have no idea doctor how long has she been agoraphobic afraid to leave the house she leaves the house he said oh yes sir she strolls the grounds does she ever leave the grounds no how large are the grounds six and threequarter acres approximately does she stroll them extensively from corner to corner throat clear cheek chew she prefers to remain fairly close to the house is there anything else doctor my initial question remained unanswered hed nitpicked his way out of giving a direct reply how long has she been that way not leaving the grounds from the beginning from the time of the attack yes yes its quite logical really when one understands the chain of events when mr dickinson brought her home right after the wedding she was in the midst of the surgical process in great agony still very frightened traumatized by the by what had been done to her she never left her room on professor montecinos orders she was ordered to lie still for hours at a time the new flesh had to be kept extremely supple and clean special air filters were brought in to remove particles that might pollute her nurses hovered around the clock with treatments and injections and lotions and baths that made her cry out in terrible pain she couldnt have left even if shed wanted to then the pregnancy she was restricted to total bed rest bandaged and unbandaged constantly four months into the pregnancy mr dickinson passed on and she it was a safe place for her she couldnt leave surely thats obvious so in a sense its completely logical isnt it the way she is shes gravitated to her safe place you see that dont you doctor i do but the challenge now is to find out whats safe for melissa yes he said of course avoiding my glance i called the waiter over and ordered another espresso when it arrived along with more hot water for dutchy he wrapped his hands around his teacup but didnt drink as i took a sip he said forgive my presumption doctor but what in your educated opinion is the prognosis for melissa given family cooperation id say good shes motivated and bright and has a lot of insight for someone her age but its going to take time yes of course doesnt anything worthwhile suddenly he pressed forward hands flapping fingers wiggling an odd bit of fluster for such a staid man i smelled bay rum and shrimp for a moment i thought he was going to grab my fingers but he stopped himself abruptly as if at an electrified fence please help her doctor i pledge everything in my power to aid your treatment his hands were still in the air he noticed it and gave a look of chagrin ten fingers plummeted to the table like gunshot ducks youre very devoted to this family i said he winced and looked away as if id exposed some secret vice as long as she comes in ill treat her mr dutchy what you can do to help is tell me everything i need to know yes of course is there something else mccloskey what does she know about him nothing she mentioned his name thats all he is to her a name children hear things yes they do and shes heard plenty she knows he attacked her mother with acid because he didnt like her what else has she been told about him nothing truly as i said children overhear but hes not a topic of conversation in our household mr dutchy in lieu of accurate information children make up their own facts it would be best for melissa to understand what happened to her mother his knuckles were white around the cup what are you suggesting sir that someone sit down and talk with melissa explain to her why mccloskey had mrs dickinson attacked he relaxed conspicuously explain why yes yes i can see your point theres just one problem whats that nobody knows why the bastard never let on and nobody knows now if youll excuse me doctor i really must be going on monday melissa was in a great mood cooperative and polite no more testing of limits no remnants of the last sessions power struggle but reserved less eager to talk asking if she could draw instead the typical new patient as if all that had happened till now had been some kind of probation and this was the real beginning she started with the same kind of benign productions shed presented to me during our first session then progressed quickly to deeper pigments sunless skies patches of gray foreboding images she sketched sadlooking animals anemic gardens forlorn children in static poses flitting from subject to subject but by the second half of the session she found a theme that she stayed with a series of houses without doors or windows bulky drunkenly listing visceroid structures fashioned of painstakingly rendered stone and set amidst groves of skeletal trees under a gloomy crosshatched sky several sheets later she added gray shapes approaching the houses gray that turned to black and became human menshapes wearing hats and long coats and bearing lumpy sacks drawing with such fury that she ripped the paper starting over pencils and crayons diminished to nubs consumed like kindling every finished product was shredded with glee she worked that way for three weeks straight leaving the office without comment at sessions end marching like a little soldier by the fourth week she began to round out the last ten or fifteen minutes with silent stretches of game playing chutes and ladders crazy eights go fish no conversation competing with great determination and little apparent pleasure sometimes dutchy brought her to the office but increasingly it was hernandez who still regarded me with a jaundiced eye then other chaperons began to appear a series of dark lean youths young men who smelled of worksweat and looked so alike that in my mind they became interchangeable i learned from melissa they were hernandezs five sons alternating with them was a big doughy woman about dutchys age with tightly braided hair and cheeks like windbellows the owner of the deep gallic voice madeleine the cookmaid invariably she arrived sweating and looking fatigued all of them slipped away the moment melissa stepped over the threshold returning to pick her up precisely at sessions end their punctuality and avoidance of eye contact smacked of dutchys tutelage dutchy the few times he showed up was the most adroit at escape not even stepping into the waiting room no followup on my request to collect data i should have been resentful but as time went on it bothered me less and less because melissa seemed to be getting better without him without any of them ten weeks since therapy had started and she was a different child unburdened conspicuously calm no more kneading no more pacing allowing herself to smile loosening up as she played laughing at my repertoire of gradeschool jokes acting like a kid and though she continued to resist talking about her fears about anything substantive her drawings had become less frantic the sackmen were vanishing windows and doors sprouted like buds on the stone faces of houses that now stood plumbstraight drawings that she preserved and presented to me with pride progress or just a sevenyearold putting on a happy face for her therapists sake knowing what she was like outside the office would have helped my assessment but those who could tell me shunned me as if i were a virus even eileen wagner was out of the picture id phoned her office several times and gotten her answering service despite being careful to call during business hours slow practice i supposed she was probably moonlighting to make ends meet i called the medical staff office at western pediatrics to find out if she had another job they had nothing else listed i phoned her office again left messages that went unanswered strange considering the dedication shed shown in arranging the referral but everything related to this case smacked of strange and id gotten used to it remembering what eileen had told me about melissas fulminating school phobia i asked melissa the name of her school looked up the number and called it presenting myself as her doctor and not clarifying when the clerk assumed pediatrician i asked to speak with melissas teacher a mrs vera adler who confirmed that melissa had missed a good deal of school early in the semester but since then her attendance had been perfect and her social life seemed better was she having social problems mrs adler i wouldnt say that no i mean she was never a problem of any sort doctor but she wasnt the most outgoing child kind of shy off in her own world now she mixes more was she ill before doctor just the usual stuff i said just following up well shes doing fine we were starting to worry she was absent so much but shes fine now a very nice extremely bright little girl she tests out on the iowa at the ninetyninth percentile were so glad shes gotten adjusted i thanked her and hung up heartened said to hell with the grownups and continued to do my job by the fourth month of treatment melissa was treating the office as if it were a second home sauntering in smiling making a beeline for the drawing table she knew every cranny could tell when a book had been moved from its usual place was quick to put it back restoring showing an unusual eye for detail that jibed with the perceptual sensitivity dutchy had described a child whose senses ran on full throttle for her life would never be boring could it ever be tranquil as the fifth month began she announced she was ready to talk again informing me that she wanted to be a team just like id said at the beginning sure what would you like to work on the dark i rolled up my sleeves ready to muster every kernel of wisdom id gathered since grad school first i taught her to recognize the physical warning signs of anxiety how she felt when the fear came on then i trained her in deep relaxation that evolved into fullblown hypnosis because of her ease at drifting into imagery she learned selfhypnosis in a single session could sink into trance within seconds i supplied her with finger signals she could use to communicate while under and finally began the desensitization process seating her in a chair i told her to close her eyes and imagine herself sitting in the dark a dark room watching as her body grew taut and her index finger popped up i warded off the tension with suggestions of deep calm and wellbeing when shed relaxed once more i had her return to the dark room onoff over and over again until she could tolerate the image after a week or so shed mastered the imaginary darkness and was ready to tackle the real enemy i drew the outer office drapes and manipulated the lightswitch rheostat getting her accustomed to gradually increasing dimness stretching the time that she sat in partial darkness and reacting to evidence of tension with instructions for deeper and deeper relaxation eleven sessions into the treatment i was able to pull the blackout drapes closed plunging both of us into total darkness counting the seconds out loud and homing in on the sound of her breathing ready to move in at the merest catch or quickening determined shed never experience prolonged anxiety rewarding each success with high praise and low art cheap plastic toys that i bought in bulk at the fiveanddime they thrilled her by the end of the month she could sit in blackness which sometimes made me lose my balance for an entire session free of tension chatting about school soon she was as nocturnal as a bat i suggested it might be a good time to work on her sleep she smiled and agreed i was especially eager because this was my bailiwick during my internship id been presented with several cases of children with chronic night terrors and had been impressed with the level of disruption the episodes caused in kids and their families but none of the psychologists or psychiatrists at the hospital knew how to treat the disorder officially there was no treatment other than tranquilizers and sedatives whose effects were unpredictable in children i went to the hospital library chased down references found plenty of theory but nothing about treatment frustrated i sat for a long time thinking and decided to try something outlandish operant conditioning bald behavior therapy reward the children for not having terrors and see what happened simpleminded almost crude theoretically it made no sense as the senior staff was quick to inform me over their fuming pipes how could unconscious behavior arousal from profoundly deep sleep be consciously manipulated what could voluntary conditioning accomplish in the face of hardwired deviance but research had emerged recently that suggested greater voluntary control over body function than had ever been imagined patients learning how to raise and lower skin temperature and blood pressure even mask severe pain at psychiatric case conference i asked for permission to try to decondition night terrors arguing that there was nothing to lose a lot of headshaking and words of discouragement but consent was granted it worked all my patients got better and stayed better the senior staff started implementing my plan with their patients and achieved similar results the chief psychologist told me to write it up for a scientific journal listing him as coauthor i sent the article in overcame skeptical reviewers with columns of numbers and statistical tests and got published within a year other therapists had begun to replicate my findings i received requests for reprints and phone calls from all over the world was asked to give lectures had been doing just that the day eileen wagner had approached it was the lecture that had led me to melissa and now melissa was ready to be treated by the expert but there was a problem the techniquemy technique depended upon family cooperation someone needed to monitor the patients sleep pattern precisely i buttonholed dutchy on a friday afternoon before he had a chance to dash away he gave a resigned look and said what is it doctor i handed him a pad of graph paper and two sharpened pencils and adopting the demeanor of a full professor gave him his orders before bedtime melissa was to practice relaxation he wasnt to badger or remind her it would be her responsibility his job was to record the occurrence and frequency of night terrors nights without terrors were to be rewarded the following morning with one of the trinkets she seemed to love so much nights following terrors were not to be commented on but doctor he said shes not having them not having what the terrors her sleeps been perfectly calm for weeks the bedwettings also ceased i looked over at melissa shed stepped behind him half a small face peeked out enough for me to see the smile pure joy reveling in her secret as if it were confection that made sense the way shed been brought up secrets were the coin of the realm the change has really been quite remarkable dutchy was saying thats why i didnt feel it was necessary to i said im really proud of you melissa im proud of you dr delaware she said starting to giggle were an excellent team she continued to get better more rapidly than science could explain leapfrogging over my clinical games plans healing herself magic one of my wiser supervisors had once said sometimes theyll get better and you wont know why before youve even started doing what you think is so goddam clever and hotshot scientific dont fight it just put it down to magic its as good an explanation as any she made me feel magical we never got into the topics id thought essential to explore death injury loneliness a mikoksi with acid despite the frequency of sessions her chart was thin i had very little to record i began to wonder if i was functioning as anything more than a highpriced babysitter told myself there were worse things to be and faced with the onslaught of difficult cases that seemed to grow each month as my practice burgeoned i was thankful for the chance to be passive and magical for fortyfive minutes a day three times a week after eight months she informed me that all her fears were gone risking her wrath i suggested reducing our time together to two sessions a week she agreed so readily that i knew shed been thinking the same thing nevertheless i expected a few backward steps as the loss sank in and she attempted to buy herself time and attention it never happened and at years end she was down to one session per week the quality of the sessions changed too more casual lots of gameplaying no drama therapy winding itself down triumph i thought eileen wagner would like to know made one more attempt to reach her got a disconnectednumber recording called the hospital and learned shed closed her practice resigned from the staff left no forwarding address puzzling but she wasnt my concern and one less report to write wasnt something id mourn for such a complicated case it had turned out surprisingly simple patient and doctor slaying demons what could be purer the checks from fiduciary first trust kept coming three figures at a shot the week of her ninth birthday she arrived with a gift i had none for her had decided long ago never to buy patients anything but she didnt seem to mind and glowed from the act of giving a gift too big for her to carry sabino brought it into my office massive basket of crepepaperwrapped fruit cheeses wine samples tins of caviar smoked oysters and trout chestnut paste jars of preserves and compotes from a gourmet shop in pasadena inside was a card to doctor delaware love melissa d on the reverse side was a drawing of a house the best shed ever done carefully shaded lots of windows and doors this is beautiful melissa thank you very much welcome smiling but her eyes had filled with tears whats the matter hon i want she turned around and faced one of the bookcases hugging herself what is it melissa i want its time maybe to for no more she trailed off into silence shrugged kneaded her hands are you saying you want to stop coming for sessions multiple rapid nods theres nothing wrong with that melissa youve done great im really proud of you so if you want to try it on your own i understand and i think its terrific and you dont have to worry ill always be here if you need me she whipped around and faced me im nine years old dr delaware i think im ready to handle things on my own i think you are too and dont worry about hurting my feelings she started to cry i went to her hugged her she put her head against my chest and sobbed i know its hard i said youre worried about hurting my feelings probably been worried about that for a long time wet nods thats very kind of you melissa i appreciate your caring about my feelings but dont worry im fine sure ill miss seeing you but ill always keep you in my mind and just because you stop coming for regular sessions doesnt mean we cant stay in touch over the phone or by writing letters you can even come in to see me when theres nothing bothering you just to say hi do other patients do that sure whatre their names smiling mischievously we both laughed i said the thing thats most important to me melissa is how well youve done how youve taken charge over your fears im really impressed i really feel i can handle things she said drying her eyes im sure you can i can she repeated looking over at the big basket have you ever had chestnut paste its kind of weird doesnt taste like roasted chestnuts at all the following week i phoned her dutchy answered i asked how she was doing he said very well indeed doctor let me get her for you i couldnt be sure but i thought he sounded friendly melissa came on the line polite but distant letting me know she was okay would call me if she needed to come in she never did i called a couple of more times she sounded distracted and eager to get off the phone a few weeks later i was doing my books reached her ledger sheet and realized id been paid in advance for ten sessions i hadnt conducted i wrote out a check and mailed it to san labrador the next day a manila envelope arrived at the office by messenger inside was my check in three neatly torn pieces along with a sheet of scented stationery dear dr delaware with much gratitude faithfully yours gina dickinson same fine graceful hand shed used to promise me two years ago that shed be in touch i wrote another check for exactly the same amount made it out to western pediatrics toy fund went down to the lobby and posted it knowing i was doing it for myself as much as for the kids whod get the toys and telling myself i had no damn right to feel noble then i took the elevator back up to my office and got ready for my next patient it was one in the morning when i put the file away reminiscing was strenuous exercise and fatigue had enveloped me i hobbled to bed slept fitfully did a good impression of waking at seven and marched into the shower a few minutes after id dressed the bell rang i went to the door and opened it milo stood out on the terrace hands in his pockets wearing a yellow golf shirt with two wide horizontal green stripes tan chinos and hightop basketball shoes that had once been white his black hair was longer than id ever seen it the forelock completely hiding the brow the sideburns nearly at jaw level his pocked lumpy face was flecked with three days worth of patchy beard and his green eyes seemed filmed over the normally startling hue dulled to the color of very old grass he said the good news is at least now you lock it the bad news is you open it without checking to see who the hells out there what makes you think i didnt check i said standing aside and letting him in latency of response from final footstep to latchturn powers of detection he tapped his temple and headed straight for the kitchen good morning detective leisure becomes you he grunted and didnt break step i said whats up what should be up he called back face already in the fridge another bona fide random dropin they were growing more frequent terminal doldrums halfway into his punishment six months suspension from the force without pay the most the department could hand out short of canning him the department hoping hed learn to enjoy civilian life and never come back the department deluding itself he scrounged for a while found rye bread lox spread and milk located a knife and a plate and began preparing himself some breakfast what are you staring at he said never seen a guy cook before i went to get dressed when i came back he was standing at the counter eating spread on toast and drinking milk out of the carton hed put on more weight his belly approached sumostatus meloning the nylon shirt got a busy day planned he said thought we might go down to rancho and shoot some golf balls didnt know you golfed i dont but a guy needs a hobby right sorry im working this morning oh yeah need me to leave no not patients im doing some writing ahh he said giving a dismissing wave i meant real work its real work for me what the old blockaroo i nodded he said want me to do it for you do what write your paper right no im serious scribbling always came easy for me thats why i went as far as the masters god knows it wasnt all the academic shit they shoved at me not much flair to my prose but it was workmanlike if a bit pedestrian in the words of my former academic adviser he crunched toast crumbs cascaded down his shirtfront he made no effort to brush them off i said thanks milo but im not ready for a ghostwriter yet i went to make coffee whatsamatter he said with a full mouth dont trust me this is scientific writing the hale shooting for a psych journal so so were talking dry maybe a hundred pages of dry big deal he said no worse than your basic homicide file he used a crescent of rye crust to tick his fingers roman numeral one synopsis of crime roman numeral two chronological narrative roman numeral three victim information roman i get the point he shoved the crust in his mouth the key to excellent report writing he said between chews is to take every bit of passion out of it use an extra heaping portion of superfluously extraneous tautological redundancies in order to make it mindnumbingly boring so that when ones superior officers read it they zone out and start skimming and maybe dont notice the fact that one has been spinning ones wheels since the body turned up and hasnt solved a goddam thing now tell me is that so different from what youre doing i laughed up till now ive been telling myself i was after the truth thanks for setting me straight no problem its my job speaking of job howd it go downtown he gave a very long very dark look more of the same desk jockeys with smiling faces this time they brought in the department shrink thought you refused counseling they got around it by calling it a stress evaluation terms of the penalty read the small print he shook his head all those greasyfaced fuckers talking real softly and slowly as if i was senile inquiring about my adjustment my stress level sharing their concern ever notice how people who talk about sharing never really do they were also careful to let me know that all my medical bills had been picked up by the department therefore the department had received copies of all my lab tests and there was some concern over my cholesterol level triglycerides whatever was i really feeling up to returning to active duty he scowled what a bunch of princes huh i smiled back and said it was funny how they never gave a shit about my stress level or triglycerides when i was out there doing the job howd they react to that bit of charm more smiles then this greasy silence you could deepfry potatoes in mindtripping no doubt the asshole shrink prepped them no offense but thats the military mind destroy the individual he looked at the milk carton said ah lowfat thats good heres to triglycerides i filled the coffeemaker carafe with water spooned kenyan into the hatch give the assholes one thing he said theyre getting more assertive this time they came right out and talked pension dollars and cents actuarial tables how much more it added up to when you threw in the interest i could earn if i invested wisely how nice life could be with what i had coming after fourteen years when i didnt slaver and snap they dropped the carrot and picked up the stick started hinting around about how the pension was by no means a foregone conclusion given the circumstances blah blah blah how timing was of the essence blah blah blah he started to work on another piece of bread i said bottom line i let them blah on for a while then got up said i had a pressing engagement and left well i said if you ever do decide to quit theres always the diplomatic corps hey he said ive had it to here running a finger across his throat give me the halfyear boot okay take my gun and shield and pay okay but just let me do my time in peace and quiet and cool it with the fucking followups all that phony sensitivity he drank and ate course guess i cant expect much better given the circumstances he smiled aplus in reality testing milo he said assaulting a superior officer bigger smile has a nice ring to it wouldnt you say you forgot the crucial part on tv he grinned started to drink more milk but was smiling too broadly and lowered the carton what the hell this is the media age right the chief wears pancake when he plays meetthepress i gave them some soundbites theyll never forget that you did whats the situation with frisk word has it his cute little nose has healed quite nicely the new teeth look almost as good as the old ones amazing what they can do with plastic nowadays huh but he is gonna look a little different less tom selleck more karl malden which isnt bad for a superior officer right that shopworn look implied wisdom and experience he back on duty nooo seems kennypoos stress level is still pretty high hes taking a long recuperation but hell be back eventually kicked upstairs where he can screw up on a higher level and do systematic damage hes the assistant chiefs soninlaw milo youre lucky to still be on the force he put down the carton and glared dont you think if they could have shafted me they would have theyre in a onedown position and they know it thats why theyre going the weasel route he slammed his big hand down on the counter asshole used me for fucking bait the lawyer rick had me talk to told me i had grounds for a majorleague civil suit could have taken it to the papers and kept it there for months he would have loved it the shyster big contingency fee rick wanted me to do it too on principle but i refused because that wasnt what it was about bunch of goddam shysters quibbling about technicalities for ten years this was oneonone it needed to be handled oneonone going the tv route was my extra insurance couple of million witnesses so no one could say it didnt happen the way it did thats why i hit him after he said what a great hero i was and gave me the commendation so no one could say it was sour grapes the department owes me alex they should be grateful all i did was mess up his face and if frisk is smart hell be grateful too stay out of my face permanently fuck his family connections hes lucky i didnt rip his lungs out and toss them at the cameras his eyes had cleared and his complexion had deepened to hot pink with his hair over his forehead and thick lips he resembled a disgruntled gorilla i applauded he rose a few inches stared at me then started laughing ah nothing like adrenaline to make the day take on a rosy glow sure you dont want to golf sorry i really have to get the paper done and theres a patient coming at noon and frankly knocking balls around the green isnt my idea of recreation milo i know i know he said no aerobic benefit bet your triglycerides are just peachy i shrugged the coffee was done i poured two cups gave one to him so i said what else have you been doing to fill the time he gave an expansive gesture and put on a brogue oh its been just grand lad needlepoint papiermâché decoupage crocheting little schooners and yachts made of icecream sticks and glitter theres a wonderful world of crafts out there just waiting to be explored he drank coffee its been shit worse than a desk job at first i thought id get into gardening grab some sun a little exercise back to the earth to my roots praise hibernia planning to grow potatoes he chuckled planning to raise anything i could other than hell only problem was rick brought in this landscape designer last year redid the whole yard with all this southwestern shit cactus succulents lowmoisture ground cover so we could cut our water usage be ecologically sound so much for farmer spud so okay scratch that i figured id tinker around the house fix everything that needed fixing i used to be handy when i worked construction in college i learned all the trades and when i lived by myself i used to do all of it plumbing wiring whatever the landlord loved me only problem with that plan is theres nothing to fix i hadnt been around the house long enough to realize it but after nagging me for a year or so rick finally took care of everything seems he found this handyman fellow from fiji former patient cut himself with a power saw nearly lost a couple of fingers rick sewed him up in the er saved the fingers and purchased eternal gratitude the guy works for us basically for free on call twentyfour hours a day so unless he slips with the saw again my expertise is not in demand scratch mr fixit what does that leave shopping cooking between the er and the free clinic ricks never home to eat so i grab whatever and stuff my face once in a while i go out to a civilian range in culver city and shoot ive been through my record collection twice and read more bad books than i ever want to think about what about volunteer work he clapped his hands over his ears and grimaced when he removed them i said what heard it before every day from the altruistic dr silverman the free clinic aids group homeless kids skid row mission whatever find a cause milo and stick with it only problem is i feel too goddam mean coiled like someone better not say the wrong thing to me or theyre gonna end up sucking the sidewalk this hot feeling in my gut sometimes i wake up with it sometimes it just comes on and dont tell me its posttraumatic stress syndrome cause giving it a name doesnt do squat ive been there before after the war and i know nothing but time is gonna bleed it out of me meantime i dont want to be around too many people especially people with heavyduty misery ive got no sympathy to give id end up telling them to shape up and get their goddam lives in order time heals i said but time can be sped along he gave me an incredulous look what counseling there are worse things he slapped his chest with both hands okay here i am counsel me i was silent right he said and looked at the wall clock anyway im gone gonna hit little white balls and pretend theyre something else he began barreling out of the kitchen i held out an arm and he stopped how about dinner i said tonight i should be free by seven or so he said charity meals are for soup kitchens youre a charmer i said and lowered my arm what no date tonight no date what about linda lindas still in texas oh thought she was due back last week she was the stays been extended her father the heart i nodded hes gotten worse bad enough to keep her there indefinitely sorry to hear it when you talk to her give her my best tell her i hope he mends his anger had given way to sympathy i wasnt sure that was an improvement will do i said have fun at rancho he took a step stopped okay so this hasnt been partytime for you either sorry im doing fine milo and the offer wasnt charity god knows why but i thought dinner would be nice two guys shooting the bull all that buddy stuff like in the beer commercials yeah he said dinner okay i can always eat he patted his gut and if youre still struggling with your term paper by tonight bring a draft along uncle milo will render sage editorial input fine i said but in the meantime why dont you think about getting yourself a real hobby after he left i sat down to write for no apparent reason it went more smoothly than ever before and noon arrived quickly heralded by the second doorbell ring of the day this time i squinted through the peephole what looked back at me was the face of a stranger but not foreign remnants of the child id once known merging with a photo from a twentyyearold newspaper clipping i realized that at the time of the attack her mother hadnt been that much older than melissa was now i opened the door and said hello melissa she seemed startled then smiled dr delaware you havent changed at all we shook hands come on in she entered the house and stood with her hands folded in front of her the transition from girl to woman appeared nearly complete and the evidence pointed to a graceful process she had fashionmodel cheekbones that asserted themselves through flawless lightly tanned skin her hair had darkened to a sunstreaked light brown and it hung pokerstraight and gleaming to her waist the straightedge bangs had given way to a side part and flip below naturally arched brows her graygreen eyes were huge and wideset a young grace kelly a miniature grace kelly she was barely five feet tall with a cinchwaist and tiny bones big gold hoop earrings dangled from each shelllike ear she carried a small lambskin handbag wore a blue pinpoint buttondown shirt a denim skirt that ended an inch above her knees and maroon penny loafers without socks maybe preppy still ruled in san labrador i showed her to a chair in the living room she sat crossed her legs at the ankles hugged her knees and looked around you have a very nice home dr delaware i wondered what my eighteenhundred square feet of redwood and glass really looked like to her the castle shed grown up in probably had rooms bigger thanking her i took a seat and said its good to see you melissa good to see you too dr delaware and thanks so much for doing it on short notice my pleasure any trouble finding the address no i used my thomas guide i just learned about thomas guides theyre terrific yes they are amazing how so much information can go in one book isnt it sure is ive never really been up to these canyons its quite pretty smile shy but poised proper a proper young lady was it for my benefit did she metamorphose into something giggly and illmannered when she and her friends hit the mall did she go to the mall did she have friends the ignorance born of nine years struck home starting from scratch i smiled back and trying not to be obviously analytic studied her posture straight maybe a little stiff understandable considering the circumstances but no obvious signs of anxiety her hands remained motionless around her knees no kneading no evidence of chafing i said well its been a long time nine years she said pretty unbelievable huh sure is i dont expect you to sum up all nine of them but i am kind of curious about what youve been up to just the usual she said shrugging school mostly she bent forward straightened her arms and hugged her knees tighter a sheet of hair fell across one eye she brushed it aside and checked out the room again i said congratulations on graduating thanks i got accepted to harvard fantastic double congratulations i was surprised they took me ill bet there was never any doubt in their minds thats nice of you to say dr delaware but i think i was pretty lucky i said straight as or close to it return of the shy smile her hands remained clamped on her knees not in gym well shame on you young lady the smile widened but maintaining it seemed to take effort she kept looking around the room as if searching for something i said so when do you leave for boston i dont know they want me to notify them within two weeks if im coming so i guess id better decide that mean youre thinking of not going she licked her lips and nodded and brought her gaze to rest meeting mine thats what thats the problem i wanted to talk to you about whether or not to go to harvard what going to harvard means in terms of mother she licked her lips again coughed and began rocking very gently then she freed her hands picked up a cutcrystal paperweight from the coffee table and peered through it squinting studying the refraction of the golddusted southern light streaming in through the dining room windows i said is your mother opposed to your going away no shes she says she wants me to she hasnt objected at all as a matter of fact shes been very encouraging says she really wants me to go but youre worried about her anyway she put down the paperweight moved to the edge of her chair and held out her hands palms up im not sure she can handle it dr delaware being away from you yes shes its shrug she began wringing her hands that saddened me more than it should have i said is she still is her situation the same in terms of her fears no i mean she still has it the agoraphobia but shes better because of her treatment i finally convinced her to get treatment and its helped good yes it is good but youre not sure treatments helped her enough to cope with being separated from you i dont know i mean how can i be sure she shook her head with a weariness that made her seem very old lowered her head and opened her bag after fumbling for a few moments she drew out a newspaper article and handed it to me february of last year a lifestyles piece entitled new hope for victims of fears husband and wife team fight debilitating phobias she lifted the paperweight and began toying with it again i read on the article was a profile of leo gabney a pasadenabased clinical psychologist formerly of harvard university and his psychiatrist wife ursula cunninghamgabney alumna and former staff member of that august institution an accompanying photograph showed the two therapists sitting side by side at a table facing a female patient only the back of the patients head was visible gabneys mouth was open in speech his wife seemed to be looking at him out of the corner of her eye both doctors wore expressions of extreme earnestness the caption read drs leo and ursula gabney combine their skills to work intensively with mary a severe agoraphobic the last word had been circled in red i studied the picture i knew leo gabney by reputation had read everything hed written but had never met the man the camera revealed him to be sixty or close to it with bushy white hair narrow shoulders dark drooping eyes behind heavy blackframed glasses and a round smallish face he wore a white shirt and dark tie had rolled his sleeves up to the elbow his forearms were thin and bony almost womanish my mental image had been something more herculean his wife was brunette and goodlooking in a severe way hollywood would have cast her as the repressed spinster ripe for awakening she was dressed in a cowlneck knit top with a paisley kerchief draped over one shoulder a short perm fit nicely around her face glasses hung from a chain around her neck she was young enough to be leo gabneys daughter i looked up melissa was still turning the crystal pretending to be enthralled with the facets the knickknack defense id totally forgotten this particular knickknack antique french a real find rescued from the back shelves of a tiny curio shop in leucadia robin and me the amnesia defense i resumed reading the article had the selfconsciously laudatory tone of a pr release striving to sound like journalism it recounted leo gabneys pioneering work in the research and treatment of anxiety disorders cited his landmark success treating korean war gis for combat trauma when clinical psychology was still an infant science pioneering research in frustration and human learning and tracing his career through three decades of animal and human studies at harvard thirty years of prolific scientific writing no blockaroo for him ursula cunninghamgabney was described as a former student of her husbands and possessor of both a phd in psychology and an md we joke said her husband that shes a paradox both gabneys had been tenured members of the staff of harvard medical school before relocating to southern california two years previously and establishing the gabney clinic leo gabney explained the relocation as a quest for a more relaxed lifestyle as well as the chance to bring to the private sector our combined body of research and clinical skills he went on to describe the collaborative nature of the gabney approach my wifes medical training is especially useful in terms of detecting physical disorders such as hyperthyroidism that present symptoms similar to those of anxiety disorders shes also in a unique position to evaluate and prescribe some of the more recent and superior antianxiety drugs that have come along several of the new medications look promising ursula cunninghamgabney elaborated but none is sufficient in and of itself many physicians tend to view medication as a magic bullet and prescribe without carefully weighing costeffectiveness our research has shown that the treatment of choice in debilitating anxiety disorders is clearly a combination of behavior and carefully monitored medication unfortunately her husband added the typical psychologist is ignorant about drugs and even if knowledgeable unable to prescribe them and the typical psychiatrist has little or no training in behavior therapy leo gabney claims this has led to bickering between the professions and inadequate treatment for many patients with incapacitating conditions such as agoraphobia a morbid fear of open spaces agoraphobics need treatment that is multimodal as well as creative we dont limit ourselves to the office go into the home the workplace wherever reality beckons more red circles around agoraphobia and the home the rest consisted of pseudonymous case histories which i skimmed finished melissa put down the paperweight have you heard of them ive heard of leo gabney hes very well known has done a lot of very important research i held out the clipping she took it and put it back in her bag when i saw this she said it just sounded right for mother id been looking for something wed started talking mother and i about how she should do something about her problem actually we talked for years i started bringing it up when i was fifteen old enough to realize how much it was affecting her i mean i always knew she was different but when you grow up with someone and the way they are is the only way you know you get used to them true i said but as i got older started to read more psychology and understand more about people i began to realize how hard it must be for her that she was really suffering and if i loved her my obligation was to help her so i started talking to her about it at first she wouldnt talk back tried to change the subject then she insisted she was okay i should just take care of myself but i just kept at it in small doses like after id done something good gotten a really good grade or brought home an academic award id bring it up letting her know i deserved to be taken seriously finally she started to really talk about how hard it was for her how bad she felt not being a normal mother how shed always wanted to be like all the other mothers but that every time she tried to leave the anxiety just got to her more than just psychologically physical attacks not being able to breathe feeling as if she were going to die how it trapped her made her feel helpless and useless and guilty for not taking care of me she gripped her knees again rocked stared at the paperweight then back at me i told her that was ridiculous shed been a terrific mother she cried and said she knew she hadnt but that id turned out wonderful anyway despite her not because of her it hurt me to hear that and i started to cry too we held each other she kept telling me over and over how sorry she was and how glad she was that i was so much better than she was that i would have a good life get out and see things shed never seen do things shed never done she stopped sucked in breath i said it must have been so hard for you hearing that seeing her pain yes she said letting loose a rush of tears i reached over pulled a tissue out of the box handed it to her and waited until she composed herself i told her she said sniffling that i wasnt better than she was in any way whatsoever that i was out in the world because id gotten help from you because shed cared enough about me to get me help i thought of a childs voice on a crisis line tape scented brushoff letters calls unanswered that i cared about her and wanted her to get help she said she knew she needed it but that she was beyond treatment doubted anyone could help her then she started crying harder and said doctors scared her she knew that was stupid and babyish but her fear was overpowering that she never even talked to you on the phone that i really had gotten better despite her because i was strong and she was weak i told her strength isnt something you just have its something you learn that she was strong too in her own way living through everything shed been through and still ending up a beautiful kind person because she is dr delaware even though she never got out and did the things other mothers did i never cared because she was better than the other mothers nicer kinder i nodded and waited she said she feels so guilty but really she was wonderful patient never grumpy she never raised her voice when i was little and couldnt sleep before you cured me shed hold me and kiss me and tell me over and over that i was wonderful and beautiful the best little girl in the world and that the future was my golden apple even if i kept her up all night even if i wet the bed and soaked her sheets shed just hold me in the wet sheets and tell me she loved me that everything would be okay thats the kind of person she is and i wanted to help her to give some of that kindness back she buried her face in the tissue it turned into a sodden lump and i gave her another after a while she dried her eyes and looked up finally after months of talking after wed both cried ourselves dry i got her to agree that if i found the right doctor shed try a doctor who would come to the house but i didnt do anything for a while because i had no idea where to find a doctor like that i made a few calls but the ones who phoned me back said they didnt do house calls i got the feeling they werent taking me seriously because of my age i even thought of calling you why didnt you i dont know i guess i was embarrassed pretty foolish huh not at all anyway then i read the article it sounded perfect i called their clinic and spoke to her the wife she said yes they could help but that i couldnt arrange treatment for someone else the patients themselves had to call to set it up that they insisted upon that only accepted patients who were motivated she made it sound like applying to college as if they got tons of applications but only took a few so i talked to mother told her id found someone gave her the number and told her to call she got really scared started to have one of her attacks whats that like she turns pale and grabs her chest and begins breathing really hard and fast gasping as if she cant get any breath in sometimes she faints pretty scary i guess she said for someone seeing it for the first time but like i said id grown up with it so i knew she wasnt in any danger that probably sounds cruel but thats the way it is i said no it doesnt you understood what was happening could put it in context yes exactly so i just waited until the attack was over they usually dont last more than a few minutes and then she gets really tired and goes to sleep for a couple of hours but i wouldnt let her sleep this time i held her and kissed her and started talking to her very quietly and calmly about how the attacks were terrible how i knew she felt terrible but didnt she want to try to get rid of them not to feel like that anymore she started crying and saying yes she did want that yes she would try she promised but not right now she was too weak so i let her off the hook and nothing happened for weeks finally my patience ran out i went up to her room dialed the number in front of her asked for dr ursula and handed her the phone and stood over her like this rising she folded both arms over her chest and put on a stern look i guess i caught her off guard because she took the phone began talking to dr ursula doing a lot of listening and nodding mostly but at the end of it shed made an appointment she let her arms drop and sat back down anyway thats how it happened and it seems to be helping her how longs she been in treatment about a year itll be a year this month does she see both gabneys at first they both came to the house with a black bag and all sorts of equipment i guess they were giving her a physical then only dr ursula came and all she brought was a notebook and a pen she and mother spent hours together up in mothers room every day even weekends for weeks then finally they came downstairs walked around the house talking like friends punctuating friends with just a hint of frown what they talked about i couldnt tell you because she dr ursula was always careful to keep mother away from everyone the staff me not by actually coming out and saying it she just has a way of looking at you that lets you know youre not supposed to be there another frown finally after about a month they went outside to the grounds strolling did that for a long time months with no progress that i could see mother had always been able to do that by herself without treatment that phase seemed to be going on forever and no one was telling me anything about what was going on i began to wonder if they if she knew what she was doing if id done the right thing by bringing her into our home the one time i tried to ask about it was pretty unpleasant she stopped wrung her hands i said what happened i caught up with dr ursula at the end of a session just as she was getting into her car and asked her how mother was doing she just smiled and told me everything was going well clearly letting me know it was none of my business then she asked me if anything was troubling me but not as if she cared not the way youd say it i felt she was putting me down analyzing me it was creepy i couldnt wait to get away from her shed raised her voice was nearly shouting realized it and blushed and covered her mouth i gave a reassuring smile but then afterward she said i could understand it i guess the need for confidentiality i started to think back and remembered how it had been with my therapy i was always asking you all those questions about other kids just to see if youd break the secret testing you and then i felt very good very comforted when you didnt give in she smiled that was terrible wasnt it testing you like that a hundred percent normal i said she laughed well you passed the test dr delaware the blush deepened she turned away you helped me a lot im glad melissa thanks for saying so must be a pleasant job she said being a therapist getting to tell people theyre okay all the time not having to cause pain like other doctors sometimes it does get painful but overall youre right it is a great job then how come you dont do it anymo im sorry thats none of my business thats okay i said no topics off limits here as long as you can tolerate not always getting an answer she laughed there you go doing it again telling me im okay you are okay she touched a finger to the paperweight then retracted it thank you for everything you did for me not only did you get rid of my fears you also showed me people can change they can win its hard to see that sometimes when youre stuck in the middle of something ive thought of studying psychology myself maybe becoming a therapist youd make a good one do you really think so she said facing me and brightening yes i do youre smart you care about people and youre patient from what youve told me about getting your mother help you have tremendous patience well she said i love her i dont know if id be patient with someone else it would probably be easier melissa yes i guess thats true cause to tell the truth i didnt feel patient while it was happening all her resistance and stalling there were times i even wanted to scream at her tell her to just get up and change but i couldnt shes my mother shes always been wonderful to me i said but now after going to all the trouble of getting her into treatment you have to watch her and dr ursula stroll the grounds for months with nothing happening that really tries your patience it did i was really starting to get skeptical then all of a sudden things started to happen dr ursula got her outside the front gate just a few steps down to the curb and she had an attack when she got there but it was the first time shed been outside the walls since the first time id ever seen her do it and dr ursula didnt pull her back in because of the attack she gave her some kind of medicine in an inhaler like they use for asthma and made her stay out there until shed calmed down then they did it again the next day and again and she kept having attacks it was really hard to watch but finally mother was able to stand at the curb and be okay after that they started walking around the block arm in arm finally a couple of months ago dr ursula got her to drive in her favorite car its this little rollsroyce silver dawn a but in perfect condition coachbuilt custommade my father had it built to his specifications when he was in england one of the first to have power steering and tinted windows then he gave it to her shes always loved it sometimes she sat in it after it had been washed with the engine off but she never drove it she must have said something to dr ursula about its being her favorite because the next thing i knew the two of them were tooling around in it down the drive and right out the gates shes at the point where she can drive with someone else in the car she drives to the clinic with dr ursula or someone else with her its not far over in pasadena maybe that wouldnt sound too impressive but when you think of where she was a year ago its pretty fantastic dont you think i do how often does she go to the clinic twice a week monday and thursday for group therapy with other women who have the same problem she sat back dryeyed smiling im so proud of her dr delaware i dont want to mess it up by going to harvard by doing anything that would mess it up i mean i think of mother as being on a scale one of those balance scales fear on one side happiness on the other right now its tipping toward happiness but i cant help thinking that any little thing could knock it the other way you see your mom as pretty fragile she is fragile everything shes been through has made her fragile have you talked to dr ursula about the impact of your going away no she said suddenly grim no i havent i get the feeling i said that even though dr ursula has helped your mother a lot shes still not your favorite person thats true shes a very shes cold is there anything else about her that bothers you just what i said about her analyzing me i dont think she likes me whys that she shook her head one of her earrings caught the light and flashed its just the vibrations she gives off i know that sounds imprecise but she just makes me feel uncomfortable the way she was able to tell me to butt out without having to say it so how can i approach her about something personal all shed do is put me down i feel she wants to shut me out have you tried to talk to your mother about this i talked to her about therapy a couple of times she said dr ursula was taking her through steps and she was climbing them slowly that she was grateful to me for getting her into treatment but that now she had to be a big girl and do things for herself i didnt argue didnt want to do anything that would ruin it wringing flipping her hair i said melissa are you feeling a little left out by the treatment no its not that at all sure id like to know more especially because of my interest in psychology but thats not whats important to me if thats what it takes to work all that secrecy then im happy even if this is as far as it goes its still major progress do you have doubts it will go further i dont know she said on a daytoday basis it seems to go so slowly she smiled you see dr delaware im not patient at all so even though your mothers come a long way youre not convinced shes gone far enough for you to be able to leave her exactly and you feel frustrated not knowing more about her prognosis because of the way dr ursula treats you very frustrated what about dr leo gabney would you be more comfortable talking to him no she said i dont know him at all like i said he only showed up at the beginning a real scientist type walking very fast writing things down ordering his wife around hes the boss in that relationship following that insight with a smile i said even though your mother says she wants you to go to harvard youre not sure she can handle it and you feel you cant talk to anyone to find out if she can she shook her head and gave a weak smile a quandary i guess pretty dumb huh not at all there you go again she said telling me im okay both of us smiled i said who else is around to take care of your mother theres the staff and don i guess thats her husband dropping that nugget into the bucket then draping it with a look of innocence but i couldnt keep the surprise out of my voice when did she get married just a few months ago the hands began kneading a few months i repeated she squirmed and said six silence i said want to tell me about it she looked as if she didnt but she said his name is don ramp he used to be an actor never a big one just a bit player cowboys and soldiers that kind of thing he owns a restaurant now in pasadena not san lab because in san lab youre not allowed to sell liquor and he serves all kinds of beers and ales thats his specialty imported beers and meat prime rib tankard and blade its called armor and swords all over the place like in old england kind of silly actually but for san labrador its exotic howd he and your mother meet you mean because she never leaves the house yes the hands kneaded faster that was my i introduced them i was at the tankard with some friends a school thing for some seniors don was there greeting people and when he found out who i was he sat down and told me hed known mother years ago back in her days at the studio the two of them had been on contract at the same time he started asking these questions about how she was doing talking on and on about what a wonderful person shed been so beautiful and talented telling me i was beautiful too she snorted you dont think youre beautiful lets be real dr delaware anyway he seemed so nice and he was the first person id met whod actually known mother before back in her hollywood days i mean people in san labrador dont usually come from an entertainment background at least they dont admit it one time another actor a real star brett raymond wanted to move in buy an old house and tear it down to build a new one and there was all this talk about his money being dirty money because the movies were a jewish business and jewish money was dirty money and brett raymond himself was really jewish and tried to hide it which i dont even know if its true or not anyway they the zoning board made his life so miserable with hearings and restrictions and whatever that he changed his mind and moved to beverly hills and people said good thats where he belonged so you can see how i wouldnt meet too many movie people and when don started talking about the old days i thought it was great it was like finding a link to the past i said its a bit of a leap from that to marriage she gave a sour smile i invited him over as a surprise for mother this was before she was getting treatment i was looking for anything to get her going get her to socialize and when he arrived he had three dozen red roses and a big bottle of taittingers i should have known then he had plans i mean roses and champagne one thing led to another he started coming over more often in the afternoon before the tankard opened bringing her steaks and more flowers and whatever it became a regular thing i just kind of got used to it then six months ago just around the time she started to be able to leave the grounds they announced they were getting married just like that brought in a judge and did it at the house so he was seeing her when you were trying to persuade her to get treatment yes howd he relate to that and to treatment i dont know she said i never asked him but he didnt fight it no dons not a fighter what is he a charmer everyone likes him she said with distaste how do you feel about him she gave me an irritated look brushed her hair from her forehead how do i feel he doesnt get in my way do you think hes insincere i think hes shallow pure hollywood echoing the prejudices shed just decried she realized it and said i know that sounds very san labrador but youd have to meet him to understand hes tan in the winter lives for tennis and skiing always smiling even when theres nothing to smile about father was a man of depth mother deserves more if id known it would get this far id never have started it does he have any children of his own no he was never married not until now the way she emphasized now made me ask are you concerned that he married your mother for her money the thought has occurred to me dons not exactly poor but hes not in mothers league she gave a wave of her hand so choppy and awkward that it made me take note i said is part of your conflict about harvard a worry that she needs protection from him no but i cant see him being able to take care of her why she married him i still cant figure out what about the staff in terms of taking care of her theyre nice she said but she needs more what about jacob dutchy jacob she said with a tremor in her voice jacob died im sorry just last year she said he developed some kind of cancer and it took him quickly he left the house right after the diagnosis and went to a place some sort of rest home but he wouldnt tell us where didnt want anyone to see him sick after he afterwards the home called mother and told her he was there wasnt even any funeral just cremation it really hurt me not being able to help him but mother said wed helped by letting him do it his way more tears more tissues i said i remember him as being a strongwilled gentleman she bowed her head at least it was quick i waited for her to say more when she didnt i said so much has been happening to you its got to feel overwhelming i can see why its hard for you to know what to do oh dr delaware she said getting up and coming forward and throwing her arms around my neck shed put on perfume for the appointment something heavy and floral and much too old for her something a maiden aunt might wear i thought of her making her own way through life the trials and errors it made me ache for her i could feel her hands grip my back her tears moistened my jacket i uttered words of comfort that seemed as substantial as the gilded light when shed stopped crying for a full minute i pulled away gently she moved away quickly sat back down looking shamefaced wringing her hands i said its all right melissa you dont always have to be strong shrinks reflex another yeasay the right thing to say but in this case was it the truth she began pacing the room i cant believe im falling apart like this its so i planned for this to be so businesslike a consultation not not therapy yes this was for her i really thought i was okay didnt need therapy i wanted to show you i was okay you really are okay melissa this is an incredibly stressful time for you all the changes in your mothers life losing jacob yes she said absently he was a dear i waited several moments before continuing and now the harvard thing thats a major decision it would be foolish not to take it seriously she sighed i said let me ask you this if everything else was calm would you want to go well i know its a great opportunity my golden apple but i have to i need to feel right about it what could help you feel right about it she shook her head and threw up her hands i dont know i wish i did she looked at me i smiled and pointed at the couch she returned to her seat i said what could really convince you your mother will be okay her being okay normal like anyone else that sounds terrible as if im ashamed of her im not im just worried you want to be sure she can take care of herself thats the thing she can up in her room its her domain its just the outside world now that shes going out trying to change its scary of course it is silence i said i suppose id be wasting my breath to remind you that you cant go on taking responsibility for your mother forever being a parent to your parent that it will get in the way of your own life and do her no good yes i know thats what n of course thats true has someone else been telling you the same thing she bit her lip just noel noel drucker hes a friend not a boyfriend just a boy whos a friend i mean he likes me as more than a friend but im not sure how i feel about him but i do respect him hes an exceptionally good person how old is noel a year older than me he got accepted to harvard last year took time off to work and save up money his family doesnt have any money its just him and his mother hes been working his whole life and is very mature for his age but when he talks about mother i just want to tell him to stop ever let him know how you feel no hes very sensitive i dont want to hurt him and i know he means well hes thinking of me boy i said blowing out breath youre taking care of lots of people guess so smile whos taking care of melissa i can take care of myself stating it with a defiance that pulled me back nine years i know you can melissa but even caretakers need to be cared for once in a while noel tries to take care of me but i wont let him thats terrible isnt it frustrating him like that but ive got to do things my way and he just doesnt understand the way it is with mother no one does do noel and your mother get along the little they have to do with each other they do she thinks hes a nice boy which he is everyone thinks that if you knew him youd understand why and he likes her well enough but he says im doing her more harm than good by protecting her that shell get better when she really has to as if its her choice melissa got up and walked around the room again letting her hands settle on things touching examining feigning sudden fascination with the pictures on the walls i said how can i best help you melissa she pivoted on one foot and faced me i thought maybe if you could talk to mother tell me what you think you want me to evaluate her give you a professional opinion as to whether she really can cope with your going to harvard she bit her lip a couple of times touched one of her earrings flipped her hair i trust your judgment dr delaware what you did for me how you helped me change it was like magic if you tell me its okay to leave her then i will ill just do it years ago id seen her as the magician but letting her know that now would be terrifying i said we were a good team melissa you showed strength and courage back then just like youre showing now thank you so would you id be happy to talk with your mother if she consents and if its okay with the gabneys she frowned why them i need to make sure i dont disrupt their treatment plan okay she said i just hope she doesnt give you problems dr ursula uhhuh any reason you think she might no shes just she likes to be in charge of everything i cant help thinking she wants mother to keep secrets that have nothing to do with therapy what kind of secrets i dont know she said thats the thing ive got nothing to back me up just a feeling i know it sounds weird noel says im being paranoid its not paranoia i said you care deeply about your mother youve been taking care of her for years it wouldnt be natural for you to just her tension dissipated she smiled i said there i go again huh she started to giggle stopped embarrassed i said ill call dr ursula today and well take it from there okay okay she took a couple of steps closer wrote down the number at the clinic for me i said hang in there melissa well get through this i sure hope so you can call me on my private line thats the number you reached me at yesterday she walked back to the coffee table hastily picked up her purse and held it in front of her waisthigh the accessory defense i said is there anything else no she said glancing at the door guess weve covered plenty havent we we had plenty to catch up on we walked to the door she turned the knob and said well thanks again dr delaware tight voice tight shoulders more tense than when shed come in i said are you sure theres nothing else you want to talk about melissa theres no rush ive got plenty of time she stared at me then her eyes slammed shut like security shutters and her shoulders dropped its him she said in a very small voice mccloskey hes back in la totally free and i dont know what hell do i brought her back inside and sat her down she said i was going to mention it at the start but it gives a whole different dimension to your fear of leaving yes but to be honest id be worried even without him he just adds to it when did you find out he was back last month there was this show on tv some documentary about the victims bill of rights how in some states the family can write away to the prison and theyll tell you when the criminal is coming up for a parole hearing so you can protest i knew hed gotten out years ago and had moved away but i wrote anyway trying to see if there was anything more i could learn i guess it was part of the same thing trying to help her the prison took a long time to write back then told me to get in touch with the parole department that was a real hassle talking to the wrong people being put on hold in the end i had to submit a written request for information finally i got through and found out the name of his last parole officer here in la only he wasnt seeing him anymore mccloskey had just gone off parole how longs he been out of prison six years that i found out from jacob id been bugging him for a while wanting to know wanting to understand he kept putting me off but i wouldnt give up finally when i was fifteen he admitted hed been keeping an eye on mccloskey the whole time had found out hed been released a couple of years before and had left the state she made tiny white fists and shook them the creep served thirteen years out of a twentythreeyear sentence time off for good behavior that really stinks doesnt it no one cares about the victim he should have been sent to the gas chamber did jacob know where hed gone new mexico then arizona and i think texas working with the indians on the reservation or something jacob said he was trying to fool the parole department into thinking he was a decent human being and that theyd probably be fooled and he was right because they did set him free and now he can do anything he wants the parole officer was a nice guy just about ready to retire his name was bayliss and he really seemed to care but he said he was sorry there was nothing he could do does he think mccloskeys a threat to your mother or anyone else he said he had no evidence of that but that he didnt know that no one could be sure with someone like him has mccloskey tried to contact your mother no but whats to say he wont hes crazy that kind of craziness doesnt change overnight does it not usually so hes a clear and present danger isnt he i had no easy answer for that said i can see why youre concerned and didnt like the sound of it she said dr delaware how can i leave her maybe its a sign his coming back that i shouldnt leave i mean i can get a good education here ucla and usc both accepted me in the long run what difference is it going to make different tune from the one shed sung just a few moments ago melissa a person with your brains can get a good education anywhere is there a reason besides education that you considered harvard i dont know maybe it was just ego yes thats probably what it was out to show myself i could do it any other reason well theres noel he really wants me to go there and i thought it would be i mean it is the best college in the country isnt it i figured why not apply it was actually kind of a lark i really didnt think i was going to get in she shook her head sometimes i think it would have been easier being a c student fewer choices melissa anyone in your position the situation with your mother would be in conflict and now mccloskey but the harsh truth is that even if he does pose a danger youre not in any position to defend your mother against him so what are you saying she said angrily that i should just give up im saying mccloskey should definitely be looked into by a professional to find out why he came back what hes up to if hes judged to be dangerous there are things that can be done like what restraining orders security precautions is your home well guarded i guess theres an alarm system and gates and the police patrol regularly theres so little crime in san labrador the police are basically just like rentacops should we be doing more have you told your mother about mccloskey no of course not i didnt want to freak her out not with how well shes been doing what about your mr ramp no no one knows no one asks me my opinion about anything anyway and i dont volunteer have you told noel she gave an uncomfortable look yes he knows what does he say to just forget about it but thats easy for him its not his mother you didnt answer my question dr delaware is there something else we should be doing im not the one to say there are professionals who specialize in that kind of thing where do i find them let me check i said i might be able to help you with that your court connections something like that in the meantime why dont we proceed as planned ill contact the gabneys and see if its okay for me to meet with your mother if it is ill let you know and you can set up an appointment for me to come by if it isnt well take another look at our options in either event you and i should be talking some more want to make another appointment how about tomorrow she said same time if youve got the time i do thank you and sorry if i got too hot under the collar just now youre fine i said and walked her to the door for the second time thanks dr delaware take care of yourself melissa i will she said but she looked like a kid overloaded with homework after she was gone i thought about the way shed dropped a crumbtrail of crucial facts her mothers remarriage the young man in her life dutchys death mccloskeys return all of it delivered parenthetically with an offhandedness that screamed selfdefense but given everything she had to deal with loss ambivalence crucial decisions the erosion of personal control selfdefense was damn reasonable the control issue had to be especially hard for her an inflated sense of personal power was the logical legacy of all those years of raising her parent shed used it to guide her mother to the brink of change playing matchmaker referral service only to be defeated by her own success forced to stand back and surrender authority to a therapist to share affection with a stepfather add to that the normal strains and doubts of youngadulthood and it had to be crushing who indeed was taking care of melissa jacob dutchy had once filled that role though id barely known the man thinking of him gone saddened me the faithful retainer ever protective hed had a certain presence for melissa that amounted to paternal loss number two what did that bode in terms of her relationships with men the development of trust if her comments about don ramp and noel drucker were any example that road hadnt been smooth so far now the folks from cambridge mass were demanding a decision raising the specter of further surrender who was really afraid of separation not that her fears were totally without foundation a mikoksi with acid why had mccloskey come back to la nearly two decades after his conviction thirteen years of imprisonment plus six on parole made him fiftythree years old id seen what prison years could do wondered if he was nothing more than a pallid weary old con seeking out the comfort of likeminded losers and deadend haunts or perhaps hed used the time at san quentin to let his rage fester nursing acidandblood fantasies filling his bottle a discomfiting sense of selfdoubt began nagging at me the same feeling of missing the mark that id experienced nine years ago bending all my rules to treat a terrified child a feeling of not really having a grip on the core of the problem nine years ago shed gotten better despite that magic how many rabbits were left in the hat a machine answered at the gabney clinic listing numbers and emergency beeper codes for both doctors no other staff members were named i left a message for ursula cunninghamgabney identifying myself as melissa dickinsons therapist and requesting a callback as soon as possible during the next few hours several calls came in but none from pasadena at ten after seven milo arrived wearing the same clothes hed had on that morning but with grass stains on the pants and sweat stains under the armpits he smelled of turf and looked tired i said any holes in one he shook his head found a grolsch in the fridge popped it and said not my sport sport chasing a little white blur around the crab grass drives me crazy putts you crazy were talking shortdistance guy he smiled the only putz is me for thinking i could go suburban tilting his head back he guzzled beer when the bottle was empty he said where to dinnerwise wherever you want well he said you know me always pining for the haut monde see i even dressed for success we ended up at a taco stand on pico near twentieth in the bad part of santa monica inhaling traffic fumes and sitting at a knifescarred picnic table eating soft steamed tortillas filled with coarseground pork and marinated vegetables and drinking cocacola classic over crushed ice out of waxedpaper cups the stand stood on a corner patch of devastated asphalt between a liquor store and a checkcashing outlet homeless people and a few people who wouldnt live in homes if they had them loitered and scrounged nearby a couple of them watched us collect our food at the counter and find our seats panhandling fantasies or worse brightened their clouded eyes milo kept them at bay with policemans looks we ate looking over our shoulders he said basic enough for you before i could answer he was up and heading toward the order counter one hand in his pocket a filthy emaciated matbearded man around my age seized the moment and approached me grinning and flapping toothless gums incoherently as he waved randomly with a shortcircuited arm the other limb was drawn up to his shoulder frozen stiff and bent like a chicken wing i held out a dollar bill the mobile arm snapped it up with crustacean precision he was off before milo returned with a cardboard carton full of yellowpapered parcels but milod seen it and scowled as he sat down whatd you do that for the guy was braindamaged i said or faking it either way hed have to be pretty desperate wouldnt you say he shook his head unwrapped a taco and bit into it when the food had traversed his gullet he said everyones desperate alex keep doing that and theyll be all over us like fungus it didnt sound like something he would have said three months ago i looked around saw the way the rest of the street people were regarding him and said i wouldnt worry about that he pointed at the food parcels go ahead this is for you too i said maybe in a little while and drank coke that had turned insipid a moment later i said if you wanted information about an excon how would you go about it what kind of information he said forming the words around a mouthful of pork how the guy behaved in prison what hes up to now this con on parole postparole free and clear a paragon of rehabilitation huh thats the question mark how longs mr paragon been free and clear bout a year or so what was he in for assault attempted murder conspiracy to commit murder he paid someone to damage someone else paid for it huh he wiped his lips paid with the intent of doing serious damage or worse then just assume hell continue to be scum what if i wanted something more specific to what end its related to a patient meaning hushhush confidential at this point well he said its really no big deal you meaning a cop cause a civilians gonna have a hell of a time doing any of this you follow the chain the past is the best predictor of the future right so first link is the guys sheet ncic and local you talk to any cops who knew him back in the bad old days preferably the ones who busted him next you eyeball the das packet therell be sentencing recommendations in there shrink stuff whatever step three is talk to the prison staff find out what kind of time he served though the ones wholl really know him best are the assholes who served it with him if youve got a hook into any of them you tug then check out his parole officer problem there is caseload and turnover lot of what they do is rubberstamping the chance of getting anything meaningful is slim final step is locating some of his current kas known associates the scum hes been socializing with since hes been out finis nothing profound just legwork and in the end it wont tell you much so if youve got a patient whos worried id tell him or her to be careful buy a big gun and learn how to use it maybe a pit bull the trace you just described could a private attorney do it he eyed me over a taco your average attorney no not in any reasonable length of time one with access to a good private eye could pull it off but it would still take a private guy longer unless hes got great police connections like an excop he nodded some of the private guys are vets all of them bill by the hour and this kind of thing is going to build lots of hours so having a rich client would help sound like the kind of thing youd be interested in he put his taco down what a little private consultation milo a real hobby are you allowed to work while on suspension im joe citizen can do whatever i want but why the hell would i want better than chasing blurs on crab grass he grunted picked up his taco finished it and began unwrapping another hell he said i wouldnt even know what to charge that mean youre considering it mulling this patient of yours is he or she the victim victims daughter i said eighteen years old i treated her years ago when she was a kid shes been accepted at a college out of town and isnt sure about going even though its probably the best thing for her because of the scumbag being back there are other reasons for her to have doubts but the scumbags presence makes it impossible to deal with any of those i cant encourage her to go away with this guy lurking in the background milo he nodded and ate the familys got money i said thats why i asked about attorneys if they dont already have a battalion on retainer they could hire one but with you doing it id have confidence it was being done properly aw shucks he said and took a few more bites of taco he pulled up his shirt collar and gave a furtive look milo marlowe milo spade which do you think is catchier what about sherlock sturgis whats that make you the new age watson sure go ahead tell the family if they want to go that route ill check him out thanks no problema he picked his teeth and looked down at his sweatstained clothes wrong climate for a trench coat any such thing as a trench shirt go all the way i said la vice armani we drained our drinks and polished off more food on our way to the car another of the panhandlers approached us a heavy man of indeterminate race and creed wearing a shiteating grin while doing a palsied boogaloo milo glared at him then reached into his pocket and came up with a handful of pocket change thrusting the money at the vagrant he wiped his hands on his pants turned his back on the mans gibbered benedictions and cursed as he reached for the door handle but the epithets lacked conviction id heard much better out of him dr ursula cunninghamgabney had called back while i was gone leaving a number where she could be reached for the rest of the evening i dialed it got a throaty wellmodulated female voice dr cunninghamgabney speaking this is dr delaware thanks for returning my call dr gabney is this by any chance dr alexander delaware yes it is ah she said im familiar with your researchpavor nocturnus in children my husband and i included it in a bibliography on anxietymediated disorders we compiled last year for the american journal of psychiatry very thoughtprovoking thanks im familiar with your work too where do you practice dr delaware children are outside of our bailiwick so we do have occasion to make frequent referrals im on the west side but i dont do therapy just forensic work shortterm consultations i see the message i got said you were someones therapist melissa dickinson i was her therapist years ago i remain available for my old patients she came in to see me recently melissa she said such a serious young woman she has a lot to be serious about yes of course she does the family pathology is deeprooted im glad shes finally reached out for help her main concern seems to be her mother i said separation how her mother will deal with her going away to harvard her mother is very proud of her and eager for her to go to boston yes melissas told me that but shes still worried no doubt she is she said but those worries are melissas alone so theres no chance of her mothers relapsing if melissa goes away hardly dr delaware in fact im sure gina mrs ramp would appreciate her newfound freedom melissas a bright girl and a devoted daughter but she can get a bit cloying is that her mothers term no mrs ramp would never say it that way but she feels it so i hope youll be able to confront melissas ambivalence headon and do it quickly enough for her to make the break i understand theres a deadline involved harvard tends to be impatient i know from experience so shes going to have to commit one would hate to see a technicality get in the way of forward movement thinking of mccloskey i said does mrs ramp have any other worries that might be transmitting themselves to melissa transmitting as in emotional contagion no id say its just the opposite the risk is of melissas anxiety transmitting itself to her mother mrs ramp presented as one of the most severely phobic patients weve ever treated and weve treated many but shes made extraordinary progress and shell continue to do so given the chance are you saying melissas a threat to her progress melissa means well dr delaware i can certainly understand her concern growing up with an ineffectual mother would give her a stake in being hypermature at some level that would be adaptive but things change and at this point in time her hovering serves only to reduce her mothers selfconfidence how does she hover she tends to make herself rather conspicuous during crucial therapeutic moments im still not sure i understand okay she said ill spell it out as you may know treatment for agoraphobia needs to be in vivo to take place out in the real world where the anxietyprovoking stimuli are her mother and i literally take steps together out the front gate around the block its a slow but steady process calibrated so that the patient experiences as little anxiety as possible melissa makes a point of being there during important moments watching with her arms folded across her chest and this absolutely skeptical look on her face its almost comical but of course its a distraction its gotten so ive scheduled things around her aiming for breakthroughs when shes at school now however shes out of school and more conspicuous have you ever talked to her about this ive tried dr delaware but melissa shows no interest in talking to me funny i said she sees it differently oh she perceives herself as trying to obtain information from you and getting rebuffed silence then yes im sure she does but thats a neurotic distortion im not without compassion for her situation dr delaware shes dealing with a lot of ambivalence intense feelings of threat and jealousy it cant be easy for her but i need to focus on my patient and melissa could use your help or someone elses if youre not so inclined in sorting things out i said shed like me to talk to her mother in order to clarify her mothers feelings so she can sort out the harvard thing im calling to find out if thats okay i dont want to disrupt your treatment thats wise of you what exactly would you discuss with mrs ramp just her feelings about melissas leaving which from what youve told me sound pretty clear after hearing it firsthand id be able to deal with melissas doubts using your advocate role to propel her forward exactly well i dont see any harm in that as long as you keep your discussion circumscribed any particular topics youd like me to stay away from at this point id say everything other than melissas college career lets just keep things simple doesnt sound as if anything about this case has been simple true she said with a lilt in her voice but thats the beauty of psychiatry isnt it i called melissa at nine and she picked up on the first ring i checked with my contact hes a police detective on temporary leave so he has some free time if you still want mccloskey looked into it can be done i want it she said tell him to go ahead it may take a bit of time and investigators usually bill by the hour no problem ill take care of it youre going to pay him yourself sure it could end up being substantial ive got money of my own dr delaware ive paid for things for a long time im going to pay your bill so why not this melissa no problem dr delaware really im a very good money manager im over eighteen meaning its totally legal if im going to go away and live independently why not start right now when i hesitated she said its the only way dr delaware i dont want mother even knowing hes back what about don ramp i dont want him involved either its not his problem all right i said well work out the details when i see you tomorrow speaking of which i spoke to dr ursula and she says its fine for me to meet with your mother good i already talked to mother and shes willing to meet you tomorrow isnt that great so can we cancel our appointment and do that instead all right ill be there tomorrow at noon thanks dr delaware ill have lunch set out for you what do you like to eat lunch isnt necessary but thanks anyway youre sure im sure do you know how to get here i know how to get to san labrador she gave me directions to her house i copied them and said okay melissa see you tomorrow dr delaware yes melissa mothers worried about you even though i told her how nice you are shes worried about what youll think of her because of the way she treated you years ago tell her i understand and that my horns only come out during the full moon no laughter i said i wont be in the least bit rough melissa shell be fine i hope so melissa part of what youre dealing with a lot more important than money management is breaking away finding your own identity and letting your mother do things for herself i know its hard i think its taken lots of guts for you to go as far as you have just calling me took guts were going to work it out i hear you she said its just hard loving someone that much the stretch of freeway that connects la to pasadena announces itself with four tunnels whose entries are festooned with exquisite stonework not the kind of thing any city council is likely to approve nowadays but this bit of progress was carved into the basin long ago the citys first conduit to ceaseless motion masquerading as freedom its a grubby and graceless asphalt belt now three narrow streetlevel lanes bordered by exhaustwarped maples and houses that range from victorian relic to tobacco road psychotically engineered ramps appear without warning concrete overpasses that have browned with time las stab at patina throw spooky shadows across the blacktop every time i get on it i think of nathanael west and james m cain a southern california history that probably never really existed but is gloomily gratifying to imagine i also think of las labradoras and how places like the uppercrusty parts of pasadena sierra madre and san labrador might as well be on the moon for all their crosspollination with the urban tangle at the other end of the freeway las labradoras the farm girls i encountered them years before i met melissa in retrospect the similarity between the experiences seemed obvious why hadnt i made the connection before they were women who called themselves girls two dozen sorority sisters whod married very well and settled into estate living at a young age gotten a couple of kids off to school and started looking for ways to fill time seeking comfort in numbers they banded together and established a volunteer society an exclusive club sorority days renewed their headquarters was a bungalow at the cathcart hotel a aday nest they obtained gratis including room service because one of their husbands owned a chunk of that hostelry and another the bank that held the mortgage after composing bylaws and electing officers they searched for a raison dêtre hospital work seemed admirable so most of their early energies were focused upon remodeling and running the gift shop at cathcart memorial then the son of one of their members was diagnosed with a rare and painful disease and transferred to western pediatric hospital the only place in la where the ailment could be managed the child survived but suffered chronically his mother dropped out of the club in order to devote more time to him las labradoras decided to offer their good services to western peds at the time i was in my third year on staff running a psychosocial rehab program for seriously ill children and their families the chief of staff called me into his office and suggested i find a niche for these girls talking about budgetary problems for the softer sciences and emphasizing the need to interface with positive forces within the community one tuesday in may i put on a threepiece suit and drove out to the cathcart hotel ate boiledshrimp canapés and crustless sandwiches drank weak coffee and met the girls they were in their midthirties uniformly bright and attractive and genuinely charming projecting a noblesse oblige tainted by selfconsciousness and selfawareness theyd gone to college during the sixties and though that consisted typically of four sheltered years at usc or arizona state or some other place where the foment hadnt really taken hold even protected señoritas had been touched by the times they knew that they their husbands their children the way they lived and would continue to live were the enemy the privileged battlements all those unwashed radical types clamored to storm i wore a beard back then and drove a dodge dart that teetered on the brink of death despite the suit and my fresh haircut i figured i had to look like radical danger to them but they accepted me warmly listened intensely to my afterlunch talk never removed their eyes from my slide show sick kids iv poles surgical theaters the one we staffers during the blackest of moments called the tearjerker matinee when it was over they were all weteyed more certain than ever that they wanted to help i decided the best way to make use of their talents would be to have them serve as guides for newly diagnosed families psychosocial docents whose goal was to cut through the procedural red tape that hospitals produce even faster than debt weekly twohour shifts in tailored uniforms that they designed themselves smiles and greetings and guided tours of the misery working within the system to blunt some of its indignities but no swan dives into the deep waters of trauma and tragedy and no blood and guts the chief of staff thought it was a great idea so did the girls i set up a training program lectures reading lists tours of the hospital debriefings discussion groups roleplaying they were firstrate students took detailed notes made intelligent comments halfjokingly asked if i planned on testing them after three weeks they graduated the chief of staff presented them with diplomas bound in pink ribbon a week before the docent rotation was scheduled to begin i received a handwritten note on icecolored stationery las labradoras bungalow b the cathcart pasadena california dear doctor delaware on behalf of my sisters and myself i wish to thank you for the consideration youve shown us during these past few weeks we girls all agree that we learned a tremendous amount and greatly profited from the experience we regret however that we will not be able to participate in the welcome mat program as it presents some strategic problems for some of our members we hope this hasnt caused you any undue inconvenience and have tendered a donation to the western pediatric hospital christmas fund in lieu of our participation best wishes for a wonderful year and our sincere appreciation for the terrific work you do faithfully yours nancy brown president las labradoras i found ms browns home number in my rolodex dialed it the next day at eight in the morning oh hi she said how are you hanging in nancy i just got your letter yes im so sorry i know how terrible this looks but we just cant you mentioned strategic problems anything i can help with no im sorry but its nothing related to your program dr delaware just your setting my setting the hospitals the environment la hollywood most of us were amazed at how far down its slid some of the girls think its just too far to travel too far or too dangerous too far and too dangerous lots of the husbands are against us coming down there too we really havent had any problems nancy youd be here during the daylight hours using the vip parking lot silence i said patients come and go every day with no problem well you know how it is guess so i said okay be well im sure it sounds silly to you dr delaware and to be honest i think its an overreaction i tried to tell them that but our charter says we either participate as a group or not at all we took a vote dr delaware and this is the way it turned out i do apologize if weve caused you problems and we do hope the hospital accepts our gift in the spirit in which it was offered no doubt the hospital does goodbye dr delaware have a nice day notes on good paper monetary buyoffs phone brushoffs must be the san labrador style i thought about it all the way to the end of the freeway onto arroyo seco then east on california boulevard past cal tech a quick series of loops through quiet suburban streets then cathcart boulevard appeared and i resumed the eastward trek into the wilds of san labrador the farmer saint a canonization that had eluded the vatican the very origins of the place were grounded in a buyoff once the private domain of h farmer cathcart heir to an east coast railroad dynasty san labrador looked like old money but had been chartered as a city for only fifty years cathcart came to southern california at the turn of the century in order to scope out commercial possibilities for the family he liked what he saw began buying up downtown rail lines and hotels orange groves bean farms and ranch land on the eastern borders of los angeles assembling a foursquaremile fiefdom in the foothills of the san gabriel mountains after building the requisite mansion he surrounded it with worldclass gardens and named the estate san labrador a bit of selfaggrandizement that made episcopal tongues wag then midway through the great depression he discovered his funds werent infinite holding on to half a square mile he subdivided the rest parceling the gardens out to other rich men tycoons of grand but lesser stature who could afford to maintain two to sevenacre properties attaching restrictive covenants to all deed transfers which ensured his living out the rest of his life in sweet harmony with nature and the finest aspects of western civilization the rest of his life didnt amount to much he died in of influenza leaving a will bequeathing his estate to the city of san labrador should such a city exist within two years the tycoon tenants acted quickly setting up a charter and pushing it through the la county board of supervisors cathcarts mansion and grounds became a countyowned but privately funded museumcumbotanical gardens that nobody visited before the freeways during the postwar years the land was subdivided further halfacre lots for the burgeoning professional class but the covenants remained in place no coloreds no orientals no jews no mexicans no multiple dwellings no alcohol served in public places no nightclubs or theaters or places of base entertainment commercial establishments limited to an eightblock segment of cathcart boulevard no commercial structure to exceed two stories architectural style to be in the spanish revival mode with plans approved by the city council state and federal law eventually nullified the racial restrictions but there were ways to get around that and san labrador remained lilywhite the rest of the covenants withstood tests of time and litigation perhaps that was due to sound legal basis or maybe the fact that lots of judges and at least two district attorneys resided in san labrador had something to do with it whatever the reason the districts immunity to change remained strong as i cruised down cathcart nothing seemed different from the last time id been there how long ago had that been three years a turner exhibition at the museum a stroll through the library and grounds with robin traffic was sparse but slowmoving the boulevard was split by a wide greenbelt median the same mix of shops ran along the south side ensconced in jewelbox spanish revival buildings and dwarfed by the rusttinged chinese pistachios h farmer cathcart had planted long ago doctors dentists lots of orthodontists clothiers for both sexes offering styles that made brooks brothers seem new wave a profusion of dry cleaners florists interior decorators banks and brokerage houses three stationers in two blocks suddenly that made sense plenty of esqs and ltds and fauxvictorian nomenclature on the signs nowhere to eat or drink or stretch frequent signs directing the meandering tourist to the museum a hispanic man in blue cityissue coveralls pushed an industrialstrength vacuum cleaner along the sidewalk a few whitehaired figures walked around him otherwise the streets were bare the haut monde approach to exurbia pictureperfect except for the sky sootstreaked and dingy clouding the foothills because money and connections couldnt buck geography ocean winds blew the smog here and trapped by the hills it settled in for the long run san labrador air was poisonous days a year following melissas directions i drove six blocks past the commercial area took the first leftturn break in the median and got onto cotswold drive a pinecanopied straightaway that began snaking and climbing a halfmile in cool shade and postnuclear silence followed las usual dearth of humanity but here it seemed more pronounced because of the cars the lack of them not a single vehicle at the curb the no parking at any time enforced with denver boots and predatory fines rising above the empty streets were big tileroofed houses behind sloping lawns they got bigger as the grade climbed the road split at the top of the hill essex ridge to the west sussex knoll to the east no homes visible here just twostory walls of green eugenia and juniper and redberried toyon backed by forests of oak ginkgo and liquidambar i lowered my speed and cruised until i finally saw it handcarved pine gates on thick doweled posts capped with verdigrised iron the kind of hard waxed pine you see on buddhist temples and the counters of sushi bars the posts sided by iron fencing and twelvefoot hedge the numeral on the left arm of the gate on the right to the left of the an electric eye and talk box i pulled up reached out the drivers window and punched the button on the box melissas voice came out of the speaker dr delaware hi melissa one second a rumble and groan and the gates angled inward i drove up a steep stone path that had been hosed down so recently the air was misty past regimentally planted fiftyfoot incense cedars and a vacant guardhouse that could have housed a couple of middleclass families then another regiment of trees a skyblotting grove of monterey pines that stretched for several moments before condescending to smaller cousins gnarled bonsailike cypress and mountain dogwood ringed with freeform clumps of purple rhododendron white and pink camellia japonica a dark drive the silence seemed heavier i thought of gina dickinson making her way down here alone gained a new appreciation for her affliction and her progress the trees finally cleared and a stadiumsized lawn came into view ryegrass so healthylooking it could have been fresh sod edged with circular beds of begonia and star jasmine i saw flashes of light at the far west end among the cypress movement glints of metal two no three khakiclad men too distant to be clearly discernible hernandezs sons i could see why he needed five the gardeners worked on the vegetation with hand clippers barely breaking the silence with dull clicks no air guns or power tools here another covenant or house rules the path ended in a perfectly semicircular drive backed by a pair of date palms between the knobby palm trunks two flights of doublewidth bouquetcanyon stone steps flanked by wisterialaced stone balustrades led to the house peachcolored threestoried wide as a neighborhood what could have been simply monolithic grossness was merely monumental and surprisingly pleasing to the eye the visual flight piloted by fanciful turns of the architects pencil subtly shifting angles and elevations a richness of detail high arched leaded windows grilled with tealgreen neomoorish wroughtiron work balconies verandas dripstones running molds and mullions carved from mochacolored limestone a limestone colonnade on the east end spanish rooftiles honeycombed with mosaic precision stainedglass cinquefoil insets placed with a contempt for synchrony but an unerring eye for balance still the very size of the place and the solitude was oppressive and sad like an empty museum nice place to visit but i wouldnt want to be phobic here i parked and got out the gardeners clicks were augmented by birdsquawks and breezerustle i climbed the stairs unable to imagine what it would have been like to grow up here an only child the entry was big enough to accommodate a delivery truck double doors of lacquered oak trimmed with more verdigrised iron each side divided into half a dozen raised panels carved into the panels were peasant scenes that evoked highschool chaucer they held my interest as i pressed the doorbell two baritone chimes sounded then the right door opened and melissa stood there wearing a white buttondown shirt pressed blue jeans and white tennies she looked tinier than ever a doll in a dollhouse built to too large a scale she shrugged and said some place huh very beautiful she smiled relieved my father designed it he was an architect the most shed said about him in nine years i wondered what else would emerge now that id made a house call she touched my elbow briefly then drew it away come in she said let me show you around around was a vast space crammed with treasures an entry hall big enough for croquet and at its rear a sinuous green marble staircase beyond the stairs cavernous room after cavernous room galleries built for display vast and silent indistinguishable from one another in terms of function cathedral and coffered ceilings mirrorsheen paneling tapestries stainedglass skylights kaleidoscopic oriental and aubusson rugs over floors of inlaid marble and handpainted tile and french walnut parquet so much sheen and opulence that my senses overloaded and i felt myself losing equilibrium i remembered feeling that way once before over twenty years ago a college sophomore backpacking solo across europe on a secondclass rail pass and a day visiting the vatican staring bugeyed at goldencrusted walls the treasuretrove assembled in the name of god gradually pulling away from it and watching other tourists and italian peasants visiting from the southern villages gawking too the peasants never leaving a room before dropping coins in the alms boxes that stood near each door melissa was talking and pointing a docent in her own home we were in a booklined fivesided windowless room she indicated a spotlit painting over a mantel and this ones a goya the duke of montero on his steed father bought it in spain when art was much more reasonable he wasnt concerned with what was fashionable this was considered a very minor goya until just a few years ago too decorative portraiture was déclassé now auction houses write us letters all the time father had the foresight to travel to england and brought back cartons of preraphaelites when everyone else thought they were just kitsch tiffany glass pieces too during the fifties when the experts brushed those off as frivolous you know your stuff i said she blushed i was taught by jacob she nodded and looked away anyway im sure youve seen enough for one day turning heel she began walking out of the room are you interested in art yourself i said i dont know much about it not the way father or jacob did i do like things that are beautiful if nobody gets hurt by it what do you mean she frowned we left the bookfilled room passed by the open door of another huge space this one ceilinged with handpainted walnut beams and backed with tall french doors beyond the glass was more lawn and forest and flowers stone pathways statuary an amethystcolored swimming pool a sunken area vinetopped and walled with darkgreen tennis tarp under chain link from the distance came the hollow thump of a ball bouncing a couple of hundred feet back to the left of the court was a long low peachcolored building that resembled a stable ten or so wooden doors some of them ajar backing a wide cobbled courtyard filled with gleaming longnosed antique automobiles amoeboid pools of water dotted the cobblestones a figure in gray overalls bent over one of the cars chamois in hand buffing the flaring rubycolored fender of a splendid piece of machinery from the blower pipes i guessed it was a duesenberg and asked melissa for confirmation yes she said thats what it is and keeping her eyes straight ahead she led me back through the artfilled caverns toward the front of the house i dont know she said suddenly it just seems that so many things start off beautiful and turn hateful its as if being beautiful can be a curse i said mccloskey she put both hands in the pockets of her jeans and gave an emphatic nod ive been thinking about him a lot more than before a lot more since we talked she stopped turned to me blinked hard why would he come back dr delaware what does he want maybe nothing melissa maybe it means nothing if anyone can find out my friend can i hope so she said i certainly hope so when can he start ill have him call you as soon as possible his name is milo sturgis good name she said solid hes a solid guy we resumed walking a big broad woman in a white uniform was polishing a tabletop feather duster in one hand rag in the other open tin of paste wax near her knee she turned her face slightly and our eyes met madeleine grayer and wrinkled but still stronglooking a grimace of recognition tightened her face then she showed me her back and resumed her work melissa and i stepped back into the entry hall she headed for the green stairway as she touched the handrail i said in terms of mccloskey are you concerned about your own safety mine she said pausing with one foot on the first step why should i be no reason but you were just talking about beauty as a curse do you feel burdened or threatened by your own looks me her laughter was too quick too loud come on dr d lets go upstairs ill show you beautiful the top of the landing was a twentyfoot rosette of black marble inlaid with a blueandyellow sunburst pattern french provincial furniture hugged the walls potbellied bowlegged almost obscene with marquetry renaissance paintings of the sentimental school cherubs harps religious agony competed with flockedvelvet paper the color of old port footwide white molding and coving defined three hallway spokes two more women in white vacuumed the one on the right the other corridors were dark and empty more like a hotel than a museum the sad aimless ambience of a resort during the offseason melissa turned onto the middle corridor and led me past five white panel doors adorned with black and gold cloisonné knobs at the sixth she stopped and knocked a voice from within said yes melissa said dr delawares here and opened the door id been ready for another megadose of grandeur but found myself in a small simple room a sitting area no more than twelve feet square painted dovegray and lit by a single overhead milkglass fixture a white door took up a quarter of the rear wall the other walls were bare except for a single lithograph a softly colored motherandchild scene that had to be cassatt the print was centered over a rosecolored graypiped loveseat a pine coffee table and two pine chairs created a conversation area bonechina coffee service on the table woman on the couch she stood and said hello dr delaware im gina ramp soft voice she came forward her walk a curious mix of grace and awkwardness the awkwardness was all above the neck her head was held unnaturally high and tilted to one side as if recoiling from a blow pleased to meet you mrs ramp she took my hand gave it a quick gentle squeeze and let go she was tall had at least eight inches on her daughter and still modelslender in a kneelength longsleeved dress of polished gray cotton frontbuttoned to the neck patch pockets flatheeled gray sandals a plain gold wedding band on her free hand gold balls in her ears no other jewelry no perfume the hair was mediumblond and starting to silver she wore it short and straight brushed forward with feathered bangs boyish almost ascetic her face was pale oval made for the camera strong straight nose firm chin wide grayblue eyes stippled with green the pouty allure of an old studio photo replaced by something more mature more relaxed slight surrender of contour the merest sag at the seams smile lines brow furrows a suggestion of pouch at the junction of lips and cheek fortythree years old i knew from an old newspaper clipping and she looked every day of it yet age had softened her beauty enhanced it somehow she turned to her daughter and smiled lowered her head almost ritualistically and showed me the left side of her face skin stretched tight bonewhite and glassysmooth too smooth the unhealthy sheen of feversweat the jawline sharper than it should have been subtly skeletal as if stripped of an underlying layer of musculature and refurbished with something artificial her left eye drooped very slightly but noticeably and the skin beneath it was scored with a dense network of white filaments scars that seemed to be floating just beneath the surface of her skin a suspension of threadworms swimming in fleshcolored gelatin the neckflesh just below the jaw was ruled with three ruddy stripes as if shed been slapped hard and the finger marks had lingered the left side of her mouth was preternaturally straight offering harsh counterpart to the weary eye and giving her smile a lopsided cast that projected an uninvited irony she shifted her head again her skin caught the light at a different angle and took on the marbled look of a teasoaked egg offkilter beauty defiled she said to melissa thank you darling and gave a crooked smile part of the left side didnt smile along i realized that just for the moment id blocked out melissas presence i turned with a smile for her she was staring at us a hard watchful look on her face suddenly she turned up the corners of her mouth forced herself to join in the smilefest her mother said come here baby and went to her holding out her arms hugging her using her height to advantage cradling stroking melissas long hair melissa stepped back and looked at me flushed gina ramp said ill be fine baby go on melissa said have fun in a voice on the verge of cracking gave one more look back and walked out leaving the door open gina ramp walked over and closed it please make yourself comfortable doctor she said readjusting the tilt of her face so that only the good side was visible she gestured toward the china service coffee no thanks i sat in one of the chairs she returned to the loveseat sat perched at the edge back straight legs crossed at the ankles hands in lap the identical posture melissa had adopted at my house yesterday so she said smiling again she leaned forward to adjust one of the teacups spent more time at it than she had to i said good to meet you mrs ramp a pained look fought with the smile and won finally before i could answer she said im not a terrible person dr delaware of course you arent i said too emphatically it made her start and take a long look at me something about her about this place was screwing up my timing i sat back and kept my mouth shut she recrossed her legs and shifted her head as if in response to stage direction showing me only her right profile stiff and defensively genteel like a first lady on a talk show i said im not here to judge you this is about melissas going away to college thats all she tightened her lips and shook her head you helped her so much despite me no i said because of you she closed her eyes sucked in her breath and clawed her knees through the gray dress dont worry dr delaware ive come a long way i can handle harsh truths the truth mrs ramp is that melissa turned out to be the terrific young woman she is in good part because she got a lot of love and support at home she opened her eyes and shook her head very slowly youre kind but the truth is that even though i knew i was failing her i couldnt pull myself out of my out of it it sounds so weakwilled but i know i said anxiety can be as crippling as polio anxiety she said what a mild word its more like dying over and over like living on death row never knowing she swiveled revealing a crescent of damaged flesh i felt trapped helpless and inadequate so i continued to fail her i said nothing she went on do you know that in thirteen years i never attended a single parentteacher conference never applauded at her school plays or chaperoned field trips or met the mothers of the few children she played with i wasnt a mother dr delaware not in any true sense of the word shes got to resent me for it maybe even hate me has she given any indication of that no of course not melissas a good girltoo respectful to say whats on her mind even though ive tried to get her to she leaned forward again dr delaware she puts on a brave front feels she always has to be grown up a perfect little lady i did that to her my weakness did touching her bad side i turned her into a premature adult and robbed her of her childhood so i know its got to be there anger all bottled up inside i said im not going to sit here and tell you you gave her the ideal upbringing or that your fears didnt influence hers they did but throughout it all from what i saw during her therapy she perceived you as being nurturant and loving giving her unconditional love she still sees you that way she bowed her head held it with both hands as if praise hurt i said when she wet your sheets you held her and didnt get angry that means a lot more to a child than parentteacher conferences she looked up and stared at me the facial sag more evident than before shifting her head she switched to a profile view smiling i can see where youd be good for her she said you put forth your point of view with a force thats hard to debate is there a need for us to debate she bit her lip one hand flew up and touched her bad side again no of course not its just that ive been working on honesty seeing myself the way i truly am its part of my therapy but youre right im not our concern melissa is what can i do to help her im sure you know how ambivalent she is about going away to college mrs ramp right now shes framing it in terms of her concern about you worry that leaving you at this point in your therapy might upset the progress youve made so its important for her to hear from you explicitly that youll be okay that youll continue to make progress with her gone that you want her to go if you do dr delaware she said looking at me straight on of course i do and i have told her that ive been telling her since i found out shed been accepted im thrilled for her its a wonderful opportunity she must go her intensity caught me by surprise what i mean she said is that i see this as a crucial period for melissa breaking away starting a new life not that i wont miss her of course i will but ive finally gotten to a point where i can think of her the way i should have been doing all along as the child ive made tremendous progress dr delaware im ready to take some really giant steps look at life differently but i cant get melissa to see that i know she mouths the words but she hasnt changed her behavior how would you like her to change she overprotects me continues to hover ursula dr cunninghamgabney has tried to talk to her about it but melissas unresponsive the two of them seem to have a personality conflict when i try to tell her how well im doing she smiles gives me a pat and says great mom and walks away not that i blame her i let her be the parent for so long now im paying for it she lowered her gaze again rested her brow in one hand and sat that way for a long time then i havent had an attack in over four weeks dr delaware im seeing the world for the first time in a very long time and i feel i can cope with it its like being born again i dont want melissa limiting herself because of me what can i say to convince her sounds like youre saying the right things she just may not be ready to hear them i dont want to come out and tell her i dont need her i could never hurt her that way and it wouldnt be true i do need her the way any mother needs any daughter i want us always to be close and im not giving her mixed messages doctor believe me dr cunninghamgabney and i have worked on that projecting clear communication missy just refuses to hear it i said part of the problem is that some of her conflict has nothing to do with you or your progress any eighteenyearold would be anxious about leaving home for the first time the life melissas led up till now the relationship between the two of you the size of this place the isolation makes moving out scarier for her than for the average freshman by focusing on you she doesnt have to deal with her own fears this place she said holding out her hands its a monstrosity isnt it arthur collected things built himself a museum a trace of bitterness then quick cover not that he did it out of ego that wasnt arthur he was a lover of beauty believed in beautifying his world and he did have exquisite taste i have no feel for things i can appreciate a fine painting when its placed in front of me but id never accumulate its just not in my nature would you ever consider moving faint smile im considering lots of things dr delaware once the door opens its hard not to step through but we dr cunninghamgabney and i are working together to keep me in check make sure i dont get ahead of myself ive still got a long way to go and even if i was ready to dump everything and roam the world i wouldnt do that to melissa pull everything out from under her she touched the china pot smiled and said cold are you sure you dont want me to call down for fresh or something to eat have you had lunch i said im sure but thanks anyway what you said before she said avoiding her own conflicts by mothering me if thats the case how can i pull that out from under her shell come to grips with your improvement naturally gradually as you continue to make progress and to be honest you may not be able to persuade her to go to harvard before the application deadlines up she frowned i said it seems to me theres something else complicating the situation jealousy yes i know she said ursulas pointed out how jealous she is melissas got lots to be jealous of mrs ramp shes been hit with a lot of change over a short period of time besides your progress jacob dutchys death your remarriage the return of a madman what makes it even rougher for her is the fact that she takes credit or blame for initiating a good deal of the change for getting you into treatment introducing you to your husband i know she said and its true she did get me into therapy nagged me into it god bless her and therapys helped me cut a window in my cell sometimes i feel like such a fool for not doing it sooner all those years she shifted position suddenly showing me her complete face flaunting it saying nothing about her second marriage i didnt pursue it she stood suddenly made a fist held it in front of her and stared at it ive got to convince her somehow tension blanched the scarred side marbling it again bleaching the stripes on her neck im her mother for gods sake silence the distant whir of a vacuum cleaner i said you sound pretty convincing right now why dont you call her in and tell her that she thought about that lowered the fist but kept it clenched yes she said okay i will lets do it she excused herself opened the door on the rear wall and disappeared through the doorway i heard padded footsteps the sound of her voice got up and looked she sat on the edge of a canopied bed in an immense offwhite bedroom with a muraled ceiling mural of courtesans at versailles enjoying life before the deluge she sat slightly stooped bad side unprotected pressing the mouthpiece of a whiteandgold phone to her lips her feet rested on plumcolored carpeting the bed was covered with a quilted satin spread and the phone rested on a chinoiserie nightstand high crank windows flanked the bed on both sides clear glass under pleated goldfringed valances giltframed mirrors lots of lace and toile and happily pigmented paintings enough french antiques to put marie antoinette at ease she nodded said something and put the phone back in its cradle i returned to my seat she came out a moment later saying shes on her way up do you mind being here if melissa doesnt mind smile she wont shes quite fond of you sees you as her ally i said i am her ally of course she said we all need our allies dont we a few minutes later footsteps sounded from the hall gina got up met melissa at the door took her by the hand and drew her in placing both hands on melissas shoulders she looked down at her solemnly as if preparing to confer a benediction im your mother melissa anne ive made mistakes and been weak and inadequate as a mother but that doesnt change the fact that im your mother and youre my child melissa looked at her quizzically then whipped her head in my direction i gave what i hoped was a reassuring smile and shifted my glance to her mother melissa followed it gina said i know my weakness has put a burden on you baby but thats all going to change things are going to be different at the word different melissa stiffened gina saw it and drew her close hugging her melissa didnt fight it but neither did she yield i want us always to be close baby but i also want us to live our own lives we do mother no we dont sweetheart not really we love each other and care about each other youre the best daughter a mother could ever hope for but what we have is too tangled we have to untangle it get the knots out melissa pulled away a bit and stared up at her what are you saying what im saying baby is that going away back east is a golden opportunity for you your apple you earned it im so proud of you your whole future is waiting and you have the brains and the talent to make the best of it so take advantage of the opportunity i insist you take advantage melissa wriggled free you insist no im not trying to what i mean baby is that what if i dont want to take advantage of it melissas tone was soft but combative a prosecutor building the foundation for an assault gina said i just think you should go melissa anne some of the conviction had left her voice melissa smiled thats fine mother but what about what i think gina drew her close once more and pressed her to her breast melissas face was impassive gina said what you think is the most important baby but i want to make sure you know what you really think that your decision isnt clouded by your worries about me because im fine and im going to continue to be fine melissa looked up at her again her smile had widened but turned cold gina looked away from it while holding tight i said melissa your mother has given a lot of thought to this shes certain she can handle things is she yes i am said gina her voice had risen half an octave and i expect you to respect that opinion i respect all of your opinions mother but that doesnt mean i have to live my life around them ginas mouth opened and closed melissa took hold of her mothers arms and peeled them off her stepping back she looped her fingers in the belt loops of her jeans gina said please baby im not a baby mother still smiling no no you arent of course you arent i apologize for calling you that old habits are hard to break thats what this is all about changing im working on changing you know how hard ive been working melissa that means a different life for all of us i want you to go to boston melissa looked at me defiant i said talk to your mother melissa melissas attention swung back to gina then to me once more her eyes narrowed whats going on here gina said nothing ba nothing dr delaware and i have had a very good talk hes helped me clarify things even further i can see why you like him can you gina started to reply stammered and stopped i said melissa this familys going through major changes its rough for everyone your mothers searching for the right way to let you know shes really okay so that you dont feel obligated to take care of her yes said gina exactly i really am okay honey go out and live your own life be your own person melissa didnt move her smile had vanished she was wringing her hands sounds like the grownups have decided whats best for little me oh honey said gina thats not it at all i said no ones decided anything whats important is that the two of you keep talking keep the channels of communication open gina said we sure will well get through it wont we honey she walked toward her daughter arms out melissa backed away into the doorway braced herself by grasping the doorframe this is great she said just great her eyes blazed she pointed a finger at me this isnt what i expected from you honey said gina i got up melissa shook her head and held her hands out palmsfront i said melissa forget it just forget it she shuddered with anger and ran out i stuck my head out the door watched her race down the corridor legs flying hair flapping i considered going after her then thought better of it and turned back to gina trying to conjure up something profound but she was in no shape to listen her face had gone ghostly and she was clutching her chest mouth open gasping for breath body starting to shake the shakes got violent i rushed to her she stumbled back shaking her head holding me off her eyes wild reaching into one of the pockets of her dress she fumbled for what seemed like a very long time finally pulled out a small lshaped white plastic inhaler inserting the short end in her mouth she closed her eyes and tried to fasten her lips around the apparatus but her teeth chattered against the plastic and she had trouble gripping it in her mouth our eyes met but hers were glazed and i knew she was somewhere else finally she clamped her jaws around the mouthpiece and managed to inhale depressed a metal button at the tip of the inhalers long end a faint hiss sounded her cheeks remained hollow the bad side more hollow she clutched the inhaler with one hand grabbed a corner of the loveseat for balance with the other held her breath for several seconds before removing the device and collapsing on the couch her chest heaved i stood there and watched as the rhythm slowed then sat next to her she was still shaking i could feel the vibrations through the sofa cushions she mouthbreathed worked at slowing down her respiration closed her eyes then opened them saw me and closed them again her face was filmed with sweat i touched her hand she gave a weak squeeze in return her flesh was cold and moist we sat together not moving not talking she tried to say something but nothing came out she rested her head against the back of the loveseat and stared at the ceiling tears filled her eyes that was a small one she said in a feeble voice i controlled it yes you did the inhaler was still in her hand she looked at it then dropped it back in her pocket bending forward she took my hand and squeezed it again exhaled inhaled let out breath in a long cool minty stream we were so close i could hear her heart beating but i was focusing on other sounds listening for footsteps thinking of melissa returning seeing us that way when her hand relaxed i let it go it took a couple more minutes for her breathing to return to normal i said should i call someone no no im fine she patted her pocket whats in the inhaler muscle relaxant ursula and dr gabney did the research on it its very good for short term her face was soaked with sweat the feathery bangs plastered to her brow the bad side looked like inflatable plastic she said whew i said can i get you some water no no ill be fine really it looks worse than it is this was a small one the first time in four weeks i it was a tough confrontation she put her hand to her mouth melissa shooting up she ran out of the room i went after her following her slender form down one of the dark spokes to a rear spiral staircase sticking close so as not to get lost in the huge house the stairway bottomed at a short hallway just outside a pantry as big as my living room we walked through it and into the kitchen a banquetsized galley painted custardyellow and floored with white hexagonal ceramic tiles there were two walls of coolers and freezers oiled butcherblock counters and lots of copper pots hanging from castiron ceiling racks no cooking smells a bowl of fruit sat on one of the counters the industrial eightburner stove was bare gina ramp led me out past a second smaller kitchen a silver room and a paneled dining hall that could accommodate a convention looking from side to side calling out melissas name getting silence in return we backtracked made a couple of turns and ended in the room with the painted ceiling beams two men in tennis whites came through the french doors holding rackets and wearing towels around their necks both were big and well built the younger man was in his twenties with thick shaggy yellow hair worn past his shoulders a long thin face was dominated by narrow dark eyes and a cleft chin deep enough to hide a diamond his tan had taken more than one summer to build the second man in his early fifties i guessed was thickset but not flabby a lifelong athlete whod stayed in condition heavyjawed and blueeyed executivecut black hair with gray temples clipped gray mustache precisely as wide as his mouth seamed ruddy complexion marlboro man goes country club he cocked an eyebrow and said gina whats up his voice was mellow and resonant the kind that seems friendly even if it isnt have you seen melissa don sure just a minute ago directing his gaze at me something the mat do you know where she is don she left with noel with noel he was doing the cars she came running out like a bat out of hades said something to him and the two of them drove off in the corvette something wrong geen oh boy gina sagged the mustachioed man put his arm around her shoulder cast another searching look at me whats going on gina forced a smile and fluffed her hair its nothing don just a this is dr delaware the psychologist i told you about he and i were trying to talk to melissa about college and she got upset im sure itll blow over he held her arm pursed his lips in a way that made his mustache peak in the middle and arched his eyebrows again strong and silent another one to the camera born gina said doctor this is my husband donald ramp don dr alex delaware pleased to meet you ramp extended a big hard hand and we shook briefly the younger man had retreated to a corner of the room ramp said they cant have gotten too far geen if youd like i can go after them see if i can haul em back gina said no its okay don she touched his cheek the price of living with a teenager darling anyway im sure shell be back fairly soon maybe they just went to get gas the younger man was examining a jade bowl with a fascination too intense to be genuine lifting it putting it down lifting it again gina turned to him how are you today todd the bowl descended and stayed put great mrs ramp and you muddling along todd how did don do today the blond man gave her a toothpastead smile and said hes got the moves all he needs is to work ramp groaned and stretched these old bones rebel against work turning to me doctor this is todd nyquist my trainer tennis coach and allaround grand inquisitor nyquist grinned and touched one finger to his temple doctor ramp said not only do i suffer i pay for it obligatory smiles all around ramp looked at his wife you sure theres nothing i can do honey no don well just wait theyre bound to be back soon noels not finished yet is he ramp looked out the doors toward the cobbled courtyard doesnt look like it the isotta and the delahaye are both due for a wax and all hes been doing so far is washing okay said gina so they probably did go for gas theyll be back and then dr delaware and i will take up where we left off you go shower off mister dont worry about a thing tight voice all of them tight squeezing out chitchat like meat through a grinder tight silence i felt as if id wandered into the middle of a collaboration between noel coward and edward albee gina said drink anyone ramp touched his midriff not for me im going for that shower good to meet you doctor thanks for everything i said no problem not sure what he was thanking me for he used one end of the towel to wipe his face winked at no one in particular and began walking off then he stopped looked over his shoulder at nyquist hang in todd see you wednesday if you promise to spare the thumbscrews you bet mr r said nyquist grinning again to gina i could handle a pepsi mrs r or anything else you got thats cold and sweet ramp continued to look at him hesitated as if contemplating return then walked off nyquist flexed his knees stretched his neck ran his fingers through his mane and checked the netting on his racket gina said ill get madeleine to fix you something nyquist said sure bet but his grin died leaving him standing there she escorted me to the front of the house we sat in overstuffed chairs in one of the caverns surrounded by works of genius and fancy any space not filled with art was paneled with mirror all that reflection turned true perspective into a carny joke nearly engulfed by cushions i felt diminished gulliver in brobdingnag she shook her head and said what a disaster how could i have handled it better i said you did fine its going to take time for her to readjust she doesnt have that much time harvard needs to be notified like i said mrs ramp it may not be realistic to expect her to be ready by some arbitrary deadline she didnt respond to that i said suppose she spends a year here watching you get better getting comfortable with the changes she can always transfer to harvard during her sophomore year i guess she said but i really want her to go not for me touching her bad side for her she needs to get away from this place its so its a world to itself all her needs met everything done for her that can be crippling sounds like youre afraid that if she doesnt leave now she never will she sighed despite all this she said taking in the room all the beauty it can be malignant a house with no doors believe me i know that startled me i thought id concealed it but she said what is it the phrase you just used a house with no doors when i treated her melissa used to draw houses without doors and windows oh she said oh my touching the pocket that held the inhaler did you ever use the phrase in front of her i dont think i did that would be terrible if i did wouldnt it putting that image into her head not necessarily i said hear ye hear ye the great yeasayer cometh it gave her a concrete image to deal with when she got better she started drawing houses with doors i doubt this place will ever be for her what it was for you how can you be sure of that i cant be sure of anything i said gently i just dont think we need to assume that your prison is hers despite the gentleness it wounded her yes of course youre right shes her own person i shouldnt see her as my clone pause so you think itll be okay for her to live here in the interim how long of an interim long enough for her to get comfortable about leaving from what i saw nine years ago shes pretty good at pacing herself she said nothing gazed at a tenfoot grandfather clock veneered with tortoise shell i said maybe they decided to go for a drive noel hasnt finished his work she said as if that settled it she got up walked around the room slowly staring at the floor i began taking a closer look at the paintings flemish and dutch and renaissance italian works i felt i should have been able to identify but the pigments were brighter and fresher than any id seen in museum old masters some of them bordered on lurid i remembered what jacob dutchy had said about arthur dickinsons passion for restoration realized how much of a dead mans aura remained in the house house as monument mausoleum sweet mausoleum from across the room she said i feel terrible i meant to thank you right off as soon as we were introduced for all you did years ago as well as what youre doing now but we got into things and i forgot please forgive me and accept my disgracefully belated thanks i said accepted she looked at the clock again i do hope they get back soon they didnt a half hour passed thirty very long minutes filled with smalltalk and a crash course in flemish art delivered with robotic enthusiasm by my hostess throughout it all i kept hearing dutchys voice wondered what the voice of the man whod taught him sounded like when she ran out of things to say she stood and said maybe they did go out for a drive theres no sense in your waiting around im so sorry for wasting your time pushing myself up from the quicksand cushions i followed her on a furniturestrewn obstacle course that ended at the front doors she opened one of them and said when she does come home should i get right into it with her no i wouldnt push it let her behavior be your guide when shes ready to talk youll know it if you want me to be there next time you have a discussion and that suits melissa i can be but she may be angry at me feel i betrayed her im sorry she said i didnt want to spoil things between you that can be fixed i said whats important is what goes on between you she nodded patted her pocket came closer and touched my face the way shed touched her husbands gave me a closeup look at her scars a white brocade and kissed my cheek back on the freeway back on planet earth sitting in the jam at the downtown interchange i listened to the gipsy kings and tried not to think about whether id screwed up thought about it anyway and decided id done the best i could when i got home i phoned milo he picked up and growled yeah gee what a friendly greeting keeps away scambags trying to peddle bullshit and geeks taking surveys whats up ready to get to work on the excon thing yeah ive been thinking about it figure fifty an hour plus expenses is reasonable that going to sit okay with the clients i didnt have a chance to get into the financial details yet but i wouldnt worry theres no shortage of funds and the client says she has full access to plenty why wouldnt she shes only eighteen and you want me to work for the kid herself alex jesus how many cookie jars we talking about this is no ditsy teenager milo shes had to grow up fast too fast and she has her own money assured me payment would be no problem i just need to make sure she realizes exactly what it entails thought id get to it today but something else came up the kid herself he said do i look like mister rogers or something well i said i know you like me just the way i am he said jesus again then tell me more about this who exactly got damaged and what kind of damage i started describing the acid attack on gina ramp he said whoa sounds like the mccloskey case you know it i know of it it was a few years before my time but it was a teaching case at the academy interrogation procedures any particular reason the weirdness of it and the guy who taught the course eli savage was one of the original interrogators weird in what way in terms of motive cops are like anyone else they like to classify reduce things to basics money jealousy revenge passion or some sort of sexual kink sums up ninetynine percent of your violentcrime motives this one just didnt fit any of those the way i remember learning it mccloskey and the victim had once had a thing going but it ended friendly half a year before he had her burned no pining away on his part no poison pen or love letters or anonymous phone calls or any of the harassment you typically see in an unrequited passion situation and she wasnt going out with any other guys so jealousy seemed out of the question money wasnt a strong bet because he had no insurance out on her no one discovered any way hed made a dime off the attack and he actually paid out plenty to the yog who did the dirty work in terms of revenge there was some speculation that he blamed her for his business going bad he had a modeling agency i think im impressed dont be you dont forget a case like that i remember they showed us photos of her face before and after and during she had tons of surgery it was a real mess i kept wondering what kind of person could do that to someone else now of course i know better but those were the days of sweet innocence anyway in terms of the money motive it turns out losing the agency had nothing to do with her either mccloskey was on the skids due to his drinking and some very heavy doping and he himself went out of his way to make that clear during his interrogation kept telling the detectives hed fucked up his life begged to be put out of his misery wanting everyone to know that his putting the contract out on her had nothing to do with business what did it have to do with thats the big question mark he refused to say no matter how hard they pressed him turned deaf and mute any time the issue of motive came up leaving only the psychopath angle but no one uncovered any history of violence he was a punk and an asshole liked to hang around gangsters do the vegas bit but that was more of a pose everyone who knew him said he was a weenie weenies can snap or get elected to office so sure maybe he was faking it maybe he was a goddam sadist and hid it so well no one ever figured it out that was savages hunch something psychological maybe kinky the case stuck in his craw he prided himself on being a topnotch questioner he ended the lecture with this speech about how mccloskeys motive didnt really matter what counted was the asshole was behind bars for a long time and that was our job put em away let the shrinks figure em out i said a long times up how long did he stay in thirteen years on a twentythreeyear sentence time off for good behavior then they gave him parole for six usually paroles limited to three probably made some kind of a deal he grimaced par for the course burn someones face rape a baby whatever attend remedial reading class and dont get caught shanking anyone and you walk in half the time he paused said thirteen huh that would be some time ago and youre saying he just got back to town i nodded he spent most of his parole in new mexico and arizona working on an indian reservation the old dogooder scam six years is a long time to scam but who knows if he behaved himself for six years who knows how many dead indians paid for it even if he did six isnt that long if the alternative is shoveling shit in some landfill or doing more time did he also pull a chuckie colson and find jesus i dont know what else do you know about him just that hes off parole free and clear and that his last parole officers named bayliss and hes ready to retire or already has sounds like your eighteenyearolds a pretty good sleuth herself she learned all of this from one of the servants a guy named dutchy kind of a superbutler he kept tabs on mccloskey from the time he was convicted very protective of the whole family but hes dead now ah he said leaving the helpless rich to protect themselves has mccloskey tried to get in touch with the family no as far as i know the victim and her husband arent even aware hes back in town melissa the girl knows and its hanging over her head for good reason he said so you do think mccloskeys dangerous who knows on the one hand youve got the fact that hes been out of jail for six years and hasnt made any moves on the other youve got the fact that he left the indians and came back here maybe theres a good reason that has nothing to do with nastiness maybe not bottom line is it would be a smart idea to find out or at least try ergo yeah ergo time to sharpen up the old private eye okay if she wants me to ill do it thanks milo yeah yeah the thing is alex even if he does have a solid reason for being back id still be concerned whys that what i told you before the motive thing the fact that no one knows why the hell he did it no one ever got a fix on him maybe thirteen years opened him up and he blabbed to a cellmate or talked to some jail shrink but if he didnt that means hes a secretive fucker mucho patient and that pushes my buttons fact is if i was less of a macho invincible guy that would goddam well scare me after he hung up i thought of calling san labrador but decided to let melissa and gina try to work things out i went down to the pond tossed pellets to the koi and sat facing the waterfall the fish were more active than usual but seemed uninterested in food they were chasing one another in tight formations of three or four racing and splashing and bumping against the rock rims puzzled i bent down and got close to the water the fish ignored me continued circling then i saw it males chasing females spawn shiny clusters clinging to the irises that sprouted in the corners of the pond pale caviar fragile as soap bubbles glistening under the setting sun first time in all the years id had the pond maybe it meant something i crouched and watched for a while wondering if the fish would eat the eggs before they hatched if any of the young would survive i felt a sudden urge to rescue but knew it was out of my hands nowhere to put the spawn professional breeders kept multiple ponds removing the eggs and putting them in buckets would kill all chances of survival nothing to do but wait nothing like impotence to round off a charming day i went back up to the house and made dinner a grilled minute steak salad and a beer ate it in bed listening to perlman and zukerman do mozart on cd most of me getting lost in the music a small segment of consciousness standing guard waiting for a call from san labrador the concert ended no call another disc cued itself the miracle of technology the cd player was stateoftheart a gift from a man who preferred machines to people another dynamic duo took center stage stan getz and charlie byrd brazilian rhythms didnt do the trick either the phone remained mute more of me slipped away from the music i thought of joel mccloskey apparently remorseful but keeping his motive hidden thought of how hed shattered gina paddocks life scars visible and otherwise the hooks that people embedded in one another while trolling for love the agony when the barbs had to come out impulsively without thinking it through i phoned san antonio a stuffedsinus female twang said yaylo i heard tv noise in the

therell be no diapers to deal with both of us laughed said so at the same time and laughed again synchrony but stilted like bad summerstock theater she said been down to the school last week everything seems to be going well real well from what i hear i spoke to ben a couple of days ago hes turned out to be a bangup principal hes a nice guy i said organized too you made a good recommendation yeah he is very organized she gave another heartless chuckle wonder if ill have a job when i get back im sure you will made any plans yet in terms of getting back no she said sharply how in the world can i i was silent she said i didnt mean to snap alex its just been hell waiting sometimes i think waitings the hardest thing in the world even worse than anyway no sense obsessing on it its all part of growing up and being a big girl and facing reality isnt it id say youve had more than your share of reality lately yeah she said good for toughening up the old hide i kind of like your hide the way it is pause alex thanks for coming out last month the three days you spent out here were the best days ive had want me to come out again i wish i could say yes but id be no good to

correctly shes the original helpless hannah a broken nails a major tragedy till now shes been one of those lucky idiots never had to deal with anything like this but the sicker he gets the more she falls apart and when she falls apart she talks lord how she talks i dont know how daddy tolerates it thank god im here to shelter him its as if shes bad weather a wordstorm i said i know i got caught in the downpour poor you ill survive silence i tried to conjure her face blond hair against my chest the feel of our bodies the images wouldnt come anyway she said sounding very tired is there anything i can do for you long distance thanks but i cant think of anything alex just think good thoughts about me and take care of yourself you too linda ill be fine i know you will she said i think i hear him coughing yeah i sure do got to be going bye bye i changed into shorts a tshirt and sneakers and tried to run off the phone call and the twelve hours that had preceded it got home just as the sun was setting showered and put on my ratty yellow bathrobe and rubber thongs after dark i went back down to the garden and ran a flashlight over the surface of the water the fish were inert even the light didnt arouse them postcoital bliss some of the egg clusters seemed to have dissipated but several remained adhering to the pond walls after id been down there for a quarter of an hour i heard the phone news from san labrador finally hopefully mother and daughter had started to talk i vaulted up the stairs to the landing and made it into the house in time to catch it on the fifth ring hello alex familiar voice familiar though i hadnt heard it in a long time this time the images tumbled out like vendingmachine candy hello robin you sound out of breath everything okay fine just made a mad dash up from the garden hope im not interrupting anything no no whats up nothing much just wanted to say hi i thought her voice lacked buoyancy but it had been a while since id been an expert on anything to do with her hi howve you been doing just great working on an archtop for joni mitchell shes going to use it on her next album terrific lots of handcarving im enjoying the challenge whatve you been up to working thats good alex same thing linda had said identical inflections the protestant ethic or something about me i said hows dennis gone flew the coop oh its okay alex it was longbrewing no great shakes okay im not trying to be a tough broad alex say it didnt affect me at all it did in the beginning even though it was mutual theres always that empty space but im over it it wasnt like what he and i had was i mean it had its merits as well as its problems but it was different from you and me it would have to be yes she said i dont know if therell ever be anything like what we had thats not a manipulation just the way i feel my eyelids began to ache i said i know alex she said in a pinched voice dont feel pressured to respond in any way god that sounds so ridiculous im so afraid of going out on a limb here what is it im feeling really lousy tonight alex i could really use a friend i heard myself saying im your friend whats the problem so much for steely resolve alex she said timidly could it be facetoface not just over the phone sure she said my place or yours then laughed too loudly i said ill come to you i drove to venice as if in a dream parked in back of the storefront on pacific impervious to the graffiti and the trash smells the shadows and sounds that filled the alley by the time i reached the front door she had it open dim lights touched upon the hulls of heavy machinery woodsweetness and lacquerbite floated forth from the workshop mixing with her perfume one id never smelled before it made me feel jealous and antsy and thrilled she had on a grayandblack floorlength kimono the bottom hems flecked with sawdust curves through silk slender wrists bare feet her auburn curls were lustrous and loose tumbling around her shoulders fresh makeup age lines id never seen the heartshaped face id woken up to so many mornings still beautiful as familiar as morning but some region of it new uncharted journeys shed taken alone it made me sad her dark eyes burned with shame and longing she forced herself to look into mine her lip trembled and she shrugged i took her in my arms felt her wrap around me and adhere a second skin found her mouth and her heat lifted her in my arms and carried her up to the loft the first thing i felt the next morning was confusion a desolate bafflement throbbing like a hangover though we hadnt drunk the first thing i heard was a slow rhythmic rasp a leisurely sambabeat from down below empty bed beside me some things never change sitting up i looked over the loft rail and saw her working handsanding the rosewood back of a guitar clamped to a padded vise hunched at her bench wearing denim overalls safety goggles and a surgical mask her hair tied up in a curly knot bittersweetchocolate curls of wood collecting at her feet i watched her for a while then got dressed and went downstairs she didnt hear me kept working and i had to step directly in front of her to catch her attention even then there was a delay before our eyes met her focus narrowed and intense was aimed on the richly patterned wood finally she stopped placing the file on the bench top and pulling down the mask the goggles were filmed with pinkish dust making her eyes look bloodshot this is it the one for joni she said cranking open the vise lifting the instrument and rotating it to give me a frontal view your basic carved belly but instead of maple she wants rosewood for the back and sides with only a minimal arch should be interesting to hear it i said good morning good morning she put the guitar back in the vise kept her glance lowered even after the instrument was secured her fingers grazed the file sleep well great how about you great too feel like breakfast not really she said theres plenty in the fridgemi fridge es su fridge feel free i said im not hungry either her fingernails drummed the file sorry for what not wanting breakfast major felony i said youre busted she smiled looked down at the bench again then back at me you know how it is the momentum i woke up early fivefifteen because i really didnt sleep well not because of i was just restless thinking about this caressing the guitars convex back and tapping it still trying to figure out exactly how i was going to get into the grain this is brazilian quarter sawn can you imagine how much i paid for a piece this thick and how long i had to look to find one this wide she wants a onepiece back so i cant afford to mess it up knowing that jams me up its been slow going but this morning i got into it pretty easily so i kept going i guess it just swept me along what time is it seventen youre kidding she said flexing her fingers cant believe ive been working for almost two hours flexing again i said sore no i feel great been doing these hand exercises to ward off the cramps and its really working she touched the file again i said youre on a roll kiddo dont stop now i kissed the top of her head she took hold of my wrist with one hand used the other to push the goggles up on her brow her eyes really were bloodshot poor goggle fit or tears alex i i placed a finger over her lips and kissed her left cheek remnants of the perfume now familiar tickled my nose mixed with wood dust and sweat a cocktail that brought back too many memories i freed my wrist she grabbed it pressed it to her cheek our pulses merged alex she said looking up at me blinking hard i didnt set it up to happen this way please believe me what i said about friendship was true theres nothing to apologize for somehow i feel there is i said nothing alex whats going to happen i dont know she lowered my hand pulled away and faced the workbench what about her she said the teacher the teacher id told her linda was a school principal demotion in service of the ego i said shes in texas indefinitely sick father oh sorry to hear that anything serious heart problems hes not doing too well she turned faced me blinked hard again memories of her own fathers sludged arteries or maybe it was the dust alex she said i dont want to i know i have no right to ask this but whats your understanding with her i moved to the foot of the bench leaned on it with both hands and stared up at the corrugations on the steel ceiling there is no understanding i said were friends would this hurt her i dont imagine it would make her whoop for joy but im not planning on submitting a written report the anger in my voice was strong enough to make her clutch the bench top i said listen im sorry this is just a lot to deal with and im feeling jammed up myself not because of her maybe thats part of it but most of it is us being together all of a sudden the way it was last night shit how longs it been two years twentyfive months she said but whos counting she put her head on my chest touched my ear touched my neck it could have been twentyfive hours i said or twentyfive years she inhaled deeply we fit she said i forgot how well she came to me reached up and held my shoulders alex what we had its like a tattoo youve got to cut deeply to remove it i was thinking in terms of fishhooks yanking them out she flinched and touched her arm i said choose your analogy either way its major pain we stared at each other tried to temper the silence with smiles and failed she said there could be something again alex why shouldnt there be answers flooded my head a babel of replies contradictory jabber before i could pick a reason she said lets at least think about it what can we lose by thinking about it i said even if i wanted to i couldnt not think about it you own too much of me her eyes got wet ill take what i can get i said happy carving and turned to leave she called out my name i stopped and looked back she had her hands on her hips and her face was contorted in that littlegirl scrunch that women never seem to outgrow prelude to tears probably carried on the x chromosome before the valves opened fullforce she yanked down her goggles picked up her file turned her back on me and began to scrape i left hearing the same rasprasp samba that had greeted me upon waking felt no desire to dance knowing i had to fill the day with something impersonal or go mad i drove to the university biomedical library to seek out references for my monograph i found plenty of stuff that looked promising on the computer screen but little that turned out to be relevant by the time noon rolled around id generated lots of heat very little light and knew it was time to buckle down and wrestle with my own data instead i used a pay phone just outside the library to call in for messages nothing from san labrador six others no emergencies i returned all of them then i drove into westwood village paid too much for parking found a coffee shop masquerading as a restaurant and read the paper while chewing my way through a rubbery hamburger by the time i got home id managed to push the day along to pm i checked the pond a bit more spawn but the fish still looked subdued i wondered if they were all right id read somewhere that they could damage themselves in the throes of passion the uniforms changed but the game never did i fed them picked dead leaves out of the garden threetwenty light housekeeping took up another half hour bereft of excuses i went into the library pulled out my manuscript and began working it went well when i finally looked up id been going for almost two hours i thought of robin you know how it is the momentum the fit the impetus of loneliness propelling us toward each other fishhooks back to work the drudgery defense i picked up my pen and tried kept at it until the words ran out and my chest got tight it was seven by the time i got up from the desk and when the phone rang i was grateful dr delaware this is joan at your service ive got a call from a melissa dickinson she says its an emergency put her on please click dr delaware what is it melissa its mother what about her shes gone oh god please help me i dont knowhatodo okay melissa slow down and tell me exactly what happened shes gone shes gone i cant find her anywhere not on the grounds or in any of the rooms i was looking we all were looking and shes not here please dr delaware how longs she been gone melissa since twothirty she left for the clinic for her three oclock group was supposed to be back by fivethirty and its sevenohfour and they dont know where she is either oh god whos they the clinic the gabneys thats where she went she had a group meeting from three to five usually she goes with don or someone else once i took her but this time panting gulping for air i said if you feel youre losing your breath find a paper bag and breathe into it slowly no no im okay got to tell you everything im listening yes yes where was i oh god usually she goes with someone but this ti she was supposed to go with him don but she decided to go herself insisted on it i told her i didnt think that was but she was stubborn insisted she could handle it

to be okay she didnt show up at the clinic at all no and they didnt call till four to let us know they should have called right away shouldnt they how long a ride is it to the clinic twenty minutes at the most she gave herself a half hour which was more than enough they should have known when she didnt if theyd called right away we could have looked for her right away shes been gone for over four hours oh god is it possible i said that she changed her mind and went somewhere else instead of the clinic where where would she go i dont know melissa but after talking to your mother i can understand her wanting to improvise break free of her routine its not that uncommon in patients who conquer their fears sometimes they get a little reckless no she said she wouldnt do that not without calling she knows how much it would worry me even dons concerned and nothing gets to him he called the police and they went out looking for her but they havent found her or the dawn she was driving her rollsroyce yes then she shouldnt be too hard to spot even in san labrador then why hasnt anyone seen it how could nobody have seen her dr delaware i thought of the empty streets and had a ready answer for that im sure someone did i said maybe she ran into mechanical problems its an old car even rolls arent perfect no way noel keeps all the cars in top shape and the dawn was like new and if she did run into problems shed call she wouldnt do this to me shes like an infant dr delaware she cant survive out there doesnt have any idea of what its like out there oh god what if she had an attack and drove off a cliff or something and is lying there helpless i cant take this anymore this is just too much too much sobs poured out of the receiver so loud i pulled my ear away involuntarily i heard a catch of breath melissa im freaking out cant breathe relax i commanded you can breathe you can breathe just fine do it breathe regularly and slowly strangulated gasp from the other end breathe melissa do it in and out in and out feel your muscles loosen and expand with every breath you take feel yourself relax just relax relax i relax melissa dont try to talk just breathe and relax deeper and deeper in and out in and out your whole bodys getting heavier deeper and deeper relaxed think of pleasant things your mother walking through the door shes okay shes going to be okay but just listen to me melissa do what i say freaking out cant help her getting upset cant help her worrying cant help her you need to be at your best so keep breathing and relaxing are you sitting down no i uh find a chair and sit down rustle and bump okay im sitting good now find a comfortable position stretch your feet out and relax breathe slowly and deeply every breath you take will make you deeper and deeper relaxed silence melissa okay im okay whoosh of breath good would you like me to come out there a whispered yes then youll have to hold on long enough for me to get out there it will take at least half an hour okay youre sure i can stay on the phone until youre settled no yes im okay please come please hang in there i said im out the door empty streets made lonelier by the darkness as i drove up sussex knoll a pair of headlights appeared in my rearview mirror and remained there constant as the moon when i turned off at the pine gates of number a blinking red light appeared over the two white ones i stopped switched off the engine and waited an amplified voice said out of the car sir i complied a san labrador police cruiser was nudging my rear bumper its brights on its engine running i could smell the gasoline feel the heat from its radiator the red blinker colored my white shirt pink erased it colored again the drivers door opened and an officer got out one hand on his hip big and wide he lifted something a flashlight beam blinded me and i raised an arm reflexively both hands up in the air where i can see them sir more compliance the light traveled up and down my body squinting i said im dr alex delaware melissa dickinsons doctor im expected the cop stepped closer caught some of the light from the halogen fixture over the left gatepost and turned into a young white man with a heavy prognathous jaw baby skin and pug features his hat was pulled low over his forehead on a sitcom hed be called moose whos expecting you sir the beam lowered illuminating my trousers the family what family dickinson ramp melissa dickinson called me about her mother and asked me to come over has mrs ramp shown up yet whatd you say your name was sir delaware alex delaware with a tilt of my head i indicated the talk box why dont you call over to the house and verify that he digested that as if it were profound i said can i put my hands down move to the rear of your car sir put your hands on the trunk keeping his eyes on me he advanced to the box push of a button and don ramps voice said yes this is officer skopek san labrador police sir im down by your front gate got a gentleman here who claims to be a friend of the family whos that mr delaware oh yes its okay officer another voice came out of the box loud and dictatorial anything yet skopek no sir keep looking yes sir skopek touched his hat and turned off his flashlight the pine gates began sliding inward i opened the door of the seville skopek followed me and waited until id turned the ignition on when i put the seville in gear he stuck his face in the drivers window and said sorry for the inconvenience sir not sounding sorry at all just following orders huh yes sir spotlights and lowvoltage accent beams set among the trees created a nightscape walt disney would have cherished a fullsize buick sedan was parked in front of the mansion rear searchlight and lots of antennas ramp answered the door wearing a blue blazer gray flannels bluestriped buttondown shirt with a perfect collar roll and winecolored pocket square despite the fashion statement he looked drawn and angry doctor no handshake he walked ahead of me fast leaving me to close the door i stepped into the entry another man stood in front of the green staircase examining a cuticle as i got closer he looked up looked me over early sixties just under six feet and hefty with a big hard paunch thin gray brylcreemed hair meaty features filling a broad face the color of raw sweetbreads steelrimmed glasses over a fleshy nose bladder jowls compressing a small fussy mouth he had on a gray suit cream shirt grayandblack striped tie masonic stickpin american flag lapel pin vfw lapel pin beeper on his belt size thirteen wingtips on his feet he kept scrutinizing ramp said doctor this is our police chief clifton chickering chief dr delaware melissas psychiatrist chickerings first look told me id been the topic of discussion the second one let me know what he thought of psychiatrists i figured telling him i was a psychologist wouldnt alter that much but i did it anyway he said doctor he and ramp looked at each other he nodded at ramp ramp glared at me why the devil he said didnt you tell us that bastard was back in town mccloskey do you know of some other bastard whod want to harm my wife melissa told me about him in confidence i had to respect her wishes oh christ ramp turned his back on me and began pacing the entry hall chickering said any particular reason for the girl to keep it confidential why dont you ask her i did she says she didnt want to alarm her mother then youve got your answer chickering said uhhuh and shot me the kind of look viceprincipals reserve for teenage psychopaths she could have told me said ramp stopping his pacing if id known id have looked out for her for gods sake i said is there evidence mccloskey was involved in the disappearance christ said ramp hes here shes gone what more do you need hes been in town for six months this is the first time shes been out on her own he hung around and waited i turned to chickering from what ive seen chief you keep a pretty tight lid on things whats the chance mccloskey could have been hanging around the neighborhood for six months stalking her without being noticed chickering said zero to ramp good point don if hes behind it well know it soon enough ramp said why all the confidence cliff you havent found him yet chickering frowned weve got his address all the particulars hes being staked out when he surfaces hell be snapped up faster than a free turkey dinner on skid row what makes you think hell surface what if hes off somewhere with don said chickering i understa well i dont said ramp how the hell is staking out his address going to do a damn thing when hes probably long gone chickering said its the criminal mind they tend to return to roost ramp gave a disgusted look and resumed pacing chickering went a shade paler parboiled sweetbreads were interfacing with lapd pasadena glendale and the sheriffs don got everyones computers on the job the rolls plates are on all their alert lists theres no car registered to him but all the hot sheets are being scrutinized how many cars on the hot sheets ten thousand everyones looking don taking it seriously he cant get far ramp ignored him kept pacing chickering turned to me this wasnt a good secret to keep doctor ramp muttered thats for damn sure i said i understand how you feel but i had no choice melissas a legal adult ramp said what you did was legal huh well see about that a voice from the top of the stairs said just get off his case don melissa stood on the landing dressed in a mans shirt and jeans her hair tied back carelessly the shirt made her look undernourished she came down the curving flight fast swinging her arms like a jogger ramp said melissa she stood before him chin up hands fisted just leave him alone don he didnt do anything i was the one who asked him to keep it secret he had to listen so just lay off ramp drew himself up weve heard all tha melissa screamed shut up dammit i dont want to hear this crap anymore ramps turn to go pale his hands quavered chickering said i think youd best calm down young lady melissa turned to him and shook her fist dont you dare tell me what to do you should be out doing your job getting your stupid rentacops to find my mother instead of standing around with him drinking our scotch chickerings face tensed with rage then settled into a sick smile melissa said ramp melissa she mimicked his outraged tone i dont have time for this crap my mothers out there and we have to find her so lets stop looking for scapegoats and just figure out how to find her thats exactly what were doing young lady said chickering how with neighborhood patrols whats the point shes not in san labrador anymore if she was she would have been spotted long ago a moments pause before chickering answered were doing everything we can it sounded hollow he knew it the look on both ramps face and melissas drove it home he buttoned his coat tight across the midriff turned to ramp ill stay as long as you need me but in your interests i should be out on the streets sure said ramp dispiritedly chin up don well find her dont you worry ramp shrugged and walked away disappearing into the innards of the mansion chickering said good to meet you doctor his index finger pointed like a revolver to melissa young lady he saw himself out when the door closed melissa said idiot everyone knows hes an idiot the kids all call him prickering behind his back theres basically no crime in san labrador so no one challenges him its not because of him though just that outsiders stick out like sore thumbs and the police roust anyone who doesnt look rich talking rapidly but fluently just a slight raise of pitch a tinge of the panic id heard over the phone i said your basic smalltown setup she said thats what this place is hicksville nothing ever happens here she lowered her head and shook it only now it has it is my fault dr delaware i should have told her about him melissa theres no indication mccloskey has anything to do with this think of what you just said about the police rousting outsiders the chance of anyone being able to stalk her without being spotted is nil stalk she shivered let out breath i hope youre right then where is she what happened to her i chose my words carefully its possible melissa that nothing happened to her that she did this on her own youre saying she ran away im saying she may have taken a drive and decided to prolong it no way she shook her head vehemently no way melissa when i talked to your mother i got the sense she was chafing at the bit really yearning for some freedom she kept shaking her head turned her back on me and faced the green staircase i said she talked to me about being ready to take giant steps of standing before an open door and having to walk through she spoke of this house as stifling her i got the distinct impression she wanted out and was even considering moving once youd gone away no she didnt take anything with her i checked her room all the suitcases are there i know everything in her closet and she didnt take any of her clothes im not saying she planned a trip melissa im talking about something spontaneous impulsive no another sharp head shake she was careful she wouldnt do this to me you are her main concern but maybe she got intoxicated by her newfound freedom she insisted on driving by herself today wanted to feel in control maybe once she got out on the road driving her favorite car it felt so good she just kept going that has nothing to do with her love for you but sometimes when things start to change they change fast she bit her lip fought back tears and said in a very small voice you really think shes okay i think you need to do everything possible to try to locate her but i wouldnt assume the worst she took several breaths punched her sides kneaded her hands out on the road and she just kept going wouldnt that be something wideeyed fascinated by the possibility then fascination gave way to injury no i just cant see it she wouldnt do that to me she loves you dearly melissa but she yes she does she said crying yes she does love me and i want her back footsteps sounded on the marble to our left we turned toward it ramp was standing there blazer over one arm melissa used her bare hands to dry her eyes hastily and ineffectually he said im sorry melissa you were right theres no sense blaming anybody sorry if i offended you too doctor i said no offense taken melissa turned away from him he came over and shook my hand melissa was tapping her foot fingercombing her hair ramp said melissa i know how you fee the point is were in this together weve all got to hang together to get her back melissa spoke without looking at him what do you want from me he gave a concerned look it seemed genuine paternal she ignored it he said i know chickerings a moron i dont have any more confidence in him than you do so lets put our heads together see if we can come up with something for gods sake he held out his hands frozen in supplication genuine pain on his face unless he was better than olivier she said whatever sounding that bored had to be a strain he said look theres no sense standing around out here lets go in stay near the phone can i get you something to drink doctor coffee if youve got it sure bet we followed him through the house settled in the rear room with the french doors and painted beams the gardens and rolling lawns and tennis court were bathed in emerald light the pool was a lozenge of peacock blue all but one of the doors to the car stable were closed ramp picked up a phone on an end table punched two digits and said pot of coffee in the rear study please three cups hanging up he said make yourself comfortable doctor i settled in a suncracked club chair the color of a wellused saddle melissa perched on the arm of a canebacked chair nearby scratched her lip tugged at her ponytail ramp remained standing every hair in place but his face showed the strain a moment later madeleine came in with the coffee and set it down without comment ramp thanked her dismissed her and poured three cups black for me and himself cream and sugar for melissa she accepted it but didnt drink ramp and i sipped no one spoke ramp said let me call malibu again he picked up the phone and punched in a number held it to his ear for several moments before putting it back in its cradle treating the apparatus with special care as if it held his fate i said whats in malibu our ginas beach house broad beach not that shed go there but its the only thing i can think of melissa said thats ridiculous she hates the water ramp punched buttons again waited several moments and hung up we sipped some more ate more silence melissa put her cup down and said this is stupid before either ramp or i could reply the phone rang melissa beat ramp for it yes but speak to me first just do it dammit im the one who what oh no what do you thats ridiculous how can you be sure thats stupid no im perfectly capable of no you listen to me you she stood there openmouthed pulled the phone away from her face and stared at it he hung up who said ramp prickering that ass hung up on me what did he have to say still gazing at the phone she said mccloskey they found him downtown la the la police questioned him and let him go christ said ramp he snatched the phone out of her hand punched buttons hurriedly twisting his shirt collar and grinding his teeth cliff this is don ramp melissa said you i understand that cliff i know she is its a frightening thing but thats no all right i know you are yes yes frowning and shaking his head just tell me what happened uhhuh uh huh but how can you be sure cliff this isnt some goddam saint were talking about cliff uhhuh yes yes but still wasnt there some way okay but what if okay i will thanks for calling cliff stay in touch hanging up he said he apologizes for hanging up on you says he told you he was busy trying to find your mom and you continued to lip off to him he wants you to know he has your mothers best interests at heart melissa stood there glassyeyed they had him and they let him go ramp put his arm over her shoulder and she didnt resist she looked numb betrayed id seen more life in wax models apparently said ramp he can account for his whereabouts every minute of the day they have no grounds to hold him they had to release him meliss legally the asses she said in a low voice the goddam asses what does it matter where he was all day he doesnt do things himself he hires people to do things raising her voice to a shout he hires people so what if he wasnt there himself wrenching herself away from ramp she grabbed her face and let out a squeal of frustration ramp started to approach her thought better of it and looked at me i went over to her she retreated to a corner of the room and faced the wall stood in the corner like a child being punished sobbing ramp gave a sad look both of us knowing she could have used a father neither of us able to fill the bill finally she stopped crying but she stayed in the corner i said neither of you has confidence in chickering maybe a private investigators called for melissa said your friend ramp looked at her with sudden curiosity she looked at me and said tell him i said yesterday melissa and i discussed investigating mccloskey a friend of mines an lapd detective on leave very competent lots of experience he agreed to do it hed probably agree to look into your wifes disappearance as well if she shows up soon you might still want to consider checking out mccloskey of course your attorneys may have someone else they work with no said melissa i want your friend period ramp looked at her then me i dont know who they use the lawyers we never had to deal with anything like this is this friend of yours really good melissa said he already said he was i want him and im paying that wont be necessary melissa ill pay no i will shes my mother and thats the way its going to be ramp sighed well talk about it later in the meantime dr delaware if youd be kind enough to call your friend the phone rang again both of them jerked their heads around this time ramp got there first yes oh hello doctor no im sorry she hasnt yes i understand melissa said her if shed called sooner we could have started looking sooner ramp covered his ear im sorry doctor i couldnt hear oh thats very kind of you but no i dont see any pressing reason for you to hold on covering the mouthpiece with his other hand he looked at me dr cunninghamgabney wants to know if she should come over any reason she should does she have any clinical information about mrs ramp that would help locate her here he said handing me the phone i took it said dr cunninghamgabney this is alex delaware dr delaware the wellmodulated voice stripped of some of its melody im very alarmed by todays events did melissa and her mother have any sort of confrontation before she disappeared why do you ask that gina called me this morning and intimated there had been some unpleasantness melissa staying out all night with some boy keeping my eyes off melissa i said thats accurate as far as it goes doctor but i doubt its a causal factor do you any unusual stress could cause someone like gina ramp to behave unpredictably melissa was staring straight at me i said why dont you and i get together discuss any clinically relevant factors that might shed light on whats happened pause shes right there isnt she hovering basically all right i dont imagine my coming down there and provoking another confrontation is very wise would you like to come over to my office right now sounds good i said if melissa thinks thats okay that child has too much power as is she said sharply maybe so but clinically i think its advisable very well consult her i covered the receiver and said to melissa what do you think of my getting together with her at the clinic to share facts psychological data in order to see if we can figure out where your mother is sounds like a good idea said ramp sure melissa said sourly whatever waving her fingers the same offhandedness shed used two days ago to drop clinical bombs i said ill stay here as long as you want me to no no you can go right now ill be fine go talk to her i got back on the phone ill be there within the half hour dr cunninghamgabney ursula please at times like this a hyphens a damned nuisance do you know how to get here melissa will tell me im sure she will before i left i called milos home and got ricks voice on a machine both melissa and ramp sagged when i told them he wasnt in making me realize how much stake they were putting in his powers of detection wondering if i was doing him a favor by drawing him into the haut monde i left a message for him to call me at the gabney clinic during the next couple of hours at my home after that as i got ready to leave the doorbell chimed melissa jumped up and ran out of the room ramp followed her walking with long tennisbred strides i brought up the rear to the entry hall melissa opened the doors and let in a blackhaired boy of around twenty he took a step toward melissa looked as if he wanted to hug her saw ramp and stopped himself he was on the small side five seven slim build olive skin full bowed lips brooding brown eyes under heavy brows his hair was black and curly worn short on top and sides longer in back he had on a short red busboys jacket black slacks white shirt and black bow tie a set of car keys jangled in one hand he looked around nervously anything melissa said nothing he moved closer to her ramp said hello noel the boy looked up everythings okay mr ramp jorges handling the cars there arent that many tonight its kind of slow melissa touched the boys sleeve and said lets get out of here ramp said where are you going melissa said out to look for her ramp said do you really think yes i do cmon noel tugging at the red fabric the boy looked at ramp ramp turned to me i played sphinx ramp said okay noel consider yourself off for the rest of the night but be careful before he finished the sentence the two of them were out the door it slammed shut and echoed ramp stared at it for a few moments then turned to me weary would you care for a drink doctor no thanks im expected at the gabney clinic yes of course he walked me to the door have kids of your own doctor no that seemed to disappoint him i said it can be tough he said shes really bright sometimes i think that makes it rougher for all of us her included gina told me you treated her years ago when she was just a little kid seven through nine seven through nine he said two years so youve spent more time with her than i have probably know her a hell of a lot better than i do it was a long time ago i said i saw a different side of her he smoothed his mustache and played with his collar shes never accepted me probably never will right things can change i said can they he opened the door on disney lights and cool breeze i realized i hadnt gotten directions to the clinic from melissa and told him so he said no problem i know the way by heart gone there plenty when gina needed me to on the way to pasadena i found myself peering up driveways checking foliage scanning the streets for a misplaced shadow a flash of chrome the crumpled outline of a woman down irrational because the pros had been there already i spotted three san labrador police cruisers within a tenblock radius one of which tailed me for half a block before resuming its prowl irrational because the streets were naked a stray tricycle could be spotted a block away a neighborhood that kept its secrets off the street where had gina ramp taken hers or had they been taken from her despite my words of encouragement to melissa i hadnt convinced myself the whole thing was an impromptu vacation from phobia from what id seen gina had been vulnerable fragile just arguing with her daughter had set off an attack how could she possibly handle the real world whatever that meant so i kept searching as i drove spitting in the face of reason and feeling a little better for it the gabney clinic occupied a generous corner lot in a good residential neighborhood that had begun yielding reluctantly to apartments and shops the building had once been a house a big twostoried shinglesided brown craftsmanstyle bungalow set back behind a flat wide lawn three giant pines shadowed the grass a front porch spanned the width of the structure darkened by massive eaves shake roof lots of woodrelief stingy windows in oversized casements ungainly and dimly lit some architectural hacks sendup of greene and greene no sign advertising what went on inside a low wall rock chips in cement fronted the property a gateless gap in the center provided access to a cement walkway on the left a woodplank gate had been propped open exposing a long narrow driveway a white saab turbo was parked at the mouth of the drive blocking further motor access i left the seville parked on the street pasadena was more tolerant than san labrador and made my way up the walk a white porcelain sign the size and shape of an hour cigar was nailed to the front door gabney was painted on it in black block letters the knocker was a snarling lion chewing on a brass ring toplit by a yellow bug bulb i lifted it and let it fall the door vibrated csharp i was pretty sure a second porch light went on a moment later the door opened ursula cunninghamgabney stood in the doorway wearing a burgundycolored scallopnecked knit dress that ended two inches above her knees and accentuated her height vertical ribs ran through the fabric accentuating further highheeled pumps were the topper the perm shed worn in the newspaper photo had been replaced by a glossy fudgecolored wedge john lennon eyeglasses hung from a chain around her neck competing for chestspace with a string of pearls the chest itself was convex and concave exactly where it should have been her waist was small her legs sleek and very very long her face was squarish finely molded much prettier than in the picture younger too she didnt appear to be much older than thirty smooth neck tight jawline big hazel eyes clean features that didnt need camouflage but she was wearing plenty pale foundation artfully applied blush mauve eye shadow deepred lipstick aiming for severe and hitting the target dr delaware come in alex i said fair is fair that confused her for a moment then she said yes of course alex and smiled and turned it off she motioned me into what would have seemed like a generous entry hall if i hadnt just done time at dickinson manor parquet floors architecturally paneled oak walls stained shoepolish brown plainwrap craftsman benches and coat trees a clock that said santa fe below the and railroad above the on the walls was a scattering of muddy california pleinair landscapes the kind of stuff the galleries in carmel had been trying to palm off as masterpieces for years the living room was to the left visible through halfopen sliding wooden doors more oak walls more landscapes yosemite death valley the monterey coast blackupholstered straightbacked chairs arranged in a circle heavy drapes hid the windows what would have been the dining room was to the right set up as a waiting area with mismatched couches and magazine tables she stayed a couple of steps in front of me heading for the rear of the first floor quick deliberate steps tight dress fluid glutei no chitchat she stopped opened a door and held it i stepped into what had probably been a maids room small and dim and graywalled with a low ceiling furnished with simple contemporary pieces a lowbacked pine and grayleather stenographers chair behind a pine tabledesk two side chairs three bracketed shelves full of textbooks on the wall behind the desk diplomas filling the wall to the left a single window on a side wall was covered by a gray pleated shade a single piece of art next to the shelves cassatt drypoint etching soft color mother and child yesterday id seen another piece by the same artist another simple gray room therapeutic rapport taken to the nth chickenegg riddles jumped into my head ursula cunninghamgabney went behind the desk sat and crossed her legs the dress rode up she left it that way put on her glasses and stared at me she said no sign of her yet i shook my head she frowned pushed the glasses higher on her thin straight nose youre younger than i expected ditto and you squeezed in two doctorates it really wasnt that remarkable she said i skipped two grades in elementary school started tufts at fifteen went to harvard for grad school at nineteen leo gabney was my major professor and he guided me through helped me avoid some of the nonsense that can trip a person up i did a double major in clinical and psychobiology had taken all the premed courses as an undergrad so leo suggested i go to med school i did my dissertation research during the first two years combined my psych internship with my psychiatric residency and ended up with licensure in both fields sounds pretty hectic it was wonderful she said without a trace of smile those were wonderful years she removed her glasses set her hands flat on the desk so she said what are we to make of mrs ramps disappearance i thought you could cue me in id like to take advantage of the fact that you saw her more recently than i did i thought you saw her every day she shook her head not for some time weve cut our individual sessions to two to four times a week depending upon her needs the last time i saw her was tuesday the day you called she was doing quite well thats why i felt it was acceptable for you to speak with her what happened with melissa that upset her so she was trying to let melissa know she was fine that it was perfectly okay for her to go away to harvard melissa got angry ran out of the room and her mother had an anxiety attack but she handled it inhaled a drug she described as a muscle relaxant and worked on her breathing until shed recovered she nodded tranquizone it shows great promise my husband and i are among the first to use it clinically the major advantage is that its very focused works directly on the sympathetic nervous system and doesnt appear to impact the thalamus or the limbic system in fact so far no ones found any cns impact at all which means the addictive potential is lower none of the problems you get with valium or xanax and respiratory administration means you get improved breathing quickly which generalizes to the entire anxiety syndrome the only drawback is that the effects are very shortlived it worked for her she calmed down pretty quickly felt good about handling the attack thats what we work on she said selfesteem using the drug as a springboard for cognitive restructuring we give them a success experience then train them to see themselves in a power role see the attack as a challenge not a tragedy to zero in on small victories and build from there it was definitely a victory for her after she calmed down she realized the issue with melissa was still unresolved that upset her but the anxiety didnt recur how did she react to being upset she went looking for melissa good good she said actionorientation unfortunately melissa was gone had left the house with a friend of hers i sat with mrs ramp for about half an hour waiting for her to come back thats the last i saw of her what was mrs ramps demeanor while you waited subdued worried about how shed work things out with melissa but no panic actually she seemed quite calm when did melissa finally show up i realized i didnt know and said so well she said the whole thing must have affected gina more than she let on even to me she called me this morning and said thered been a confrontation sounded tense but insisted she was all right the ability to perceive herself as masterful is so essential to the treatment that i didnt argue with her but i knew we had to talk i offered her the choice of an individual session or discussing it in group she said shed try group the next one was today and if that didnt resolve things for her maybe she would stay late and talk oneonone thats why i was especially surprised when she didnt show up id expected it to be an important session for her when the group took its midsession break at four i called her at home spoke to her husband and found out shed left for group at twothirty i didnt want to alarm him but i did suggest he call the police before the sentence was out of my mouth i heard screaming in the background she paused pressed forward so that her breasts rested atop the desk apparently melissa had come into the room hovering asked her stepfather what was going onfound out and gone hysterical another pause the breasts remained there like an offering i said you dont seem to like melissa very much she lifted her shoulders moved back against the chair thats hardly the issue is it guess not tugging now at her hemline pulling harder when it didnt yield all right she said youre her advocate i know child people get into that kind of thing all the time perhaps sometimes its necessary but thats totally irrelevant to the issue at hand weve got a crisis situation here a severely phobic woman one of the most impaired patients ive ever treated and ive treated lots weve got her out on her own dealing with stimuli shes totally unprepared for having broken her treatment regimen taken steps she wasnt ready for due to pressure exerted by her relationship with an extremely neurotic teenage girl and thats where my advocacy comes in i have to think about my patient surely you can see that the relationship between the two of them is pathological blinking hard several times real color deepening the rouge on her cheeks i said maybe but melissa didnt invent the relationship she was made not born so why blame the victim i assure you i also dont see why you feel the need to pin the disappearance on motherdaughter conflict gina ramp never let melissa get in the way of her pathology before she wheeled her chair back several inches never breaking eye contact now whos blaming the victim all right i said this isnt productive no it isnt have you any other information for me i assume youre familiar with the circumstances leading up to her phobia the acid attack barely moving her lips she said you assume correctly the man who did it joel mccloskey is back in town her mouth formed an o no sound came out she uncrossed her legs pressed her knees together oh shit she said when did this happen six months ago but he hasnt called or harassed the family theres no evidence he has anything to do with this the police questioned him and he had an alibi so they released him and if he wanted to cause trouble hes had plenty of time been out of prison for six years never contacted her or anyone else in the family six years six years since his release from prison he spent most of it out of state she never said a thing she didnt know then how do you know melissa found out recently and told me her nostrils widened and she didnt tell her mother she didnt want to alarm her planned to hire a private investigator to check mccloskey out brilliant just brilliant shaking her head in light of whats happened do you concur with that judgment at the time it seemed reasonable not to traumatize mrs ramp if the detective learned mccloskey was a threat it would have been communicated how did melissa find out mccloskey was back i repeated what id been told she said unbelievable well the child has initiative ill grant her that but her meddling is it was a judgment call and its still far from clear that it was wrong can you say for sure you would have told mrs ramp it would have been nice to have had the choice she looked more hurt than angry part of me wanted to apologize the other wanted to lecture her about proper communication with the patients family she said all this time ive been working on showing her the worlds a safe place and hes been out there i said look there really is no reason to believe anything ominous has happened she could have had car trouble or just decided to stretch her wings a bit the fact that she chose to drive over here by herself may indicate she was yearning to stretch this mans being back doesnt bother you at all the possibility that he might have been stalking her for six months you were at that house frequently when you walked around the block with her did you ever notice him or anyone else no but i wouldnt have i was focusing on her even so i said san labradors the last place you could stalk anybody and get away with it no people no cars making intruders conspicuous is exactly why they do it and the police function as private guards keeping an eye out for strangers is their specialty granted she said but what if he didnt sit around and make himself obvious what if he just drove around not every day just once in a while different times of day hoping to grab a glimpse of her and today he succeeded spotted her leaving the house alone and went after her or maybe it wasnt him at all he hired someone to hurt her once could have done it again so the fact that he has an alibi is meaningless as far as im concerned what about the man who actually attacked her the one mccloskey paid maybe hes back in town too melvin findlay i said not the man id choose for the job what do you mean a black man driving around san labrador without a good reason wouldnt last two minutes and findlay served hard time in prison for being hired help its hard to believe hed be stupid enough to go after her again maybe she said i hope youre right but ive studied the criminal mind and i long ago gave up assuming anything about human intelligence speaking of the criminal mind did mrs ramp ever say what mccloskey had against her she took off her glasses drummed her fingers picked a piece of lint from the desk and flicked it away no she didnt because she didnt know had no idea why he hated her so much thered once been a romance but theyd parted as friends she was truly baffled it made it even more difficult for her not knowing not understanding i spent a long time working on that she drummed some more this is totally uncharacteristic of her she was always a good patient never deviated from plan even if it is nothing more than car trouble i have an image of her stranded somewhere panicking and going out of control does she carry medication with her she should her instructions are to have her tranquizone with her at all times from what i saw she knows how to use it she stared at me gave a closelipped smile that tightened her jawline youre quite the optimist dr delaware i smiled back gets me through the night her face softened for a moment i thought she might actually show me some teeth then she grimaced and said excuse me im feeling a real lack of closure have to deal with it she reached for the phone punched when the operator came on the line she identified herself as gina ramps doctor and asked to be put through to the chief of police as she waited i said his name is chickering she nodded held up an index finger and said chief chickering this is dr ursula cunninghamgabney gina ramps physician no i havent nothing yes of course yes she did three oclock this afternoon no she didnt and i havent no theres nothing no not in the least look of exasperation chief chickering i assure you she was in full possession of her faculties absolutely no not at all i dont feel that would be prudent or necessary no i assure you she was totally rational yes yes i understand excuse me sir there is one thing i thought you might want to consider the man who attacked her no not him the one who actually threw the acid findlay melvin findlay has he been located oh oh i see yes of course thank you chief she hung up and shook her head findlays dead died in prison several years ago chickering was offended that i even asked seems to think im casting aspersions on his professional abilities it sounded as if hes questioning ginas mental stability she gave a look of distaste he wanted to know if she was all there hows that for a choice of words rolling her eyes i actually think he wanted me to tell him she was crazy as if that would make it acceptable for her to be missing make it acceptable if he didnt find her i said who can be responsible for the actions of a crazy person she blinked several more times gazed down at the desk top and let all the severity drop from her face i was willing to bet her beauty had bloomed late for a moment i saw her as a myopic little girl growing up smarter than her peers unable to relate sitting up in her room reading and wondering if shed ever fit in anywhere were responsible she said weve taken on the responsibility to care for them and here we sit ineffectual frustration on her face my eyes drifted to the cassatt print she noticed and appeared to grow even more tense wonderful isnt it yes it is cassatt was a genius the expressiveness particularly the way she brought out the essence of children ive heard she didnt like children oh really have you had the print for a long time a while she touched her hair another lockedjaw smile you didnt come here to discuss art is there anything else i can do for you can you think of any other psychological factors that might explain ginas disappearance such as dissociative episodes amnesia fugue could she have had some sort of break be out there wandering unaware of who she is she thought for a while theres nothing like that in her history her ego was intact remarkably so considering everything shes been through in fact i always thought of her as one of my most rational agoraphobics in terms of the origin of her symptoms with some of them you never know how it starts theres no trauma you can put your finger on but in her case the symptoms manifested following a tremendous amount of physical and emotional stress multiple surgeries prolonged stretches of time when she was ordered to remain in bed so that her face could heal medically prescribed agoraphobia if you will combine that with the fact that the assault took place when she stepped out of her home and it would be almost irrational for her not to behave the way she did maybe even in a biological sense data are coming out showing actual structural change in the midbrain following trauma makes sense i said i suppose even after she turns up we may never know what happened what do you mean the life she leads the insularity in her own way shes quite selfsufficient that can lead a person to treasure secrecy even luxuriate in it back when i treated melissa i remember thinking that for this family secrets were the coin of the realm that an outsider would never really know what was going on gina may have stockpiled plenty of coins thats the goal of therapy she said to break into that stockpile her progress has been remarkable im sure it has all im saying is that she still may decide to hold on to a private reserve her face tightened as she prepared to defend against that but she waited until shed calmed before speaking i suppose youre right we all hold on to something dont we the private gardens we choose to water and feed turning away from me gardens brimming with iron flowers iron roots and stems and petals a paranoid schizophrenic once told me that and i do believe its an apt image not even the deepest probing can uproot iron flowers when they dont want to be dug up can it she faced me again looking hurt once more no it cant i said still if she does choose to dig them up youll probably be the one she hands the bouquet weak smile teeth white and straight and gleaming are you patronizing me dr delaware no and if it sounds that way im sorry dr cunningham hyphen gabney that pumped some strength into the smile i said what about the members of her group would they know anything useful no she never saw any of them socially how many are there just two small group its a rare disorder finding motivated patients and those with the financial means to embark on the extensive treatment we offer cuts the number even further how are the other two patients doing well enough to leave home and come to group well enough to be interviewed by whom the police the private detective hell be looking for her in addition to investigating mccloskey absolutely not these are fragile individuals theyre not even aware shes missing yet they know she didnt show up today noshows arent unusual given the diagnosis most of them have missed sessions at one time or another has mrs ramp missed any before today no but thats not the point no ones absence would be especially noteworthy will they be curious if she doesnt show up by next monday if they are ill deal with it now if you dont mind id prefer not to discuss the other patients they havent lost their right to confidentiality okay she started to cross her legs again thought better of it and kept her feet flat on the floor well she said this hasnt been very profitable has it she stood smoothed her dress looked past me toward the door i said would there be any reason for her to walk out voluntarily she snapped her head around what do you mean the great escape i said trading in her lifestyle for something new jumping the therapeutic gun and going for total independence total independence she said that makes no sense at all not a lick the door swung open before she was able to get me to it a man charged in and racewalked across the entry hall leo gabney but even though id seen his photo just a few days ago i had to look twice before his identity registered he noticed us midstride stopped so suddenly i expected to see skid marks on the parquet it was his getup that had thrown me off redandwhite flannel western shirt pipestem blue jeans pointytoed bullhide boots with riding heels his belt was tooled cowhide the buckle a big brass letter psi the greek alphabets contribution to psychologys professional identity a retractable key ring was attached to the belt urban cowboy but he lacked the brawn to make it work despite his age his build was almost boyish five nine sunken thorax shoulders narrower than his wifes the bushy hair stark white over a face sunbaked the color of sourmash whiskey active blue eyes bristly white brows liverspotted cranial dome high enough to host half a dozen worry lines prominent highbridged nose with pinched nostrils less chin than he deserved his neck was wattled a bramble of white chest hair ended at his gullet the entire assemblage elfin but not whimsical he gave his wife a peck on the cheek gave me a laboratory look she said this is dr delaware ah dr delaware im dr gabney strong voice basso profundo too deep a tone for such a narrow box a new england accent that turned my name into dullaweah he extended his hand thin and soft he hadnt been roping steers even the bones felt soft as if theyd been soaked in vinegar the skin around them was loose and dry and cool like that of a lizard in the shade has she shown up yet he said she said im afraid not leo he clucked his tongue hellish thing i came down just as soon as i could she said dr delaware informed me that mccloskey the man who assaulted her is back in town the white eyebrows tented and the worry lines became inverted vs oh the police located him but he had an alibi so they let him go we were discussing the fact that his previous modus was to hire someone theres no reason to think he wouldnt do it again the man he hired the first time is dead but that doesnt rule out another scoundrel does it no of course not dreadful letting him go was absurd absolutely premature why dont you call the police and remind them of that fact dear i doubt theyd pay much attention dr delaware also feels its unlikely anyone could have watched her without being noticed by the san labrador police he said whys that the bare streets the fact that the local polices area of competence is looking out for strangers competence is a relative term ursula call them tactfully remind them that mccloskeys behavioral style is contractor not contractee and that he may have contracted again sociopaths often repeat themselves behaviorally rigid cut out by a cookie cutter the lot of them leo i dont please darling he took both of her hands in his massaged her smooth flesh with his thumbs were dealing with inferior minds and mrs ramps welfare is at stake she opened her mouth closed it said certainly leo thank you darling and one more thing if youd be so kind pull the saab in a bit im sticking out into the street she turned her back on us and walked quickly to her office gabney watched her following her sway almost lasciviously when she closed the door he turned to me for the first time since wed shaken hands dr delaware of pavor nocturnus fame come into my office wont you i followed him to the rear of the house into a wide paneled room that would have been the library drapes of cranberrycolored velvet under goldedged valances covered most of one wall the rest was bookcases carved with nearrococo abandon and murky paintings of horses and dogs the ceiling was as low as the one in his wifes study but adorned with moldings and centered with a plaster floral medallion from which hung a brass chandelier set with electric candles a sevenfoot carved desk sat in front of one of the bookcases a silver and crystal penandinkwell set bonebladed letter opener antique foldup blotter and greenshaded bankers lamp shared the red leather top with an inout box and piles of medical and psychological journals some still in their brown paper wrappers the case directly behind him was filled with books with his name on the spine and letterfiles tagged peer review articles and dated from through the last year he settled himself in a highbacked leather desk chair and invited me to sit second time in just a few minutes on the other side of the desk i was starting to feel like a patient using the boneknife to slit the wrapper on a copy of the journal of applied behavioral analysis he opened to the table of contents scanned and put the magazine down picking up another journal he flipped pages frowning my wifes an amazing woman he said reaching for a third journal one of the finest minds of her generation md and phd by the age of twentyfive youll never find a more skillful clinician or one more dedicated wondering if he was trying to make up for the way hed just treated her i said impressive extraordinary he put the third journal aside smiled after that what else could i do but marry her before id figured out how to react to that he said we like to joke that shes a paradox chuckling stopping abruptly he unsnapped one shirt pocket and pulled out a packet of chewing gum spearmint he said no thanks he unwrapped a stick and got to work on it weak chin rising and falling with oilpump regularity poor mrs ramp at this stage of her treatment shes not equipped to be out there my wife called me the moment she realized something was wrong we keep a ranch up in santa ynez unfortunately i had little to offer by way of wisdom who could expect such a thing what on earth could have happened good question he shook his head very distressing i did want to be down here in case something developed abandoned my duties and zipped down his clothes looked pressed and clean i wondered what his duties were remembering his soft hands i said do you ride a bit he said chewing though i dont have a passion for it id never have bought the beasts in the first place but they came with the property it was the space i wanted the place i settled on included twenty acres ive been thinking about planting chardonnay grapes his mouth was still for a moment i could see the gum wadded up inside one cheek like a plug of tobacco do you think a behaviorist is capable of producing a firstrate wine they say great wine is the result of intangibles he smiled no such thing he said only incomplete data maybe so good luck he sat back and rested his hands on his belly the shirt billowed around them the air he said between chews is what really draws me up there unfortunately my wife cant enjoy it allergies horses grasses treepollens all sorts of things that never bothered her back in boston so she concentrates on clinical work and leaves me free to experiment it wasnt the conversation id have imagined having with the great leo gabney back in the days when i used to imagine things like that i wasnt sure why hed invited me in perhaps sensing that he said alex delaware ive followed all your work not just the sleep studies multimodal treatment of self damaging obsessions in children the psychosocial aspects of chronic disease and prolonged hospitalization in children diseaserelated communication and family coping style et cetera a solid output clean writing thank you you havent published in several years im working on something currently for the most part ive been doing other things private practice forensic work what kind of forensic work trauma and injuryrelated cases some child custody ugly stuff custody he said whats your opinion about joint custody it can work in some situations he smiled nice hedge i suppose thats adaptive when dealing with the legal system actually parents should be strongly reinforced for making it work if they fail repeatedly the parent with the best childrearing skills should be selected as primary custodian regardless of gender dont you agree i think the best interests of the child are what counts everyone thinks that doctor the challenge is how to operationalize good intentions if i had my way no decisions about custody would be made until trained observers actually lived with the family for several weeks keeping careful records using structured valid and reliable behavioral scales and reporting their results to a panel of psychological specialists what do you think of that notion sounds good theoretically in practical terms no no he said chewing furiously i speak from practical experience my first wife set out to murder me legally this was years ago when the courts wouldnt even hear what a father had to say she was a drinker and a smoker and irresponsible to the core but to the idiot judge that heard the case the crucial factor was that she had ovaries he gave her everything my house my son sixty percent of the paltry estate id accumulated as an untenured lecturer a year later she was smoking in bed deaddrunk the house burned down and i lost my son forever saying it matteroffactly the bass voice flat as a foghorn resting his elbows on the desk he placed the fingertips of both hands together creating a diamondshaped space that he peered through i said im sorry it was a terrible time for me chewing slowly for a while it seemed as if nothing would ever have reinforcement value again but i ended up with ursula so i suppose theres a silver lining heat in the blue eyes unmistakable passion i thought of the way shed obeyed him the way hed looked at her rear wondered if what turned him on was her ability to be both wife and child he lowered his hands soon after the tragedy i married again before ursula another error in judgment but at least there were no children when i met ursula she was an undergraduate applying for graduate school and i was a full professor at the university and the medical school as well as the first nonmd associate dean the medical school had ever appointed i saw her potential set out to help her realize it most satisfying accomplishment of my life are you married no a wonderful convention if the proper confluence can be achieved my first two were failures because i allowed myself to be swayed by intangibles ignored my training dont segregate your scholarship from your life my young friend your knowledge of human behavior gives you great advantage over common bumbling homo incompetens he smiled again enough lecturing whats your take on this whole thing poor mrs ramp i dont have a take dr gabney i came here to learn this mccloskey thing very distressing to think such a man is roaming free how did you find out i told him ah the daughter managing her own anxiety by attempting to control her mothers behavior would that shed shared her information what else do you know about this mccloskey just the basic facts of the assault no one seems to know why he did it yes he said an atypically closemouthed psychopath usually those types love to brag about their misdeeds i suppose it would have been nice to know from the beginning in terms of defining variables but in the end i dont feel the treatment plan suffered the key is to cut through all the talk and get them to change their behavior mrs ramp has been doing very well i hope it hasnt all been for naught i said maybe her disappearance is related to her progress enjoying her freedom and deciding to grab a bigger chunk an interesting theory but we discourage breaks in schedule patients have been known to do their own thing to their detriment you dont think sometimes they know whats best for them not generally if i did i couldnt charge them three hundred dollars an hour in good faith could i three hundred at that rate the kind of intensive treatment they did three patients could carry the whole clinic i said is that for both you and your wife he grinned and i knew id asked the right question myself alone my wife receives two hundred are you appalled by those figures dr delaware theyre higher than what im used to but its a free country that it is i spent most of my professional life in academia and in public hospitals ministering to the poor setting up treatment programs for people who never paid a penny at this stage in my life i thought it only fair that the rich be offered the benefit of my accumulated knowledge lifting the silver pen he twirled it and put it down so he said you feel mrs ramp may have run away i think its a possibility when i spoke to her yesterday she hinted that she was planning to make some changes in her life really the blue eyes stopped moving what kind of changes she implied that she didnt like the house she was living in too big all the opulence that she wanted something simpler something simpler he said anything else no thats about it well disappearing like this can hardly be thought of as a simplification do you have any clinical impressions that would explain whats happened mrs ramp is a nice lady he said very sweet instinctively one wants to help her and clinically her case is fairly simple a textbook case of classically conditioned anxiety strengthened and maintained by operant factors the anxietyreducing effects of repeated avoidance and escape strengthened by the positively reinforcing qualities of reduced social responsibility and increased altruism of others conditioned dependency exactly in many ways shes like a child all agoraphobics are dependent ritualistic routinized to the extent that they cling to primitive habits as the phobia endures it gains strength and their behavioral repertoire drops off sharply eventually they become frozen by inertia a sort of psychological cryogenics agoraphobics are psychological reactionaries dr delaware they dont move unless prodded sharply every step is taken with great trepidation thats why i cant see her gaily running off in search of some illdefined xanadu despite her progress her progress is gratifying but she has a ways to go my wife and i have each mapped out extensive plans that sounded more like competition than collaboration i didnt comment unwrapping another stick of gum he slid it between his lips the treatment is well thought out we offer full value in return for our appalling fees in all probability mrs ramp will return to the roost and avail herself of it so youre not worried about her he chewed hard made squirting noises im concerned dr delaware but worrying is counterproductive anxietyproducing i train my phobics to stay away from it and i train myself to practice what i preach he walked me to the door talking about science as i made my way across the lawn i noticed the saab had been moved forward into the driveway behind it was a gray range rover the windshield was dusty except for wiper arcs i visualized gabney behind the wheel forging through the mesquite and drove away thinking what an odd couple the two of them were at first glance she was an ice queen combative accustomed to fighting for her rights i could see why she and melissa had raised each others hackles but the frost was so thin it melted on scrutiny underneath vulnerability like ginas had that formed the basis for an exceptional empathy whod introduced whom to small gray rooms and the art of mary cassatt whatever the reason she seemed to care ginas disappearance had shaken her up in contrast her husband seemed intent upon distancing himself from the whole affair shrugging off ginas pathology as routine reducing pain to jargon yet despite his nonchalance hed zipped down to la all the way from santa ynez a twohour drive so perhaps he was as worried as his wife and simply better at concealing it the old malefemale split men posture women bleed i thought of what hed told me about losing his son how hed told me the ease with which hed spun his tale suggested hed mouthed it a thousand times before working it through desensitization or maybe he really had mastered the art of putting the past behind him maybe one day id call him up and ask for lessons it was ninefifty by the time i got back to sussex knoll a single police cruiser was still patrolling the streets i must have passed inspection because no one stopped me from pulling up to the gates over the talk box don ramps voice was dry and tired no nothing he said come on up the gates yawned i sped through more outdoor bulbs had been switched on creating a false daylight bright and cold no other cars in front of the house the chaucer doors were open ramp stood between them in his shirtsleeves not a damned thing he said after id climbed the steps whatd the doctors say nothing significant i told him about ursulas call regarding melvin findlay his face fell i said have you heard anything more from chickering he called about half an hour ago nothing to report shes probably fine not to worry its not his wife out there i asked him about contacting the fbi he claims they wont get involved unless theres evidence of abduction preferably something involving interstate transport of the victim he threw up his hands let them fall limply the victim i dont even want to think of her as that but he closed the doors the entry hall was lit but beyond it the house was in darkness he headed for a light switch on the other side of the entry making scuffing sounds as he crossed the marble i said did your wife ever say why mccloskey did it he stopped halfturned why do you ask in terms of understanding her how she dealt with the assault dealt with it in what way victims of crime often go on factfinding missions wanting to know about the criminal his motives what turned them into victims in order to try to make some sense out of it and protect themselves from future victimizations did your wife ever do that because no one seems to know what mccloskeys motive was no she didnt he resumed walking at least not as far as i know and she had no idea why he did it frankly we dont talk much about it im part of her present not her past but she did tell me that the bastard refused to say the police couldnt get it out of him he was a drinker and a drugfiend but that doesnt explain it does it what kind of drugs did he use he reached the switch flicked illuminated the huge front room in which gina ramp and i had waited yesterday yesterday seemed like ancient history a swannecked decanter filled with something amber and very clear sat alongside several oldfashioned glasses on a portable rosewood bar he held out a glass to me i shook my head he poured a finger for himself hesitated doubled it then stoppered the decanter and sipped i dont know he said drugs were never my thing this raising the glassand beer is about as daring as i get i never knew him very well just a bit from the studios he was a hangeron hung around gina like a little leech a nothing hollywoods full of them no talent of his own so he got girls to pose for pictures he walked farther into the room stepped on carpeting that dampened his footsteps and restored the house to silence i followed him is melissa back yet he nodded up in her room she went straight up looked pretty beat noel still with her no noels back at the tankard my restaurant he works for me parking cars busing some waiting good kid real upfromthebootstraps story hes got a good future melissas too much for him but i guess hell have to learn that for himself too much in what way too smart too goodlooking too feisty hes madly in love with her and she walks all over him not out of cruelty or snobbery its just her style she just forges straight ahead not thinking as if trying to compensate for the criticism he said thats one thing she isnt a snob despite all this waving his free hand around the room christ can you imagine growing up here i grew up in lynwood when it was still mostly white my dad was an independent truck driver with a bad temper meaning there were plenty of times nobody hired him we always had enough to eat but that was about it i didnt like having to scrounge but i know now that it made me into a better person not that melissas not a good person basically shes a real good kid only shes used to having her way just plows ahead when she wants something regardless of what anyone else wants ginas situation made her grow up fast actually its kind of amazing she developed as well as she did he sat down heavily on an overstuffed couch guess i dont need to tell you about kids im just going on because frankly im pretty rattled by all this where the hell could she be what about this detective you reach him yet not yet let me try again he sprang up and brought back a cellular phone i dialed milos home got the recorded message then heard it break hello rick this is alex is milo there hi alex sure we just got in saw a bad movie hold on two seconds then yeah ready to start early on what privateeyeing it cant wait till morning somethings come up i looked over at ramp staring at me haggard choosing my words carefully i recounted what had happened including mccloskeys questioning and release and the news of melvin findlays death in prison expecting milo to comment on either or both instead he said she take any clothes with her melissa says no how can melissa be sure she says she knows the contents of her mothers closet could tell if anything was missing ramp looked at me sharply milo said even a skimpy little negligee i dont think it was anything like that milo why not i shot a glance over at ramp still staring his drink untouched it doesnt fit ah hubby at close proximity correct okay lets switch to another lane what have the local cops done other than drive around thats it as far as i know no ones too impressed with their level of competence theyre not known as stone geniuses out there but what else should they be doing going door to door and antagonizing the trillionaires lady staying out late isnt judge crater its only been a few hours and with the kind of car shes driving someone might actually see it they put out bulletins for what theyre worth the police chief said they did you hobnobbing with police chiefs now he was here the personal touch he said ah the rich what about the fbi nah those guys wont touch it unless theres definite evidence of a crime preferably one that will make the headlines unless your affluent friends have heavyduty political connections how heavyduty someone in a position to call washington and lean on the director even then shes gonna have to be missing for a couple of days for the feds for anyone to take it seriously without some kind of evidence of a bona fide crime what theyll do is eventually send over a couple of agents who look like actors to take a report march around the house in their junior gman shades frenchkissing their walkietalkies whats it been six hours i looked at my watch closer to seven it doesnt scream major felony alex what else have you got to tell me nothing much i just got back from talking to her therapists they had no major insights well he said you know those types better at asking questions than answering them you have any you want to ask i could go through some motions ramp was sipping and eyeing me over the rim of his glass i said that might be useful i guess i could make it over there in a halfhour or so but basically its going to be a placebo routine because the kind of stuff you want to do in a real missingpersons case financial searches creditcard checks have to take place during working hours anybody think of checking hospitals i assume the police have if youd like to no big sweat making a few calls in fact i can do plenty from right here rather than spend thirty minutes getting over there i think it would be a good idea to do it facetoface you do huh yup lots of shaky knees power of placebo yup hold on hand over receiver yeah okay dr silvermans not happy but hes being saintly about it maybe i can even get him to pick out my tie ramp and i waited without talking much he drinking and sinking progressively lower into one of the overstuffed chairs me thinking about how melissa would be affected if her mother didnt return soon i considered going up to her room to see how she was doing remembered what ramp had said about her being beat and decided to let her rest depending on how things turned out she might not be sleeping well for a while half an hour passed then another twenty minutes when the chimes sounded i got to the door ahead of ramp and opened it milo padded in dressed as well as id ever seen him navy hopsack blazer gray slacks white shirt maroon tie brown loafers cleanshaven and hed gotten a haircut the usual lousy one cropped too close at the back and sides the sideburns trimmed to midear three months off duty and he still looked like the arm of somebodys law i did the introductions watched ramps face change as he got a good look at milo eyes narrowing mustache twitching as if plagued by fleas flinty suspicion marlboro man staring down rustler varmints gabneys cowboy suit would have looked better on him milo must have seen it too but he didnt react ramp stared a while longer then said i hope you can help more suspicion it had been a while since milos picture had been on tv but maybe ramp had a good memory actors even stupid ones often did or perhaps his memory had been prompted by good oldfashioned homophobia i said detective sturgis is on leave from the los angeles police pretty sure id mentioned that before ramp stared milo finally began to return the favor the two of them remained locked in a starefest i thought of rodeo bulls in adjacent pens snorting and pawing and butting the boards milo broke first this is what ive been given so far he repeated almost word for word what id told him accurate yes said ramp milo grunted pulling a note pad and pen out of a jacket pocket he turned pages stopped pointed with a thick finger ive confirmed that the san labrador police put out countywide bulletins on her which is usually a waste of time but with this car maybe not theyve got the car listed as a rollsroyce sedan license plate ad rr sd vehicle identification number sog twentytwo correct correct color black over shellgray better than a toyota said milo in terms of conspicuousness before i came out i called a few of the local emergency rooms no one fitting her descriptions been brought in thank god said ramp sweating milo looked up at the ceiling lowered his eyes and took in the front rooms with one sweeping glance nice house how many rooms the question caught ramp off guard im not really sure never counted about thirty thirtyfive i guess how many does your wife actually use use basically she just uses her suite its three rooms four including the bathroom sitting area bedroom plus a side room with bookshelves a desk some exercise equipment a refrigerator sounds like a home within a home said milo do you have one too just one room said ramp coloring right next to hers milo wrote something down any reason you can think of why she decided to drive to the doctor alone i dont know that wasnt the plan i was supposed to go with her we were going to leave at three she called me at twofifteen i was at my restaurant and told me not to bother coming home shed be driving herself i questioned it but she said shed be fine i didnt want to weaken her confidence so i didnt press the matter thirtyfive rooms said milo writing again besides her suite did she frequent any of the others keep stuff around not to my knowledge why how large is the property just under seven acres she walk around it much shes comfortable walking around it if thats what you mean she used to stroll quite a bit i strolled with her back when it was the only place she went lately the last few months shes been leaving the property taking short walks with dr cunninghamgabney besides the front gate is there another way to get in or out not as far as i know no rear alleys no the property abuts another estate dr and mrs elridges there are high hedges in between ten feet or higher how many outbuildings ramp thought lets see if you count the garages garages how many ten one long building with ten stalls actually it was built for her first husbands antique car collection some of the vehicles are priceless the doors are kept bolted at all times only the dawns stall was left open milo jotted quickly looked up go on ramp looked puzzled milo said other buildings on the property buildings said ramp a potting shed pool cabanas a changing room off the tennis court thats it unless you count the gazebo what about servants quarters the staff lives here in the house one of the corridors upstairs leads to their quarters how many on the staff theres madeleine of course two maids and the gardener the gardener doesnt live on the premises hes got five sons none of whom work for us full time but all of whom are here from time to time helping out any of the staff actually see your wife leave ramp said one of the maids was polishing the entry saw her walk out the door im not sure if anyone actually saw her drive off if you want to question them i can go get them right now where are they up in their rooms when do they go off shift at nine they dont always retire right away sometimes they stay in the kitchen talking having coffee i sent them up early tonight didnt want any hysteria they pretty upset ramp nodded theyve known her a long time tend to be protective what about other homes only one at the beach broad beach malibu shes never gone there to my knowledge doesnt like the water she doesnt even swim in the pool here but i called over there anyway twice nothing did she say anything recently over the past few days or even weeks about taking off going away by herself absolutely not and i no hints dropped remarks that didnt seem to mean anything then but do now i said no ramps color deepened he squinted so hard my head began to ache milo tapped his pen and waited ramp said that wouldnt make sense she wanted more involvement with other people not less that was the whole point of her treatment getting back into the social whirl and frankly i dont see the point of this line of questioning who the hell cares what she talked about she didnt go on vacation for christs sake something happened to her out there why dont you drive downtown and shake up that psychopath mccloskey teach the idiots who let him go something about police work breathing hard temple veins swollen milo said before i came here i spoke to the detective at central division who interviewed mccloskey fellow named bradley lewis not the best cop but not the worst either mccloskeys alibi is ironclad he was feeding the homeless at the mission where he lives peeling potatoes and washing dishes and ladling out soup all afternoon dozens of people saw him including the priest who runs the place he never left from noon till eight so theres no way the police could have kept him in custody what about as a material witness no crime no witness mr ramp as far as theyre concerned its just a situation of some lady who stayed out late but look who were talking about what he did true but he served his time his paroles over far as the laws concerned hes joe citizen the police have zero hold over him cant you do anything my holds less than zero i wasnt referring to legal niceties mr sturgis milo smiled took a deep breath sorry donated my rubber hose to goodwill im serious mr sturgis the smile died so am i mr ramp if thats the kind of help youre after youve dialed a very wrong number he put his pen away ramp said look i didnt mean to milo held out a hand i know this is hell i know the system stinks but rousting mccloskey right now is not in your wifes best interest central division said after they let him go they drove him home guy doesnt have a car and he went to bed lets say i go over there wake him up he refuses to let me in so i force my way in play dirty harry in the movies that works great the power of intimidation he confesses all and the good guys win in the real world he hires a lawyer sues my ass and yours and the media find out meanwhile your wife comes waltzing in she had car trouble couldnt get to a phone a real happy ending except now shes back on page one the main feature on a current affair not to mention having to watch you cough up some dough to mccloskey or play defendant for a couple of years whats that gonna do for her psychological progress ramp said christ this is insanity and shook his head i asked central division to keep a watch on him they said theyd try but to be truthful thats not worth a lot if shes not back by morning ill pay him a visit if you cant handle waiting ill drive down there right now when he doesnt let me in ill sit out there all night watching his door write you a detailed surveillance report that sounds pretty impressive im charging you seventy dollars an hour plus expenses a bullshit hour gets billed the same as a productive one but i just figured for that kind of money youre entitled to some independent judgment on my part and what is your independent judgment mr sturgis at this point there are better ways of spending my time such as such as making more hospital calls phoning allnight service stations the auto club if youre members we are those sound like things i can do you can feel free the more people working on it the faster well get it done if you want to do it yourself ill write you up a list of the other things you can do and be on my way what kinds of things hooking up with the paramedics and the independent ambulance companies keeping in touch with the traffic divisions of the various police departments in order to make sure information doesnt get lost in the shuffle it happens a lot believe me if you want to go further check out airlines air charter services car rental agencies run creditcard traces find out what cards she carries have the companies flag the numbers so when theyre used to make a purchase we know where and when and get the information as soon as possible if shes not back by morning id also get to work on her bank records see if she made any major withdrawals recently do you cosign on her accounts no our finances are independent no shared accounts no mr sturgis ramp had folded his arms across his chest each word seemed to crank him tighter withdrawals airlines what are you saying that she deliberately ran away im sure she didnt but she definitely didnt milo ran his hand over his face mr ramp lets hope she walks in any minute if she doesnt its got to be approached as a missingpersons case and missingpersons cases arent great for the ego the egos of those left waiting because to do the job properly youve got to assume anythings possible its like a doctor biopsying a lump chances are its benign the doctor quotes you statistics smiles and tells you hes almost positive its nothing to worry about but he cuts it open anyway and sends it to the lab he unbuttoned his jacket jammed both hands in his trouser pockets put the weight of one leg on its heel and arced it back and forth like a runner doing an ankle stretch ramp looked down at the foot then up at milos green eyes so he said im going to get cut its your choice said milo the alternative is just to sit tight and wait no no go ahead do all those things you can do them faster i suppose youll want a check before you begin milo said ill want one before i leave seven hundred dollars which is a tenhour advance but first round up the servants call the gardener and get him back here along with any sons who were working today and might have seen her meantime id like to check out her suite go through her stuff ramp started to question that didnt like the answers he created for himself and swallowed them milo said ill be as tidy as possible you want to watch thats okay ramp said no thats fine go ahead this way pointing to the staircase the two of them began climbing side by side sharing the same wide marble step but keeping maximum distance i followed two steps behind feeling like the guy who introduced ali to foreman when we got to the top i heard a door open saw a sliver of light slant across the floor of one of the corridor spokes two doors down from gina ramps room it widened to a triangle then was darkened by shadow as melissa walked out into the hall still in shirt and jeans socks on her feet walking groggily rubbing her eyes i called her name softly she started turned ran toward us is she ramp shook his head nothing yet this is detective sturgis dr delawares friend detective ms melissa dickinson mrs ramps daughter milo held out a hand she barely grazed it withdrew looked up at him there were crease marks on her face the false scars of slumber her lips were dry and her eyelids were swollen what are you going to do to find her what can i do were you here at home when your mother left said milo yes what kind of mood was she in okay excited about going out by herself actually nervous and she was covering it by trying to look excited i was worried shed have an attack i tried to talk her out of it told her id go with her but she refused she even raised her voice to me shed never raised her voice to me biting back tears i should have insisted milo said did she say why she wanted to go by herself no i kept asking her that but she refused it wasnt like her at all i should have known something was wrong did you actually see her drive away no she told me not to follow her ordered it biting her lip so i went to my room lay down and listened to music and fell asleep just like i did now i cant believe it why am i sleeping so much ramp said stress meliss she said to milo what do you think happened to her thats what im here to find out your stepdad will be calling the staff together see if anyone knows anything in the meantime ill be checking out her room and making phone calls you can help with some of those if you want calls to where routine stuff said milo gas stations the auto club the highway patrol some of the local hospitals just to be careful hospitals she said putting a hand on her chest oh god just to be careful milo repeated the san labrador cops have already called a few so have i and she hasnt been reported injured but it pays to be careful she said hospitals again and began crying milo put a hand on her shoulder ramp pulled out a handkerchief said here she glanced at it shook her head used her hand to wipe her eyes ramp looked at the cloth put it back in his pocket and took a couple of steps back melissa said to milo why do you want to see her room to get a feel for the type of person she was see if anythings out of order maybe she left some clue you can help me with that too shouldnt we be doing something be out there looking for her ramp said waste of time she turned on him thats your opinion no its mr sturgiss opinion then let him tell me himself ramp squinted motionless except for tiny flexes along the jawline ill go get the staff he said and walked away quickly down the lefthand corridor when he was out of earshot melissa said you should be keeping an eye on him milo said whys that shes got a lot more money than he does milo looked at her ran a hand over his face you think he might have done something to her if he thought it might get him something who knows he sure likes the things money can buy tennis living here the beach house but everything belongs to mother i dont know why they got married they dont sleep together or do anything together its like hes just visiting some damned houseguest who refuses to leave i dont see why she married him they fight much never she said but big deal theyre not together enough to fight what could she see in him ever ask her i said in a roundabout way i didnt want to hurt her feelings i asked her what to look for in a man she said kindness and tolerance were the most important things that describe him said milo i think hes just smooth out for luxury does he get her money if something happens to her it was more than she was willing to confront her hand flew to her mouth i i dont know easy enough to find out he said if she doesnt show up tomorrow morning ill start looking into her finances maybe ill find something up in her room right now okay she said you dont really think something happened to her do you no reason to and in terms of what you mentioned before going out there looking for her your local cops are already patrolling extensively i saw them on the way over and its what they do best there are also countywide bulletins out for her i checked myself didnt take that on faith dr delaware will tell you im the original skeptic that doesnt mean all those police departments are gonna go out of their way to look for your mother but a rollsroyce may just catch their eye if shes not back soon we can have the bulletins expanded can even tell the papers shes missing but once those guys sink their teeth in they never let go so weve gotta be careful what about mccloskey she said do you know about him milo nodded then why dont you go out there and pressure him noel and i would have done it if we knew where he lived maybe ill find out and do it thats not a very good idea said milo and repeated the speech hed given ramp im sorry she said but shes my mother and ive got to do what i think is right how do you think your mother would like seeing you in a drawer in the morgue her mouth dropped open she closed it drew herself up next to milo she looked tiny almost comically so youre just trying to scare me youre right well it wont work damn shame he looked at his timex been here a quarter hour and ive done diddly wanna stand around talking or work work she said of course her room said milo over here cmon she ran down the hall all traces of sleepiness gone milo watched her and muttered something i couldnt make out we followed her shed reached the door was holding it open here she said ill show you where everything is milo walked into the sitting room i went in after him she slid past me and faced milo blocking the door to the bedroom one more thing what im paying you not don so treat me like an adult milo said if you dont like the way im treating you im sure youll let me know in terms of payment work it out with him he pulled out his pad again and looked around the sitting room went to the gray couch poked at the pillows ran his hand under them what is this a waiting room for visitors a sitting room said melissa she didnt have visitors my father designed it this way because he thought it was genteel it used to be different very elegant lots more furniture but she cleaned it out and put this in she ordered it from a catalogue shes basically a simple person this is really her favorite place she spends most of her time here doing what reading she reads a lot loves to read and she exercises theres equipment back there crooking a finger in the direction of the bedroom milo peered at the cassatt i said how longs she had that print melissa my father gave it to her when she was pregnant with me did he have other cassatts probably he had lots of works on paper theyre stored upstairs on the third floor to keep them out of the sunlight thats why its perfect for here no windows no windows said milo that doesnt bother her shes a sunny person said melissa she makes her own light uhhuh he went back to the gray couch removed the cushions and put them back i said how long ago did she change the decor both of them looked at me just curious i said about any changes she might have made recently melissa said it was recent a few months ago three or four the stuff that was in here was fathers taste really ornamental she had it put up on the third floor in storage told me she felt kind of guilty because father had spent so much time picking it out but i told her it was okay it was her place she should do what she wanted milo opened the door to the bedroom and stepped through i heard him say she didnt change this too much did she melissa hurried after him i walked in last he was standing in front of the canopied bed melissa said i guess she likes it the way it is guess so said milo the room seemed even bigger from the inside at least twentyfive feet square with fifteenfoot ceilings embroidered with crown moldings fashioned to resemble braided cloth a sixfoot white marble mantel was topped with a gold clock and a menagerie of miniature silver birds a gold eagle sat perched atop the clock eyeing the smaller fowl groupings of empire chairs upholstered in olivegreen silk damask a baroque threefold screen painted in trompe loeil flowers a scattering of tiny goldinlaid tables of doubtful function paintings of country scenes and bosomy maidens with uncertainty in their eyes the braids snaked toward the center of the ceiling terminating in a plaster knot from which a crystal and silver chandelier dangled like a giant watch fob the bed was covered with a quilted offwhite satin spread tapestry pillows were arranged at the head in a precise overlapping row like fallen dominoes a silk robe lay neatly across the foot the bed was set on a pedestal adding to its already considerable height the finials of the posts nearly touched the ceiling weak light shone from crystal wall sconces beside the bed transforming the offwhite color scheme to the color of english mustard and turning the plum carpeting gray milo flipped a switch and flooded the room with the highwatt glare of the chandelier he looked under the bed straightened and said you could eat off it when was the room made up probably this morning mother usually does it herself not the vacuuming or anything strenuous but she likes to make her own bed shes very neat i followed his glance to the chinoiserie nightstands ivory pseudoantique phones on both bud vase with red rose centered on the one to the left a hardcover book next to it all the draperies were drawn milo went to one of the casement windows pulled aside the curtains cranked and looked out fresh air puffed in after studying the view for a while he turned walked to the left side of the bed picked up the book and opened it skimmed a few pages turned it upside down and gave it a couple of shakes nothing fell out opening the door of the stand he bent and peered in empty i went over and looked at the books front cover paul therouxs patagonia express melissa said its a travel book milo said nothing kept looking around the wall opposite the bed was occupied by a ninefoot walnutandgilt armoire and a wide carved fruitwood dresser inlaid with marquetry herbs and flowers perfume bottles and a marble clock sat atop the dresser milo opened the top section of the armoire inside was a color tv a sony inch that looked to be at least ten years old atop the television was a tv guide milo opened it flipped through it the bottom of the armoire was empty no vcr he said she doesnt go in for movies much he moved down to the dresser slid open drawers ran his hands through satin and silk melissa watched for several moments then said what exactly are you looking for where does she keep the rest of her clothes over there she pointed to carved swinging doors on the left side of the room indian rosewood doors inlaid with vines of copper and brass and topped with a motif that conjured up the taj mahal milo shoved them open unceremoniously on the other side was a short squat foyer with three more doors the first opened to a green marble bathroom accented with champagnetinted mirrors and equipped with a sunken whirlpool tub expansive enough for family bathing gold fixtures green marble commode and bidet the medicine cabinet was camouflaged as just another mirrored panel milo pushed looked inside aspirin toothpaste shampoo lipstick tubes a few jars of cosmetics halfempty she take anything as far as you can tell melissa shook her head this is all she keeps she doesnt use much makeup beyond the second door was a roomsized closet outfitted with a makeup table and padded bench at the center and organized as precisely as a surgical scrub tray champagnecolored padded hangers all facing the same way two walls of cedar two of pink damask doublehung hardwood dowels clothes organized by type but there wasnt much to organize mostly onepiece dresses in pale colors a few gowns and furs at the back some still bearing their sales labels perhaps ten pairs of shoes three of them sneakers a collection of sweats folded in storage compartments along the back wall no more than a quarter of the dowelspace filled milo took his time there checking pockets kneeling and inspecting the floor beneath the garments finding nothing and going into the third room combination library and gym the walls lined floor to ceiling with oak shelves the floor highlacquer hardwood tile interlocking rubber mats covered the front half a stationary bicycle rowing machine and motorized treadmill sat on the rubber along with a freestanding rack of lowweight chromeplated dumbbells a cheap digital watch hung from the handlebars of the bike two unopened bottles of evian water stood atop a small refrigerator alongside the weight rack milo opened it empty he moved to the back and ran his finger along some of the bookshelves i read titles more theroux jan morris bruce chatwin atlases books of landscape photography travelogues dating from the victorian age to modern times audubon birding guides to the west fielding guides to everywhere else seventy years of national geographic in brown binders bound collections of smithsonian oceans natural history travel sport diver connoisseur for the first time since hed arrived at the mansion milo looked troubled but only momentarily he scanned the rest of the bookcases said seems like weve got a theme going here melissa didnt answer neither did i no one daring to put the obvious into words we went back into the bedroom melissa seemed subdued milo said where does she keep her bankbooks and financial records i dont know im not sure she keeps anything here whys that her bankings handled for her by mr anger over at first fiduciary trust hes the president his father knew mine anger said milo writing it down know the number offhand no the banks on cathcart just a few blocks from where you turn off to get here any idea how many accounts she keeps there not the foggiest i have two my trust account and one that i use for expenses meaningful pause father wanted it that way what about your stepdad where does he bank i have no idea kneading her hands any reason to think hes in any financial trouble i wouldnt know what kind of restaurant does he run steak and beer does he seem to do pretty well well enough he brings in lots of imported beers in san labrador thats considered exotic speaking of which said milo i could use a drink juice or soda with ice is there a refrigerator up here with something in it she nodded theres a service kitchen at the end of the staff wing i can get you something from there what about you dr delaware sure i said milo said coke i said id have the same she said two cokes waited what is it said milo are you finished in here he looked around one more time sure we passed through the sitting room and went out into the hall melissa closed the door and said two cokes ill be right back when she was gone i said so what do you think what do i think that money sure dont buy no happiness brutha that room cocking a thumb at the doorits like a goddamn hotel suite like she came in on the concorde unpacked went out to see the sights how the hell could she live like that not leaving a piece of herself anywhere and what the hell did she do with herself all day read and toned her muscles yeah he said travel books its like a bad joke some shlock movie directors version of irony i said nothing he said what think ive lost my sense of compassion youre talking about her in the past tense do me a favor dont interpret im not saying shes dead just that shes gone my gut feeling is shes been planning to fly the coop for a while finally gathered enough courage and did it probably jamming that rolls along route with the windows open singing at the top of her lungs i dont know i said i cant see her abandoning melissa he gave a small hard laugh alex i know shes your patient and you obviously like her but from what ive seen the kid grates you heard what she said about mommy never raising her voice to her that normal maybe mommy finally blew her stack see the way she treated ramp and suggesting to me i investigate him without any solid reason to i couldnt put up with that shit for very long course i dont have a phd in kiddy psych but neither does mommy i said shes a good kid milo her mothers disappeared time to cut her a little slack dont you think was she sweetness and light before mommy split you yourself said she pulled a fit and ran out on mommy yesterday okay she can be difficult but her mother cared about her the two of them are close i just dont see her running out no offense he said but how well do you really know the lady alex you met her once she used to be an actress and in terms of their being close think of it never yelling at a kid for eighteen years no matter how good a kid is theyre gonna bear some yelling once in a while right the lady must have been sitting on a powder keg anger at what mccloskey did to her at losing her husband at being stuck up here because of her problems thats one giant keg right the fight with the kid was what finally lit it the kid mouthed off one time too many mom waited a long time for her to come back and when she didnt she said fuck it to hell with reading about distant places lets go see some i said assuming youre right do you think shell come back yeah probably she didnt take much with her but who knows so whats next more placebo not more the placebo hasnt started yet when i scoped out the room it was for real trying to get a feel for her as if it were a crime scene and you know even with all the bloody rooms ive been in that place ranks up there on the freaky scale it felt empty bad vibes i saw jungles in asia that made me feel like that dead silent but you knew something was going on beneath the surface he shook his head listen to me vibes i sound like some new age asshole no i said i felt it too yesterday when i was here the house reminded me of an empty hotel he rolled his eyes flashed a halloween mask grimace clawed his hands and scraped at the air the rrrich motel he said in a lugosi accent they check in but they dont check out i laughed totally tasteless but it felt cruelly good like the jokes that flew around at staff meetings back in my hospital days he said i figure the best thing to do is give it a couple of days of my time chances are shell be back by then the alternative is for me to quit right now but all that would do is spook both the kid and ramp and send them rushing to someone else at least with me they wont get ripped off might as well be my seventy an hour meant to ask you about that i said you told me fifty it was fifty then i drove up and saw the house now that ive seen more of the interior im sorry i didnt make it ninety sliding scale absolutely share the wealth half an hour in this place and im ready to vote socialist maybe gina felt the same way i said what do you mean you saw how few clothes she had and the sitting room the way she redecorated ordering from a catalogue maybe she just wanted out or maybe its just reverse snobbery alex like owning expensive art and storing it upstairs i was about to tell him about the cassatt in ursula cunninghamgabneys office but was interrupted by melissa returning with two glasses at her heels were madeleine and two stocky hispanic women in their thirties who came up to the frenchwomans shoulder one with long plaited hair the other with a short shag cut if theyd removed their white uniforms for the evening theyd put them back on along with fresh makeup they looked hyperalert and wary travelers passing through customs at a hostile port this is detective sturgis melissa said handing us the cokes hes here to figure out what happened to mother detective meet madeleine de couer lupe ortega and rebecca maldonado milo said ladies madeleine folded her arms across her bosom and nodded the other two women stared melissa said were waiting for sabino the gardener he lives in pasadena it shouldnt take long to us they were waiting in their rooms i couldnt see any reason why they shouldnt be able to come out or even why you shouldnt get started right now i already asked them the doorbell cut her short she said one sec and ran down the stairs i watched her from the top of the landing followed her descent to the front door before she got there ramp was opening it sabino hernandez walked in trailed by his five sons all six men had on shortsleeved sports shirts and slacks and stood at parade rest one wore a bolo tie a couple had on sparkling white guayaberas they began glancing around awestruck by circumstances or the scale of the house i wondered how many times after all these years theyd actually been inside we assembled in the front room milo standing note pad and pen out everyone else sitting on the edges of the overstuffed chairs nine years had turned hernandez into a very old man whitehaired hunched and loosejawed his hands had a permanent tremor he looked too frail for physical labor his sons transformed from boys to men by the same stretch of time surrounded him like stakeposts protecting an ailing tree milo asked his questions told them to search their memories very carefully got wet eyes from the women bright stares from the men the only new development was an eyewitness account of ginas departure two of the hernandez sons had been working in the front of the house at the time gina ramp had driven out one of them guillermo had been pruning a tree near the driveway and had actually seen her drive by seen her clearly because hed been standing to the right of the righthand drive rollsroyce and the tinted window had been rolled down the señora hadnt been smiling or frowning just a serious look both hands on the steering wheel driving very slowly she hadnt noticed him or said goodbye that was a little unusual the señora was usually very friendly but no she hadnt looked frightened or upset not angry either something else he searched for the word in english conferred with his brother hernandez senior looked straight ahead seemed cut off from the proceedings thinking said guillermo she looked as if shed been thinking about something any idea what milo asked guillermo shook his head milo addressed the question to all of them blank faces one of the hispanic maids began crying again madeleine prodded her and stared straight ahead milo asked the frenchwoman if she had something to add she said madame was a wonderful person non she had no idea where madame had gone non madame hadnt taken anything with her other than her purse her judith leiber black calfskin purse the only one she owned madame didnt like a lot of different things but what she had was excellent madame was très classique more tears from lupe and rebecca the hernandezes shifted in their seats lost looks from all of them ramp stared at his knuckles even melissa seemed drained of fight milo probed gently then more insistently doing as deft a job as id ever seen coming up with nothing a tangible sense of helplessness settled over the room during the course of milos questions no pecking order had emerged no one stepping forth to speak for the group once upon a time it had been different looks like jacobs a good friend he takes care of everything dutchy had never been replaced now this as if the big house were being assaulted by destiny allowed to crumble piece by piece milo dismissed the staff and asked for a place to work ramp said anywheres okay melissa said the downstairs study and led us to the windowless room with the goya painting the desk at the center was white and french and much too small for milo he sat behind it tried to get comfortable gave up and swung his glance from wall to booklined wall nice view melissa said father used it as his study he designed it without windows for maximum concentration milo said uhhuh he opened desk drawers and closed them took out his note pad and placed it on the desk got any phone books melissa said here and opened a cabinet beneath the shelves removing an armful of directories she piled them in front of milo obscuring the bottom half of his face the black one on tops a san labrador private directory even people who dont list their numbers in the regular phone book put them in here milo divided the books into two short stacks lets start with her creditcard numbers she has all the major ones said ramp but i dont know the numbers offhand where does she keep her statements at the bank first fiduciary here in san labrador the bills go straight there and the bank pays them milo turned to melissa know any numbers she shook her head and gave a guilty look like a student caught unprepared milo scribbled what about her drivers license number silence easy enough to get from the dmv said milo still writing lets go for vital statistics height weight birthdate maiden name five eight and a half said melissa around a hundred and twentyfive pounds her birthdays march twentythird her maiden names paddock regina marie paddock she spelled it milo said year of birth nineteen fortysix social security number i dont know ramp said ive never seen her card im sure glenn anger can get you the number from her tax returns milo said she doesnt keep any papers around the house not as far as i know the san labrador police didnt ask you for any of those things no said ramp maybe they figured on getting the information elsewhere from the city rolls melissa said right milo put down his pen okay time to get to work he reached for the phone neither ramp nor melissa budged milo said feel free to stick around for the show but if youre drowsy i promise this will finish you off melissa frowned and left the room quickly ramp said ill leave you to your duties mr sturgis and turned heel milo picked up the phone i went looking for melissa and found her in the kitchen looking in one of the wall lockers she pulled out a bottle of orange soda twisted the cap got a glass from an upper cabinet and poured carelessly some of the soda spilled on the counter she didnt attempt to clean it still unaware of my presence she raised the glass to her lips and gulped so quickly it made her cough sputtering she slapped her chest saw me and slapped harder when the paroxysms died she said oh that was attractive in a smaller voice cant do anything right i came closer ripped a piece of paper towel from a roll impaled upon a wooden holder and mopped up the spill she said let me do that and took the towel wiped spots that were already dry i know how rough this has been for you i said two days ago we were talking about harvard harvard she said big damned deal hopefully itll return to being a big deal soon yeah right as if i could ever leave now wadding up the towel she tossed it onto the counter lifted her head and looked straight at me inviting debate i said in the end youll do whats best for you her eyes flickered with uncertainty shifted to the soda bottle god i didnt even offer you any im sorry its okay i just had that coke as if she hadnt heard she said here let me get you some she reached up into the cupboard and retrieved another glass as she placed it on the counter her arm jerked and the glass skidded across the shelf she caught it before it dropped on the floor dropped it and fumbled to catch it again staring at it breathing hard she said damn and ran out of the room i followed her again searched for her throughout the ground floor of the house but couldnt find her went up the green stairs and headed toward her room the door was open i looked in saw no one called out her name got no answer entering i was hit by deceitful memories crystalline recollections of a place id never been the ceiling was painted with a mural of gowned courtesans enjoying a place that could have been versailles carpeting the color of raspberry sherbet covered the floor the walls were pinkandgray lambandpussycat wallpaper broken by lacetrimmed windows the bed was a miniature of her mothers shelves brimming with music boxes and miniature dishes and figurines lined the room three dollhouses a zoo of stuffed animals the precise images shed described nine years ago the place shed never slept the only concession to young adulthood was a desk to the right of the bed bearing a personal computer dotmatrix printer and a pile of books i inspected the books two manuals on preparation for the sat the college game planning your academic career fowlers guide to american universities information brochures from half a dozen firstrate colleges the one from harvard dogeared a bookmark inserted in the psychology section manuals for the future in a room that clung to the past as if her mind had developed while the rest had stagnated had i been fooled nine years ago into believing shed changed more than she had i left the room considered looking for her on the second and third floors and realized how daunting that would be i went downstairs and stood alone in the entry hall man without a function a tenfoot marble clock with a face almost too ornate to read said gina ramp had been gone almost nine hours id been hanging around for more than half of it time to catch some sleep leave the detecting to the pros i went to tell the pro i was leaving he was standing behind the desk tie loosened sleeves rolled carelessly midforearm phone tucked under his chin writing rapidly uhhuh is he generally reliable he does didnt know you guys were doing that well that so really maybe i should be thinking about that yeah anyway what time was this okay yeah i know where it is i appreciate your talking to me at this stage of the game yeah yeah officially though i dont know that theyre actively involved san labrador is yeah i know just for strokes though yeah thanks appreciate it bye he hung up said that was the highway patrol looks like my freeway theorys getting some validation weve got a possible sighting of the car threethirty this afternoon on the heading east out near azuza thats about a tenmile drive from here so it makes sense timewise what do you mean possible sighting and why did it take so long to find out if it was spotted that long ago the source is an offduty motorcycle guy he was hanging out at home listening to his scanner happened to hear the bulletin and called in seems at threethirty hed pulled some speeder off onto the left shoulder of the westbound was in the process of writing out a ticket when he happened to notice the rolls or one just like it zip by on the eastbound it happened too fast for him to get the plates other than to notice they were english that answer both your questions who was driving he didnt see that either not that he wouldve if it was her because of the smoked windows did he notice smoked windows nope it was the car he was looking at the bodystyle seems hes some sort of collector has a bentley from around the same period cop with a bentley that was my reaction too the guy i was just talking to sergeant at the san gabriel chippy station is a buddy of the first guy the call came in to him personally hes also a motorhead collects corvettes lots of cops are into wheels they work extra jobs to pay for their toys anyway he informs me that some of the old bentleys arent that expensive twenty grand or so cheaper if you buy a wreck and fix it up yourself rolls from the same year cost more cause theyre rarer only a few hundred of those silver dawns were made thats why the first guy noticed it meaning its probably hers probably but not definitely the guy who saw it thought it was black over gray but he couldnt be sure it might have been all black or dark gray over light gray were talking a sixtymileanhour zipby how many old rolls would there be driving around that time that place more than you might imagine apparently a hell of a lot of them ended up in la back when the dollar was worth something and there are plenty of collectors concentrated in the pasadenasan labrador area but yeah id say weve got a ninetypercentplus chance it was her east on the i said picturing the wideopen highway where would she be heading anywhere but shed have had to make a decision fairly soon the freeway ends around fifteen miles from there just short of la verne north is angeles crest and i dont see her as the type to rough it south she could have caught any number of other freeways the going straight south or in either direction which would take her anywhere from the beach to vegas or she could have continued on surface streets up into the foothills checked out the sights at rancho cucamonga what the hell is out there anyway i dont know but my guess is shed probably stay near civilization he nodded yeah her type of civilization im thinking newport beach laguna la jolla pauma santa fe springs still doesnt narrow it much or maybe she turned around and headed for her own place in malibu ramp called there twice and she didnt answer what if she wasnt in the mood to pick up the phone why would she go in one direction then reverse herself lets say the whole thing started out impulsively shes just driving for the hell of it gets on the freeway gets swept along going east by chance maybe its just a matter of it being the first onramp she sees when the freeway ends she decides upon a specific destination closest thing to home home number two or lets say she was heading east intentionally that means route and a whole bunch of other possibilities san berdoo palm springs vegas and beyond the great beyond alex she could drive all the way to maine if the car held up if it didnt with her dough she couldve ditched it gotten another one fast all you need to chew up the open road is time and money and neither of those is her problem an agoraphobic doing the scenic route you said yourself she was in the process of getting cured maybe the freeway helped it along all that blacktop no stoplights it can make you feel powerful make you wanna forget about the rules thats why people move out here in the first place isnt it i thought about that thought of my first time on the open road heading west for college at sixteen the first time id driven over the rockies seeing the desert at night thrilled and terrified my first view of the dirtbrown haze looming over the la basin heavy and threatening but incapable of dimming the gilded promise of the city at twilight guess so i said he came around from behind the desk i said what now deliver the news then get the bulletin expanded its better than even money shes out of the county by now or the car is he raised his eyebrows meaning what it is possible that something happened to her isnt it that someone else is behind the wheel anythings possible alex but if you were a bad guy would that be the car youd rip off who was it told me long ago its only the stupid ones you catch you wanna think foul play fine at this point id have to see something ugly to consider it anything more than an adult runaway and not one thats likely to turn me into a hero what do you mean runaways are the hardest mps to locate under any circumstances rich ones are the worst of the worst because the rich get to make their own rules buying for cash avoiding jobs credit unions all the stuff that leaves a paper trail what just happened with ramp and the kid is a perfect example your average husband would be a hell of a lot more in touch with his wifes credit cards and social security number your average couple shares these people live separately at least where moneys concerned the rich know the power of the buck they rope their funds off and protect them like buried treasure separate bank accounts and separate bedrooms i said real intimate huh he doesnt seem to know her wonder why she married him in the first place the kid has a point maybe she liked his mustache he gave a short sad smile and walked to the door looking back at the windowless room he said designed for concentration i couldnt spend too much time here without going stircrazy i thought of another windowless room said speaking of interior design when i was over at the gabney clinic i was struck by the similarity between ursula gabneys office decor and the way gina furnished that sitting room upstairs exact same color scheme same style of furniture and the only art in ursulas office was a cassatt lithograph mother and child so whats it mean doctor i dont know exactly but if the print was a gift it was a hell of a generous one the last time i checked an auction catalogue cassatt prints in good shape were pricey how pricey twenty to sixty grand for blackandwhite a color one would go for more the doctors print is a color one too i nodded very similar to ginas sixty grand plus he said whats the current wisdom on therapists accepting gifts its not illegal but its generally considered unethical you think theres some kind of svengali thing going on maybe nothing that ominous i said just overinvolvement possessiveness ursula seems resentful of melissa the way one sibling might resent another almost as if she wants gina all to herself melissa sensed it on the other hand maybe its just professional pride the treatments been intensive shes brought gina a long way changed her life changed her furniture too i shrugged maybe im overinterpreting or seeing it backwards patients influence therapists too its called countertransference ursula could have bought her cassatt because she saw ginas and liked it with the fees the clinic charges she could sure afford it big bucks setup megabucks when both gabneys work they bill five hundred an hour per patient three for his time two for hers didnt she ever hear of equal pay for equal work her works more than equal my impression is she does most of the actual therapy while he sits back and plays mentor he clucked his tongue shes not doing too bad as a mentee is she five hundred he shook his head sweet deal get a handful of rich folk in serious psychic pain and you wouldnt need much else to fuel the gravy train he took a step paused you think this ursulas holding back holding back what knowledge of the whole thing if they were as close as youre suggesting gina could have let her in on her plans for the great escape maybe old ursula even thought getting away would be good for her therapeutic hell maybe she even helped plan it gina disappeared on the way to the clinic anythings possible i said but i doubt it she seemed genuinely upset by the disappearance what about the other one the husband he mouthed the right words but didnt come across too stressed he claims he doesnt worry trained himself not to doctor heal thyself huh or could be hes just not as good an actor as his wife the three of them in cahoots i said thought you didnt like conspiracy theories i like what fits not that any of it does at this point were just headtripping there are two other women in ginas group i said if she did plan to run away she might have mentioned it to them when i suggested to ursula that they be interviewed she got really defensive told me gina didnt socialize with them they couldnt be any help if she is hiding something that could have been stonewalling he gave a small smile stonewalling i thought you guys called it confidentiality i felt myself go hot he patted my shoulder now now whats a little reality between friends speaking of which id better deliver the news to my clients we found ramp sitting and drinking in the rear room with the painted beams the drapes were drawn across the french doors and he was staring off into space eyes halfclosed his face had taken on a ruddy glow and his shirt was wilting around the edges when we came in he said gentlemen in a hearty greeters voice milo asked him to get melissa and he called her room using an intercom on the phone when she didnt answer he tried several other rooms without success then looked up helplessly milo said ill catch her later and told him about the car being sighted the said ramp where would she be going can you think of anything me no of course not none of this makes any sense to why would she be driving the freeway she just started driving period this is just crazy milo said it would be a good idea to have that bulletin expanded statewide of course go ahead do it its got to come from a police agency your local cops have probably been informed of the sighting by now may have requested it already if you want i can call to confirm please said ramp he got up and walked around the room a shirttail had come loose in front it was monogrammed with a red dnr driving the freeway he said thats nuts theyre sure it was her no said milo the only thing theyre sure of is that it was a car just like hers so it had to be her how many damned silver dawns could there be he looked down tucked in his shirt hastily milo said the next step would be to call airline companies then get to the bank tomorrow morning and take a look at her financial records ramp stared at him groped like a blind man along the edge of a nearby armchair and lowered himself into it still staring what you said at the beginning about this being about her running away you think that for certain now dont you i dont think anything yet milo said with a gentleness that surprised me and raised ramps head a couple of inches higher im taking it step by step doing the things that need doing a door slammed somewhere in the house ramp bounded up and left the room returning a few moments later trailing melissa she had on a khaki safari vest over her shirt and boots encrusted with mud and grass i had sabinos boys check the grounds she said just in case a brief glance at ramp whats going on milo repeated what hed learned the freeway said melissa one of her hands found the other and kneaded ramp said it doesnt make any sense does it she ignored him put her hands on her hips and faced milo okay at least shes all right what next milo said phone work till morning then i head over to the bank why wait till morning ill call anger right now and tell him to get down here its the least he can do all the business this familys given him okay tell him ill need to go over your mothers records wait here ill go call him right now she left the room milo said yes maam she came back with a scrap of paper and handed it to milo hell meet you there heres the address i had to tell him what it was about let him know i expected him to keep it to himself what should i do while youre gone call airlines said milo see if anyone bought a ticket to anywhere using your moms name say youre her daughter and its an emergency if that doesnt work embellish it someones sick you really need to know for medical reasons check departures from lax burbank ontario john wayne and lindbergh if you want to be really thorough check under your moms maiden name too ill only come back here if something profound happens at the bank heres my number at home scrawling on the back of the paper shed just handed him he tore off half and gave it to her call me if you learn anything she said even if it seems unimportant will do said milo turning to ramp he said hang in there ramp remained in his chair and gave a dull nod i said to melissa is there anything i can do for you no she said no thanks i dont really feel like talking i want to do something no offense okay no offense ill call you if i need you she said no problem sayonara said milo heading for the door i said ill walk out with you if you insist he said coasting down the driveway but if i had a chance at some shuteye id grab it hed brought ricks white porsche a portable scanner had been mounted on the dash since the last time id seen the car he had the volume on low and the machine emitted a steady stream of mumbles hoo hah i said tapping the box christmas gift from whom from me to me he said accelerating the porsche hummed in agreement i still think you should go to sleep ramps already looking wilted and the kids running on adrenaline sooner or later youre gonna be back here doing your thing not tired i said too keyed up uhhuh itll hit you tomorrow just in time for a panic call no doubt he chuckled and gunned the engine the gates to the property were open he turned left on sussex knoll then left again giving the porsches wheel a rightward turn he oversteered a bit and had to straighten before turning onto cathcart boulevard the businesses along the commercial strip were all dark the streetlights cast an opaline light that expired before it reached the grassy median yeah there it is all lit up he said pointing across the street to a floodlit onestory greek revival building white limestone boxwood hedges small lawn with a flagpole first fiduciary trust bank fdic in gold letters over the door i said doesnt look big enough to store cookiesale proceeds quality not quantity remember he pulled up in front of the bank to the right was a twenty space parking lot fronted by twin iron posts and a chain that had been lowered to the ground a black mercedes sedan sat alone in the first spot on the left side as we got out of the porsche the black cars door opened a man exited closed the door and stood there one hand on the roof of the car milo said im sturgis the man came forward into the streetlight he had on a gray gabardine sack suit white shirt yellow tie with blue dots matching handkerchief in his breast pocket black wingtips on his feet quick midnight dresser he said glenn anger mr sturgis i hope mrs ramps in no danger thats what were trying to find out come this way pointing toward the banks front door the security systems been disarmed but there are still these to contend with pointing to a quartet of deadbolt locks arranged in a square around the doorknob he pulled out a ring crammed with keys fingered one inserted it in the upper righthand lock turned and waited until a click had sounded before pulling it out working quickly and efficiently i thought of a professional safecracker i took a good look at him six feet gray crewcut long face that would probably show tan in the daylight nub of nose skimpy mouth diminutive closeset ears as if hed purchased his features on sale and had settled for one size too small thick dark eyebrows made his pale eyes look even tinier than they were his age was somewhere between fortyfive and fiftyfive if hed been roused from sleep hed made a good recovery before inserting the fourth key he stopped and looked up and down the deserted street then at us milos return look communicated nothing anger turned the key pushed the door open an inch im very concerned about mrs ramp melissa made it sound quite serious milo gave a noncommittal nod anger said what exactly is it you think i can do for you then he looked at me milo said this is alex delaware as if that settled it the first thing you can do is get me the numbers on her credit cards and her checking accounts the second is you can educate me about her general financial situation educate you said anger his hand still on the knob answer a few questions anger moved his lower jaw back and forth curving his arm around the jamb he reached in and turned on some lights inside the bank was polished cherry wood royalblue carpeting brass fixtures and a ceiling with a relief of a bald eagle at the apex three tellers stations and a door marked safe deposit took up one side three deskandchair sets filled the other in the center of the room was a service kiosk the place smelled of lemon wax and ammonia and money so old it had begun to grow mold seeing it empty made me feel like a burglar anger pointed forward and took us to a door at the rear that said w glenn anger chairman and president over a seal that looked awfully similar to the one ronald reagan had just stopped using two locks on this one anger opened them and said come on in his office was small and cool and smelled like a new car it was furnished with a squat desk bare except for a gold cross pen and a blackshaded lamp and two brown tweed chairs with a low square table between them several leatherbound books sat on the table to the right of the desk was a personal computer on a wheeled stand family photos filled the rear wall each featuring the same brood blond wife resembling doris day after six months of overeating four blond boys two beautifully groomed golden retrievers and a grumpylooking siamese cat the other walls were taken up by a pair of stanford diplomas a collection of norman rockwell plates a framed replica of the declaration of independence and a ceilinghigh rack of athletic trophies golf squash swimming baseball track awards dating back twenty years and inscribed to warren glenn anger more recent ones made out to warren glenn anger jr and eric james anger i wondered about the two boys who hadnt brought home any goldplate and tried to pick them in the photos but couldnt all four were smiling anger took a seat behind the desk shot his cuffs and looked at his watch dark curly hair with red tips sprouted along the tops of his hands milo and i sat in the tweed chairs i looked down at the table the leatherbound books were membership directories rosters of three private clubs still battling the city over admission of women and minorities youre a private detective said anger thats right what kind of education are you after milo took out his pad mrs ramps net worth for starts how her assets are divided any significant withdrawals recently angers eyebrow dipped at the center why exactly do you need all this mr sturgis ive been hired to hunt for mrs ramp a good hunter gets to know his quarry anger frowned milo said her banking patterns might tell me something about her intentions intentions in terms of what a pattern of unusually large withdrawals might suggest she was planning to take a trip anger gave several very small nods i see well that hasnt been the case and her net worth what would that tell you i need to know whats at stake at stake in terms of what in terms of how long she can stay out of sight if her disappearance is voluntary are you suggesting in terms of who stands to inherit if it isnt angers jaw moved back and forth that sounds ominous not really i just need to define my parameters i see and what do you thinks happened to her mr sturgis i dont have enough information to think anything thats why im here anger tilted back in his chair rolled the bottom of his tie upward then let it unfurl im really concerned for her welfare mr sturgis im sure youre aware of her problem the fears the thought of her out there by herself anger shook his head were all concerned said milo so why dont we get to work anger swiveled his chair to one side lowered it and faced center again the problem is that a bank needs to maintain certain levels of i know what a bank needs to do and im sure you do it really well but theres a lady out there whose family wants her found asap so why dont we cut to the chase anger didnt move but he looked as if hed slammed his finger in a car door and was trying to tough it out who exactly is your client of record mr sturgis both mr ramp and ms dickinson i havent heard from don on this hes a bit stressed right now trying to get some rest but feel free to call him stressed said anger concerned for his wifes welfare the longer shes gone the greater the stress with luck the whole thing will resolve itself and the family will be extremely grateful to those who helped them in their time of need people tend to remember that kind of thing yes of course but thats part of my dilemma having the matter resolve itself only to have made mrs ramps finances needlessly public without proper legal justification because only mrs ramp has the legal justification to request release of that information youve got a point said milo if you want well walk out of here and record the fact that you opted not to cooperate no said anger that wont be necessary melissa has reached her majority if barely in light of the situation i suppose its appropriate for her to make these types of family decisions in her mothers absence what situations that shes her mothers sole heir ramp gets nothing just a small sum how small fifty thousand dollars let me qualify that by saying those are the facts as i know them today the family attorneys are wresting douse and cosner downtown they may have drafted new papers though i doubt it generally im kept well informed of any changes we do the familys accounting receive copies of all documents give me those lawyers names again said milo pen poised wresting douse and cosner theyre a fine old firm jim douses greatuncle was j harmon douse the california supreme court justice whos mrs ramps personal lawyer jim junior jim douses son james madison douse junior milo copied it down got his number handy anger recited seven numbers okay said milo the fifty thousand that goes to ramp that the result of a prenuptial agreement anger nodded the agreement states to the best of my recollection that don forfeits claim to any part of ginas estate beyond a single cash payment of fifty thousand dollars very simple shortest one ive ever seen whose idea was it arthur dickinsons essentially ginas first husband voice from the grave anger shifted in his chair and gave a look of distaste arthur wanted gina well taken care of he was acutely aware of the difference in their ages and her fragility he specified in his will that no subsequent husband be eligible to inherit is that legal youd have to consult an attorney on that mr sturgis don certainly showed no desire to challenge it then or since i was present when the agreement was signed notarized it personally don was totally amenable more than that enthusiastic stated his willingness to forgo even the fifty thousand it was gina who insisted on sticking to the letter of arthurs will whys that the man is her husband then why didnt she try to give him more i dont know mr sturgis youd have to ask selfconscious smile yes well i can only guess but i suppose she was a bit embarrassed this was a week before the wedding most people dont like dealing with financial matters at a time like that don reassured her it was irrelevant to him sounds like he didnt marry her for her money anger gave a cold look apparently not mr sturgis any idea why he did marry her i assume he loved her mr sturgis they pretty happy together far as you know anger sat back and folded his hands across his chest investigating your own client mr sturgis trying to fill in the picture art was never my strong suit mr sturgis milo looked at the trophies and said would it help if i phrased it in sports terms not one bit im afraid milo smiled and scribbled okay back to basics melissas the sole heir thats correct who inherits the estate if melissa dies i believe her mother does but were really getting out of my field of expertise okay lets move back into it whats inherited how big of an estate are we talking about anger hesitated a bankers prudishness then about forty million give or take all of it in highly conservative investments such as state of california taxfree municipal bonds rated doublea or above bluechip stocks and corporate bonds treasury bills some holdings in the secondary and tertiary mortgage markets nothing speculative how much yearly income does she get from all that three and a half to five million depending on yields all interest anger nodded talking figures had drawn him forward and relaxed his posture theres nothing else coming in arthur did some architecture and development early on but most of what he accumulated was the result of royalties on the dickinson strut its a process he invented something to do with strengthening metal he sold all rights to it just before he died which is just as well thereve been newer techniques that have superseded it whyd he sell hed just retired wanted to devote all his time to gina to her medical problems youre aware of her history the attack milo nodded any idea why she was attacked that startled anger i was at college when it happened read about it in the papers that doesnt exactly answer my question anger said what exactly was your question the motive behind the attack i have no idea any local theories youre aware of i dont engage in gossip im sure you dont mr anger but if you did is there something you would have heard mr sturgis said anger you need to understand that ginas been out of circulation for a long time shes not a topic of local gossip what about at the time of the attack or shortly after when she moved to san labrador any gossip then from what i recall said anger the consensus was that he was out of his mind the maniac who did it does a madman need a motive guess not milo scanned his notes those highly conservative investments you mentioned they also dickinsons idea absolutely the rules of investment are spelled out in the will arthur was a very cautious man collecting art was his only extravagance he would have bought his clothes off the rack if he could milo said think he was too conservative one doesnt judge said anger with what hed put together from the strut royalties he could have invested in real estate and parlayed it into a really sizable estate two or three hundred million but he insisted on security no risks and we did as told continue to do so youve been his banker since the beginning fiduciary has my father founded the bank he worked directly with arthur angers face creased sharing credit with reluctance no portraits of the founder in here none out in the main room of the bank either none of arthur dickinson in the house hed built i wondered why milo said you pay all her bills everything except small cash purchases minor household expenditures how much do you pay out each month one moment said anger swiveling to face the computer he turned on the machine waited until it had booted up and beeped a welcome then hunted and pecked waited typed some more and sat forward as the screen was filled with letters here we go last months bills totaled thirtytwo thousand two hundred fiftyeight and thirtynine cents the month before that a little over thirty thats about typical milo got up walked behind the desk and looked at the screen anger began to shield it with his hand protecting his data like a goody twoshoes kid guarding an exam but milo was looming over him already copying and the banker let his hand drop as you can see he said the family lives comparatively simply most of the budget goes to cover staff salaries basic maintenance on the house insurance premiums no mortgages none arthur bought the beach house for cash and lived there while he built the main house what about taxes theyre paid out of a separate account if you insist ill call up the file but youll learn nothing from it humor me said milo anger rubbed his jaw and typed a line the computer made digestive noises he rubbed his jaw again and i noticed that the skin along his mandible was slightly irritated hed shaved before coming over here he said as the screen flashed amber last years federal and state taxes amounted to just under a million dollars that leaves about twoandahalf to four million to play with approximately where does it go we reinvest it stocks and bonds anger nodded does mrs ramp take any cash out for herself her personal allowance is ten thousand dollars per month allowance arthur set it up that way is she allowed to take more the moneys hers mr sturgis she can take whatever she wants does she does she what take more than ten no what about melissas expenses those are covered by a separate trust fund so were talking a hundred twenty thousand a year for how many years since arthur died i said he died just before melissa was born that makes it a little over eighteen years eighteen times twelve is what said milo around two hundred months two sixteen said anger reflexively times ten thou is over two million dollars if mrs ramp put it in another bank and earned interest it could have doubled right thered be no reason for her to do that said anger where is it then what makes you think its anywhere mr sturgis she probably spent it on personal items two million plus worth of personal items i assure you mr sturgis that ten thousand dollars a month for a woman of her standing is hardly worth considering milo said guess youre right anger smiled its easy to be staggered by the idea of all those zeroes but believe me that kind of money is inconsequential and it goes fast i have clients who spend more on a single fur coat now is there anything else i can help you with mr sturgis mr and mrs ramp share any accounts no mr ramp do his banking here too yes but id prefer you talk to him directly about his finances sure said milo now how about those creditcard numbers angers fingers danced across the keyboard machineburp flash there are three cards american express visa and mastercard he pointed these are the numbers below each are the credit allowances and purchase totals for the current fiscal year this all of it said milo writing yes it is mr sturgis milo copied between all three shes got around a fiftythousand monthly credit line fortyeight thousand five hundred and fiftyfive no purchases on the american express not much on any of them looks like she doesnt buy much no need to said anger we take care of everything kind of like being a kid said milo beg pardon the way she lives like being a little kid getting an allowance having all her needs taken care of no fuss no muss angers hand clawed above the keyboard im sure its amusing to ridicule the rich mr sturgis but ive noticed youre not immune to material amusements that so your porsche you chose it because of what it means to you oh that said milo rising thats borrowed my regular transportations much less meaningful really said anger milo looked at me tell him he drives a moped i said better for stakeouts except when it rains said milo then i take an umbrella back in the porsche he said looks like little melissa may have been wrong about stepdaddys intentions true love i said yet they dont sleep together shrug maybe ramp loves her for the purity of her soul or maybe he intends one day to contest the prenuptial what a suspicious guy he said in the meantime theres all that allowance money to wonder about two million i said chump change dont get staggered by a few zeroes mr sturgis heaven forfend he got back on cathcart drove slowly thing is hes got a point her kind of income a hundred twenty a year could seem like petty cash if she spent it but after being up in her room i dont see where it went books and magazines and a home gym dont add up to a hundred twenty gees a year hell she didnt even have a vcr theres the therapy but thats only for the last year unless shes got some secret charity eighteen years worth of unspent allowance would have accumulated to something pretty tidy by anyones standards maybe i should have checked her mattress could be thats where the money for the cassatt came from both cassatts possible he said but that still leaves plenty if she did deposit it in another bank wed be hardpressed to find it any time soon how could she deal with another bank without leaving the house that kind of money at stake plenty of banks would come to her neither ramp nor melissa mentioned any visits from bankers true he said so maybe she just stashed it for a rainy day and maybe the rainy day came and shes got it clutched in her hot little hand right now i thought about that he said what rich lady hauling megabucks in a rolls it spells victim he nodded in a hundred goddam languages we drove back to sussex knoll to get my car the gates were closed but two floodlights above them had been switched on welcome home lights a stretch at optimism that seemed pitiful in the stillness of the early morning hours i said forget the car ill pick it up tomorrow without a word milo turned around and headed back toward cathcart putting on speed and handling the porsche better than id ever seen we sped west onto california made the transition to arroyo seco in what seemed like seconds then the freeway barren and dark and windlashed but milo kept searching anyway turning his head from side to side checking the rearview waiting until wed hit the downtown interchange before cranking the volume up on the scanner and listening to the hurts people were choosing to inflict on one another as a new day began when i got home i was still wound up i went down to the pond and found clusters of spawn clinging bravely to some of the plants at the edge of the water heartened i climbed back up to the house and wrote made myself drowsy in fifteen minutes and barely got my clothes off before tumbling into bed i awoke at sixforty am friday and called melissa an hour later oh she said sounding disappointed it was me i already talked to mr sturgis nothing new sorry i did exactly as he said dr delaware called every airline at every airport even san francisco and san jose which he didnt mention because she could have headed north right then i phoned every hotel and motel i could find in the yellow pages but no one had any record of her checking in i think hes starting to realize it might be serious whys that because he agreed to talk to mccloskey i see is he really good dr delaware as a detective best i know i think he is too i actually like him better than when i first met him but ive really got to be sure because no one else seems to care the police arent doing anything chickering acts as if im wasting his time by calling and dons gone back to work can you believe that what are you doing staying right here and waiting and praying i havent prayed since i was a little kid before you helped me pause i keep going back and forth between expecting her to walk in at any moment and feeling really sick to my stomach when i realize she could be ive got to stay here i dont want her coming home to an empty house makes sense in the meantime i think im going to try some hotels up north maybe nevada too because that really isnt very far by car is it can you think of anywhere else that would be logical i guess any of the bordering states i said good idea is there anything you need melissa anything i can do for you no she said quickly no thanks ill be coming out there today anyway to get my car oh sure whatever if you want to talk just let me know sure take care melissa i will dr delaware better keep this line open just in case bye the phone barked sturgis well i said its a lot better than yeah hey im a working man now whats up i just got off the phone with melissa she told me the two of you conferred she talked i listened if thats conferred i guess we did sounds as if shes been keeping herself busy she worked all night kids got energy adrenaline overdrive i said want me to tell her to cool it no its okay for the time being shes dealing with her anxiety by making herself feel useful i am concerned about whatll happen if her mother doesnt show up soon and her defenses start to crack yeah well shes got you for that any time you want her to ease off just let me know as if shed listen true he said so i said nothing new not a damn thing the bulletin has been expanded statewide and into nevada and arizona and the credit checks are all in place so far no bigticket purchases have been phoned in small stuff is tabulated when the merchants mail in the receipts so well have to wait on that i doublechecked some of the places melissa called mostly airlines and luxury hotels no one fitting mommys description checked in during the night im waiting for the passport office to open at eight just in case she opted for longdistance travel told melissa to keep working the local lines actually shes a damn good assistant she said you agreed to see mccloskey i told her id do it some time today cant hurt nothing else is panning out what time were you planning on visiting him fairly soon ive got a call in to douse the lawyer hes supposed to get back to me by nine i want to verify some of the things anger told me if douse is willing to answer my questions over the phone ill take on mccloskey soon as im finished if not itll mean a couple of hours delay hassling downtown but mccloskey doesnt live that far from the law office so either way i should be there before noon whether or not i find hims another story pick me up got plenty of free time free enough fine he said you buy lunch he came by at nineforty honking the horn of his fiat by the time i got outside hed parked in the carport lunch and transportation he said pointing to the seville id picked up from melissas house milo had on a gray suit white shirt and blue tie where to downtown ill direct you i drove down the glen to sunset got on the south then switched to the santa monica freeway east milo pushed his seat back as far as it went howd it go with the lawyer i said more of the same doublespeak we got at first fidoosh i had to engage in the requisite pissing contest before he cooperated but once he gave in the guys inherent laziness took over more than happy to talk on the phone probably bill the estate for every second of it basically he confirmed everything anger had said ramp gets fifty thou melissa takes the rest mom inherits if anything happens to melissa if both of them go before melissas had kids all of it goes to charity any specific charities medical research i asked him to send me copies of all the documents he said hed need melissas written permission for that which i dont see as any big problem i also asked him if he had any idea how gina spent her allowance like anger he didnt seem to think a hundred and twenty grand was anything worth messing with traffic was light until a mile before the interchange where it started to curdle get off at ninth and take it to la said milo i followed his directions north on los angeles street drove through rundown blocks filled with fashion outlets shrieking bankruptcy bargains discount appliance stores importexport concerns and pay parking lots to the west a range of mirrorglass highrises rose like synthetic mountains built on soft soil federal redevelopment funds and pacific rim optimism to the east was the industrial belt that divided downtown from boyle heights downtown was doing its usual splitpersonality routine fasttalking fastwalking power dressers wannabee tycoons and stiff lipped secretaries sharing turf with blearyeyed filthencrusted human shells transporting their life stories in purloined shopping carts and verminous bedrolls at sixth street the shells took over hordes of them congregating on street corners slumping in the doorways of boardedup businesses sleeping in the shadows of overflowing dumpsters i caught a red light at fifth the taxi in the next lane shot the light and nearly ran over a longhaired smudgeeyed blond man dressed in a sleeveless tshirt and torn jeans the man began cursing at the top of his lungs and with scabbed tattooed hands slapped the trunk of the cab as it sped on two uniformed cops issuing a jaywalking citation to a young mexican girl across the street paused to observe the tantrum then returned to their paperwork half a block later i saw two skinny black men in baseball caps and topcoats veer off the sidewalk and come facetoface under the sagging portico of a halfdemolished sro hotel they lowered their heads and did a palmslapping routine so wellcoordinated it could have been choreographed by balanchine then one man flashed a small wad of bills and the other bent quickly and retrieved something from his sock a quick exchange and the two of them were on their way heading in opposite directions the entire transaction had taken ten seconds milo saw me watching ah free enterprise theres the place park wherever you can he was pointing to a wide flatroofed threestory building on the east side of the street the ground floor was faced with offwhite tiles that brought to mind a bus station lavatory the upper facade was paleaqua stucco a single row of barred windows ran along the top of the first story too high to be reached from the street the rest of the structure was a blank slab four or five men mostly black all ragged congregated drowsily near the front door which was topped by a dead neon decostyle sign that read eternal hope mission all the parking spots in front of the building were taken so i drove up ten yards and nosed into a space behind a winnebago with mobile medical painted on the back a larger and more energetic group of derelicts hovered nearby at least two dozen men and three or four women yapping and shuffling and rubbing their arms as i turned off the ignition i noticed it wasnt health care they were after a loose line had formed in front of an accordiongrated storefront another neon sign these tubes flashing for plasma milo removed a piece of paper from his pocket unfolded it and placed it in the sevilles front window a by card reading lapd vehicle in service be sure to lock he said slamming his door next time we take yours i said watching a bald eyepatched man engage in an angry conversation with a dead elm tree you did it the man kept repeating slapping the trunk of the tree every third or fourth utterance the palms of his hands were bloody but there was a smile on his face no way theyd eat mine said milo cmon the men hanging out in front of the mission noticed us long before we got to the front door and stepped aside their shadows and their stench lingered several of them looked hungrily at my shoes brown loafers purchased a month ago that still looked new i thought how far would go in this neighborhood inside the building was overheated and brightly lit the front room was large aqua crowded with men sitting and lying across randomly placed green plastic chairs the floors were blackandgray linoleum the plaster bare except for a single wooden crucifix tacked high to the welcoming wall more body odor mixed with disinfectant the bilious reek of stale vomit and the suety smell of something simmering in broth a young black man in a white polo shirt and tan slacks circulated among the men carrying a clipboard and chained pen and a handful of brochures a name tag above the tiger embroidered on his chest said gilbert johnson student volunteer he made his way among the men consulting the board from time to time stopping and bending to talk to someone handing out a leaflet once in a while he got a response none of the men moved much no conversation that i could see but there was still noise from afar metallic rattles and machine pulses and a rhythmic baritone drone that had to be prayer i thought of a depot filled with travelers whod lost their way milo caught the young black mans eye the man frowned and came over can i help you on the clipboard was a list of names some of them followed by check marks im looking for joel mccloskey johnson sighed he was in his early twenties had broad features asian eyes a cleft chin and skin not that much darker than glenn angers tan again is he here youll have to speak to father tim first one second he disappeared down a hallway to the right of the crucifix and came back almost immediately with a thin white man in his early thirties wearing a black shirt clerical collar and white jeans over hightop blackandwhite basketball shoes the priest had jug ears short lightbrown hair a wispy drooping mustache and skinny hairless arms tim andrus he said in a soft voice i thought it was all cleared up with joel just a few more questions said milo andrus turned to johnson why dont you get back to bedcount gilbert its going to be tight tonight well need to be really accurate sure thing father johnson shot a quick look at milo and me then returned to the men several of them had turned around and were staring at us the priest gave them a smile that wasnt reciprocated turning to us he said the police were here quite a while last night and i was assured everything had been taken care of like i said father just a few more questions this kind of thing is very disruptive not so much for joel hes patient but the rest of the men most of them have had experiences with the police lots of them are mentally disturbed the upset in routine patient said milo good of him andrus gave a short hard laugh his ears had turned scarlet i know what youre thinking officer another bleedingheart liberal dogooder and maybe i am but that doesnt mean im unaware of joels history when he came here six months ago he was totally forthright he hasnt forgiven himself for what he did all those years ago and it was a terrible thing so of course i had my reservations about allowing him to serve but if i stand for anything its the power of forgiveness the right to be forgiven so i knew i couldnt turn him away and over the past six months hes proved me right no ones served more selflessly hes not the same man he was twenty years ago good for him said milo but wed still like to talk to him she still hasnt shown up the woman he burned not yet im so sorry im sure joel is too why he express his regrets father he still bears the burden of what he did never stops blaming himself talking to the police brought it all back he didnt sleep at all last night was in the chapel on his knees i found him and we knelt there together but he couldnt have had anything to do with her disappearance hes been here all week never left the building working double shifts i can attest to that what kind of work does he do anything we need for the past week its been kitchen and latrine duty he requests latrine duty would do it full time he have any friends andrus hesitated before answering friends hed hire to do wrong thats not what i asked father but now that you mention it yeah andrus shook his head joel knew thats exactly the way the police would think he hired someone to sin once before therefore it was inevitable that hed do it again best predictor of the futures the past said milo andrus touched his clerical collar and nodded its an incredibly difficult job you do officer a vital job god bless all honest policemen but one of the side effects can be fatalism a belief that nothing ever changes for the better milo looked around at the men on the plastic chairs the few who were still staring turned away you get to see much change around here father andrus twisted one end of his mustache enough he said to maintain my faith mccloskey one of those whos maintained your faith the flush spread from the priests ears to his neck ive been here five years officer believe me im not naäive i dont take convicted felons off the street and expect them to turn into someone like gilbert but gilberts had a good home nurturance education hes starting from a different baseline someone like joel has to earn my trust earn a higher trust it did help that he brought references from where father other missions here in town no arizona and new mexico he worked with the indians put six years of his life into helping others paying his legal debt and enlarging himself as a human being those he worked with had only good things to say about him milo said nothing the priest smiled and yes that did help him obtain parole but he came here as a free man officer in a legal sense he works here because he chooses to not because he has to and in answer to your question about friends he has none sticks to himself denies himself worldly pleasures a very tough cycle of work and prayer constitutes his entire life sounds pretty darn saintly said milo anger tightened the priests face he struggled to fight it and managed to put on a calm expression but when he spoke his voice was constricted he had nothing to do with that poor womans disappearance i really dont see why theres a need to that poor woman has a name said milo gina marie ramp im aware of tha shes been sticking to herself too father cut off from worldly pleasures but in her case its not out of choice for twenty years since the day mccloskeys hired creep destroyed her face shes been living up in a room too scared to go out into the world no parole for her father so im sure you can understand why lots of people are upset at the fact that shes disappeared and i hope youll find it in your heart to forgive me if i try to get to the bottom of it even if it means inconveniencing mr mccloskey andrus bowed his head and clasped his hands in front of him for a moment i thought he was praying but he looked up and his lips were still all the color was gone from his face forgive me officer its been a hard week two men died in their beds two more were sent over to county general with suspected tuberculosis he cocked his head toward the men in the chairs weve got a hundred more heads than beds no letup in sight and the archdiocese wants me to raise a larger share of my own funds his shoulders dropped one searches for small victories ive been trying to think of joel as one maybe he is said milo but wed still like to talk to him the priest shrugged come ill take you to him hed never asked to see id didnt even know our names the first door in the hall led to an enormous dining hall where food smells finally overtook the stink of unwashed bodies wooden picnic tables covered by peacockblue oilcloth were arranged in tandem creating five long rows men sat hunched over their food cradling their plates protectively prison dining spooning and chewing nonstop with all the joy of windup toys along the back wall was a steam table fronted by a glass partition and aluminum counter men were lined up holding their plates out oliver twist style three figures dressed in white shirts and aprons and hairnets ladled out food father andrus said wait here please and we stood by the door as he walked behind the steam table and said something to the middle server still working the man nodded handed his ladle to the priest and stepped backward father andrus began distributing food the man in white wiped his hands on his apron stepped around the table through the line and came toward us he was about five five with a stoop that robbed him of an inch he couldnt spare the apron reached below his knees and was stained with food he shuffled barely raising his feet from the linoleum and his arms remained at his sides as if glued there strands of white hair straggled from under the hairnet and adhered to a pasty moist forehead the face below was long and sallow thin yet flabby an aquiline nose had conceded defeat to gravity white eyebrows no fat under his chin but a flap of loose flesh shook as he came closer his eyes were hooded dark deepset very tired he walked up to us expressionless and said hello in a flat phlegmy voice mr mccloskey nod im joel listless open pores on nose and cheeks deep crevices flanking a downturned drylipped mouth eyes nearly shut under the heavy lids yellowish scleras surrounding nearly black irises i wondered when hed last had a liverfunction test were here to talk about gina ramp joel she hasnt been found a statement no she hasnt any theories youd like to share about what might have happened to her mccloskeys eyes shifted to one of the tables some of the men had stopped eating others cast covetous glances at the untouched food could we talk in my room sure joel he shuffled out the door and turned right into the corridor we passed dormitories crammed with folding cots some of them occupied and a closed door marked infirmary moans of pain filtered through plywood and echoed along the hall mccloskey turned toward the sound briefly but didnt break step redirecting his gaze forward he shuffled toward a brownpainted staircase at the back of the hall the treads were covered with hard rubber and the banister felt greasy we followed his steady slow climb up three flights now the disinfectant smell triumphed just off the landing on floor three was another closed door taped with a piece of shirt cardboard joel was written on it in black marker the knob had a keyhole but he turned it and the door opened he held it and waited for us to enter the room was half the size of gina ramps closet no more than eight by eight with a cot covered by a gray wool blanket a wooden nightstand painted white and a narrow threedrawer woodgrain chest a bible sat atop the drawer along with a hot plate a can opener a cellophanewrapped crackerandpeanutbutter combo a halfempty jar of pickled beets and a tin of vienna sausage a calendar painting of a haloed jesus looked down approvingly on the cot a yellowed flyspecked shade was half drawn on a single barred window beyond the bars was a wall of gray brick light came from a bare bulb in the center of a ceiling spotted with mildew barely enough room to stand i felt like holding on to something but didnt want to touch anything mccloskey said sit if you want milo looked at the cot and said thats okay the three of us remained standing close together but miles apart like subway straphangers resolute upon isolation milo said any theories joel mccloskey shook his head ive thought about it a lot since the other police were here i hope what happened is she got well enough to go out by herself and and what and liked it you want the best for her do you nod now that youre a free man and the state cant tell you what to do a faint smile formed on mccloskeys pale lips the corners of his mouth were crusted with something white and flaky something funny joel freedom thats long gone for gina too mccloskey closed his eyes opened them sat heavily on the cot removed his hairnet and rested his brow in one hand the crown of his head was bald the hair around it white and gray cut short and spiky it might have looked fashionable on an eighteenyearold melrose marauder on an old man it resembled exactly what it was a doityourself job old man fiftythree he looked seventy what i want doesnt matter he said not unless youre still after her joel the jaundiced eyes squeezed shut again the neckflap trembled i wasnt no im not not what mccloskey held the hairnet with both hands fingers poking through the mesh stretching it after her a subwhisper were you starting to say you never were after her joel no i mccloskey scratched his head then shook it it was a long time ago sure was said milo but history has a way of repeating itself no said mccloskey very quietly but with force no never my life is what over everythings out whats out joel mccloskey put one hand on his gut the fire the feelings the hand dropped all i do is wait wait for what joel peace blank space a fearful glance at milo then over at the picture of jesus pretty religious guy are you joel it helps helps what waiting milo bent his knees cupped his hands on them and lowered his face until it was nearly level with mccloskeys whyd you burn her joel mccloskeys hands began to shake he said no then crossed himself why joel whatd she do to make you hate her so much no cmon joel what would it hurt to tell after all these years headshakes i its not not what no i sinned confess your sin joel no please tears more trembling isnt confession part of salvation joel full confession mccloskey licked his lips put his hands together and mumbled something milo bent lower whats that joel done my confession have you nod mccloskey swung his legs onto the bed and lay down on his back arms folded over his chest staring up at the ceiling mouth agape beneath the apron his trousers were ancient tweed tailored for a man thirty pounds heavier and two inches taller the cuffs were frayed and rimmed stiff with black grime the soles of his shoes were perforated in several places and clotted with dried food gray yarn peeked through some of the holes bare flesh through others i said for you it may be all in the past but understanding it would help her and her daughter after all these years the whole familys still trying to comprehend mccloskey stared at me his eyes moved back and forth as if following traffic his lips moved soundlessly deliberation for a moment i thought he was going to open up then he gave his head a violent shake sat up untied his apron and slipped it over his head his shirt bagged on him undoing the top three buttons he pulled the fabric apart and exposed a hairless chest hairless but not unmarked most of his skin was the color of spoiled milk but a splotch of pink puckered flesh twice as wide as a hand gnarled as briar covered most of his left breast the nipple was gone in its place was a glossy clabbered depression scar streaks flowed from the primary splash like rosy paint ending midway down his rib cage he stretched the shirt farther thrust the ruined tissue forward a heartbeat pulsed the lumpy mound very fast his face was white drawn anointed with sweat someone do that to you at quentin said milo mccloskey smiled and looked back at jesus again a smile of pride i would take her pain away and eat it he said swallow it and let it be me all of it everything he placed one hand on his chest crossed the other arm over it sweet lord he said the sacrament of pain then he began to mumble in something that sounded like latin milo looked down at him mccloskey kept praying have a nice day joel said milo when mccloskey didnt respond he said have a nice wait no break in the whitehaired mans benedictions all this selfflagellation notwithstanding joel if theres something you could be doing to help us find her your salvations not worth a goddam mccloskey looked up just for a second the yellow eyes filled with terror the panic of someone whod wagered everything on a deal gone very sour then he dropped to his knees so hard it had to hurt and resumed his supplication as we drove away milo said so whats the diagnosis pathetic if what we just saw was real thats what im asking was it i cant be sure i said my instinct is to assume someone whod hire a hit man wouldnt balk at a bit of theatrics but something about him was believable yeah he said i thought so too would you call him schizophrenic i didnt see any overtly disturbed thinking but he didnt say much so maybe i drove half a block pathetic fits better than anything technical what do you think drove him that far down drugs booze prison guilt singly or in combination or all of the above boy he said smiling you sound like a hard guy i looked out the car window at the derelicts and junkies and bag ladies urban zombies squandering their allotment of breath on a wetbrained haze a very old man was sleeping on the curb dirtcaked belly up snoring through rotted gums or maybe he wasnt old at all must be the environment miss the green hills of san labrador no i said realizing it as the words left my mouth how about something in the middle how about he let out a tensionsloughing laugh it wasnt enough and he ran his hand over his face drummed the dashboard opened the window and closed it and stretched his legs without attaining comfort his chest i said think it was selfinflicted cross his heart and hope to die thats obviously what he wanted us to think the sacrament of pain shit growling with contempt but he looked ill at ease i made a stab at mind reading if hes still into pain he might still be into inflicting it on others he nodded all the guilty talk and praying the guy told us exactly nothing so maybe he isnt all that fucked up mentally my instinct doesnt yell prime suspect but id hate to be caught in an awshucks situation if our combined hunch quotient turns out to be low so whats next first find me a phone booth i wanna call in see if anythings turned up on the lady if it hasnt lets go talk to bayliss the probation officer hes retired i know i got his home address before i came by middleclass neighborhood you should feel comfortable i found a phone booth near the childrens museum and waited in a noparking zone as milo used it he was on the line long enough for two meter maids to drive by prepare to cite me only to be held at bay by the lapd cardboard most fun id had in a long time i savored it while watching parents herd their young toward the entrance to the museum milo came back jingling change and shaking his head nothing whod you speak to highway patrol again then one of chickerings lackeys and melissa hows she doing i said pulling into traffic still hyper making calls she said one of the gabneys phoned just a while ago the husband expressing concern the goose with the golden egg i said planning on telling melissa about the cassatt any reason to i thought about that not that i can see no use getting her riled up about something else i told her about mccloskey that from what i could see we were talking brain death but that id keep my eye on him it seemed to calm her down placebo got anything stronger i picked up the harbor freeway at third switched to the west and exited at fairfax heading north milo directed me to crescent heights then farther north just past olympic where i turned left on commodore sloat passed a block of office buildings then entered the carthay circle district a treeshaded enclave of small exceedingly wellkept spanish and mocktudor houses milo recited an address and i matched the numerals to a shakeroofed brick and madderstucco cottage set on a corner lot two blocks up the garage was a miniature clone of the house behind a hedgebordered cobbled drive a twentyyearold mustang white and shining sat in the drive moisture pools beneath the chassis and a neatly coiled garden hose rested near the rear tire the front yard was rich green lawn worthy of dublin edged with beds of flowers taller plantings of camellias azaleas hydrangeas agapanthus backing impatiens begonia and a white fringe of alyssum a cobbled path ran up the middle to the left was a weeping paperbirch triplet a highwaisted grayhaired man in khaki shirt blue pants and a pith helmet inspected its branches and plucked away dead leaves a chamois cloth hung out of one rear pocket we got out traffic from olympic was a baritone drone birds sang harmony not a particle of trash on the streets the man turned as we walked up the path sixtyish narrow shoulders long arms large hands long hounddog face under the helmet white mustache and goatee blackframed eyeglasses it was only when we were a few feet away that i realized he was africanfeatured skin as light as mine dotted with freckles eyes goldenbrown the color of schooldesk oak one hand remained on the tree as he watched us he lowered it ground a birch cone between his fingers the particles showered to the ground gilbert bayliss said milo whos asking my names sturgis im a detective private working on the disappearance of mrs gina ramp several years ago she was victimized by someone you used to handle at the parole department joel mccloskey good old joel said bayliss removing his hat his hair was a thick nappy saltandpepper cap private eye huh milo nodded for the time being on leave from lapd voluntary not exactly bayliss peered at milo sturgis i know that name know your face too milo didnt move a muscle bayliss said i got it youre the one hit the other cop on tv something about interdepartmental intrigue news never did make clear what it was all about not that i want to know im out of all that congratulations said milo earned it so how long they cooling you out for six months paid or unpaid unpaid bayliss clucked his tongue so in the meantime youre paying bills i wasnt allowed to do that one thing that bothered me about the job no room to expand opportunities how do you like it so far its a job bayliss looked at me whos this another lapd bad boy alex delaware i said dr delaware said milo hes a psychologist treating mrs ramps daughter melissa dickinson i said you talked to her about a month ago i seem to remember something like that said bayliss psy chologist huh i wanted to be one of those once figured what i was doing was mostly psychology anyway why not get paid better took some classes at cal state got enough credits for a masters but no time to write a thesis or take the exams so that was that he peered at me more closely whatre you doing running around with him psychoanalyzing everyone we just paid a visit to mccloskey i said detective sturgis thought it might be useful for me to observe him aha said bayliss good old joel you seriously suspect hes been up to something just checking him out said milo getting paid by the hour and piling up those hours dont get yourself worked up soldier i dont have to talk to you if i dont want i realize that mr twentythree years i spent following routine taking orders from people a heck of a lot stupider than me working toward a twentyfiveyear pension so that my wife and i could go traveling two years short she had the bad manners to leave me massive stroke got one kid in the army over in germany married a german girl never comes home so the last two years ive been making my own rules last six months ive been getting good at it understand milo gave a long slow nod bayliss smiled put his helmet back on just as long as weve got a meeting of the minds on that we do said milo if theres something you can tell us about mccloskey that might help us find mrs ramp id be much obliged good old joel said bayliss he touched his goatee stared at milo you know there were plenty of times during those twentyfive years that i wanted to punch someone never did it cause of the pension the trip the wife and i were going to take when you punched that paperpusher it made me smile i was in a low mood thinking about things that had happened and those that hadnt you gave me a chuckle lasted through the evening thats why i remember you he smiled funny thing your walking up like this must be destiny come on in the house his living room was dark neat furnished with heavy carved pieces not quite old or good enough to be antiques lots of doilies and figurines and feminine touches on the wall above the mantel were framed blackandwhite photos of big bands and jazz combos the musicians all black and one closeup of a young cleanshaven pomaded bayliss dressed in a white dinner jacket and formal shirt and tie and holding a slide trombone he said that was my first love trained classically at juilliard but no one was hiring colored trombonists so i settled for swing and bebop did the rib circuit traveled with skootchie bartholomew for five years ever hear of him i shook my head he smiled no one did tell the truth the band wasnt that good shooting heroin before every gig and thinking they were playing better than they actually were i didnt want to live like that so i quit came out here tooted for whoever would listen did a few record things you listen to magic love by the sheiks some of that other doowop foolishness thats me in the background finally got a trial run with lionel hampton he went over and touched one of the photos this is me first row that band was all power really heavy on the brass playing with em was like trying to ride a big brass hurricane but i did okay lionel kept me on then the bigband market dried up and lionel took the whole outfit to europe and japan i didnt see any point in that went back to school took the civil service havent played since my wife liked the pictures ive got to take them down get some real art you want some coffee both of us declined sit if you want we did bayliss settled in a softlooking floral chair with lace antimacassars on the arms good old joel he said wouldnt worry too much about him in terms of major felonies whys that said milo hes a nothing bayliss tapped his head nothing there when i read his file i expected some serious psychopath then this skinny little nothing walks in all yessirs and nosirs not an ounce of fight left in him and im not talking bootlicking not the usual routine you get from your active psychopath you know how they try to come across like good boys every joker i dealt with over twentyfive years thought he was oscarquality smarter than everyone else just had to put on the act and no oned see through him thats the truth said milo even though it rarely works yeah funny how they never stop to think about why theyre spending most of their lives in sixbysix cells but old joel was different this was no act the man had everything stripped out of him course if you just saw him you know that how often did he come to see you i said just a few times four or five by the time he got to la he really wasnt on official parole the department requested he check in until he got settled covering its derriére just in case theyre really sensitive to playing it by the rules so if something goes wrong and the victims family gets on geraldo they can produce paperwork and show theyve done the right thing so it was really more a formality he could have ignored it but he didnt showed up once a week we spent our ten minutes and that was it tell the truth i wish id had more like him toward the end my caseload was sixtythree crooks and some of them really did bear looking into milo said paroles usually three years how come he did six part of a deal after he got out of quentin he asked to leave the state the department said okay if he could obtain structured placement and double his time he found some sort of indian reservation out in arizona i think did three years there then moved somewhere else another state i dont recall exactly and did three there why the move i said from what i recall he said the first place was funded by a grant that got canceled so he had to move on the second place was catholic i guess he figured unless the pope canceled hed be okay why the move to la i asked him about that and he didnt have much of an answer not one that made sense anyway something about original sin a lot of mumbojumbo about salvation basically what i think he was getting at was that hed sinned here against your missing lady so he had to be a good boy here to even the score with the almighty i didnt push him on it like i said he wasnt even obligated to show up it was a formality any idea what he did with his time said milo far as i know he was over at that mission full time cleaning toilets and washing dishes eternal hope yeah thats the one found himself another catholic place from what i could tell he never left his room never consorted with known felons or used dope the priest confirmed it over the phone if ida had sixtythree like him my job would have been a breeze did he ever talk about his crime i said i talked to him about it first time he came in read from his sentencing report the judge calling him a monster and all that i liked to do that with all of them at the outset establish some ground rules let them know i knew who i was dealing with eliminate a lot of nonsense most of them leave stir still claiming theyre innocent as baby jesus you try to break through that delusion get some insight going if theres gonna be any hope like doing psychoanalysis right i nodded did mccloskey develop any insight said milo didnt need to he came in breathing guilt told me straight out he was worthless and didnt deserve to live i told him that was probably true then read the sentencing report out loud to him he just sat there and took it like it was some kind of medical treatment that was for his own good about as close to a walking dead man as id ever seen after a couple of times with him i found myself actually getting sorry for him the way you feel sorry for a dog thats been hit by a car and thats something that doesnt come easy to me ive worked a long time fighting my sympathies he ever say why he burned her said milo nope said bayliss and i asked him about that too because his file said hed never owned up to any motive but he didnt have much to say kind of mumbled and wouldnt get into that a scratch of the goatee bayliss removed his glasses wiped them with a handkerchief and replaced them i tried to work on him a bit think i phrased it to him in terms of his duty to her how once hed done a crime like that she owned him in a spiritual sense i was trying to appeal to his religious side whenever they tried the religious stuff i turned it right back on them but it didnt work with him he just sat there and stared at the floor it was all i could do to keep a conversation going for the ten minutes and he wasnt faking it after twentyfive years i can tell were talking nothing total zombie any idea why i said what got him to that state bayliss shrugged youre the psychologist okay said milo thanks anything else nothing whats the story with the lady she left her house drove off and hasnt been heard from since left when yesterday bayliss frowned one day gone and they hire a pi its not your typical situation said milo shes been housebound for a long time hardly left her home how longs a long time since he burned her shes been severely agoraphobic since then i said oh thats too bad he looked as if he meant it yeah i can see why her folks would be worried we walked back outside bayliss looked thoughtful he accompanied us all the way to the car hope you find her soon he said if there was something i could tell you about joel that would help you i would but i doubt he has anything to do with it whys that said milo inertia the dead zone hes like a snake that got stepped on one time too many and lost its poison i drove home on olympic though his seat was pushed all the way back milo positioned himself with his knees drawn up opting for discomfort looking out the window at roxbury i said whats up he kept his eyes on the landscape guys like mccloskey who the hell knows whats real and whats not bayliss is so sure the assholes run out of steam but he admitted he barely knew him basically he took mccloskey at face value because the sleaze showed up voluntarily and didnt make waves your typical bureaucratic response shit flushes through the system and as long as the pipes dont back up no one cares you think mccloskey bears further watching if the lady doesnt show up real soon and no new leads develop im gonna mosey on by again try to catch him off guard but before i do that im gonna get to a phone call in some markers and try to find out if the scumbags been consorting with any known felons you got anything planned for yourself nothing urgent if you feel like it take a run out to the beach check out the second house just in case shes bunked out there and not telling anyone its a long drive and i dont want to kill that much time course i dont think itll lead anywhere sure heres the address he said i took the slip of paper and continued to drive he looked at his watch might as well leave soon while the suns still out play sleuth and work on your tan hell take out your boogie board and catch a wave watson goes gnarly something like that no messages at home i stayed long enough to give the fish a heavy feed hoping to keep them away from the few egg clusters that remained then back on sunset heading west by twothirty day at the beach i pretended it was going to be fun i hit pacific coast highway saw blue water and brown bodies robin and i had done this drive so many times linda and i had done it once the second time wed been out together alone was different i stayed away from those thoughts paid attention to the malibu coastline never the same always inviting kama sutra real estate probably why people went into hock in order to get a piece of it living with black flies and corrosion and highway mayhem and waxing amnesiac about the inevitable cycle of mud slides fires and killer storms arthur dickinsons piece was choice five miles up from point dume past the sprawling public beach at zuma and a left turn onto broad beach road just past the rodeo rink at trancas canyon western malibu where the tacky motels and surf shops have long disappeared ranches and tree farms fill the landside of pacific coast highway and the dinner hour is dominated by sunsets of unlikely hue the address milo had given me took me to the far end of the road a half mile of white silicon heaped into sinewave dunes fiftybyahundredfoot mounds of dubious geology going for four million plus at that price architecture becomes a competitive sport the dickinsonramp place was a onestory saltbox with silvered wood sides and a flat brown gravel roof behind a low chainlink fence that provided no privacy and gave the public visual access to the beach the house was flanked on both sides by freeform twostory ice cream scoops one was vanilla stucco still under construction the other pistachio trimmed with raspberry both lots were blocked by prisonbar electric gates green tenniscourt tarp behind vanilla a for sale sign in front of pistachio alarm warnings on both but no security system for the saltbox i lifted the latch and walked right in no landscaping either just a thorny mess of orange bougainvillea climbing part of the fence instead of a garage a cement pad over sand wide enough for two vehicles a yamcolored vw van with a ski rack on its roof was parked carelessly taking up both widths nowhere to conceal a rollsroyce i approached the house absorbing the heat of the sand through the soles of my shoes still wearing a jacket and tie and feeling like a salesman for something i could smell the tang of the ocean see the hightide spray percolate over the dunes a vformation of brown pelicans cut through the sky a hundred feet beyond the breakers someone was windsurfing the front door was brineeaten pine with a knob that had greened and crusted the windows were cloudy and moist to the touch and someone had fingerwritten clean me on one of the panes glass wind chimes dangled over the doorway swaying and striking one another but the roar of the ocean killed their song i knocked got no answer knocked again waited and went over to one of the streaked windows single room unlit hard to make out details but i squinted and discerned a small openshelved kitchen to the left combo bedroom and living area filling the rest of the space futon unrolled on a dull pine floor a few pieces of furniture bargain rattan with hawaiian print cushions beanbag chair plainwrap coffee table on the beach side sliding glass doors led to a shaded patio through them i could see a couple of folding lounges a rise of dune and tealcolored water a man stood out on the sand directly in front of the patio knees bent back rounded curling a barbell i walked around todd nyquist the tennis instructor was braced ankledeep in the sand wearing skimpy black briefs a leather powerlifters girdle and fingerless weight gloves straining and grimacing as he hefted and lowered the iron discs on the bar were the size of manhole covers two on each end his eyes were clenched shut his mouth was open and his long yellow hair was wet and limp and drooping down his back sweating and grunting he kept lifting keeping his back immobile putting all the strain on his arms curling in rhythm to the beat that blared from a boombox near his feet rock n roll thin lizzie the boys are back in town manic beat it had to be torture keeping up with it nyquists biceps were engorged flesh carvings he did six more solid reps then a few shaky ones until the music stopped letting out a hoarse cry that could have been pain or triumph he bent his knees further and with his eyes still closed lowered the barbell into the sand he exhaled noisily began to straighten shook his head and sprayed sweat the beach was nearly empty despite the weather only a handful of people strolled along the shoreline mostly with dogs i said hello todd he hadnt come fully upright and the surprise nearly knocked him off his feet he recovered gracefully planting his soles then bouncing like a dancer opening his eyes wide he stared processed and gave a wide smile of recognition the doctor right i met you over at the big house alex delaware i came closer and held out my hand my shoes filled with sand he looked at his gloved hands and kept them up in the air wouldnt if i were you pretty rank doc i lowered mine just doing my pumps he said what brings you out here looking for mrs ramp here he seemed genuinely baffled theyre looking for her everywhere todd asked me to come down here and check thats really weird he said what is uh the whole thing her disappearing it really is freaky where could she be thats what were trying to find out yeah right well you wont find her here thats for sure shes never been here not once at least not since ive been living here he turned toward the ocean stretched and inhaled can you imagine owning a place like this and never being here it is gorgeous i said how long have you been living here year and a half you rent the place he smiled wider as if proud to possess some important secret removing the gloves he fluffed his hair more sweat droplets flew its a trade thing he said tennis and personal training for mr r in return for a place to stay but its not really my crib mostly im other places traveling around last year i went on two cruises up to alaska and down to cabo did an exercise class for old ladies i also give lessons at the brentwood country club and ive got lots of friends in the city i sleep here maybe once or twice a week sounds like a good deal it is do you know what this place would rent for even being dinky five thousand a month try ten for an allyearround eighteen to twenty during the summer and thats with the heat not even working but mr and mrs r theyve been really cool about letting me stay here when i want just as long as i make the drive over to smogsville and give mr r a good workout when he wants he never comes here his smile eroded not really why should he no reason it just seems like a good place for a workout we heard female conversation and turned toward it two stringbikinied girls around eighteen or nineteen were walking a sheepdog the dog kept veering away from the water tugging on its leash making the girl on the other end work she fought for a while finally gave up and let the dog lead her diagonally across the beach the other girl jogged along the dog stopped straining when it reached the property line of the vanilla scoop the three of them headed our way nyquist hadnt taken his eyes off them both had manes of long thick suncoarsened hair one blonde one redhead tall and longlegged with perfect thighs and laughing california girl faces straight out of a soft drink commercial the blondes bikini was white the redheads acid green when they were a few feet away the dog stopped and coughed and began shaking itself the redhead bent and petted it revealing heavy freckled breasts nyquist whispered whoa raising his voice yo traci maria the girls turned hey he said still shouting hows it going ladies fine todd said the redhead hey todd said the blonde nyquist stretched and grinned and rubbed a washboard abdomen looking good ladies whatsamatter old bernie still afraid of the water yeah said the redhead what a chicken to the dog arent you baby isnt bernie just a little old wussy chickendog as if comprehending the insult the dog turned away kicked sand and coughed again hey said nyquist sounds like hes got a cold naw hes just chicken said the redhead vitamin cll do something for that and b crush it up and put it in his chow whos this todd said the blonde a new friend friend of the landlords oh said the redhead smiling she looked at the blonde then at me gonna raise todds rent i smiled nyquist said one sec doc and bounded over to the girls putting his arms around them he drew them in as if for a football huddle they seemed surprised but were pliant he muttered to them smiling all the while rubbing the back of the blondes neck massaging the redheads waist the dog nosed his ankle but he ignored it the girls looked uncomfortable but nyquist seemed oblivious to that too finally they drew away nyquist held on to their wrists for a moment let go stretched his grin patted both their rumps as they ran off the dog followed lumbering he came back pardon the interlude got to keep the wenches in line aiming for sexual bravado but coming across too strong almost caricaturist it reminded me of his interaction with gina a couple of days ago nuances of tension that i hadnt thought much of at the time i could handle a pepsi mrs r or anything else you got thats cold and sweet ill get madeleine to fix you something older woman young stud tennis for hubby other kind of lessons for the lady of the house hardly original but people so seldom were when they transgressed i said any idea where mrs r might be todd no he said scrunching his face its really a mystery i mean where could she go being afraid and all that she ever talk to you about her fears no we not at all but hanging around someones house you just pick stuff up he glanced toward the house wanna have a beer or something no thanks got to be heading back bummer he said but he looked relieved you look in pretty good shape what do you do in terms of workout bit of running how much six to ten miles a week better watch it runnings ultra highimpact four times your weight every stride bad for the joints bad for the spine too ive got a crosscountry ski machine now excellent the ultimate aerobic if you alternate that with some musclelengthening weighttraining youll be doing yourself the ultimate favor thanks for the advice no prob if youre interested in some oneonone training give me a call i dont have any cards with me but you can always get me through mr and mrs through mr r shaking his head shee that was dumb sure hope they find her shes a real nice lady i walked back to the seville and took a few moments to look at the ocean the windsurfer was out of view but the pelicans had returned and were swooping and retrieving seagulls and terns followed in their wake content with the leavings a couple of oblong gray cigars were visible floating atop the horizon oil tankers making their way up the coast i wondered what it would be like to live at sea to be reminded constantly of insignificance and infinity before i could take that any further i heard engine noise then happy shouts that turned into hey mr landlord a white vw golf with the top down had pulled up next to me the blonde from the beach was behind the wheel a cigarette fuming between her fingers the redhead sat next to her eating from a box of fiddle faddle and holding an open can of coors both girls had put gauzy white shirts over their bathing suits but had left them unbuttoned bernie the dog sat in the back seat panting and lolling and looking motionsick hi said the redhead neat old car my dad had one just like it i smiled at the thought of the seville as an antique ten years old the day id bought it these two had probably been in third grade do you like garage it said the blonde uhhuh neat thanks you really with the landlord cause traci and me are looking for a place closer to the beach were across pch now down at las flores and the beach there isnt a keeper too wet lots of rocks were willing to work light au pair babysitting whatever like for a trade todd said hed help but we figure we can talk for ourself sorry i said i do know todds landlord but im not in the realestate business the blondes face managed to turn ugly while retaining its beauty what a firp told you mar it was total bullshit the redhead wrinkled her nose and looked injured i said whats the matter todd said the redhead he bullshat us royal how said you were a realestate stud and if we were nice to him hed talk to you about finding us a place here on broad we used to live hereau pairing for dave dumas and his wife when they rented last summer so people think we still live here and dont hassle us when we come down but we want to be right here all the time or at least somewhere dry dave dumas the basketball player yeah mr stretch shared giggles we took care of his kids said the blonde really big kids from a really big guy she laughed some more then turned abruptly serious wed really like to get back here to broad the beach is a total keeper and the concerts at the trancas café are heating up last week eddie van halen showed up to jam were willing to work said the redhead todd said he could get us a trade fagwuss said the blonde last time were nice to him she gunned the golfs engine the dog jerked in alarm i said what exactly did he want from you he was like act like we thought he was hot let him touch us in front of you turning to the redhead told you mar i was like sure todd you might ever be todds not hot in real life giggles all around the redhead picked a piece of popcorn out of the box and handed it back to the dog he likes it she said bernies got a sugar thing enjoy bernie i said walking over and petting the dog his fur was matted and clogged with salt and dirt as i rubbed his neck he whined with pleasure so todds no keeper i said a wary look came into the blondes eyes up close her face was hard ready to age already starting to leather from too much sun and risktaking youre not like a good friend of his or anything she said not at all i said i do know the people who own the house but i only met todd once before so youre not like the blonde smiled gave an arch look and raised her wrist limply traace thats like so ruude so said the blonde hes the one who does it he should be embarrassed i said todds gay for sure said the redhead a musclefag said the blonde wasted buff said the redhead the dog coughed she said dont stress out bern thats why it was rank said the blonde using us to make like hes into girls i mean maybe hes got a buff body but his heads not buff thats for sure how do you know hes gay i said well said the blonde laughing and gunning the engine again its not like we go around watching him do it or anything hes got guys coming in and out all the time said the redhead he says hes training them but one time i saw him and this guy holding hands and kissing rank said the blonde elbowing her friend you never told me yeah it was a long time ago when we were still with big dave big dave said the blonde giggling how long ago was that i said bafflement both of them looked as if they were struggling with a difficult word problem finally the redhead said a long time ago maybe five weeks buffy todd and this other guy were walking in back of the house right over there i was walking bernie she pointed to the cement pad and they touched their hands then the other guy got in his car white fivesixty sec with these brushedsteel custom wheels and todd leaned in and gave him a little kiss rank said the blonde kind of sweet actually said the redhead looking as if she meant it but the empathy didnt fit and she squirmed and burst into nervous laughter i said remember what this other guy looked like she shrugged he was old how old older than you even forties older maybe he was todds dad said the blonde smirking you can kiss your dad right mar maybe said the redhead little todd and his dad kissing they looked at each other shook their heads giggled some more no way said the redhead this was true love she gave a reflective look actually the old guy was kind of buff for an old guy kind of like tom selleck i said he had a mustache the redhead strained i think so maybe i just remember he reminded me of tom selleck an old tom selleck buff tan big chest how come said the blonde so many of them are buff what a waste its cause theyre rich trace said the redhead they can afford to buy special supplements get lipoedout whatever suck and tuck said the blonde touching her own flat midriff if i ever need that put me to sleep she stuck her hand in the box of fiddle faddle and groped around geez dont touch everything said the redhead tugging on the box the blonde held fast and said almonds smile here we go she pulled out a nut and placed it between her teeth looked at me flicked it with her tongue and bit down slowly i said that the last time you saw this old guy around five weeks yup said the redhead looking wistful its been a long time since we hit dry sand so said the blonde can you do anything for us like i said im not in the real estate business but i do know some people let me check around why dont you write down your names and numbers sure said the redhead beaming then she grew grave what is it no pen no prob i said resisting the impulse to wink i went back to the seville found a ballpoint and an old mechanics receipt in the glove compartment and handed it to her write on the back using the fiddle faddle box as a desk she wrote laboriously as the blonde looked on the dog planted a wet nose on the back of my hand and wheezed in gratitude when i rubbed him again here the redhead thrust the paper at me maria and traci looping script hearts over the is an address on flores mesa drive a exchange i smiled and said great ill do what i can in the meantime good luck weve already got it said the blonde got what said the redhead luck we always get what we want right mar giggles and a cloud of dust as the golf shot forward i watched them speed to the northern end of broad beach road and disappear it took a second to register that they were around melissas age i made a threepoint turn and headed back for the highway older man and young stud older man with a mustache and a tan lots of tan mustachioed gay men in la lots of white mercedes but if don ramp drove a white sec with brushedsteel wheels i was willing to go out on a limb and assume i joined the southbound traffic on pch and drove home assuming even without proof casting ramp as nyquists lover and recasting the tension that id witnessed between nyquist and gina another macho charade on his part anger on hers did she know did that have something to do with her hints about making a lifestyle change separate bedrooms separate bank accounts separate lives or had she known about ramp when shed married him why after living a bachelor life for so long had he married her ginas banker and lawyer seemed certain it hadnt been for money citing the prenuptial agreement as proof but prenuptials and wills could be contested and lifeinsurance policies could be taken out without bankers and lawyers being informed or perhaps inheritance had nothing to do with it maybe ramp simply needed a cover for the good conservative folks of san labrador hearth and home and a child who hated his guts what could be more allamerican i got home just after five milo was out hed recorded a new greeting on his machine no more misanthropy businesslike please leave your message i asked him to please call when he had a chance i phoned san labrador and got madeleine mademoiselle melissa was not feeling well she was sleeping non monsieur was not there either a catch in her voice click i paid bills straightened the house fed the fish some more and noticed that they looked tired especially the females did thirty minutes on the ski machine and showered next time i looked at my watch it was seventhirty friday night date night without thinking it through i called san antonio a man answered with a wary hello when i asked for linda he said whos this a friend from los angeles oh shes over at behar at the hospital her dad yeah this is conroy her uncle his brother im over from houston came down today alex delaware mr overstreet im a friend from la hope its nothing serious yeah well thats what id like to hope too but im sorry to say thats not the case my brother passed out this morning they revived him but it wasnt easy some kinda problem with

i called if theres anything i can do let me know ill be sure to do that sir thank you for offering click wrong reason to do it but i did it anyway hello alex how are you got a date tonight she laughed a date no just sitting here by the phone care to change your luck more laughter why did it sound so good hmm i dont know she said my mother always told me not to go out with any boy who didnt ask by wednesday night good old mom then again she was full of shit about lots of other things what time half an hour she came out of the front door of her studio just as i pulled in front of the building she was wearing a thin black silk turtleneck and tight black jeans tucked into black suede boots lips glossed eyes shadowed curls full and gleaming i wanted her badly before i could get out she opened her own door scooted next to me radiating heat one hand in my hair kissing me before i had a chance to catch my breath we necked fiercely she bit me a couple of times seemed almost angry just as i ran out of breath she broke it off and said whats for dinner i was thinking chinese thinking of all the times wed eaten takeout in bed of course we could call out for it and stay here never mind that i want a date we drove to a place in brentwood the standard mandarinszechuan menu and paper lanterns but always reliable and feasted for an hour then headed over to a comedy club in hollywood a lighthearted place we used to enjoy together neither of us had been there with anyone else the ambience was different now black felt walls murderous looking bouncers with ponytails and steroid complexions calcutta level density stale smoke and hostility tables crowded with heavyeyed nightcrawlers and their significant others coming down from one trip or another demanding an entertainmentfix or else the first few acts were raw meat for that crowd mumblemouthed novice standups reciting the stuff that had always cracked up their friends but didnt make the transition to sunset boulevard sad clowns veering wildly like drunks on ice skates staggering between silences more painful than any id encountered doing therapy and stutterbursts of manic word salad just before midnight things got more polished but no more friendly slick trendily dressed young men and women whod been shaped on the late night talk show lathe spitting out the fourletter wit they couldnt get away with on tv ragelaced relationship humor uglyspirited ethnic jokes screaming scatology had the city gotten meaner or had i just lost my edge i looked over at robin she shook her head we left this time she allowed me to open her door pressed herself against it the moment she was inside and stayed that way i began driving reached for her hand she squeezed mine a couple of times and let go sleepy i said no not at all everything okay uhhuh so where to do you mind just driving for a while not at all i was on fountain going west turning right on la cienega i crossed sunset up into the hollywood hills climbing slowly and steadily until i found myself on a series of narrow hairpin residential streets named after birds robin remained tight against the door like a nervous hitchhiker eyes shut not talking her face directed away from me she crossed her legs and placed one hand on her belly as if it ached a few moments later she put her head back and straightened her legs despite her denial of fatigue i wondered if shed fallen asleep but when i switched on the radio and found a late night jazz show she said thats nice i kept driving with no idea where i was going ended up somehow on coldwater canyon took it all the way to mulholland drive and turned left a bit of forest then clearings that revealed sheer cliff above the incandescent grid of the san fernando valley fifty square miles of lights and motion leering through nighthaze and treetops bright lights pseudo city being up here felt strangely adolescent mulholland was the quintessential parking spot as consecrated by hollywood how many makeout scenes had been filmed here how many splatter flicks i lowered my speed enjoying the view keeping my eyes out for dragracers and other nuisances robin opened her eyes why dont you pull over somewhere the first few turnoffs were occupied by other vehicles i found a eucalyptusshaded spot several miles from the coldwater junction parked and killed my lights not far from beverly glen just a quick southward dip and wed be home at least i would she was still up against the door looking out at the valley nice i said setting the emergency brake and stretching she smiled the stuff of picture postcards its good being with you i made another reach for her hand no return squeeze this time her skin was warm but inert so she said hows your friend in texas her dad took a turn for the worse hes in the hospital im so sorry she cranked open her window stuck her head out are you okay guess so she said pulling her head back in whyd you call me alex i was lonely i said without thinking not liking the pitiful sound of it but it seemed to cheer her she took my hand and played with my fingers i could use a friend too she said youve got one things have been rough i dont want to whine i know i have a tendency to do that and im fighting it i never thought of you as a whiner she smiled what is it i said dennis he used to complain that i whined well fuck him the churl he didnt just leave i kicked him out i said nothing i got pregnant and had an abortion it took me a week to decide that was what i was going to do when i told him he agreed right away offered to pay for it that made me angry that he had no conflict about it that it was so simple for him so i kicked him out suddenly she was out of the car walking around to the front and standing by the grille i got out and stood next to her the ground was thick with dead eucalyptus leaves the air smelled like cough drops a couple of cars drove by then silence then another headlight parade finally a stillness that endured when i found out she said i felt so strange disgusted at myself for being so careless happy that i was able to biologically and scared i remained silent dealing with my own feelings anger all the years wed been together the care wed taken sadness you hate me she said of course i dont i dont blame you robin it happens to other people she said she stepped toward the cliff i put both arms around her waist felt resistance and let go the procedure itself was nothing my obgyn did it right in the office she said wed caught it real early as if it were a disease vacuum pump and a receipt for insurance as a routine d and c later i had cramps but nothing terrible the old castagna pain threshold couple of days of tylenol then cold turkey shed slipped into a flat voice that unnerved me i said the main thing is youre okay and felt as if i were reading from a script melodrama at makeout mountain check your theater listings afterward she said i got paranoid what if the pump had done damage and i could never conceive again what if god punished me for killing what was inside me she took several steps to the side everyone talks about it so abstractly she said the paranoia lasted for a month i developed a rash convinced myself i was going to get cancer the doctor said i was fine and i believed her was okay for a few days then the feelings came back i fought them and won convinced myself i was going to live then i cried nonstop for another month wondering what might have been eventually that stopped too but some of that sadness stuck around in the background its still there sometimes when i smile i feel as if im really crying its like a hole in here prodding her abdomen right here i took hold of her shoulders and managed to turn her around pressed her face into my jacket with him dammit she said muffled by fabric then she drew away and forced herself to look at me he was fastfood something to fill space kind of obscene that it would happen with him huh like one of those horrible jokes they were telling tonight she was dryeyed my eyes began to hurt sometimes alex i still lie awake at night wondering its as if ive been sentenced to wondering we stood staring at each other another caravan of cars zoomed by some date huh she said whine whine whine stop i said im glad you told me are you yes i yes i am if you hate me i understand why should i hate you i said with sudden anger i had no claim on you it had nothing to do with me true she said i let go of her shoulders threw up my arms and let them fall i should have kept my mouth shut she said no i said its all right no its not not right at the moment i feel lousy mostly for what youve been through mostly okay for myself too for not being a part of your life when it happened she nodded mournfully embracing that bit of gloom you would have wanted me to keep it wouldnt you i dont know what i would have wanted its too theoretical and theres no sense flogging yourself over it you didnt commit any crime didnt i no i said taking hold of her shoulders again ive seen the real item i know the difference people being deliberately cruel being bestial to one another god knows how many times its happening right now down in that light show i pointed her toward the valley view she allowed herself to be molded the hell of it is i said the ones who should feel guilty the really bad ones never do its the good ones who torture themselves dont get sucked into that youre not doing anyone any favors by not drawing distinctions she looked up at me seemed to be listening i said you made a mistake and not an earthshaking one in the greater scheme of things youll recover youll go on if you want babies youll have them meanwhile try to enjoy life a little bit do you enjoy life alex i sure try thats why i ask goodlooking women out on dates she smiled a tear rolled down her cheek i put my arms around her from behind felt her belly toned muscle under a layer of softness i stroked it she cried when you called i was glad she said and worried about what that it would be just like a few days ago not that i didnt enjoy it god it was great first real pleasure id had in so long but afterwards i she put her hand over mine and pressed i guess what im saying is i could really use a friend right now more than a lover like i said youve got one i know she said hearing you seeing you like this i know i do she turned and we held each other a car sped by trapping us momentarily in its highbeams a teenage face appeared in the open window and shouted go for it dude we looked at each other and laughed she came back to the house with me and i ran her a hot bath she soaked for half an hour came out looking pink and drowsy we got into bed and played gin while absently attending to a onestar western on tv by am wed finished a dozen games six wins each it seemed as good a time as any to go to sleep no callback from milo on saturday no news from san labrador i phoned got madeleine again and was told melissa was still sleeping robin and i spent most of the day together brunch and groceryshopping at farmers market a drive out to the selfrealization fellowship in pacific palisades to look at the lake and the swans light dinner at a seafood place near sunset beach then back to her place by seven where i called in for messages and she played the tape on her machine nothing for me but a famous singer had called her three times an hour for the past three hours famous raspy baritone tight with panic emergency rob sunday concert in long beach just got back from a gig in miami humidity popped pattys bridge call me at the sunset marquis rob please rob i wont go anywhere she turned off the machine and said wonderful sounds pretty serious oh yeah when he calls himself instead of getting a roadie to do it that means nervous breakdown time whos patty one of his guitars fiftytwo martin dtwentyeight hes got two others laverne and i forgot the other theyre named after the andrews sisters who was the other andrews sister maxene right maxene patty and laverne and maxene all fiftytwos sequential serial numbers ive never heard three instruments sound so similar but of course he has to play patty tomorrow she shook her head and walked into the kitchenette something to drink nothing right now thanks sure looking edgy glancing back at the phone positive arent you going to call him back you dont mind i shook my head actually im a little tired youre wearing an old man out she was about to respond when the phone rang she answered it and said yes i just got in no its better if you bring it here i can do a better job here okay see you soon she hung up smiled and shrugged she walked me to the car we kissed lightly avoiding conversation and i left her to her work left myself to enjoy life but i was into a preaching mode not a practicing one and after driving a few blocks i pulled into a service station and used the pay phone to try milo again this time rick answered he just walked in alex and went right out said hed be tied up for a while but that you should call him hes got my car and the cellular phone heres the number i copied it down thanked him hung up and dialed milo picked up after the first ring sturgis its me whats up the car he said it was found a couple of hours ago out near san gabriel canyon morris dam what about no trace of her just the car does melissa know shes out here i brought her myself hows she doing she seems pretty shellshocked the paramedics looked at her said she was okay physically but to keep an eye on her any specific advice dealing with her just stay with her give me directions i shot onto the freeway at lincoln traffic was gummy and hottempered all the way to the east weekend partyers and rv jockeys coming and going but by glendale it had started to thin and by the time i reached the transition the highway was mine i drove faster than usual speeding along the northern rim of pasadena passing the onramp gina had probably taken two days ago lonely road made lonelier by the darkness separating the city from the chalky high desert at the base of the san gabriel mountains daylight would reveal budget housing developments industrial outcroppings an eventual decline to gravel pits and scrubby hills all of it hidden mercifully by a starless night a bad night to be looking for someone a mile before the highway exit i slowed down to get a look at the spot where the highway patrolman had seen the rollsroyce the freeway was bisected by windowhigh cement soundbarriers the only thing that would have been visible even to a car fanatics eye was the top of the unmistakable grille chased by a blur of lacquer amazing hed noticed anything but hed been right i exited onto azusa boulevard and drove through the outskirts of a town that looked as if it had never forgotten the fifties fullservice filling stations lodge halls small storefronts all dark occasional streetlamps brightened some of the signs tack and saddle christian books tax preparation a presenttense intrusion appeared at the end of the third block ampm minimart open for business but no one was buying and the clerk looked asleep i crossed a railroad track and route turned into san gabriel canyon road the seville bounced over old asphalt speeding through a neighborhood of sad little stucco houses and trailer parks insulated from the street by cinder block walls no graffiti guess that made it the country cars and pickups were parked in peewee front yards old cars and pickups nothing that would ever be a classic the rolls would have stuck out like frankness during election year as the road began to climb the houses gave way to larger parcels boarding stables and horse ranches behind stakeandpost fencing a park service sign a hundred yards up was toplit announcing the entrance to angeles crest national forest above small print fire and camping regulations an information booth just off the road was boarded up the air began to smell sweet before me was twolane asphalt cutting through granite bulk the rest darkness using my brights the speed bumps in the center of the road and blind faith to guide me i drove faster a couple of miles in i heard a deep mechanical stutter it grew louder deafening seemed to be descending upon me two sets of cherryred lights appeared at the top of my windshield then lowered and ranged directly in front of my field of vision before rising sharply and pulling ahead on a northward trajectory twin searchlights began scything the darkness highlighting treetop and fissure brushing over the mountainside exposing momentary flashes of shimmer and luster to the east water another peek of it around a curve then a crest of concrete concrete piers a sloping spillway i tried to follow the copters lightstrokes saw the dam rising a quarter mile above the water table roundedged wpa architecture a staked placard by the road morris dam and reservoir la flood maintenance district a long time since floods had needed to be maintained in southern california the current drought was four years running still the depth of the reservoir had to be substantial hundreds of millions of gallons inky and secretive milo had said to look for a utility road on the dam side the first two i passed were blocked by padlocked metal swing gates five miles later as the road looped sharply to accommodate the northern ridge of the reservoir i saw it sparking road flares flashing amber emergency lights atop orangeandwhite sawhorses a convention of vehicles some idling and huffing out white smoke azuza police blackandwhites la sheriffs three park service jeeps fire department paramedic van behind one of the jeeps a foreign contingent the bowlbutt of ricks white porsche and another white car mercedes sec brushedsteel wheels a sheriffs deputy stepped into the middle of the road and halted me young female blond ponytail a figure that lent the beige uniform more style than it deserved i stuck my head out the window sorry sir the roads closed im a doctor mrs ramps daughter is my patient i was asked to be here she asked me my name requested id to back it up after looking at my license she said one moment meantime why dont you turn off your engine sir stepping to the side of the road she talked into a handheld radio and returned nodding okay sir you can just leave your car right here with the keys in as long as you dont mind my driving it if i have to be my guest theyre all down there pointing to an open swinggate be careful its steep the path was a vehiclewide swath through mesquite and young conifers paved but a slight softness beneath my soles said it had been recent the blacktop provided some traction but i still had to walk sideways to maintain balance on the fiftydegree slope i sidestepped my way down a quarter mile before i saw the bottom flat area maybe sixty feet square leading to a small wooden dock that bobbed on the banks of the reservoir hazard lanterns had been rigged on high poles flooding the space with sallow light people in uniforms crowded around looking at something to the left of the dock trying to talk over the roar of the copters from where i was standing none of the conversation was audible i continued to descend and saw the object of attention a rollsroyce its rear end submerged in the water its front wheels lifted several feet off the ground the drivers door was open hanging open hinged near the centerpost the kind of doors old lincoln continentals used to have suicide doors i peered into the crowd saw don ramp in shirtsleeves next to chief chickering staring at the car one hand on his head the other clutching his trousers gathering a handful of worsted as if trying literally to hold himself together no immediate sign of milo finally i spotted him off to one side out of the light he had on a plaid shirt and jeans and his arm was around melissa a dark blanket covered her shoulders their backs were to the car milos lips were moving i couldnt tell if melissa was listening i made my way down to them milo noticed me coming and frowned melissa looked up at me but remained under his arm her face was white and still like a kabuki mask i spoke her name she didnt respond i took both of her hands and gave them a squeeze she said theyre still under in a disembodied voice milo said the divers in the practiced tone of an interpreter one of the helicopters circled lower over the reservoir using its beam to sketch spheres of light in the black water the sketches decayed before they were complete someone shouted melissa yanked her hand free and turned toward the sound one of the park rangers held a flashlight near the shoreline a wetsuited diver surfaced pulling up his mask and shaking his head as he stepped completely out of the water another diver emerged both of them began removing their scuba tanks and weight belts melissa made a groaning sound like gears grinding then shouted no and ran over to them milo and i went after her she reached the divers and screamed no you cant stop now the divers backed away from her and lowered their gear to the ground they looked at chickering whod come over accompanied by a deputy sheriff some of the other men were glancing our way ramp hung back still fixated on the car whats the situation chickering asked the divers he had on a dark suit white shirt and dark tie the toes of his wingtips were coated with mud uniforms were assembling behind him watchful like a nighttime posse itching to ride black as coal said one of the divers he shot an uneasy glance at melissa turned back to the san labrador chief really dark sir then use light said melissa people nightdive all the time with lights dont they miss said the diver we he searched for words he was young not much older than she freckled with a downy blond mustache under a peeling nose a thread of algae clung to his chin his teeth began to chatter and he had to clench his jaws to make them stop the other diver just as young said we did use lights miss he bent over and picked something off the ground blackcased bulb attached to a rope lanyard he let it swing a few times and put it back down swat submersible miss we used the yellow bulbs theyre excellent for this kind of the problem here is that even during the day its pretty murky at night shaking his head he rubbed his arms looked down at the ground the blond diver had seized the opportunity to move several feet away standing on one leg he pulled off a flipper switched legs and began to tug at the other someone brought him a blanket identical to the one around melissas shoulders the other diver looked at it longingly its a reservoir dammit said melissa its drinking water how can it be muddy not muddy miss said the darkhaired diver murky kind of opaque its the natural color of the water minerals come here during the day and youll see the colors this real deep green he stopped himself looked to the crowd for confirmation the deputy stepped forward a brass tag above one pocket said gautier below it were rows of ribbons he looked about fiftyfive his eyes were tired and gray were going to do everything to find your mother miss dickinson he said showing even tobaccostained teeth the helicopters will keep going covering a twentymile semicircle above the highway which will take us well above the crest highway as far as the reservoir those boats the dam people sent out right at the beginning went over every square inch of surface the copters are going over it again just to make sure but in terms of below the surface theres really nothing we can do right now he spoke softly and deliberately trying to communicate horror without being horrible if gina was below the surface there was no need for urgency melissa kneaded her hands glared at him working her mouth chickering frowned and took a step closer melissa shut her eyes threw up her hands and let out a wrenching cry slamming both hands over her face she bent at the waist as if gripped by cramps no no no milo made a move toward her but i got there first and he retreated taking hold of her shoulders i drew her to me she fought kept repeating the word no i held her fast and gradually she loosened too loose i put a finger under her chin and lifted her face she was cold and plastic to the touch it was like positioning a mannequin conscious breathing normally but her eyes were static and unfocused and i knew if i let go shed sink to the ground the crowd of uniformed men watched i drew her away she moaned and some of them flinched one man turned his back then others gradually most of them began drifting back to the rolls chickering and gautier lingered chickering stared at me puzzled and irritated shook his head joined the car crowd gautier watched him leave with a raised eyebrow turning back to me he glanced down at melissa and gave a look of concern its okay i said were going to get out of here if thats okay with you gautier nodded chickering was looking at the water don ramp stood alone in muck up to his ankles hed somehow turned into a fraillooking stooped man i tried to catch his attention thought i had when he turned toward me but he was staring past me with eyes as muddy as his shoes the helicopters had moved on emitting flyoncarrion buzzes from somewhere in the north suddenly my senses expanded like the lens of a camera i heard water lapping against the shore smelled the chlorophyll tang of the underbrush the hydrocarbon stink of leaking motor fluids melissa stirred opening too like a wound crying softly rhythmically her grief rising to a high mewl that danced above the water and the harddata chorus of the men at the shore milo frowned and shifted his weight from one foot to the other hed been standing behind me and i hadnt noticed maybe it was that movement that snapped ramp out of his trance he walked toward us took half a dozen halting steps before thinking better of it and turning around milo and i halfwalked halfcarried melissa up to my car he returned to the rolls and i drove her home prepared for therapy she put her head back and closed her eyes and by the time i reached the bottom of the mountain road she was snoring lightly the gates to the house on sussex knoll were open i carried her up to the front door and knocked after what seemed like a long time madeleine answered wearing a white cotton dressing gown buttoned to the neck no surprise on her broad face she had the weathered look of one used to grieving alone i walked past her into the huge front room and deposited melissa on one of the overstuffed couches madeleine hurried off and came back with a blanket and a pillow sinking to her knees she propped up melissas head slid the pillow under it removed melissas sneakers spread the blanket over her and tucked the corners under her feet melissa turned on her side facing the back of the sofa there was squirrely movement under the blanket a couple of shifts of position then a hand peeked out thumb extended the hand wormed its way totally free and the thumb came to rest on melissas lower lip still kneeling madeleine brushed the hair from melissas face then she stood straightened her dress and gave me a hard hungry look that demanded information i curled a finger and she followed me across the room out of melissas earshot when we stopped she was standing very close to me breathing hard heavy bosom heaving her hair was braided tightly shed put on some kind of rosewater cologne only the car monsieur unfortunately i told her about the helicopter search her eyes remained dry but she brushed them hastily with her knuckles i said she may still be in the park somewhere if she is theyll find her madeleine said nothing pulled at a finger joint until it cracked melissa made sucking sounds around her thumb madeleine looked at her then back at me you stay monsieur for a while i am here monsieur good well take shifts she didnt respond not sure if thered been a language problem i said well take turns make sure shes not alone she didnt acknowledge that either just stood there eyes like granite i said is there anything you want to tell me madeleine non monsieur then feel free to rest no tired monsieur we sat together on opposite sides of the couch where melissa dozed madeleine got up a few times to fuss with the blanket even though melissa had barely moved neither of us talked every so often madeleine cracked a knuckle she was working on the tenth one when the doorbell chimed hurrying to the entry with as much grace as her bulk would allow she opened the door and let in milo monsieur sturgis once more eager for news hello madeleine he shook his head gave her hand a quick pat looking past her he said hows our girl sleeping he came into the room and stood over melissa her thumb was still in her mouth some hair strands had come loose veiling her face he made a move as if to brush them away stopped himself and whispered how longs she been out since i got her in the car i said that okay the two of us shifted several feet away madeleine moved in close to melissa given the circumstances i said madeleine said i will stay with her monsieur sturgis sure said milo dr delaware and i will be in the downstairs study she gave a small nod as milo and i walked to the windowless room i said you seem to have made a friend old maddy not exactly a giggle a moment but shes loyal and makes a great pot of coffee shes originally from marseilles i was there twenty years ago stopover on my way home from saigon papers covered with milos handwriting obscured the blotter on the small white desk another set of notes and a cellular phone lay atop a fruitwood writing table the phones antenna was extended milo pushed it closed this was melissas work station he said pointing to the table we set up info command central in here shes a smart kid industrious we were on the horn all day none of it led anywhere but she didnt let it get to her ive seen rookie detectives who didnt handle frustration nearly as well she was motivated yeah he went behind the desk and sat down howd you find out about the car i said we took a sandwich break at seven she was joking about ditching harvard and becoming a private eye first time id seen her smile i figured at the least i was keeping her mind off it while we were eating i made a routine check with baldwin park chp been doing it once per shift so as not to be seen as a giant pain in the ass didnt really expect it to lead anywhere but the gal at the desk said oh yeah that one just turned up and told me the details melissa must have seen the look on my face and dropped her food so i had to tell her she insisted on coming with me better than waiting around guess so he got up walked back to the writing table and toed a dark spot on the cream border of the aubusson carpet heres where it dropped her tuna and mayo nice little grease spot he faced the goya portrait and rubbed his eyes before it happened she was telling me some of the things shed been through how you helped her kids lived a lot in eighteen years i was too rough on her wasnt i too damn judgmental occupational hazard i said but you obviously did something right she trusts you i really didnt think it was going to turn out nasty he turned and faced me for the first time i noticed that he needed a shave and his hair looked oily what a fucking mess who found the car park ranger on routine patrol he noticed the service gate was open went over to close it and decided to check the areas at the bottom are used by the dam people for taking water samples they like to keep john q public out no peeing in the drinking water the lock on this one was missing but apparently thats not too weird sometimes the dam people forget to lock up its kind of a running joke between them and the rangers he almost didnt bother to go down and check no one saw the car from the dam he shook his head its a good couple of miles from the dam to that part of the reservoir and the dam people generally keep their eyes glued on dials and gauges milo sat back down again looked at the papers on the desk flipped them absently what do you think happened i said why she drove out there in the first place and why down that road who knows chickering made a big deal about her phobia hes convinced she got lost and started to panic and was looking for a place to get hold of herself the others bought it make sense to you maybe if she felt a need to practice her breathing and take her medicine she would have wanted privacy but howd the car get into the water looks like an accident he said she parked close to the shore the tire marks put it at eighteen inches away the gearshift was set to neutral for that particular model reverse is the parking gear once the engines off she wasnt exactly an experienced driver and the prevailing wisdom was that she lost control and it rolled in apparently these old rolls have servo drum brakes that take a few seconds to engage if the hand brakes not set they can roll a bit even after the engines off and you really have to stomp on the main brake to stop them why didnt it roll all the way in therere these steel flanges extending several feet out from the wall of the dam like steps for maintenance the rear wheels got lodged between a couple of them really tight sheriffs investigators said it would take a winch tow was the drivers door open when the ranger found it yes first thing he did was take a look if anyone was trapped but it was empty water was up to the seats the doors may have flipped open accidentally theyre put on backwards attached to the center post so gravity would have pulled them back or maybe she was trying to get out whats the prevailing wisdom on whether she succeeded he stopped looked at his papers again gathered a handful crumpled it and left it balled on the desk most popular theory is that she either hit her head trying to get out or passed out due to anxiety and fell in the reservoirs deep even with the drought over a hundred and twentyfive feet and there are no gradations like a swimming pool it just drops straight off she would have sunk in seconds melissa says she wasnt a strong swimmer hadnt gone in the pool for years melissa said she didnt like water i said so what was she doing out there in the first place who the hell knows maybe it was all part of her doityourself therapy confronting what scared her that make sense to you it doesnt feel right i said do you remember your comment after the car was spotted we were looking at the map looking at the and you thought it was unlikely shed gone north cause north was angeles crest and you didnt see her as the type to rough it so what are you saying i dont know i said but this whole tragic accident bit is based upon the assumption that she was alone what if someone drove her there and dumped her weighed the body down to make sure it sank then tried to push the car in to make it look like an accident but was prevented by the flanges whered this other person go into the great beyond the forest is huge you once told me its a prime dumping ground for bodies didnt know you listened so carefully all the time he crumpled some more papers and ran his hand over his face alex all these years on the job you dont have to talk me into seeing the worst in people but so far nothing screams out foul play give me a who and a why who do you usually suspect first when a rich woman dies the husband but this one doesnt profit so whats his motive maybe he does profit despite what anger and the lawyer said prenuptials can be challenged with an estate this size even if he ended up with one or two percent it would be significant and insurance policies can be taken out without lawyers and accountants or the insured knowing also hes got another secret i told him what id learned at malibu he pushed the chair back to the bookshelves stretched without appearing to achieve comfort old macho don living in a big old walkin closet i said it could explain why he was so hostile when he first met you he knew who you were from tv was worried you might possibly know about him why would i common contacts in the gay community yeah thats me he said mr activist direct line to the gay community hed have no way of knowing unless he himself was involved in the gay community given the fact that he serves food to san labrador folk i think thats unlikely or maybe it wasnt rational maybe it was just a gut response your being there threatened him reminded him of his secret threatened he said you know it occurred to me too that he knew something about me i thought he was just being a homophobe fascist came this close to saying fuck you and walking then he just seemed to forget about it so i did too once he could see you were focusing on gina and not him he figured his secret was safe he gave a sour smile didnt take long to bust his secret now that i think back it was probably on his mind from the beginning he was the first one to mention the beach house called over there himself twice figuring that would take care of it he had no way of knowing id go out there even after i did it was a fluke i found out if nyquist hadnt overdone it with those two girls and if i hadnt run into them later i wouldnt have suspected a thing whats this nyquist like besides being an overacter blond goodlooking pumps iron surfs the girls said he has guys in and out all the time claims to be training them golden hustler he said what a cliché thats exactly what i thought i said back when i suspected gina of fooling around with him that raised his eyebrows when was this right at the beginning but i didnt put it into focus till yesterday the first time i was here gina and i were downstairs looking for melissa after their blowup ramp and nyquist came in from playing tennis then ramp left to shower and nyquist hung around for no apparent reason kind of casually snotty he asked gina for something to drink and somehow made it sound lascivious nothing explicit it was the way he said it she must have heard it too because she put him in his place right away he didnt like it but he kept his mouth shut the whole interchange took less than a minute i forgot about it until i saw nyquist play stud with the beach bunnies then the girls told me about him and ramp and i realized it was just a front maybe it wasnt what do you mean maybe todds a creative fellow playing both ends he smiled its been known to happen id been standing since wed entered the room realized it and sat down in an armchair money and jealousy and passion i said a whole slew of classic motives for the price of one remember how melissa said gina told her she prized kindness and tolerance in a man maybe what she liked about ramp was that he was tolerant of more than her phobia maybe she was referring to his acceptance of her fooling around with nyquist andor some other sexual explorations but what if that tolerance wasnt mutual infidelitys one thing crossing sexual preference lines is another if gina found out she was sharing todd with ramp it could have blown her mind even if she and nyquist had nothing going learning ramp was gay or bisexual could have blown her mind said milo whatever the specifics she learned something that led her to decide shed had enough time to make her escape psychologically and physically take a giant step through an open door big change for ramp if she boots him out i nodded no more mansion no more beach house no more tennis court people do get accustomed to a certain standard and if her reason for divorcing him ever got out hed lose a lot more than luxuries hed be finished in san labrador outing him he said softly what dragging him out of the closet whether he wanted it or not its something angry people do and hell hath no fury true i said but the only thing is i havent picked up any exceptional hostility between gina and ramp neither has melissa and you can bet shed be looking for it yeah said milo but both of them used to act right theyd be good at faking marital bliss isnt that the san labrador way heavy starch on the upper lip true so where do we go with it go he said if youre asking could i convince chickering or the sheriffs to investigate ramp on the basis of his having a secret sex life you know the answer to that should i do a little research on him and golden boy what could it hurt another day at the beach i said remind me to bring my boogie board did you get over to see mccloskey again this afternoon he was sleeping when i got there the priest didnt want me to bother him but i snuck up the back way went to his room he didnt even look surprised to see me resigned the way old cons get learn anything he shook his head just the same old religious crap i tried all my cop tricks nothing fazed him im starting to think the guys a genuine head case he tapped his cranium nada aqui but that doesnt preclude his hiring someone to get her he didnt answer looked preoccupied what is it you got me going on ramp it would be nice to know how much gina actually knew about his sexuality think she discussed it with those therapists quite possibly but i dont see them breaking confidentiality are dead people entitled to confidentiality ethically they are im not sure about the legal end of it if foul play was suspected they could probably be forced to open their records eventually but without that i dont see them being too forthcoming any publicity can only hurt them yeah he said patient in the lake doesnt shout nobel prize for medicine my mind drifted to black water and stayed there a hundred plus feet of muck if she is at the bottom of the reservoir whats the chance of finding the body not terrific like the diver said visibilitys lousy the areas huge you cant drain it the way you could a lake and a hundred and twentyfives getting close to maximum scuba depth before you need to get into deepsea equipment were talking major expense major time commitment with little chance of success the sheriffs guys werent jumping to fill out the requisition forms sheriffs got sole jurisdiction uhhuh chickering was happy to punt the prevailing wisdom was to let nature take its course meaning wait for her to float i thought of a gasfilled suppurating lump rising to the surface of the dam wondered what comfort id be able to dredge up for melissa if and when that happened wondered what id tell her when she woke up despite the prevailing wisdom i said do you think theres any chance she escaped from the car and made it back to shore he gave me a puzzled look abandoning your murdermayhem scenario exploring alternatives if thats the case why didnt she just wait by the side of the road until someone came by its not welltraveled but eventually she would have been found she might have been in shock disoriented maybe she even suffered a head injury wandered off and lost consciousness no blood traces were found closed head injury you dont need blood for a concussion wandered off somewhere he said if youre searching for a happy ending that aint it not if the copters dont find her damned soon were talking fiftyplus hours of exposure if i had a choice of which way to die id opt for the lake he stood again paced can you handle more ugly he said i spread my arms thrust my chest forward hit me there are at least two other scenarios we havent considered one she got to shore waited by the road and someone did pick her up someone nasty psycho motorist its an alternative alex goodlooking woman in a wet dress helpless it would appeal to a certain appetite lord knows we see it often enough women stranded on the freeway good samaritans turning out not to be i said that is ugly no one deserves to suffer that much since when has deserving had anything to do with it whats two suicide gautier the sheriff brought it up right after you and melissa left chickering started explaining to everyone that you were her shrink got into this little monologue about ginas problems bad genetics about san labrador having lots of eccentrics he may guard the rich folks palaces but he doesnt have much affection for them anyway gautier said given all that why not suicide apparently theyve had other people jump in the reservoir chickering loved it what did ramp have to say about that ramp wasnt there chickering wouldnt have mouthed off in front of him he didnt even realize i was listening where was ramp up on the highway he started to look queasy the paramedics took him to the ambulance for an ekg he okay ekgwise he is but he looked pretty shitty when i left he was still getting tea and sympathy acting he shrugged chickerings psychological insights notwithstanding i said i dont see suicide when i talked to her there was no evidence of depression not even a hint of it on the contrary she was optimistic she had twenty years of pain and misery to contemplate doing away with herself why would she do it just at the point where she was looking forward to some freedom freedom can be scary just a couple of days ago you had her getting high on freedom driving to vegas to whoop it up things change he said then you always have a way of complicating my life what better basis for friendship we went to check on melissa she was lying on her side face to the sofa back the blanket twisted around her in a tight cocoon madeleine sat at the foot of the sofa only a small portion of her substantial buttocks making contact with the cushion crocheting something pink and formless and concentrating on her hands she glanced up as we entered i said has she been up at all non monsieur milo said has mr ramp come home yet non monsieur her fingers stilled i said why dont we put her to bed oui monsieur i lifted melissa carried her up the stairs to her room madeleine and milo behind me madeleine turned on the light dimmed it and drew back the covers of the fourposter she spent a long time tucking melissa in then pulled a chair to the side of the bed and sat reaching into a dressinggown pocket she drew out her crocheting and placed it in her lap sitting motionless careful not to rock melissa shifted position under the covers moved again so that she was on her back her mouth was open and her breathing was slow and steady milo watched the rise and fall of the comforter for a moment then said im gonna get going how about you remembering a small childs night terrors i said ill stay for a while milo nodded i stay also said madeleine she engaged her yarn looped it around her needle and began dipping and tilting good i told her ill be downstairs call me if she wakes up oui monsieur i sat in one of the overstuffed chairs and thought about things that kept me awake the final time i checked my watch it was just after am i fell asleep still sitting and awoke stiff and cottonmouthed my arms tattooed dazed and confused i jerked upright the tattooing shifted kaleidoscopically luminous blue and red and emerald and amber splotches sunlight sieved through lace curtains and daubed by stained glass sunday i felt sacrilegious as if id dozed off in a church seventwenty silent house overnight a stale smell had settled in or maybe it had been there all along i rubbed my eyes and tried to clear my head stood with some pain straightened my clothes ran my hand over my stubbled face and stretched until it was obvious that the ache wasnt ready to depart in a guest bathroom near the entry hall i splashed water on my face massaged my scalp and headed upstairs melissa was still asleep hair spread on her pillow too perfectly arranged to be accidental it reminded me of a victorian funeral photo angelic children in laceedged coffins i worked my way past that smiled at madeleine the pink thing was still formless but had stretched to a couple of feet i wondered if shed slept at all her feet were bare bigger than mine a pair of corduroy slippers was arranged neatly on the floor next to the rocker next to them was a telephone that shed removed from melissas nightstand i said bonjour she looked up cleareyed and grim began working her needle faster monsieur she reached down and replaced the phone did mr ramp come home glance at melissa shake of the head the movement made the chair creak melissa opened her eyes madeleine shot me an accusing look i approached the bed madeleine began rocking the chair complained louder melissa looked up at me i smiled down at her hoping it didnt look ghoulish she widened her eyes moved her lips seemed to be struggling hi i said i what her eyes darted unable to settle panic crossed her face she pushed her head forward fell back closed her eyes and opened them again i sat down and took her hand soft and hot felt her forehead warm but not feverish madeleine rocked faster melissa was squeezing my fingers i wha mama theyre still looking for her melissa mama tears she closed her eyes madeleine was there with a tissue for her and a look of reproach for me a moment later melissa was sleeping again i waited around until her slumber deepened got what i needed from madeleine and went downstairs lupe and rebecca were downstairs vacuuming and scrubbing when i passed they averted their eyes i left the house stepping out into sooty light that grayed the forest shielding the mansion as i opened the door to the seville a white saab turbo came roaring up the drive it came to a short stop the engine quieted and both gabneys got out ursula from the drivers side she had on a snugly tailored gray sharkskin suit over a white blouse and less makeup than shed worn at the clinic it made her look tired but younger every hair in place but her coiffure lacked luster her husband had exchanged cowboy duds for a brownandtan houndstooth jacket beige slacks chocolate suede wingtips white shirt and green tie she waited until he took her arm the difference in their heights seemed almost comical but their expressions killed the joke they walked toward me matching each other step for step looking like pallbearers dr delaware said leo gabney weve been calling the police department regularly just received the terrible news from chief chickering his free hand wiped his high brow terrible his wife bit her lip he patted her arm hows melissa she said very softly surprised by the question i said sleeping oh it seems to be her major defense right now not uncommon said leo protective withdrawal im sure youre aware of how important it is to monitor because sometimes its a prelude to prolonged depression i said ill be keeping an eye on her ursula said has she been given anything to make her sleep not to my knowledge i said good she said its best that she not be tranquilized in order to she bit her lip again god im so sorry i really this is just she shook her head folded her lips inward and looked at the sky what can you say at a time like this horrible said her husband you can say its damned horrible and feel the pain while resigning yourself to the inadequacy of language he patted some more she gazed past him at the big houses peach facade her eyes seemed unfocused he said horrible again a professor trying to foment discussion then who can account for the way things work out when neither his wife nor i responded he said chickering suggested suicide playing amateur psychologist pure nonsense and i told him so she never displayed an iota of depression masked or overt on the contrary she was a robust woman considering what shed been through he stopped again meaningfully somewhere from the trees a mockingbird imitated a jay gabney gave an exasperated look and turned to his wife she was somewhere else i said did she ever mention anything in therapy that would explain why she drove up to that reservoir nothing said leo not a thing driving off by herself in the first place was total improvisation thats the hell of it had she adhered to the treatment plan none of this would have happened shed never been anything but compliant before ursula continued to say nothing shed loosened her arm from her husbands grip without my noticing i said was there any unusual stress she was undergoing apart from the agoraphobia no nothing said gabney her stress level was lower than ever before she was progressing beautifully i turned to ursula she continued looking at the house but shook her head no she said nothing why this line of inquiry dr delaware said gabney surely you dont believe it was suicide pushing his face closer to mine one of his eyes was a paler blue than the other both were clear and unwavering less combative than curious just trying to make some sense of it he placed a hand on my shoulder i understand thats only natural but im afraid the sad sense of it boils down to the fact that she overestimated her progress and deviated from the treatment plan the sense of it is that well never make any sense of it he sighed wiped his brow again though it was dry who knows better than we therapists that human beings persist in their annoying habit of being unpredictable those of us who cant deal with that should study physics i suppose his wifes head made a sharp quarterturn not that im blaming her of course he said she was a sweet wellmeaning woman suffered more than anyone should its just one of those unfortunate things shrug after enough years in practice one learns to accommodate to tragedy one definitely learns he reached for ursulas arm she allowed him to touch her for a moment then moved away and walked quickly up the limestone steps her high heels clattered and her long legs seemed too decorative for top speed she looked sexy and awkward at the same time at the front door she placed her palms flat upon the chaucer carving and stood there as if the wood had healing powers shes soft said gabney very quietly too caring didnt know that was a fault he smiled give yourself a few more years then so are you taking responsibility for the emotional wellbeing of this family just melissa he nodded shes certainly vulnerable please dont hesitate to consult with us if theres anything we can do would it be possible to review mrs ramps chart her chart i suppose so but why same answer as before i guess trying to make sense out of it professorial smile her chart wont help you with that theres nothing juicy in it which is to say we avoid the typical anecdotal pitfalls compulsively detailed descriptions of the patients every twitch and blink those lovely oedipal recollections and dream sequences movie writers are so fond of my research has shown that that kind of thing has little to do with therapeutic outcome typically the doctor scrawls in order to feel hes being useful never bothers to actually go back and read any of it and when he does none of its useful so weve developed a method of recordkeeping thats highly objective behaviorbased symptomology objectively defined goals what about records of the group sessions we dont keep those because we dont conceptualize the groups as therapy unstructured group sessions have very little direct treatment value two patients presenting identical symptoms may have arrived at their pathology along totally different pathways each has developed a unique pattern of faulty learning once the patient has changed it may be appropriate for him to talk to others whove experienced progress if for no other reason than as a social reinforcer socializing as a reward for doing well exactly but we keep the discussion on a positive track dont take notes or do anything else to make it seem too clinical remembering what ursula said about ginas planning to talk about melissa in group i said do you discourage their talking about their problems id prefer to see it as reinforcing positivity guess youll be facing a challenge now helping the others deal with what happened to gina keeping his eyes on me he reached into his pocket and brought out a packet of chewing gum unwrapping two pieces he stuck them together and got to work on them if you want to read her chart he said id be happy to make you a copy id appreciate that where shall i send it your wife has my address ah glancing at ursula again shed moved away from the door was coming slowly down the steps so he said the daughters sleeping i nodded hows the husband doing he hasnt come home yet any psychological insights on him he moved his head to one side shifting into the sunlight and his white hair became a nimbus seems a pleasant enough fellow somewhat on the passive side they havent been married long so hes a johnnycomelately in terms of the pathology was he involved in the treatment as involved as he could be he followed through on the little that was expected of him excuse me turning his back on me he walked briskly toward the steps and took his wifes hand as she descended tried to put his arm around her shoulder but was too short to pull it off grasping her waist instead he ushered her toward the saab holding the passenger door open for her he helped her in his turn to drive then he walked over to me and offered his soft hand we shook we came to help he said but it doesnt seem as if theres much for us to do right at this moment please let us know if that changes and good luck to the child shell certainly need it madeleines directions were precise i found the tankard without any trouble southwestern stretch of cathcart boulevard just below the san labrador city limits same mix of pricey shops and service establishments lots of selfconscious mission architecture the pistachio trees ended at the pasadena border and were replaced by jacarandas in full bloom the median was beautifully littered with purple blossoms i parked spotting other nonlabradoran features a cocktail lounge at the end of the block two liquor stores one billing itself as a wine merchant the other a purveyor of fine spirits window banners announcing premium french and california varietals on special the tankard and blade was a modestlooking establishment two stories maybe a thousand square feet set on a quarteracre lot that was mostly parking space coarsetroweled white stucco brown crossbeams leaded windows and mockthatch roofing a chain blocked the lot ramps mercedes was on the other side parked toward the rear confirming my powers of deduction where the hell was the deerstalker hat and calabash a couple of other cars sat farther back twentyyearold brown chevrolet monte carlo with a white vinyl top peeling at the seams and a red toyota celica the front door was panes of bubbly colored glass set into distressed oak a handprinted cardboard sign hanging from the knob said sunday brunch canceled thank you i knocked got no answer pretended i had a right to intrude and rapped until my knuckles grew sore finally the door opened and an irritatedlooking woman stood there keys in hand midforties five five figure in the hourglass mode made ostentatious by what she had on empirewaisted bodicetopped puffed longsleeve maxidress with a square neckline low enough to display a swelling handsbreadth of freckled cleavage above the waist the dress was white cotton below wineandbrown paisley print platinum hair drawn back and tied with a winecolored ribbon a black velvet choker centered with an imitation coral cameo encircled her neck someones idea of ye olde serving wench her features were good high cheekbones firm square chin full crimsonglossed lips small uptilted nose wide brown eyes framed by toodark toothick toolong lashes hoops the size of drink coasters hung from her ears protected by barroom light or boozesoftened consciousness she would have been a knockout morning assaulted her beauty pouncing upon overly pancaked skin worry seams a loosening around the jowls pouches of despair tugging her mouth into a frown she was regarding me as if i were the taxman id like to see mr ramp she backrapped the sign with crimson nails cant you read she flinched as if asserting herself hurt im dr delaware melissas doctor oh the worry lines deepened hold on a second just wait here the door closed and locked a few minutes later she opened it sorry its just you should have im bethel shooting her hand forward before i could take it she added noels mom good to meet you mrs drucker her expression said she wasnt used to being called mrs she dropped my hand looked up and down the boulevard cmon in closing the door behind me and locking it with a hard twist the restaurants lights were off the leaded windows were frosted and thinly spaced and a dishwatercolored haze struggled through them my pupils labored to adjust when they stopped aching i saw a single long room lined with tuftandnailhead redleather booths and floored with honeybrown carpet patterned in mock pegandgroove the tables were spread with white linen and set with pewter drink plates blocky green glass goblets and stoutlooking flatware the walls were vertical pine planks stained the color of roast beef bracketed shelves just below the ceiling line housed a collection of mugs and steins easily a hundred of them many of them featuring pinkcheeked anglosaxon visages with dead porcelain eyes suits of armor that looked like studio props stood in strategic locations around the restaurant maces and broadswords hung on the walls along with still lifes favoring dead birds and rabbits an open door at the rear offered a glimpse of stainlesssteel kitchen to its left was a horseshoeshaped leathertopped bar backed with a st paulis girl mirror a stainlesssteel serving cart sat at the epicenter of the fauxwood carpet bare except for a rotisserie spit and a carving set hefty enough to handle bison surgery ramp was at the bar facing the mirror brow resting in one hand one arm dangling near his elbow was a glass and a bottle of wild turkey clatter came from the kitchen then silence unhealthy silence like most places designed for social intercourse the restaurant was deathly without it i approached the bar bethel drucker stayed with me when we got there she said can i get you something sir as if brunch had been restored no thanks she went over to ramps right side leaned low tried to catch his eye he didnt budge the ice in his glass floated in an inch of bourbon the bar top smelled of soap and booze bethel said how bout some more water he said okay she took the glass went behind the bar filled it from a plastic evian bottle and put it in front of him he said thanks but didnt touch it she looked at him for a moment then went into the kitchen when we were alone he said no problem finding me huh talking so low i had to move closer i took the stool next to him he didnt move i said when you didnt come home i wondered it was an educated guess got no home not anymore i said nothing the st pauli girl grinned with aryan joy im a guest now he said unwanted guest welcome mat worn clear the hell through hows melissa sleeping yeah she does that a lot when shes upset every time i used to try to talk to her shed doze off no resentment in his voice just resignation lots to be upset about i wouldnt trade what shes been through for twenty billion she got dealt a lousy hand if shedve let me he stopped touched his water glass made no attempt to lift it well shes got one less thing to be upset about he said whats that yours truly no more evil stepdad she once rented that from the video storethe stepfather watched it over and over downstairs in the den never watched anything else down there doesnt even like movies i sat down to watch it with her wanting to relate made popcorn for two she fell asleep he heaved his shoulders im gone hit the dusty trail from san labrador or just from the house shrug when did you decide to leave i said bout ten minutes ago or maybe it was right from the beginning i dont know what the hells the diff neither of us talked for a while the mirror shot back our reflections sullied by dishwater light our faces were barely discernible distorted by the imperfections in the silvered glass and the painted face of the grinning fräulein i made out just enough to know that he looked awful i didnt look much better he said i just cant see why the hell shed do it do what drive up there break her appointment at the clinic she never broke rules never he turned and faced me unshaven poucheyed instant old man the mirror had been kind she once told me that when she was a kid in school she used to get straight as not because she especially liked to study but because she was afraid of the teachers getting mad at her afraid of not doing well she was straitlaced as they come even back when we were at the studio and things got pretty loose she never relaxed her standards i wondered how that kind of morality would fare after coming up against todd nyquist i said chickerings pushing a suicide theory chickerings a goddam ass the only thing hes got any talent for is keeping things quiet which is what they pay him for what kinds of things he closed his eyes shook his head faced the mirror again what do you think people making asses of themselves they come in here and get plastered want to drive home and get all pissedoff and abusive when i tell noel not to release their keys i call chickering even though this is pasadena he comes right down and escorts them home he or one of his troopers but they do it with their own cars so no one will see anything out of the ordinary nothing gets written up and the asss car gets delivered to his driveway if its somebody local same with nice old ladies caught shoplifting or kids smoking dope what about outsiders they get put in jail grim smile weve got great crime statistics he ran a finger across his lips thats why weve got no local paper thank god for that now i used to think it was a real pain in the ass from an advertising point of view but thank god for it now he put both hands over his face bethel came out from the kitchen carrying a plate of steak and eggs she put it down in front of him then quickly went back in after a long time he looked up so howd you enjoy the beach when i didnt reply he said i told you she wouldnt be out there why the helld you bother detective sturgis asked me to check good old detective sturgis we sure wasted each others time didnt we you usually do what he asks he doesnt usually ask though it wasnt exactly dirty work right drive to the beach catch some sun check up on the client its a beautiful spot i said get down there much he tensed his jaw touched his whiskey glass finally said used to few times a month never could get gina to go with me he turned and looked at me again stared i held his gaze nothing like the sun at the beach he said gotta keep the old tan going perfect host and all that got a certain goddam standard to uphold right he lifted the glass sipped i said the last couple of days havent been a day at the beach for you yeah hollow laugh first i thought it was nothing ginad lost her way would come right back then when she didnt show up by thursday night i started thinking maybe she had taken a drive wanting to be free like sturgis said once i put that in my mind i couldnt get it out couldnt stop wondering if it was something i did drove myself nuts wondering so what does it turn out to be goddam stupid accident jesus h i should have known it wasnt us we were getting along great even though it was so so he made a tortured sound picked up the glass and heaved it at the mirror the fräuleins face cracked blades of glass tumbled out and shattered on the gooseneck spigot of the bar sink leaving a trapezoid of white plaster the rest of the mirror remained bolted to the wall no one came out of the kitchen he said skoal àgoddamsantá bottoms goddam up turning to me what are you here for anyway see what a secret fag looks like touching base trying to make some sense of what happened myself so i can help melissa made any so far sense not yet you one too what fag gay whatever theyre calling it nowadays like him sturgis and me and no bully for you good old melissa what was she like as a little kid i told him emphasizing the positive careful not to break confidentiality yeah he said again thats what i figured i would have liked ah to hell with it he got up with remarkable speed went to the kitchen door and called out noel the drucker boy came out wearing his red busboys jacket over a tshirt and jeans and holding a dish towel you can go now said ramp the doctor here says shes sleeping if you want to wait till she wakes up thats fine ive got nothing for you to do here just do one thing first pack me a suitcase clothes stuff just throw it in use the big blue case in my closet bring it back here doesnt matter what time ill be here yes sir said noel looking uneasy sir said ramp turning to me hear that respectful youth this boy will go far watch out harvard noel winced ramp said tell your mom its safe to come out im not going to eat any of this gonna take a nap myself the boy went back into the kitchen ramp watched him everythings going to change he said everything just as i was pulling away from the curb noel came out of the restaurant he spotted me and jogged over to the seville hed removed his red jacket wore a small backpack over his tshirt the shirt said greenpeace he mouthed excuse me i opened the passenger window he said excuse me again and added a sir whats up noel i was just wondering how melissas doing she seems mostly to be sleeping the full impact may not have hit her yet shes a very he frowned i waited he said its hard to phrase it i shoved the door open cmon in he hesitated for a moment pulled off the backpack placed it on the floor and slid in he lifted the pack and put it on his lap his face was hungry and hurting nice car he said seventyeight nine the new ones arent nearly as good too much plastic i like it he played with the straps on the backpack i said you were saying something about melissa something that was hard to phrase he frowned one fingernail scraped a strap all i meant to say was shes a very special person unique just from looking at her youd assume she was something totally different than what she actually is i mean i know this sounds sexist but most of the really goodlooking girls tend to be concerned about superficial things at least thats the way it is out here out here in san labrador he nodded at least as far as what ive seen i dont know maybe its california in general or the whole world ive never really lived anywhere else since i was a little kid so i cant really say thats why i wanted to get out of here try a different environment not all this partyhearty harvard nod i applied to a lot of schools didnt really expect to get into harvard when i did i decided it was what i wanted if the financial part could be worked out was it basically between what ive saved up taking a year off to put more away and some other things i could have handled it could have i dont know he fidgeted pulled straps i really dont know now if going away is the best thing i said whys that i mean how can i leave when shes going through something like this shes deep feels things more strongly than other people shes the only girl ive ever met whos really concerned with important things the first time we ever met it was unbelievably easy to talk to her pain in his eyes sorry he said reaching for the door handle sorry for bothering you actually i feel kind of dishonest talking to you whys that he rubbed the back of his neck the first time melissa called you about wanting to come in and see you i was there in the room with her i mentally replayed the conversation melissa excusing herself a couple of times oh darn hold on hand over the phone and i said i was against it he said her seeing you i told her she didnt need a she could work things out herself that we could problemsolve it together she told me to mind my own business that you were great now here i am talking to you myself none of thats important noel lets get back to where we were melissa as a unique person i agree with you on that what youre saying is you feel a unique rapport with her and youre worried about abandoning her in her time of need he nodded when are you supposed to leave for boston early august classes start september but they want you to get there earlier for orientation got a major in mind maybe international relations diplomacy probably not i think id prefer something that has to do with actual policymaking an administrative staff position at the state department or defense or a congressional aide if you study the way the government works its really the people behind the scenes who get things done sometimes professional diplomats do have impact but often theyre just appointed figureheads pause also i think id have a better shot at a behindthescenes position whys that from everything ive read about the foreign service where you come from your family your background who you know is more important than what you actually accomplish kind of like making the best clubs in high school i havent got much of a family just mom and myself saying it matteroffactly no selfpity he said it used to bother me people put a lot of premium on lineage out here meaning money thats two generations old but now i realize ive actually been pretty lucky moms really supportive and ive always had everything i needed when you get down to it a person doesnt need that much do they also i got to see what happens to lots of the rich kids the kind of messes they get themselves into thats why i really respect melissa shes probably one of the richest girls in san lab but she doesnt act like it the first time i met her shed come into the tankard with some other kids for a french club dinner and i was busing for my mom the rest of them acted as if i were invisible melissa took the time to say please and thank you and afterward when the others went out to the parking lot she hung back and talked to me told me shed seen me at the pasadenasan labrador track meet i used to do gymnastics until it took too much time from my studies nothing flirty shes not like that we started talking and there was this instant rapport as if we were old friends she kept coming in and we got to be really good friends she helped me with lots of things all i want is to be able to help her is it definite about her mom being no i said not definite but it doesnt look good thats really terrible shaking his head scratching the pack god thats terrible its going to be so hard for her did you know mrs ramp well not really i washed her cars every couple of weeks once in a while shed come down and take a look but to tell the truth she really didnt care about them one time i made a comment about how fantastic they were and she said she guessed so but to her they were just metal and rubber then she apologized right away said she hadnt meant to demean my work i thought that was pretty classy overall she seemed pretty classy maybe a little distant i thought the way she lived was melissa and i used to i guess i should have had more sympathy if melissa remembers that shell probably hate me melissa will remember your friendship he said nothing for several moments then actually it may have gone beyond friendship at least from my point of view from hers i cant really be sure looking at me straight on begging for good news the most i could offer was a smile he picked at a cuticle bit it great here i am talking about myself when i should be thinking about melissa id better get over there got to pack mr ramps suitcase think hes serious about leaving youd probably know that better than i would i dont know a thing he said quickly he and melissa dont seem to have the makings of a happy family he ignored that lifted the pack and reached for the door handle well better get going need a ride i said no thanks got my own car the celica over there opening the door he put one foot on the curb stopped turned to face me again what i meant to ask you in the first place is there anything i should be doing to help her be there for her when she needs company i said listen when she talks but dont feel hurt or worried if she doesnt want to talk be patient when she gets really upset dont cut her off or try to tell her everythings all right when its not something bad happened you cant change that hed kept his eyes on me and nodded as i spoke good powers of concentration almost eerie i half expected him to whip out paper and pencil and take notes also i said i wouldnt make any drastic changes in your own plans once melissa gets over the initial shock shes going to have to pull her life together putting your life on hold for her could even make her more upset even if you dont intend to youre obligating her to you creating a debt at this stage in melissas life independence is really crucial even with whats happened she doesnt need another burden may come to resent it he said i never he was bouncing the pack looking down at it the canvas was packed tight it landed on his knee with a dull sound i said books textbooks some of the material i thought id be taking this fall i wanted to get an early start the freshman competitions really tough i keep carrying them around but i havent read a line yet embarrassed smile kind of weenieish i guess sounds like good planning to me whatever he said its just that i feel an obligation to excel if i go obligation to whom my mother don mr ramp hes putting up any tuition shortfall for the first two years those are the other funds i mentioned if i ace freshman and sophomore i should qualify for some kind of scholarship he obviously thinks a lot of you well he said dismissively i guess it makes him feel good that were making progress mom and me he gave her a job when she when things were difficult brief flash of pain shallow smile to compensate gave us a place to live the second floor of the tankard is our home not that it was charity moms earned it best waitress anyone could ever want when hes not there she basically runs the place even fills in for the chef but hes also about the best boss you could have he bought me the celica in addition to my bonus got me the job at melissas place melissa doesnt seem to share your feelings about him he started to reach for the door gave a resigned look and let his arm drop she used to like him when she was just a customer theyd talk and hed bring her free shirley temples shes the one who fixed him up with her mom the trouble started after it got serious i kept wanting to tell her that he hadnt changed he was exactly the same person but she was just looking at him differently but weak smile but what you just dont tell melissa things like that she gets an idea in her head and she just wont shake it not that its a terrible fault too many kids are wishywashy dont care about ideals she sticks to her principles doesnt care about conforming or getting into stuff just because everyone else is like with drugs i always knew how bad they were because i because of all ive read but someone like melissa youd think she might be susceptible being popular and goodlooking and having plenty of money but she never did she stood her ground popular i said shes never mentioned any friends other than you and i havent seen any come around shes picky but everyone liked her she could have been a cheerleader joined the best service clubs if shed wanted but she had other things on her mind like what her studies mostly what else he hesitated then said her mom it was as if being a daughter was her main job in life she once told me she felt shed always have to take care of her mom i tried to convince her that wasnt right but she really got steamed told me i didnt know what it was like i didnt argue with her all that wouldve done was get her madder and i really dont like it when she gets mad he walked away before i could respond i watched him lift the chain to the parking lot get in the toyota and drive off two hands on the wheel this boy will go far courteous reverent industrious almost excruciatingly earnest in some ways melissas male counterpart her spiritual sibling i could understand the rapport did that get in the way of her thinking of him the way he wanted a good kid too good to be true my talk with him had twanged my therapists antennae though i wasnt sure why or maybe i was just filling my head with supposition in order to avoid reality the topic wed barely touched upon blue skies black water something white floating i started the seville pulled forward coasted across the san labrador city line melissa was awake but not talking she lay on her back head propped on three pillows hair braided atop her head eyelids swollen noel sat by her side in the rocker madeleine had filled an hour ago holding her hand looking alternately content and edgy back in her uniform madeleine moved through the room like a harbor barge docking at pieces of furniture dusting straightening opening and closing drawers on the nightstand was a bowl of oatmeal that had congealed to mortar the drapes were drawn warding off the harshness of midday summer light i leaned under the canopy and said hello melissa acknowledged me with a feeble smile i squeezed the hand noel hadnt claimed asked her if there was anything i could do for her head shake she looked nine years old again i stuck around anyway madeleine swiped a bit more with her dustrag then said i go downstairs ma petite choute something to eat melissa shook her head madeleine picked up the bowl of oatmeal and walked halfway to the door something to eat for you monsieur doctor the invitation and the doctor meant i must have done something right i realized i was hungry but even if i hadnt been i wouldnt have turned her down thank you i said something light would be fine a steak she said or some nice lamb chops i have the doublecuts a small chop would be great she nodded stuffed her dustrag in a pocket and left alone with noel and melissa i felt like an unwanted chaperon they seemed so comfortable with each other that three was definitely a crowd soon her eyes had closed again i stepped out into the hallway found myself drifting past closed doors drifting toward the back of the house the rear spiral staircase that gina ramp had descended that first day looking for melissa stairs that ascended as well tunneling upward through the gloom of the hallway i began climbing at the top was a hundred square feet of bare space marked by cedar double doors oldfashioned iron key in the lock i turned it stepped into darkness groped for a light switch and flicked found myself in an enormous loftlike room over a hundred feet long at least half that amount in width with dusty pineplank floors cedar walls unfinished beam ceiling bare bulbs joined to unshielded electrical conduits that ran the length of the beams dormer windows on both ends shaded with oilcloth the right portion of the room was filled furniture lamps steamer trunks and leather suitcases that brought to mind the age of rail travel groups of objects assembled with loose but noticeable organization here a collection of statuary there a foundrys worth of bronze sculptures inkstands clocks stuffed birds ivory carvings inlaid boxes a jumble of staghorns some of them on mounting boards others bound together with leather thongs rolled rugs animal skins elephantfoot ashtrays glass shades that could have been tiffany a standing polar bear glasseyed yellowed snarling one paw waving the other clutching a taxidermic salmon the left side was nearly empty two levels of vertically slotted storage racks ran along the wall an easel and artists flat file sat in the center canvases and framed pictures filled the slots a blank canvas was clamped to the easel not quite blank i made out faint pencil lines the wooden frame had warped the canvas billowed and puckered a pine paint box sat atop the flat file the latch was rusted but i pried it open using my fingernails inside were a dozen or so sable brushes their shanks paintstained their bristles stiffened to uselessness a rusty palette knife and paint tubes dried solid lining the bottom of the case were several pieces of paper i slid them out pages cut out of magazines life national geographic american heritage dates from the s and s landscapes and seascapes mostly inspirational images i supposed a photo between two of the pages writing on the back black ink a beautiful flowing hand march restoration color photograph good quality satin finish two people a man and a woman standing in front of paneled doors the chaucer doors peachcolored stucco around the wood the woman was gina dickinsons size and shape modelslim figure except for a hard high swell of belly she had on a white silk dress and white shoes that stood out nicely against the dark wood on her head was a widebrimmed white straw sun hat wisps of blond hair fuzzed her slender neck the face below the hat was encased in a mummywrap of bandages the eyeholes flat and black as raisins in a snowman one of her hands clutched a bouquet of white roses the other rested on the shoulder of the man tiny man coming midway to ginas shoulder making him four seven or eight tops sixtyish frail head too big for his body arms disproportionately long stumpy legs goatish features under frizzy gray hair a man whose ugliness was so beyond aesthetic repair that it seemed almost noble he wore a dark threepiece suit that was probably well cut but tailoring couldnt compensate for natures faulty draftsmanship i remembered something anger the banker had said art was his only extravagance he would have bought his clothes off the rack if he could no portraits in the house the aesthete he was posed formally one hand in his waistcoat the other around his bride but his eyes had wandered off to one side uneasy knowing that the camera would be cruel even on special days but that special days cried out for preservation nonetheless hed kept the picture at the bottom of a box like the magazine photos inspiration i took a closer look at the canvas on the easel the pencil lines assembled themselves as coherent form two ovals faces faces on an equal level cheek to cheek below what would have been the sketchy beginnings of torsos normal size the one on the right flattummied art as revisionism arthur dickinsons attempt at mastery march melissa had been born in june of that year arthur dickinson had missed the unveiling of his most prized work by weeks something else about the picture struck me older shorter homely man taller younger beautiful woman the gabneys the way leo had tried unsuccessfully to embrace his wifes shoulders he was of normal height the disparity less dramatic but the parallel remained striking maybe it was because the gabneys had stood in that same spot this morning maybe i wasnt the only one to have noticed it identification between therapist and patient similar taste in men similar taste in interior decorating whod influenced whom chickenegg riddles which had come to me as i sat in ursulas office returned with brainpecking vengeance i went over to the vertical rack handwritten labels under each slot listed artist title descriptive data dates of execution and purchase hundreds of partitions but arthur dickinson had been an organized man the collection was alphabetized cassatt between casale and corot eight slots two of them empty i read the labels cassatt m mothers kiss c aquatint with drypoint and softground catal breeskin in cassatt m maternal caress c aquatint with drypoint and softground catal breeskin in the rest of the six accounted for framed and glassed i pulled them out carefully all blackandwhite no mother and child scenes the two best prints gone one for the patients gray room one for the doctors i recalled the way the gabneys had behaved this morning leo trying to project sympathy but making sure to tell me that chickerings suicide theory was nonsense damage control ursula operating on a whole other level touching the chaucer doors as if they led to a shrine or a treasure trove i thought of ginas unaccounted petty cash two million had the gifts gone beyond art therapeutic transference as a pathway to riches dependency and terror could create a cancer of the soul those with the cure could name their price i thought of gifts id been offered mostly handmade creations of little children potholders popsiclestick picture frames drawings clay sculptures my office at home was full of them in the case of adult offerings i had a policy of accepting only tokens flowers candy a yellowwrapped basket of fruit i turned down anything of significant and lasting value doing it graciously was sometimes an ordeal no one had ever shoved a piece of rare art in my hands still i liked to think i would have turned that down too not that accepting gifts was indictable ethically it lay somewhere in the fuzzy area between felony and bad judgment and i was certainly no saint immune to the pleasures of a bargain but id gone to school to learn how to do a certain job and most responsible therapists agreed that any sizable gift in either direction reduced the chances of doing the job correctly shaking the therapeutic balance by immutably altering the relationship that forms the core of change apparently the gabneys disagreed perhaps a treatment that involved house calls and openended sessions lent itself to a relaxation of the rules i thought of how much time id spent in this house foraging in the attic but my intentions were noble as opposed to melissa had reacted to the bond between her mother and ursula with growing suspicion shes cold i feel she wants to shut me out reactions discounted by everyone including me because melissa was a highstrung kid dealing with dependency and separation and threatened by anyone who got close to her mother little girl who cried wolf was any of it relevant to ginas fate another visit to the clinic seemed in order though i wasnt sure how id approach the gabneys picking up ginas chart saving them the price of postage in the neighborhood decided to stop by and then what god only knew today was sunday it would have to wait meanwhile there were lamb chops to deal with a meal i was willing to bet would be firstrate too bad my appetite had waned i restored arthur dickinsons hideaway to its original condition and went downstairs i ate by myself in the big dark dining room feeling more like hired help than lord of the manor when i left the house at onefifty melissa and noel were still up in the bedroom talking in low earnest tones i intended to head for home but found myself driving past the gabney clinic a gunmetalgray lincoln and a woodsided mercury station wagon were parked in front ursulas saab sat at the mouth of the driveway ginas therapy group one day early emergency session to deal with her death or another group led by the dedicated doctor two oclock if the onetothree schedule was adhered to the session would be over in an hour i decided to keep an eye on the building call milo while i was waiting i looked for a phone directly across the street were houses farther to the south the neighborhood was completely residential but catercornered a block north stood a row of storefronts a prewar golden brick building with limestone insets and domed brown awnings over each shop i cruised past slowly the first establishment was a restaurant then a real estate office a candy shop and an antique gallery with hall trees and odd tables out on the sidewalk beyond that another couple of commercial blocks then apartments the restaurant was my best bet i turned around pulled up in front of it cute little bistro affair la mystique in frosted script on the windows art nouveau letters surrounded by a garland peppermint and white petunias in a box under the window a banner over the flowers announced brunch inside were eight tables covered with blueandwhite checkered cloths sprigs of daisies and lavender in blue glass vases white chairs and walls european travel posters an open kitchen behind a low plexiglas partition in which a hispanic man wearing a chefs toque labored two of the tables were occupied both by pairs of conservatively dressed middleaged women what was on their plates tended toward the green and leafy they paused to look up as i entered then resumed playing with their food a conspicuously busty fairhaired woman of around thirty came forward holding a menu she had a full friendly face not quite brightened by a nervous smile her hair was tied in a bun and bound with a black ribbon and she wore a kneelength black knit dress that emphasized her chest but failed otherwise to flatter as she came toward me i could see an undertow of anxiety tugging at the smile brandnewbusiness anxiety stillinthered anxiety she said hello please sit anywhere youd like i looked around noticed that the two window tables offered an oblique but clear view of the clinic how about there i said and do you have a pay phone i could use right through the back she pointed to dutch doors to the left of the kitchen the phone was mounted on the wall between the bathrooms after two rings milos new businesslike message kicked in i told him i had a few things i wanted to discuss said id probably be back at melissas house by four then i dialed an art gallery in beverly hills that id dealt with before and asked for the owner eugene de long speaking eugene its alex delaware hello alex nothing on the marsh yet were still looking for one in acceptable condition thanks actually im calling to find out if you can give me an evaluation of a piece or two pieces really same artist nothing formal just an approximation certainly if its something i know about cassatt color print moment of silence i didnt know you were in the market for that kind of thing wish i were its for a friend is your friend buying or selling maybe selling i see he said which particular color prints i told him he said just one second and put me on hold for several minutes he came back saying ive got the most recent auction figures for comparable works right here as you know with works on paper condition is everything so without inspecting it i cant be sure however cassatts print runs tended to be low she was a perfectionist had no compunctions about burnishing down her initial impressions and reworking the plates so any decent piece would be interesting especially color if youve indeed got the final states in excellent condition full margins no stains youve got a couple of jewels i could get a quarter of a million from the right client maybe more both or each oh each especially in the current climate the japanese are crazy for impressionism and cassatts at the top of their american list i expect her important paintings to be fetching solid seven figures very shortly the prints actually reflect a blending of western and asian sensibilities she was highly influenced by japanese printmaking that appeals to them even three hundred wouldnt be out of the question for a really fine impression thanks eugene my pleasure tell your friend he or shes got a blue chip investment but in all honesty the major appreciation probably hasnt taken place however if he or she does want to sell theres no need to go to new york ill pass it along bonsoir alex i closed my eyes and pictured zeros for a while then i dialed my service and found out robin had called i called her studio when she picked up i said hi its me hi just wanted to see how you were doing pretty well still out here on a case and here is pasadena san labrador ah she said old money old secrets if you only knew how right you were esp she said if the world ever stops strumming ill get into tea leaves or stock trading no not that jail isnt my thing i laughed anyway she said howre you doing fine hows mr panics guitar just a scratch really it wasnt even close to an emergency i think hes finally going off the deep end too much sobriety i laughed again id like to see you again when things ease up sure she said when things ease up silence soon i said though i had nothing to back that up thats even better i went back into the restaurant there was a basket of bread and a glass of ice water on the table two of the lunching women had left the other two were settling their check with a pocket calculator and furrowed brows the bread smelled fresh slices of whole wheat and baguettes tinged with anise but madeleines light meal had stuffed me and i pushed it aside the woman who had seated me noticed and i thought i saw her flinch i picked up the menu the two customers left the woman picked up their credit slip glanced at it and shook her head after wiping the table she came over to me pencil at the ready i ordered the most expensive coffee listed triple espresso with a dash of napoleon brandy and a bowl of jumbo strawberries she brought the berries first truth in advertising they were as big as peaches the coffee a few minutes later still foaming i smiled at her she looked worried everything okay sir great terrific berries we get them from carpenteria would you like some fresh cream no thanks i smiled and let my eyes drift across the street wondering what was going on behind the craftsman facade calculating the hours of therapy necessary to buy a quarterofamilliondollar piece of paper trying to figure out how id deal with the gabneys when the proprietress came back a few minutes later the level of coffee in my cup was one third lower and only two strawberries were gone something the matter sir not at all everythings fine i sipped to prove it then speared the most gargantuan of the strawberries on my fork we import all our coffee she said simpson and veroni buy from exactly the same source but they charge twice as much i had no idea who simpson and veroni were but i smiled and shook my head and said figures the empathy didnt impress her if this was her usual interpersonal style i could see why the public wasnt beating a path to her door i took another swallow and began working on the berry she lingered for a second went into the kitchen and began conferring with the chef i resumed looking out the window glanced at my watch less than half an hour till show time what would i say to ursula gabney the busty woman came out from the kitchen with the sunday paper under one arm sat down at one of the tables and began reading as she put aside the front section and picked up the metro our eyes met she pulled away quickly i gulped down the rest of my coffee without rising she said anything else no thanks she brought me the check i handed her a credit card she took it stared at it returned with a slip and said youre a doctor i realized then how i must have appeared to her clothes id slept in unshaven i said im a psychologist theres a clinic across the street im on my way over there to talk to one of the doctors uhhuh she said looking doubtful dont worry i said putting on my best smile im not one of the patients been working a long shift emergency case that seemed to spook her so i produced my license and med school faculty card scouts honor she relaxed a bit said what kind of things do they do over there dont really know i said had any problems because of them oh no its just that you dont see too many people going in and out and theres no sign telling anyone what kind of place it is i wouldnt have even known what it was except one of my customers told me it just made me wonder what they do in there i dont know much about it myself my specialty is working with children one of my patients is the child of a woman who used to be treated there maybe you noticed her she used to come in an old rollsroyce black and gray she nodded i did see a car like that a couple of times but i never noticed who drove it the woman who owned it disappeared a few days ago its been pretty hard on the child i came over to learn what i could disappeared what do you mean she set out for the clinic never showed up and hasnt been seen oh a new kind of anxiety one that had nothing to do with balance sheets i looked up at her fingered the credit slip you know she said then shook her head what is it nothing its probably nothing i shouldnt mix in in things that dont concern me if you know anything no she said emphatically its not about your patients mother another one of their patients the customer i mentioned the one who told me what kind of place it was she used to come in here didnt seem as if there was anything wrong with her she said she used to be afraid of going places phobic thats why she was going for treatment but shed gotten a lot better you would have thought shed like the place the clinic be grateful but she didnt seem to not that you should quote me on that i really dont need any headaches she touched the credit slip you still need to total and sign i did adding a percent tip thank you she said my pleasure what made you think this woman didnt like the clinic just the way she talked asking lots of questions about them glancing across the street not right away after shed been coming for a while what kinds of questions how long theyd been here i had no idea just moved in myself did the doctors or any of the other patients ever come in here that was an easy one not even once except kathy that was her name she didnt seem afraid of anything kind of aggressive actually but i liked her she was friendly liked my food and she came in all the time i really liked the idea of having a regular then one day out of the blue she just stopped snapping her fingers just like that i thought it was strange especially because she hadnt mentioned anything about being finished with her treatment so when you said this other woman disappeared it kind of reminded me of that though kathy didnt really disappear she just stopped showing up how long ago was this she thought about a month ago first i thought it was something to do with the food but she stopped going over there too i knew her car shed been on a regular schedule monday and thursday afternoon like clockwork at threefifteen shed be in here for angel hair pasta or scallops cappuccino royale and a raisin croissant i appreciated it because to tell the truth business has not been booming yet were still establishing our presence my husband has been itoldyousoing for three months i started sunday brunch last week but it hasnt exactly raised the dead i clucked my tongue in sympathy she smiled i called this place la mystique for mystery he says the only mystery is when im going to fold so ive got to prove him wrong thats why i especially appreciated kathys patronage i still wonder what happened to her do you remember her last name why im just trying to contact everyone who knew my patients mother you never know what little detail might tell us something she hesitated then one sec she pocketed the credit slip went back into the kitchen as i waited i looked over at the clinic building no one entered or exited not a hint of life behind the windows she returned with a square of yellow message paper this is kathys sisters address she gave her as a reference at the beginning because she used to pay by check and her own checks were outofstate i actually thought of giving a call but never got around to it if you speak to her give her my best tell her joyce said hi i took the paper and read it neatly printed letters in red felttip marker kathy moriarty co robbins ashbourne dr s pas a phone number i put it in my wallet got up and said thanks everything was great all you had was berries and coffee come back sometime when youre hungry were good we really are she walked back to her table and the newspaper i got up looked out the window saw movement a statelylooking grayhaired woman getting into the lincoln the station wagon already pulling away from the curb time for a chat with dr ursula but i was disabused of that notion as i reached the sidewalk the saab shot backwards out of the driveway came to a short stop and sped northward so fast i barely had a glimpse of the drivers tense beautiful face by the time i got behind the wheel of the seville she was out of sight i sat for a while wondering what had drawn her away opened the glove compartment took out my thomas guide and looked up ashbourne drive the house was a generously proportioned usedbrick tudor on a wide ungated lot shaded by maples and firs a plymouth van in the driveway shadowed a scattered collection of toy bikes and wagons three brick steps and a porch led to the front entrance the door featured a tiny brass replica of itself set at eye level a bellring the tiny door creaked open and a pair of dark eyes peered out a tv cartoon soundtrack blared from within the eyes narrowed dr delaware to see mrs robbins please wan meen i waited straightening my clothes and fingercombing my hair hoping my dress shirt and tie would make the stubble look like intentional hip westside hip wrong neighborhood the little door opened again blue eyes pupils contracting yes young voice slightly nasal mrs robbins what can i do for you my name is dr alex delaware im trying to locate your sister kathy are you a friend of kathys no not actually but we have a mutual acquaintance what kind of doctor are you clinical psychologist im sorry to bust in on you like this and ill be happy to show you identification and some professional credentials yes why dont you do that i pulled the appropriate snips of paper out of my wallet and held them up one by one she said who do you and kathy both know its something i really need to discuss with her personally mrs robbins if youre not comfortable giving me her number ill give you mine and she can call me the blue eyes moved back and forth the little door slammed shut again and the big one opened a woman in her late thirties came out onto the front porch five six trim strawberryblond hair cut in a bob the blue eyes deepset in a long freckled face full lips pointed chin slightly protruding ears that the short hair flaunted she wore a shortsleeved boatneck top with horizontal redandwhite stripes white canvas pants and tennies without socks tiny diamonds in her ears she could have been one of las labradoras jan robbins she said looking me over her nails were long but unpolished its best that we talk out here sure i said conscious of every wrinkle in my suit she waited until id backed away a bit before closing the front door behind her so why are you looking for kathy i considered how much to say had kathy moriartys sessions at the clinic been something shed withheld from her sister shed talked openly to joyce at the restaurant but strangers were often seen as the safest repositories of confidences its complicated i said it would really be best if i talked to your sister directly mrs robbins im sure it would doctor id like to speak with her directly myself but i havent heard from her in over a month before i could reply she said not that its the first time given the way she lives her career what career is that journalism writing she used to work for the boston globe and the manchester union leader but now shes on her own freelancing trying to get her own books published she actually had one out a few years ago on pesticidesthe bad earth i said nothing she smiled with some satisfaction i thought it wasnt exactly a bestseller is she from new england originally no originally shes from here california we both grew up in fresno but she went back east after college said she considered the west coast a cultural wasteland she gave a quick look at the van and the toy bikes and frowned did she come back out on a writing project i said i assume so she never told me never talked about her work at all confidential sources of course you dont have any idea what she was doing no not in the least were not were very different she didnt spend much time here she stopped folded her arms across her chest now that i think about it how did you find out i was her sister she used you as a reference in order to cash an outofstate check at a restaurant the owner gave me your address great she said figures thank god the check didnt bounce she have a problem with money not with spending it look ive really got to get inside im sorry i cant help you she started to turn away i said so her being gone for a month doesnt concern you she pivoted sharply for her pesticide book she traveled all over the country for more than a year we never heard from her unless she ran short of cash instead of repaying what shed borrowed we got a signed copy of the book my husbands a corporate attorney handles chemical accounts you can imagine how much he appreciated that a few years before that she went to el salvador some sort of investigative thing very cloakanddagger six months she was gone not a call not even a postcard my mother was scared out of her mind and we never even saw a story come out of that one so no it doesnt concern me shes out chasing another intrigue what kind of intrigue generally interests her anything with a hint of conspiracy she fancies herself an investigative reporter still thinks the kennedy assassination makes for fascinating dinner table conversation pause cartoon sounds from inside the house she gave a hard swipe at her hair this is ridiculous i dont even know you i shouldnt be talking to you in the unlikely event i hear from her soon ill tell her you want to talk to her wheres your office west side i said do you have a recent address for her she thought for a moment sure why not if she can give out mine i can give out hers i pulled out a pen and using my knee for a table wrote on the back of a business card as she reeled off an address on hilldale avenue thats west hollywood she said closer to your part of town standing there as if expecting me to answer some challenge i said thanks sorry to bother you sure she said looking at the van again i know i sound hardhearted but its just that ive tried for a long time to help her but she goes her own way no matter who she touched her mouth as if forcefully hushing it were very different thats all vive la différence you psychologists believe in that right i got back to sussex knoll by fourfifteen noels celica was parked in front along with a brown mercedes twoseater with a dodger blue sticker on the rear bumper and a cellular antenna on the rear deck madeleine opened the door for me how is she she said upstairs monsieur doctor she eats a little soup has mr sturgis called non but others she cocked her head toward the front room and curled her lips in scorn a conspiratorial gesture i was an insider now she said they wait for whom she shrugged the two of us crossed the entry when we got to the room she veered and kept walking toward the back of the house glenn anger and a heavyset bald man in his fifties were sitting in the overstuffed chairs legs crossed looking clubby both wore dark blue sack suits white shirts and pocket squares foulard ties angers cravat was a pink miniprint the other mans yellow when i was a few feet away they stood and buttoned their jackets the bald man was six feet tall with a powerlifters build gone slightly to seed his face was square and beefy above an eighteeninch neck his tan every bit as good as angers and the one don ramp had sported before life had ground him pale the little hair he had was wispy and colored an insipid browngray most of it ran around the sides of his head and looked as thin as a greasepaint smear a tiny teased puff topped his crown well said anger i suppose your work here is at an end looking grimly satisfied to the bald man this is one of the detectives hired to search for gina jim not exactly i said my name is alex delaware im melissas psychologist anger looked baffled then peeved i said mr sturgis the detective is a friend of mine i referred the family to him i happened to be with him when we went to your office i see well thats sorry for not clarifying but given the urgency at the time it didnt seem important well said anger i suppose it wasnt the bald man cleared his throat anger said doctor it is doctor delaware i nodded doctor meet jim douse ginas attorney one side of douses mouth smiled he shook my hand exposing a monogrammed cuff his hand was big and padded and surprisingly rough weekends spent away from the desk and he curled his fingers in a way that prevented much contact between our palms reserving judgment on how friendly he wanted to get or the special care very strong men sometimes exercise so as not to inflict pain he said doctor in a smokers rasp the tips of two cigars protruded from behind his pocket square psychologist i use them from time to time in court i nodded wondering if that was an icebreaker or a threat he said hows our little girl doing last time i saw her she was resting im on my way up there to check cliff chickering told me the terrible news said anger this morning in church jim and i came by to see if there was anything we could do what a stinking thing i never actually believed it would come to this douse looked at him as if introspection were a felony then shook his head in a delayed show of sympathy i said has the search been called off anger nodded cliff said they stopped looking a few hours ago hes convinced shes at the bottom of that dam hes also convinced she put herself there i said anger looked uncomfortable douse said ive suggested to mr chickering that any further theorizing should be backed up with fact lifting his chin he ran a finger around the interior of his shirt collar anger said damned accident is what it was thats obvious she shouldnt have been out there driving in the first place i said if youll excuse me gentlemen im going to see melissa give her our condolences doctor said anger if shed like us to come up we will if not well be available whenever shes ready to tackle the transition just let us know what transition is that transfer of status said douse theres never a good time for it but it needs to be done as quickly as possible routine procedures paperwork the government giving itself something to do everythings got to be followed to the letter or uncle sam gets his dander up anger said shes too young to deal with it the sooner we get everything squared away the better too young to deal with paperwork i said too young to deal with the mechanics said anger the burden of management she should be doing other things with her life said douse wouldnt you say that psychologically speaking feeling as if id been beamed down to a senate subcommittee meeting i said youre saying she shouldnt manage her own money silence dropped like a theater curtain its complicated said douse lots of inane regulations because of the size of the estate anger pursed his lips and busied himself with a jumpyeyed appraisal of the old masters on the walls douse said unless it can be shown to me that youll have an extended role in the matter im not able to go into details with you doctor but speaking generally let me say this without concrete proof of an actual act of decession it will take substantial time to establish the validity of the heirs tenancy and rights and subsequent transfer of ownership of those rights and the concomitant property he stopped and watched me when i didnt move he went on when i say substantial time i mean just that what were dealing with here is multiple jurisdictions everything from local up to federal because of the dynamics of the tax code and thats just in terms of basic transfer it doesnt even start to consider the whole issue of guardianship guarding her rights there are matters of proxy ownership various fine points of estate law and of course the irs always steps in and tries to plunder whatever it can though with the trusts that have been established were on solid ground regarding that can of worms guardianship i said melissas reached her majority why would she need a guardian anger looked at douse douse looked back at him ocular tennis match the ball finally landed in the bankers court majority he said is one thing competence is another youre suggesting melissas incompetent to run her own affairs anger returned his attention to the paintings affairs said douse doesnt even begin to describe it he swept an arm around the room how many eighteenyearolds would be competent to manage something of this magnitude i know mine sure wouldnt mine neither said anger add to that the emotional stress the family history he turned to me youd have a good handle on that it sounded like an invitation i didnt rsvp douse touched his bald head from where im sitting he said both as her attorney and as a parent my educated judgment is that her resources would be put to optimal use just trying to grow up god knows its going to be hard enough considering thats for sure said anger ive got four at home doctor all teens or tweens were going through the wringer majorleague hormone alert give an adolescent lots of money might as well hand them a loaded gun do you have kids of your own doctor said douse no i said both of them gave knowing smiles well said douse playing with a jacket button as i said thats about all im free to divulge barring an extended role for you what kind of role should you choose to commit yourself to an extended course of psychological consultation coordinating the management of melissas emotional affairs in sync with glenns and my stewardship of the financial aspects of her life id be sure to see that your views were considered at all critical junctures and well compensated let me get this straight i said youd like me to help you certify melissa psychologically incapable of handling her own affairs so that a guardian can be appointed to manage her money anger winced wrong said douse we dont want anything our welfare isnt whats at stake here were only thinking of hers as longtime friends of the family and as parents and professional managers and were in no way attempting to influence your judgment or opinion this conversation which i might remind you originated spontaneously simply reflects a discussion of issues that have acquired a certain sense of urgency due to unforeseen events plainly put doctor we need to square things away damned quickly one thing you should be clear on doctor said anger is that the moneys not melissas yet not in a legal sense shed have a heck of a time getting hold of it before the process completes itself and as jim said the wheels of bureaucracy grind slowly the process will take a long time months or even longer in the meantime her needs have to be met the running of this household salaries repairs not to mention marshaling investments through a web of regulations things need to progress smoothly as far as i can see a guardians clearly the best way to go whod be the guardian don ramp douse cleared his throat and shook his head no he said that would contravene the spirit if not the letter of arthur dickinsons will who then more dead air footsteps thumped somewhere in the big house a vacuum whined the phone rang once my firm said douse has been of long service to this family theres a certain logic to seeing that continue i said nothing he unbuttoned his jacket pulled out a small crocodile case removed a white business card and gave it to me gravely as if it were something of value j madison douse jr attorney at law wresting douse and cosner s flower street los angeles ca douse said the founding partner was chief justice douse leaving out the my uncle part confusing conspicuous discretion with class anger blew it by saying jims uncle douse cleared his throat without opening his mouth the end result was a deep bullish snort anger hastened to repair the douse and dickinson families have been bonded by many years of implicit trust and goodwill arthur entrusted his affairs to jims dad back in the days when those affairs were even more complex than they are now its in your patients best interests that she be taken care of by the best doctor right now i said its in my patients best interests to marshal her emotional defenses in order to deal with losing her mother exactly said anger thats exactly the reason jim and i would like to see everything squared away as soon as possible the problem said douse is one of procedural transfer establishing continuity every step of the process as it currently operates was contingent upon mrs ramps approval even though she had little to do in terms of a handson daytoday management role legally procedurally we were required to interface with her now that shes no longer available were obligated to deal with her heir i said must be a hell of an inconvenience douse buttoned his jacket and leaned forward his forehead puckered and wrinkled and he sniffed like a tackle out for a quarterback i sense a combativeness here dr delaware thats wholly unwarranted by the facts at hand maybe i said or maybe i just dont like the idea of being asked to lie professionally even if your intentions are good melissas not incompetent nowhere near it she hasnt a trace of thought disorder or any other mental disturbance that would impair her judgment as to whether or not shes mature enough to handle forty million dollars who knows howard hughes and leland belding werent much older when they took over their parents estates and neither of them did too badly and banks and law firms have been known to screw up handily havent they whatre the latest figures on the sandl mess that said anger coloring has nothing to do with whatever i said the bottom line is any decision to delegate management of melissas money will have to be melissas and it will have to be voluntary douse pressed his fingertips together withdrew them repeated the gesture several times it might have been a parody of applause his eyes were steady and small he said well theres obviously no need for you to assume the burden of assessment doctor given your reluctance what does that mean bring in the hiredgun expert witnesses his face remained blank as he showed his cuff monogram and consulted a goldandrivet cartier that looked much too small for his wrist nice meeting you doctor to anger this clearly isnt a good time to be visiting glenn well come back when shes feeling more up to it anger nodded but he looked offbalance none of his trophies had been for overt conflict douse touched his elbow and the two of them walked past me heading for the entry and came facetoface with melissa who stepped out from behind a tall bookcase her hair was tied in a ponytail she had on a black blouse over a kneelength khaki skirt no stockings black sandals something pink was clenched in her right hand a balled tissue melissa said anger switching on a loandenial sadface im so sorry about your mother hon you know mr douse douse held out his hand melissa opened her palm and showed the tissue douse dropped his arm mr douse she said i know who you are but weve never met have we sorry it has to be under these circumstances said the attorney yes how kind of you to come and on a sunday days dont matter when it comes to something like this said anger we came by to see how you were doing but dr delaware told us you were resting and we were just on our way out mr douse she said ignoring him and stepping closer to the attorney mr douse mr douse please douse any ideas of ripping me off okay mr douse no dont even say a word just leave right now both of youout my new attorneys and my new bankers will be contacting you shortly after they were gone she cried out in rage and collapsed against me weeping noel came running down the stairs looking scared and confused and eager to comfort he saw her pressed to my chest and stopped midway down the flight i motioned him forward with a small backward movement of my head he stepped very close to her and said melissa she kept crying pushed her head into my sternum so hard it hurt i patted her back it seemed inadequate finally she pulled away redeyed face blazing oh she said oh the bastards how could they how could they have the shes not even oh choking on her words she wheeled ran to a wall hit it hard with her fists noel looked to me for counsel i nodded and he went to her she allowed him to guide her into the front room the three of us sat down madeleine came in looking angry but smug as if her worst assumptions about mankind had been confirmed once again i wondered how much shed heard more footsteps the other two maids appeared behind madeleine she said something and they hurried off madeleine walked over and touched melissas head melissa looked up and pushed a smile through her tears madeleine said i bring you to drink melissa didnt answer i said please tea for all of us madeleine lumbered off melissa sat hunched under noels protective forearm jaw clenched tearing the tissue to shreds and letting them fall to the floor madeleine returned with tea honey and milk on a silver tray she served handing a cup to noel who guided it toward melissas lips melissa drank choked sputtered all three of us hurried to attend to her the resulting flurry of arms was keystonish it might have been comical under different circumstances when the dust cleared noel again held the cup to melissas lips she took a sip started to gag put her hand to her chest and managed to hold it down when shed finished a third of the cup madeleine nodded in approval and left melissa touched noels hand and said enough thanks he put the cup down she said the bastards unbelievable who said noel my banker and my lawyer she said trying to rip me off to me thanks thanks so much for sticking up for me dr delaware i know who my true friends are noel remained confused i gave him a brief replay of the interchange with anger and douse each word seemed to inflate his own anger assholes he said better get yourself some new ones fast oh yeah she said i made it sound as if i already had someone hired you should have seen the looks on their faces brief smile noel remained serious melissa said do you know any good lawyers dr delaware most of the ones i know practice family law but i should be able to get you a referral for an estate lawyer please id really appreciate it and a banker too the estate lawyer should be able to refer you to a banker good she said the sooner the better before those two worms try anything for all i know theyve already been filing some kind of papers against me insight widened her eyes ill have milo check them out hell be able to find out what theyre up to theyve probably ripped me off already wouldnt you say who knows well she said they havent exactly shown themselves to be honorable for all i know theyve been ripping off mother all these years closing her eyes noel hugged her tighter she allowed it but didnt relax her eyes opened suddenly maybe don was in it with them all of them scheming no said noel don wouldnt she cut him off with a slashing diagonal movement of one arm you see one side of him i see another noel was silent melissas eyes got huge oh god what is it i said maybe they even had something to do with with what happened maybe they wanted her money and she shot to her feet throwing noel off balance dryeyed hands fisted one fist rose to eye level and shook ill get them she said the bastards anyone who hurt her will pay noel stood she held him at arms length no its all right ill be all right i know where i stand now she began walking around the room circling sticking close to the walls like a novice skater taking wide steps and speeding her pace till it was nearly a jog scowling and extending her lower jaw and punching her hand with a fist sleeping beauty roused by the malignant kiss of suspicion anger replacing fear incompatible with fear id treated an entire school that way the previous fall had taught her the same lesson years ago this childs anger whitehot the look on her face almost savage i watched and could think of nothing but a hungry animal in a cage psychological progress i guessed milo showed up shortly after wearing a brown suit and carrying a shiny black briefcase melissa latched onto him and told him what had happened get them she said ill check it out he said but itll take some time in the meantime get yourself a lawyer whatever it takes please who knows what theyve been up to at least he said theyre on notice if theyve been up to something larcenous theyll probably quit for the moment noel said true milo said to melissa how are you doing otherwise better im going to get through it i have to if theres something you need me to do i can do it what you can do for the time being is take care of yourself she started to object milo said no im not brushing you off i mean it just in case they decide to keep pushing what do you mean she said these guys are obviously out to run the show if they can convince a judge youre screwed up theyve got a shot at it i may get dirt on them or i may not while im digging theyll be stockpiling ammunition the better you look physically and psychologically the less ammunition theyre gonna have so take care of yourself he looked over at me if you have to scream scream at him thats his job she let noel take her upstairs milo said did it happen the way she said i nodded they were a couple of real sweethearts came on concerned then eased into the grand plan kind of stupid though showing their cards like that not necessarily he said in most cases it would work because the average eighteenyearold would be intimidated and agree to let a couple of suits handle everything and plenty of shrinks would go along with what they offered you for the right compensation he scratched his nose be interesting to know what theyre really after id say filthy lucres a good guess question is how much lucre are they out to totally drain the estate or just maintain managerial control so they can beef up their fees a couple of percent people who live off the rich get into a rut start thinking they have a right to it or maybe i said they made some bad investments and want to keep it quiet wouldnt be the first time he said but the thing weve got to consider is despite all these maybes do they still have a valid point one that would look good to a judge can she handle that kind of dough alex hows she really doing emotionally im not sure shes gone from drowsy to enraged awfully quickly but nothing pathological when you consider what shes been through say it in court that way and shes finished forty million dollars would be tough for anyone milo if i were king of the world i wouldnt give any kid that much but no theres no psychological justification for declaring her incompetent i could back her up anyway he said whats the worst thing that could happen she pisses it away has to start from scratch shes smart enough could do something useful with her life maybe it would be the best thing ever happened to her financial collapse as a therapeutic technique good excuse for doctors raising their fees he smiled in the meantime ill do what i can to check out anger and the other guy though its gonna be damned hard to pierce that kind of armor quickly she really needs legal help i thought id call someone on that good he lifted his briefcase that new i said picked it up today got an image to uphold this privateeye business is heady stuff did you get the message i left with your machine a couple of hours ago several things to talk about sure but ive been a busy little private bee scooping up honeycombs of information how about a sharefest i motioned to one of the overstuffed chairs no he said lets get the hell out of here breathe some normal air if its okay for you to leave let me check i climbed the stairs went to melissas room the door was partially open as i raised my hand to knock i looked through the crack and saw melissa and noel stretched out on the bed fully clothed entwined her fingers in his hair his arm around her waist rubbing the small of her back bare feet toes touching before they noticed me i tiptoed away milo was in the entry hall refusing a plate of food from madeleine full he said patting his belly thanks anyway she regarded him as if he were a wayward son we smiled and left once outside he said i lied actually im hungry as hell and her stuffs probably tastier than anything were gonna get somewhere else but the place gets to me after a while i od on being taken care of me too i said getting into the car think how melissa feels yeah he said starting up the engine well now shell be on her own any suggestions cuisinewise as a matter of fact i have just the place start of the dinner hour la mystique was empty as i pulled up in front milo said gee are we gonna have to wait at the bar i said thats the gabney clinic and pointed to the big brown house the windows were dark and the driveway was empty ah said milo squinting little spooky he turned back to the restaurant so whats this place your lookout post just a warm kind resting spot for the weary sojourner joyce was startled to see me again but she welcomed me as if i were longlost kin and offered the same front table sitting there at this hour would have turned us into a window display so i asked to be seated at the back she took our drink orders and came back with two grolsches as she poured she said weve got poached striped bass and veal vino for specials and launched into a detailed speech about the preparation for each i said ill have the bass milo scanned the menu hows the entrecôte excellent sir thats what ill have bloody rare with double potatoes she stepped behind the partition into the kitchen and began cooking we touched glasses and drank beer i said according to anger chickering said the search for gina is over not surprised last time i checked with the sheriffs was onethirty this afternoon they were pretty much winding down not a trace of her anywhere in the park lady in the lake huh looks that way he ran his hand over his face okay time to share who first go ahead basically he said its been hooray for hollywood spent most of my day talking to movie people and exmovie people and associated hangerson crotty no crottys gone died a couple of months ago oh i said thinking of the scrawny old vice cop turned gay activist i thought the azt was working we all did unfortunately he didnt sat on the porch of that little farm he had up in the hills and ate a gun sorry yeah in the end he did it like a cop anyway what i learned in cinemaville apparently gina and ramp and mccloskey were all pretty chummy back in the good old days there was this group of contract players at apex studios during the mid to late sixties mccloskey wasnt exactly part of it but he hung out with them started his modeling agency by getting the others photo gigs pretty faces both sexes from everything i hear they were a wild bunch lots of boozing and doping and partying though no one has anything bad to say about gina specifically so if she sinned she did it quietly most of them never went anywhere careerwise gina was the most likely to succeed but the acid thing kiboshed that the studio knew it was a buyers market lots of fresh flesh bused in daily from iowa so it gave these kids shoestring contracts used them for walkons various ancillary services then ditched them when the wrinkles started showing ramp never mentioned knowing mccloskey more than casually he knew him all right though from what i hear they werent good buddies milo raised his briefcase to his lap opened it searched and came up with a brown marbledpaper folder inside was a blackandwhite photograph with the apex studios snowymountain logo on the lowerright margin the shot had been taken at some kind of nightclub or maybe it was just a set fluted leather booth mirrored wall whitelinened table silver service crystal ashtrays and cigarette boxes half a dozen goodlooking people in their early twenties wearing stylish evening clothes smiling photogenically and smoking and raising glasses in a toast gina prince née paddock sat dead center blond and beautiful in an offtheshoulder gown that photographed gray and a pearl choker that emphasized the length and smoothness of her neck the resemblance to melissa was striking don ramp next to her husky and tan and healthylooking sans mustache joel mccloskey on her other side slickhaired and handsome almost pretty his smile was different from those of the others outsiders uncertain grin a cigarette between his fingers was burned down nearly to the filter two other faces a man and a woman that i didnt recognize and one at the far end that i did this i said pointing to a sharpfeatured brunette in a dangerously lowcut black dress is bethel drucker noels mother shes blond now but this is her i just met her today she works for ramp as a waitress at his restaurant she and noel live upstairs my my said milo one big happy family he pulled another piece of paper out of the briefcase lets see she must be becky dupont nom du cinéma leaning forward he took hold of a corner of the photo goodlooking woman voluptuous she still is goodlooking or voluptuous both though she shows some wear he looked toward the kitchen where joyce was working next to the chef must be the day for voluptuous tell you one thing old beckybethel liked her dope downers and quaaludes according to my sources not that you need sources look at those eyes i peered closely at the finely wrought face and saw what he meant wide dark eyes halfclosed the lids sagging the bit of iris visible dull and dreamy and distant unlike mccloskeys her smile reflected genuine bliss but the amusement had nothing to do with the party at hand it fits i said with something noel said to me today about always knowing drugs were bad he started to explain then changed his mind and said hed read about it hes a really intense kid very straitlaced and selfdirected almost too good to be true if he grew up seeing what wild living did to his mom that could explain it something about him got my antennae buzzing maybe that was it i gave him back the photo before he put it away he took another look so looks like everyone knows everyone knows everyone and hollywood has sunk its fangs into san labrador what about the other two people in the picture the guy is one of my sources to remain unnamed the girl is a wouldbe starlet named stacey brooks deceased car crash probable dui like i said a wild bunch those ancillary services they provided to the studio i said that mean the casting couch that and related stuff crowd scenes at various parties dating potential backers and other poohbahs basically being available to satisfy a variety of appetites ramp was especially versatile handsome escort for the ladies sub rosa amusement for the gentlemen he was a cooperative fellow did what he was told the studio rewarded him with a few parts mostly minor roles in westerns and cop flicks what about mccloskey my sources remember him as a swaggering toughguy type bargainbasement brando toothpick in the mouth always hinting at pals in new joisey but never really fooling anyone also he hated gays didnt hesitate to say so without being asked maybe it was real maybe he was latent and protesting too much no one seems to have a clear handle on who he went to bed with other than gina what they do remember are his obnoxious personality and his heavy doping speed coke grass pills for a while when his business was failing he got into dealing supplying people at the studio then trading modeling services for dope that finished his agency off the models wanted to get paid in cash and he didnt have any did he ever get busted for dealing no why do you ask i was just wondering if gina might have had something to do with getting him in trouble with the law or if he thought she had it would have been a reason to have her burned yeah it sure would but no dope record no previous arrests of any kind before the attack joyce brought bread when she left i said how about this then his homophobia was a cover for his being gay gina found out and they had some kind of confrontation over it maybe she even threatened to blow his toughguy cover it set mccloskey off and he hired findlay to get her it would explain why he refused to talk about his motives it would have humiliated him could be he said but then why wouldnt she have let the cat out good question maybe he said it was something a lot more simple mccloskey and gina and ramp got involved in a triangle and mccloskey eventually freaked out remember the way they were sitting in the picture shes the meat in the sandwich in any event its probably ancient history probably has nothing to do with her disappearance other than telling us something about mr r prosperous businessman trying to forget about providing ancillary services yeah even when we were looking for his wife and mccloskey was a potential suspect he didnt talk about the bad old days even though he was the one pointing a finger at mccloskey youd think hed want to tell us anything that could help find her unless there was nothing to tell i said if gina never knew why mccloskey burned her why would ramp maybe he said what is clear is that gina had to be aware of ramps sexuality when she married him bi guys arent considered prime matrimonial material nowadays the physical risk on top of the social but that didnt stop her separate bedrooms i said no risk yeah but whats his allure for her hes a nice guy tolerant of her lifestyle so she puts up with his and he does appear to be a softie taking in an old friend like bethel paying for noels college maybe after all the brutality gina experienced she wanted compassion more than sex old friend he said wonder how bethel feels about hopping tables while her former buddies live in the peach palace noel hinted that he and his mom had been through some really hard times hopping tables might very well be a big step up suppose so he said taking a piece of bread i said you keep coming back to ramp i went down to the beach today to talk to nyquist and the place was cleaned out neighbor said nyquist packed his van last night and headed out for parts unknown the brentwood country club says he didnt show up for some tennis lessons he was supposed to give today didnt bother to call in ramps folding his tent too asked noel to pack him a bag maybe its the trauma of losing gina hes tired of all the pretense but itll be interesting to see if he eventually files a claim against the will or cashes in on some insurance policy no one knew existed not to mention the missing two million whod be in a better position to siphon that off than the husband melissas suspicions validated he said out of the mouths of babes ramps presence is accounted for the day gina disappeared but what about todd maybe he seduced her to get closer to the two million in any event hes someone she would have picked up if his car broke down near the house and she saw him thumbing and now he and ramp are both on the move ramps still around i drove by his restaurant before i stopped by the house his mercedes was in the lot and i peeked my head in he was out cold stinking drunk bethel clucking over him like a mama hen i left and parked across the street observed the place for a while no sign of nyquist one thing milo if ramps planning an escape why would he tell me and telegraph it no he said that wasnt telegraphing that was covering giving himself a plausible motive for leaving overwhelmed with grief the poor sucker left with nothing so no onell suspect tahiti with todd not that anyones likely to suspect him anyway officially no crimes been committed and as a oneman shop im spread too thin to check him out while looking for nyquist and doing the number melissa wants me to do on anger and douse i cant justify telling her ramps a higher priority than anger and douse because ive got nothing to back me up and those two are already moving against her also it would most likely freak her out even further and i dont see that being constructive right now do you no he thought for a while what im gonna do is make a call someone i know who happens to have a real privateeyes license but doesnt use it much not too brilliant or creative but patient he can keep an eye on big don while i hit the financial trail what about nyquist nyquist is unlikely to make a move without ramp the food came milo cut chewed said they sure know how to do their trigs we ate for a few minutes my turn i said one sec he said got a couple more tidbits related to ginas first husband dickinson remember angers crack about offtherack suits turns out the reason dickinson couldnt wear one is he was a dwarf i know i found a picture of him surprise brightened his eyes where at the house up in the thirdfloor attic little freelance archaeology good for you he said i couldnt find any pictures of him at all whatd he look like i described arthur dickinson and gina as a mummy bride weird he said first hubby an old gnome second one fullsized but interested in boys all in all id say the lady wasnt oriented toward the physical agoraphobia i said the classical freudian explanation says its a symptom of sexual repression you buy that not in all cases but maybe this one it supports my theory of ginas marrying ramp because of a need for friendship the fact that they used to know each other helped their rapport along once melissa put them in touch with each other old friends reattaching mutual needs happens all the time ive got more he said on arthur seems in addition to making a fortune with the strut he also dabbled in the movies from the financial end and some of the deals he did were with apex studios so far i havent been able to connect him to any film gina or ramp or any of the other pretty faces worked on or find proof that he knew them prior to mccloskeys trial but id say its a decent possibility the old chief justice rag i said what do you mean jim douses uncle was chief justice douse hammerin harmon said milo yeah i remember anger saying that so what didnt he sit on the court when mccloskey came to trial he thought when was that no harmon was gone by then the softhearted guys were already taking over when harmon ran things the applegreen room was real busy even so i said as chief justice emeritus hed have plenty of residual clout and arthur dickinson was a client of his firm what if jacob dutchys being chosen for the mccloskey jury wasnt coincidence what if he said then repeated it you do love your conspiracies lad lifes robbed me of my innocence he smiled and cut more steak so what does any of it have to do with our lady in the lake maybe nothing but why dont you ask mccloskey given what we know maybe you can open him up maybe he needs opening up despite all our theories about complex financial motives maybe what happened to gina just boils down to simple revenge mccloskey let his anger stew for nineteen years finally reverted to type and paid someone to get her i dont know he said i do believe the guys pretty much of a zero mentally and from what ive been able to find out he has no known associates just hangs out at the mission and plays penitent suppose the operative word is plays even bad actors can improve over time true okay yeah ill give him another chance at confession tonight cant do the financial thing anyway till the banks open joyce came over to see how we were doing our compliments made her glow at least someones day had been made she brought us coffee and dessert on the house milo forked a piece of double chocolate cake and said great fabulous best i ever had and she turned incandescent when she finally left us he said okay your turn i told him the value of the cassatt twofifty he said hell of a transference that what you guys call it i nodded it smells bad and im probably not the only one who suspects the gabneys of something fishy i recounted what id learned about kathy moriarty a reporter huh an investigative reporter according to her sister she really loved conspiracies spent her life chasing them down and shes from new england worked in boston the gabneys old stamping grounds which leads me to suspect she learned about something they did back there and came to la to check it out passed herself off as an agoraphobic and joined the group in order to spy and collect dirt sounds reasonable he said but theyre ultra highpriced who paid moriartys therapy bills her sister said kathy was always hitting her up for money that kind of money i dont know maybe she had someone behind her a newspaper or a publisher shes written a book meanwhile she hasnt been heard from in over a month that makes two out of four group members gone though in kathys case the sister says thats typical but one things for certain she was no agoraphobic she had to be spying on the gabneys what youre setting up he said is financial scam number two the gabneys looting gina just like anger and the lawyer three if you include ramp and nyquist step right up he said jab a needle into the rich ladys vein forty million dollars i said equals pretty big veins even the two million would have been enough to get the gears turning i especially like the gabneys because of the kathy moriarty angle their move from boston to la maybe it was out of necessity avoiding a scandal harvard avoiding a scandal i nodded even more reason to cover it up but kathy moriarty picked up the trail somehow and decided to follow it milo ate some more cake licked his lips said from what you told me the gabneys were pretty well regarded professionally very well regarded leo gabney would probably be on any psychologists list of the top ten living behavioral experts and as a phdmd ursula could write her own ticket but even a successful therapists earning power is limited youre selling time and there are just so many billable hours even at what they charge it would take a hell of a lot of hours to earn a cassatt also leo struck me as a bitter man the first time i met him he spoke of losing his son in a fire the wound had clearly never healed he blamed it on the judge giving custody to his wife on the entire legal system maybe he deals with his anger by defying that system crime as personal vengeance he said the thrill sure why not what about ursula she have some axe to grind ursulas his protégée from what ive observed she does what he tells her though ginas death seems to have really shaken her up so perhaps shes the weak link i intended to talk to her today but she left before i had a chance protégée huh but the print ended up in her office maybe the print was just the tip of the iceberg art for her cash for both of them course at these prices a million or two wouldnt buy that much art would it we have only glenn angers word on how much gina received every month he could have programmed his computer to read any way he wanted why would gina give the gabneys dough gratitude dependency same reasons cult members give everything to the guru could have been a loan could have been but shes not around to collect is she he frowned and pushed his cake aside ramp and nyquist the buttondown boys now her goddam shrinks suspect hit parade poor thing was an equalopportunity victim like ants crawling over a beetle carcass i said milo tossed his napkin on the table what else do you know about this moriarty just her address west hollywood i pulled out the paper jan robbins had given me and handed it to him hey he said were neighbors this is maybe six blocks from my place could have stood next to her in line at the supermarket didnt know you went to the market i was speaking symbolically he lifted his briefcase to his knee rummaged and pulled out his notepad copied down the address i can stop by he said see if shes still living there if she isnt anything furthers gonna have to wait cause of all the other stuff ive got to deal with you want to spend some time pursuing it thats fine too do i get a brandnew privateeye briefcase buy your own ace were talking free enterprise i paid the check and milo chatted with joyce complimenting her further on her food commiserating on the problems of running a small business then somehow easing into the subject of kathy moriarty as if it were the next logical step she had no new facts to offer but was able to come up with a physical description of the reporter mid to late thirties medium height and build brown hair cut short buster brown style rosy complexion like what youd expect in an irish girl light eyes either blue or green then as if realizing shed given more than shed taken she crossed her arms over her chest and said why do you want to know all this milo crooked his head and led her to the rear of the restaurant a needless concealment since we were the only customers he showed her his inactive lapd badge she opened her mouth but said nothing he said its important you dont say anything to anybody please sure is something no danger to you or anyone were just making a routine inquiry about that place the clinic does something about the place bother you well she said like i was telling this gentleman it is odd so few people come in and out makes you wonder what theyre really doing in there this day and age youve got to wonder yes you do she shivered and seemed to enjoy the conspiracy milo obtained another pledge of silence from her we left the restaurant and headed back toward sussex knoll think she can keep a secret i said who knows not that important he shrugged whats the worst that can happen it gets back to the gabneys that someones asking questions if theyre not up to anything it goes nowhere if they are maybe theyll get scared and do something rash such as sell the cassatt maybe even do some other quick cashingin that lets us know theyve been holding on to some other assets of ginas gina he said her name with an easy familiarity though theyd never met a homicide cops intimacy i thought of all the others hed never met but knew so well so he was saying that okay with you is what okay he laughed youre making my point for me champ which is go home and get some sleep im fine what were you saying that you should catch some zs and check out moriartys place tomorrow morning if its an apartment building talk to the landlord or the manager if you can find them any other tenants too whats my premise your what my reason for asking questions about her i dont have a badge buy one he said on hollywood boulevard one of the costume shops be as legal as the one im using well arent we bitter i said he gave an evil grin okay you want a premise say youre an old friend just come out from the east coast youre looking her up for old times sake or youre a cousin the grand moriarty family reunions coming around soon and no one can seem to get hold of dear kathy make something up you met her sister you should be able to make it sound realistic nothing like a little deception to spice up the morning huh hey he said makes the world go round as we parked in front of the house noel drucker came out the front door carrying a large blue suitcase with a designer logo he said shes up in her room writing writing what something to do with the bank guy and the lawyer i think shes really ticked off wants to sue them milo pointed at the suitcase for the boss noel nodded any idea where hes gonna be living i guess hell stay with us till he finds a place with my mom and me upstairs at the tankard its his anyway you rent from him no he lets us stay there free pretty nice of him noel nodded he really is a nice guy i wish he threw up one hand and said whatever must be hard for you i said caught in the middle he shrugged i figure its practice for international relations for the real world he got in the red celica and drove off milo watched his taillights until they disappeared nice kid as if hed just tagged an endangered species slapping his briefcase against his leg he checked his timex ninethirty gonna make a few calls then ill boogie on down to the mission and try to get a rise out of mr deadbrain if melissa doesnt need me ill go with you he frowned what about sleep too wound up he said nothing for a moment then okay hes a nutcase maybe your training will come in handy but then do me a favor and go home and crash dont keep driving on high the engine burns out yes mom melissa was in the windowless room sitting at the desk behind a growing pile of papers she looked alarmed when we came in stood suddenly and knocked some pages to the floor strategy planning she said im trying to figure out ways of getting the bastards milo picked up the papers glanced at them and put them on the desk blank come up with anything sort of i think the best way to go is reviewing every single thing theyve been doing since since the very beginning i mean really make them open up all their books and go over every line every number at the very least itll freak them out so much theyll forget about ripping me off and i can concentrate on getting them i said good offense the best defense exactly she clapped her hands together there was color in her cheeks and her eyes glowed but it wasnt a healthy light milo was studying her but she didnt notice it did you get a chance to talk to any lawyers dr delaware not yet okay but as soon as possible all right please i could try right now that would be great thanks she lifted the phone from the desk and thrust it at me milo said i could use something to drink she looked at him then at me sure lets go get something from the kitchen alone i dialed mal worthys home number in brentwood a machine with his third wifes voice on it answered i began leaving a message and he broke in alex i was meaning to call you got a juicy one coming up two psychologists splitting up three really screwedup kids ive got the wife and its shaping up as one of the nastiest custody fights youre ever going to see sounds like fun you bet hows your calendar lets say five weeks from now i dont have it in front of me but that far in advance i dont see a problem good youre going to love this these are two of the craziest people youll ever meet the thought of them messing with other peoples heads is what is it with your profession anyway lets talk about your profession i said i need a referral for what estate and taxation wordprocessing or litigation could be both i gave him a general summary of melissas situation leaving out names numbers and identifying marks he said suzy lafamiglia if your client doesnt mind a woman a woman would be fine only reason i mention it is youd be surprised how many people still come in with rules no women no minorities their loss because suzys the best cpa as well as a law degree worked for one of the big accounting firms and brought in more business than any other associate until they kept passing her up for partnership because she had the wrong genitals she sued settled out of court used the money to go to boalt top of the class shes a real blackhearted litigator made her mark working for film people getting money back from the studios in situations where the finances are so hairy they go beyond my not inconsiderable skills shes my main man he laughed at his own wit i said sounds perfect for my client he gave me a number century city east shes got a whole floor in one of the towers ill call you on the other thing youre going to love it our little pair of snarling snapping therapists i call them the paradox très à propros he laughed more heartily i hung up without telling him id heard the joke before milo came back without melissa holding a can of diet coke shes in the bathroom he said throwing up what happened she just gave out started in with more of the tough talk getting the bastards i said something to her then boom shes crying and gagging i saw you looking at her like a detective then you got her out of the room while i called why he looked uncomfortable i said what okay he said i have an evil mind its what i get paid for he hesitated i didnt want her out i wanted to get her alone get a closer look without you running interference for her because her demeanor just now bothered me it got me thinking wed missed one possibility in our little dinner discussion very ugly possibility but sometimes those are the most important ones melissa i said feeling my gut tighten he started to turn away reversed direction and faced me shes the sole heir alex forty million bucks and shes sure ready to fight for it before the bodys even cold there is no body figure of speech dont chew my head off you just come up with this he shook his head i guess its been floating around in the back of my head from the beginning because of my training when theres money involved look for the person who benefits but i repressed it or whatever maybe i just didnt want to think about it milo shes fighting because shes channeling her grief into anger taking the offensive instead of letting herself be crushed i trained her to do that in therapy in my book its still good coping maybe he said all im saying is that in a normal situation id have looked at her early on you cant be serious hey he said i didnt say i thought it was a probability just something we left out no not weme im the one trained to think ugly but i didnt it wouldnt have happened if id been working for the city well youre not i said raising my voice so why not allow yourself a vacation from that kind of thinking hey he said dont kill the messenger she had no opportunity i said she was here when her mother disappeared the drucker kid could have had one where was he i dont know he nodded but without satisfaction from what ive seen he digs her enough to eat her fingernail dirt and call it caviar and he took care of the familys cars hed know all about how the rolls worked gina wouldve picked him up thats for sure and you yourself said he twanged your antennae i didnt say i sensed anything psychopathic about him okay oh man i said feeling a grinding headache coming on no way milo no way its sure not anything i want to believe alex i like the kid and im still working for her she was just looking a little too hardbitten just now going on and on about getting the bastards what i said to her out in the kitchen was sounds like youre raring to go and she just stopped and fell apart i felt shitty for making her feel bad but also better because she started looking like a kid again if i did something untherapeutic im sorry no i said if it was that close to the surface it would have happened sooner or later yeah he said neither of us putting into words what we were thinking if it was real feeling suddenly weary i sat down in the chair near the phone table the paper with suzy lafamiglias number was between my fingers just got a lawyer for her female tough combative likes to take on the system sounds good sounds i said like someone melissa could grow up to be melissa came back to the fivesided room looking a long way from grown up her shoulders were stooped her gait had slowed and she dabbed at her mouth with a piece of toilet paper i gave her the lawyers number and she thanked me in a very soft voice want me to call for you no thanks ill do it tomorrow i sat her down behind the desk she gazed out blankly in milos direction and gave a weak smile milo smiled back and looked at his soda can i wasnt sure for whom i felt sorrier melissa sighed and put her hand under her jaw i said howre you doing hon i dont know she said this is all so i feel like im just being like ive got no i dont know i touched her shoulder she said who am i fooling fighting them im a nothing whos going to listen to me i said itll be your lawyers job to fight right now you should be concentrating on taking care of yourself after a long time she said i guess another stretch of silence then im really alone lots of people around here care for you melissa milo was looking at the floor im really alone she said again with an eerie wonderment as if shed run a maze in record time only to find it led to an abyss im tired she said i think ill sleep would you like me to stay with you i want to sleep with someone i dont want to be alone milo put the can down on the table and left the room i remained with melissa saying comforting things that didnt seem to have much of an effect milo returned with madeleine the big woman was breathing hard and looked agitated but by the time she reached melissas side her expression had turned tender she hovered over melissa and stroked her hair melissa swooned a bit as if shed been embraced madeleine leaned lower and hugged her to her bosom i sleep with you chérie come we go now in the car driving away from the house milo said okay im a childabusing asshole so you dont think her falling apart was an act he braked hard at the foot of the drive and whipped his head toward me what the hell was that alex twisting the goddam knife his teeth were bared the spotlight above the pine gates yellowed them no i said feeling fear of him for the first time in all the years id known him feeling like a suspect no im serious couldnt she have been faking it yeah right youre telling me you think shes a psychopath shouting now one big hand pounding the steering wheel i dont know what to think i said matching his volume you keep throwing theories at me out of left field thought that was the idea the idea was to help he shoved his face forward as if it were a weapon glared then sagged against the seat and ran his hands through his hair shit this is a pretty scene must be sleep deprivation i said feeling shaky must be change your mind about sacking out hell no he laughed me neither sorry for getting on you sorry too how about we just forget it he put his hands back on the wheel and resumed driving slowly with exquisite caution dropping speed at every intersection even when there was no stop sign looking from side to side and in all the mirrors though the streets were empty at cathcart he said alex im not cut out for this private stuff too unstructured too many blurred boundaries ive been telling myself that im different but its bullshit im straightahead paramilitary like everyone else in the department need an usversusthem world whos us the blue meanies i like being mean i thought of the world hed contended with for so many years the one hed be contending with again in just a few months being relegated to them by other policemen no matter how many thems he put away i said you didnt do anything out of line i was reacting from my gut as her protector it would have been negligent for you not to consider her as a suspect it would be negligent not to continue considering her if thats where the facts lead the facts he said we dont got us too many of those he seemed about to say more but the freeway onramp appeared and he clamped his mouth shut and gave the porsche gas traffic toward downtown was light but it created enough of a roar to substitute for conversation we reached the eternal hope mission shortly after ten and parked halfway down the block the air smelled of ripening garbage and sweet wine and fresh asphalt with a curious overlay of flowers that seemed to travel on a westerly breeze as if the better parts of town had airmailed a whiff of better homes and gardens the front facade of the mission was swimming in artificial light that and the moonglow turned the aqua plaster icywhite five or six shabby men were congregated near the entrance listening or pretending to listen to two men in business clothes as we got closer i saw that the talkers were in their thirties one was tall and thin and fair with waxylooking blond hair cut fratboy short and an oddly dark mustache that hooked down at right angles to his mouth and resembled a fuzzy croquet wicket he wore silverrimmed eyeglasses a gray summerweight suit and mochacolored zip boots the arms of the suit were a trifle too short his wrists were huge a note pad identical to the ones milo used was in one hand along with a softpack of winstons the second man was short stocky and dark cleanshaven and babyfaced he had a ritchie valens pompadour narrow eyes with lips to match wore a blue blazer and gray slacks he was the one doing most of the talking the two men stood in profile neither of them seeing us milo walked up to the taller one and said brad the man turned and stared a few of the shabby men followed the stare the darker man stopped talking checked out his partner then milo as if unleashed the homeless men began to drift away the darker man said hold on campers and the men stopped short some of them muttering the detective gave his partner an arched eyebrow the man milo had called brad sucked in his cheeks and nodded the other man said this way campers and corralled the shabby men off to one side the taller man watched them until theyd passed out of earshot then turned back to milo sturgis how convenient what is i hear youve been down here already today which makes you someone i want to talk to that so the detective transferred his cigarettes to the other hand two trips in one day pretty dedicated getting paid by the hour milo said whats up why all the interest in mccloskey just what i told you when i checked in a couple of days ago run it by me again the lady he burned is still gone real gone her family would still like to know if theres a connection what do you mean real gone milo told him about morris dam the blond man remained impassive but the hand around the cigarette pack tightened realizing it he frowned and examined the pack tugging at cellophane using his fingertips to straighten the corners too bad he said family must be shook up theyre not throwing any parties the blond man gave a curdled smile you already rousted him twice why again first couple of times he didnt have much to say and you thought you might convince him something like that something like that the blond man looked over at the dark man who was still lecturing to the derelicts milo said what gives brad what gives repeated the blond man touching the rim of his eyeglasses what gives is that maybe life just got complicated he paused studying milo when milo didnt say anything the blond man fished a cigarette out of the pack put it between his lips and talked around it looks like weve got business together another pause for reaction from half a mile away the freeway rumbled from half a block away came the sound of shattering glass brads partner kept talking to the derelicts i couldnt make out his words but his tone was patronizing the shabby men looked nearly asleep the blond detective said seems mr mccloskey met with an unfortunate situation staring at milo milo said when the detective felt around in his trousers pocket as if the answer were to be found there he pulled out a disposable lighter and ignited the flame cast a twosecond hobgoblin glow over his face his skin was roughsanded and knobby with shaving bumps along the jawline couple of hours ago he said give or take he squinted at me through glass and smoke as if his releasing the information had made me someone to be reckoned with friend of the family said milo the tall man kept scrutinizing me inhaling and blowing out smoke without removing the cigarette from his mouth hed majored in stoicism and graduated with honors milo said dr delaware detective bradley lewis central division homicide detective lewis dr alex delaware lewis blew smoke rings and said a doctor huh family doctor as a matter of fact ah i tried to look doctoral milo said howd it happen brad what said lewis this some kind of a bounty thing getting paid for bringing the good news back to the family milo said it wont bring her back but yeah i cant imagine theyll mourn he repeated his question lewis pondered answering it finally said back alley a few blocks south and east of here the industrial area between san pedro and alameda auto versus pedestrian auto winning with a first round ko if its hit and run why are you guys on it what a sleuth said lewis hey dyou ever do police work grinning milo didnt talk or move lewis smoked and said as it happens the auto didnt take any chances according to the techs ran over him once then backed up and did it at least twice more for good luck were talking road pizza with all the toppings he turned to me pulled the cigarette out of his mouth and flashed a sudden wolfish grin family doctor huh you look like a civilized gentleman but appearances can be deceiving sometimes right i smiled back his grin widened as if wed just shared a terrific joke doctor he said chainlighting a second cigarette and grinding out the first on the sidewalk you wouldnt by any remote chance have used your mercedes or bmw or whatever to put poor mr mccloskey out of his misery would you sir quick confession and we can all go home i kept smiling and said sorry to disappoint you darn said lewis i hate whodunits the car was german said milo lewis kicked the cement with one boot heel and blew smoke through his nose what is this meet the press any reason not to tell me brad youre a civilian for one milo said nothing lewis said maybe even a suspect for two right said milo what is this brad fucking murder she wrote turning his stare on lewis they were the same height but milo outweighed lewis by fifty pounds lewis stared back smoking stonefaced and didnt answer milo nearwhispered a single word that sounded like gonzales lewiss gaze faltered the cigarette in his mouth dipped then arced upward as his jaw tightened he said look sturgis i cant fuck around with this at the very least theres a conflict of interest like if we end up coming out to pasadena and talking to the family about this the family as it stands right now said milo is an eighteenyearold girl who just found out her mothers dead and doesnt even have a body to bury cause its at the bottom of the goddam dam sheriffs just waiting for it to float all the more reason that happens itll be loads of fun for her right brad iding a floater meanwhile shes been cooped up in the house for the last few days tons of eyewitnesses so she sure as hell didnt run the pieceoshit over and she sure as hell didnt put any contracts out on him but if you think theres some advantage to coming around and getting her really freaked out be my guest deal with their lawyer guys uncle was hammerin harmon douse captain spain always did appreciate guys taking the initiative lewis puffed and dragged and stared at his cigarette as if it were a thing of wonder if thats where it leads bet your ass ill be there he said but his voice lacked conviction milo said be my guest brad the dark detective finished talking to the homeless men and gave a dismissing wave they dispersed some of them entering the mission others drifting up the street he came over wiping his palms on his blazer this is the famous milo sturgis said lewis between rapid drags on his cigarette the shorter man looked perplexed lewis said heavyweight champ from west la went one round with frisk another second of confusion then insight spread across the shorter mans baby features revulsion followed a moment later a pair of hard brown eyes shifted to me and this said lewis is the family doctor family thats been interested in our db maybe he can look at that knee of yours sandy the other detective wasnt amused he buttoned his jacket and when he turned to milo he might have been regarding a floating body milo said esposito right you used to be over at devonshire esposito said you came around here earlier and talked to the deceased what about nothing he wouldnt talk thats not what i asked said esposito clipping his words regarding what specifics was your intention to talk with the deceased milo paused weighing his words or unraveling the syntax his possible involvement in the death of my clients mother esposito didnt appear to have heard he managed to back his body away from milo while pushing his head forward what do you got to tell us milo said ten to one itll come down to something stupid interview the residents of this resort and find out the last person mccloskey shortportioned on the hash line save your advice said esposito moving back farther im talking information as in whodunit as in milo said afraid i cant help you with that lewis said the hashline theory doesnt cut it sturgis the residents of this resort dont tend to have cars they get day jobs once in a while said milo driving delivering or maybe mccloskey just met up with someone who didnt like his face wasnt much of a face lewis smoked and said nothing esposito said brilliant to me you got something to add i shook my head what can i say said milo you bought yourselves a whodunit for a change lewis smoked esposito said and you got nothing that would take the who out of the dunit your guess is as good as mine said milo smiling well maybe not that good but im sure youll work at improving it he began walking past the two of them heading for the front door of the mission i tried to follow but lewis stepped in front of me hold on sturgis he said milo looked back his forehead was knotted lewis said whats your business in there now thought id see the priest said milo time for confession right said esposito smirking priest gonna grow a beard listening lewis laughed but it sounded obligatory maybe its not the optimal time he said to milo i dont see any yellow tape brad maybe its still not optimal milo put his hands on his hips youre telling me this is a restricted scene because the db once bunked here but its okay for vagrant scumbags to come in and out harmon juniors gonna love that brad next time he and the chief meet up on the links theyre gonna share a few yucks over that one lewis said what is it three months and youre already acting like a fucking suit milo said bullshit youre the one with the invisible tape brad youre the one all of a sudden turned careful esposito said we dont have to take this shit and unbuttoned his coat lewis held him back puffing like a chimney then he dropped his cigarette on the sidewalk watched it smolder and moved aside esposito said hey lewis said fuck it with enough savagery to shut espositos mouth to me go ahead move it i stepped forward and milo put his hand on the door dont fuck anything up said lewis and dont get in our way i mean it i dont care how many fucking lawyers youve got behind you hear me milo pushed the door open before it closed i heard espositos voice mutter maricon then laughter very forced very angry a tv was on in the big aqua room some sort of cop show flashed on the screen and forty or so pairs of drooping eyes followed the crunchandrattle fantasy thorazine city said milo his voice cold as freon anger as therapy wed gotten halfway across the room when father tim andrus appeared from around a corner wheeling a coffee urn on an aluminum cart plasticwrapped stacks of styrofoam cups filled the carts bottom shelf the priests clerical shirt was olivedrab worn over faded blue jeans the knees of the pants scraped white same white hightop shoes hed had on the first time one of the laces had come loose he frowned stopped made a sharp turn away from us and pushed the cart between rows of slumping men the carts wheels were loose and kept sticking andrus maintained a jerky weaving progress until he was next to the television bending low he whispered to one of the men a young wildeyed white youth in toosmall clothing that gave him the look of an overgrown feral child not much older than a child actually late teens maybe twenty still larded with baby fat and suburban softness under a patchy chinbeard but any semblance of innocence was destroyed by matted hair and scabbed skin the priest talked to him slowly with exquisite patience the young man listened rose slowly and began unwrapping a cup stack with shaky fingers filling a cup from the urns spigot he started to raise it to his lips andrus touched his wrist and the youth stopped bewildered andrus smiled spoke again guided the youths wrist so that the cup was held out to one of the seated men the man took hold of it the chinbearded youth stared and released it andrus said something and gave him another cup that he began filling some of the men had left their seats a loose queue formed in front of the urn andrus motioned at a scrawny man the color of photo film slumped in the front row the man got up and limped over he and the youth stood side by side not looking at each other the priest smiled and instructed setting up a twoman assembly line guiding and praising until a rhythm of filling and distribution had been established and the queue began to shuffle forward then he came over to us please leave he said theres nothing i can do for you just a few questions please father said milo im sorry mr i dont remember what your name is but theres absolutely nothing i can do for you and id really appreciate it if you left the name is sturgis father and you didnt forget i never gave it to you no said the priest you didnt but the police did just a while ago they also informed me you werent the police never said i was father andruss ears colored he plucked at his wispy mustache no i suppose you didnt but you did imply it i deal with deception all day mr sturgis part of the job but that doesnt mean i like it sorry said milo i was an apology isnt necessary mr sturgis you can demonstrate your remorse by leaving and letting me attend to my people would it have made a difference father if id have told you i was a cop on temporary leave surprise on the priests lean face whatd they tell you father said milo that id been kicked off the force that i was some kind of heavyduty sinner andruss pale face took on an angry blush i theres really no sense getting into extraneous things mr sturgis the main thing is theres nothing i can do for you joels dead i know that father along with any interest you might therefore have in the mission any idea whos responsible for his death do you care mr sturgis not one bit but if it helps me understand why mrs ramp died why she oh andrus shut his eyes and opened them rapidly oh my sighing and putting a hand to his forehead i didnt know im sorry milo told him about morris dam a longer but softer version than the one hed given lewis andrus shook his head and crossed himself father said milo when joel was alive did he say anything to you that would indicate hed resumed contact with mrs ramp or any member of her family no not at all im sorry i cant take this any further mr sturgis the priest looked over at the coffee line anything joel may have told me was in confidentiality its a theological issue the fact that hes dead doesnt change that of course not father the only reason i came down here to talk to him again is that mrs ramps daughter is really struggling to deal with her loss shes only a kid father a total orphan now and shes coming to grips with being all alone nothing you can say or do will change that i realize but any light you might be able to shed on what happened to her mom could be helpful to her in terms of getting her life back together at least thats what ive been told by her therapist yes said andrus that makes sense poor child he thought for a moment but no it cant help her what cant father anything nothing i know mr sturgis what i mean is that i know nothing joel never told me anything that would ease the poor girls pain though even if he had i couldnt tell you so perhaps its best that he didnt im sorry but thats the way it is uhhuh said milo andrus shook his head and put the knuckles of a fist against his brow that wasnt very clear was it its been a long day and i lose coherence after long days another glance at the urn i could use some of that poison over there plenty of chicory in it but we havent skimped on the caffeine it helps the men deal with detox youre welcome to some too no thanks father just one more second of your time do you have any idea who might have done it the police seem to think it was just one of those things that happens down on skid row do you agree with that theres no reason not to i guess ive seen so many things that dont make sense is there something about mccloskeys death that doesnt make sense no not really another look at the urn was there any reason for mccloskey to be in the area where he was run down father andrus shook his head none that i know of he wasnt on an errand for the mission i told the police that the men do take walks surprisingly long distances for their physical condition its as if staying in motion reminds them theyre still alive the illusion of purpose even though they have nowhere to go the first time we were here i got the impression that joel rarely left the mission thats true so he wasnt one of your big walkers no not really did he take any other walks youre aware of no not really andrus paused his ears were flaming what is it father this will sound very ugly very judgmental but my first impression upon hearing what had happened was that someone in the family mrs ramps family decided finally to exact revenge lured him away somehow then ambushed him whys that father theyd certainly have a reason and using a car impressed me as a nice middleclass way of doing it no need to get close to smell him or touch him the priest stared away again upward toward the crucifix ugly thoughts mr sturgis im not proud of them i was angry everything id put into him and now then i realized i was being thoughtless and cruel and thinking of myself suspecting innocent people whod had their own share of suffering i had no right to do that now that you tell me about mrs ramp i feel even more shaking his head milo said did you mention your suspicion to the detectives it wasnt suspicion just a momentary thought an uncharitable thought in the heat of the shock of hearing about it and no i didnt but they brought it up asked me if any member of mrs ramps family had been by i said only you had howd they react when you told them id been here i didnt get the impression they took it seriously took any of it seriously they just seemed to be throwing things out scattershot my impression was that theyre not going to spend a lot of time on this particular case whys that their attitude im used to it death is a frequent visitor around here but he doesnt give too many interviews on the six oclock news the priests face fell here i go again judging and theres so much work to be done you must excuse me mr sturgis sure father thanks for your time but if you do think of something anything that would help that little girl please let me know somehow a business card had made it into milos palm he handed it to the priest before andrus slipped it into a pocket of his jeans i got a look at it white vellum milos name in strong black letters over the word investigations home number and beeper code in the lower righthand corner milo thanked andrus again andrus looked pained please dont count on me mr sturgis ive told you all i can walking back to the car i said ive told you all i can not all i know my bet is that mccloskey bared his soul to him formal confession or some sort of counseling either way youll never get it out of him yup he said i used to talk to my priest too we walked to the car in silence driving back to san labrador i said whos gonzales huh what you told lewis it seemed to make an impression on him oh he said frowning ancient history gonsalves lewis used to work at west la when he was still in uniform college boy tendency to think he was smarter than the others gonsalves is a case he fucked up domestic violence that he didnt take seriously enough wife wanted the husband locked up but lewis thought he could handle it with his ba psych ba matter of fact did some counseling and left feeling good hour later the husband cut up the wife with a straight razor lewis was a lot softer then no attitude i could have ruined him chose to go easy on the paperwork talk him through it after that he got harder got more careful didnt fuck up again notably made detective a few years later and transferred to central doesnt seem too grateful yeah he gripped the wheel well thats the way the oreo deteriorates a mile later when i first called him to scope out mccloskey and the mission he was frosty but civil given the frisk thing thats the best i can hope for tonight was amateur theater putting on an act for that little macho asshole hes partnered with us and them i said he didnt answer i regretted bringing it up trying to lighten things i said nifty business card whend you get it couple of days ago instaprint on la cienega on the way to the freeway got a box of five hundred at bulk rate talk about your wise investment let me see what for souvenir it may turn out to be a collectors item he grimaced put his hand in his jacket and pulled one out i took it snapped the thin hard paper and said classy i like vellum he said you can always pick your teeth with it or use it for a bookmark got something even more constructive he said build little houses with them then blow them down back at sussex knoll he pulled up beside the seville i said whats next for you sleep hearty breakfast then financial scumbags he put the porsche in neutral and revved the engine what about mccloskey i said wasnt intending to go to the funeral revving drumming the steering wheel i said any ideas about who killed him and why you heard all of em back at the mission okay i said okay he sped away my house seemed tiny and friendly the timer had switched the pond lights off and it was too dark to tell how my fish eggs were doing i crept upstairs slept for ten hours woke up monday thinking of gina ramp and joel mccloskey bound together again by pain and terror was there a link between morris dam and what had happened in the back alley or had mccloskey been simply another piece of skid row garbage murder with a car i found myself thinking about noel drucker he had access to lots of wheels and plenty of time on his hands during the tankards indefinite hiatus were his feelings for melissa strong enough to knock him that far off the straight and narrow if so had he been acting on his own or at melissas bidding and what of melissa it made me sick to think of her as anything other than the defenseless orphan milo had portrayed to the detectives but id seen her temper in action watched her channel her grief into revenge fantasies against anger and douse i recalled her and noel entwined on her bed had the plan to get mccloskey been hatched during a similar embrace i switched channels ramp if he was innocent of causing ginas death perhaps hed avenged it he had lots of reasons to hate mccloskey had he been at the wheel of the death car or had he hired someone the poetic justice would have been appealing todd nyquist would have been perfect for the job how would anyone connect a surfjock from the west side with the downtown death of a braindamaged bum or maybe noel was ramps automotive hit man not melissas or maybe none of the above i sat on the edge of the bed an image flashed across my eyes the scars on ginas face i thought of the prison mccloskey had sent her to for the rest of her life why waste time worrying about the reason he had died his life had been a case study in wretchedness whod miss him other than father andrus and the priests feelings probably had more to do with theological abstraction than human attachment milo had been right to brush it off i was playing headgames rather than making myself useful i stood stretched said good riddance out loud dressing in khakis shirt and tie and a lightweight tweed jacket i drove to west hollywood the hilldale address kathy moriartys sister had given me was between santa monica boulevard and sunset the house was a graceless box the color of weekold newspaper on a thirtyfoot lot shielded nearly to the roof by an unkempt eugenia hedge the roof line was flat layered with spanish tiles painted black flat black it looked like an amateur job some of the terra cotta showing through in places the hue that of a poorly dyed brown shoe the eugenia hedge ended at a short collapsing driveway asphalt struggling with weeds in the couple of feet not taken up by a twentyyearold birdbombed yellow oldsmobile i parked across the street walked across a dry clipped lawn packed harder than the asphalt four paces took me to a threestep cement porch three addresses in black metal letters were nailed to the right of the gray plank door a piece of adhesive tape now darkened to the oldpaper tint of the house covered the doorbell ringer an index card with knock in red ballpoint was wedged between the bell frame and the stucco i followed instructions and was rewarded seconds later with a hold on in a sleepysounding male voice then yeah from behind gray wood my name is alex delaware and im looking for kathy moriarty how come i thought of milos suggestions of subterfuge decided i had no stomach for that and opted for technical truth her family hasnt seen her in a while her family her sister and brotherinlaw mr and mrs robbins in pasadena the door opened a young man clutching a handful of paintbrushes in his right hand looked me up and down no surprise no suspicion just an artists eye gauging perspective he was in his late twenties tall and solidly built with dark hair combed back and tied in a foots worth of ponytail that dangled over his left collarbone his face was heavy and softfeatured under a low flat forehead and shelf brows the gestalt was simian more gorilla than chimp helped along by black eyebrows that met in the middle and a wash of black stubble that ran up past his cheekbones swooped down his neck till it merged with his chest hair he wore a black polyester tank top emblazoned with the logo of a skateboard company in tomatored letters baggy flowered orangeandgreen kneelength shorts and rubber beach sandals his arms were coated with dark coiling hair just past the elbow the skin above that was hairless and white and slabbed with the kind of muscle that would pump up easily but looked slack and unused a dried patch of babyblue paint stained one bicep i said sorry to disturb you he glanced at the brushes then back at me i pulled out my wallet found the business card id taken from milo last night and handed it to him he studied it smiled studied me and gave it back i thought you said your name was delsomething sturgis is in charge im working with him an op he said grinning you dont look like one at least not like the ones on tv guess thats the point of it though isnt it très incommunicado i smiled he studied me some more a lawyer he finally said defense not prosecution or maybe some kind of professor thats how id cast you marlowe do you work in the movies i said no he laughed and touched a paintbrush to his lips lowering it he said though i guess i do actually im a writer more laughter like everyone else in this town right but not screen plays god forbid screenplays his laughter rose in pitch and lingered hovering on the brink of giddy you ever write one nope give yourself time everyones got a hot propertycept me what i do for a living is graphic art airbrushphotorealism to sell products what i do for fun is artart sloppy freedom waving the brushes and what i do to stay sane is writing short pieces postmodern essays had a couple published in the reader and the weekly moodbased urban fiction how music and money and the whole la experience make people feel the different things la evokes in people interesting i said not sounding very convincing yeah he said cheerfully as if you give a shit you just want to do your job and go home to your lonely pi murphy bed right boy needs a hobby he said oh yeah transferred his brushes to his left hand and held out his right and said richard skidmore we shook he stepped back and said cmon in the interior of the small house was prewar budget construction cramped dark rooms that smelled of instant coffee and takeout food marijuana and turpentine textured walls rounded archways tin wall sconces all of them bulbless a brick mantel above a fireplace was piled high with presto logs still in their wrappers thrift shop furniture including some plasticandaluminumtubing outdoor pieces was assembled randomly on worn wood floors art and its accoutrements oddshaped handstretched canvases in various stages of completion jars and tubes of paint brushes soaking in pitchers were everywhere but on the walls a paintencrusted easel sat in the center of the living room amid a mound of crumpled paper broken pencils and charcoal stubs a draftsmans table and adjustable chair were set up in what looked to be the dining area along with a compressor attached to an airbrush the walls were unadorned but i noticed a single piece of white construction paper nailed above the mantel calligraphic lettering at the center read day of the locusts twilight of the worms night of the living dread my novel said skidmore both the title and the opening line the rest will happen when the old attention span kicks in its always been a problem for me but hey it didnt stop the last couple of presidents did it i said did you meet kathy moriarty through your writing work work work marlowe how much does boss spurgis pay you to get you to be so conscientious depends on the case very good he said smiling evasive you know this is really great your dropping in like this its why i love waking up in la you can never tell when some socal archetype will come knocking another appraising glance i started to feel like a still life think ill use you in my next piece he said drawing an imaginary line in the air the private eye the things he sees the things that see him he lifted several canvases covered with abstract splotches from a pool chaise and dumped them on the floor unceremoniously sit i did and he lowered himself onto a wooden stool directly in front of me this is great he said thanks for dropping by does kathy moriarty live here her place is in back garage unit whos the landlord i am he said with pride inherited it from my grandfather gay old blade ergo the boys town location came out of the closet twenty years after grandma died and i was the only one in the family who didnt cut him off so when he died i got all of it the house the bloatmobile hundred shares of ibm stock the art of the deal right mrs robbins says she hasnt seen kathy for over a month whens the last time you saw her funny he said what is that her sister would hire someone to look for her they didnt get along at least from kathys pov whys that culture clash no doubt kathy said the sister was pasadena whitebread the kind whod say urination and defecation as opposed to kathy exactly i asked him again when hed last seen her he said same time whitebread did about a month whens the last time she paid her rent the rent is a hundred a month which is standup comedy right couldnt get into the whole landlord thing whens the last time kathy paid the hundred at the beginning beginning of what our association she was so happy to get something that cheap and it includes utilities because everythings metered together and its too much of a hassle to have it changed she came up with ten months worth right at the beginning so shes paid up through december ten months shes been living here since february guess so yeah it was right after new years i used the garage apartments for a party artists and writers and terrific fakers when i was cleaning up i decided to rent one of them and use the other for storage so i wouldnt be tempted to throw another party next year and hear all that bad dialogue was kathy invited to the party why would she have been being a writer no i didnt meet her till after the party howd you meet her ad in the reader she was the first to show up and i liked her straight on no bullshit a real nononsense sapphite sapphite as in lesbos shes gay sure big smile tsk tsk looks like sister whitebread didnt brief you thoroughly guess not he said like i said culture clash dont be shocked marlowe this is west hollywood everyone here is either queer or old or both or me im into chastity until something monogamous and heterosexual and meaningful comes along tugging the ponytail dont let this fool you im really rightwing two years ago i owned twentysix buttondown shirts and four pairs of penny loafers this another tugwas to make the neighbors more comfortable im already dragging down the property values not letting them bulldoze and put up another spajacuzzifullsecurity does kathy have a lover not that i saw and my guess would be no whys that her persona projects as profoundly unloved as if shes just come off something hurtful and isnt ready to juggle with razor blades again it wasnt anything she said we dont talk too much dont run into each other much i like to sleep as much as i can and shes gone most of the time gone this long he thought this is the longest but shes usually on the road i mean its not weird for her to be away for a week at a time so you can tell her sister shes probably okay probably doing something miss pasadena doesnt really want to hear about how do you know shes gay ah the evidence well for starts the stuff she reads lesbo mags she buys them regularly i find them out in the trash and the mail she gets what kind of mail his smile was a wide white pinstripe on wooly stubble not that i go out of my way to read it marlowe that would be illegal right but sometimes the mail for the back unit gets put in my box because the carriers dont realize theres a unit back there or maybe theyre just too lazy to go back there a lot of its from gay groups hows that for deductive reasoning after a month you must have quite a bit of it collected i said he stood went into the kitchen and returned a moment later carrying a sheaf of envelopes bound with a rubber band rolling the band off he examined each piece of mail then held on to it for several moments before passing the entire collection to me i fanned it and counted eleven pieces not much for a month i said like i said unloved i inspected the mail eight pieces were computeraddressed postcards and advertisements made out to occupant the remaining three were envelopes addressed to kathy moriarty by name one appeared to be a solicitation for funds from an aids support group so did another from a clinic in san francisco the third envelope was white businesssized postmarked three weeks previously in cambridge massachusetts typewritten address ms kathleen r moriarty return address preprinted in the upper lefthand corner the gay and lesbian alliance against discrimination massachusetts avenue cambridge i pulled out a pen realized i hadnt brought paper and copied the information onto the back of a gasoline receipt that i found in my wallet skidmore was studying me amused i turned the envelope over several times more for his benefit than anything else finally gave it back to him he said so what did you learn not much what else can you tell me about her brown hair butchdo green eyes kind of a potato face her fashion statement tends to be oriented toward baggy and sensible does she have a job not that im aware of but she could have she never mentioned a job uhuh he yawned and rubbed one knee then the other other than being a writer i said thats not a job marlowe its a calling have you ever seen anything she wrote sure we didnt talk at all the first couple of months she was here but once we discovered we had the muse in common we did do a little showandtell whatd she show her scrapbook remember what was in it he crossed his legs and scratched a hairy calf what do you call this getting a profile on the subject exactly i said what kinds of things did she have in her scrapbook all give no take huh he said but without resentment i dont know anything richard thats why im talking to you that make me a snitch a source aha her scrapbook i just skimmed it he said yawning again basically it was articles stuff shed written articles on what shrug i didnt look at it too closely too factbound no fancy any chance of my seeing the scrapbook like how would that be possible like if you have the key to her apartment he raised his hand to his mouth a parody of outrage invasion of privacy marlowe how about you stand right over me while i read it doesnt take care of the constitutional issues phil listen i said leaning forward and putting major effort into sounding ominous this is serious she could be in danger he opened his mouth and i knew he was going to crack wise i blocked it by holding out a hand and said i mean it richard his mouth closed and stayed that way for a while i stared at him hard and he rubbed his elbows and knees and said youre serious very this has nothing to do with collecting collecting what money she told me shed borrowed lots from her sister hadnt paid any of it back and her sisters husband was getting pissed hes some sort of financial type mr robbins is a lawyer i said and he and his wife are concerned about kathys debt but thats not the issue anymore shes been gone too long richard he rubbed some more and said when you told me you were working for the sister i figured it had something to do with collecting well it doesnt richard her sister whatever their culture clash is worried about her and so am i i cant tell you more than that but mr sturgis considers this case a priority he undid his ponytail and shook his hair loose it was thick and shiny as a cover girls and fanned across his face i heard his neck crack as he lowered it and continued fanning when he looked up some of the hair was in his mouth and he chewed it while wearing a thoughtful expression all you want to do is look at it huh he said pulling strands away from his lips thats it richard you can watch me every second okay he said why not at the worst shell find out and get pissed and ill invite her to find a cheaper place he stood and stretched and shook his hair again when i got up he said just stay right there phil another trip to the kitchen he came back too soon to have gone very far carrying a looseleaf notebook bound in orange cloth i said she left it with you uhuh she forgot to take it back after shed given it to me to look at when i realized it she was already gone so i stuck it somewhere got so much junk around here and she never asked about it we both forgot meaning it probably isnt that important to her right thats the rationale ill use if she gets pissed he returned to the stool opened the notebook and flipped pages clinging to his treasure for just a moment before yielding just as hed done with the mail here you go he said were not talking racy phil i opened the book inside were forty or so doublesided pages black paper sheathed in transparent plastic newspaper clippings bearing kathleen moriartys byline were inserted on each side there was a flap on the inside front cover i slid my hand in empty the articles were arranged chronologically the first few dating back fifteen years were from the daily collegian at cal state fresno a score or so spanning a sevenyear period were from the fresno bee next came pieces from the manchester union leader and the boston globe the dates indicated kathy moriarty had stayed at each of the new england papers for only about a year i turned back to the beginning and checked out contents for the most part general interest stuff and all local town meetings and personality pieces holiday features of the clever pet variety an investigative trend didnt creep in until moriartys year at the globe a series on pollution in boston harbor and an exposé of cruelty to animals at a worcester pharmacologic firm that didnt appear to have gone very far the last insert was a review in the hartford courant of the bad earth her book on pesticides small press publisher good marks for enthusiasm points off for poor documentation i checked the back flap slipped out several folded pieces of newsprint skidmore was looking at his toes and hadnt noticed i unfolded and began reading five opinion pieces dated last year from a paper called the gala banner and subtitled the monthly newsletter of the gay and lesbian alliance against discrimination cambridge mass byline change to kate moriarty title of contributing editor these essays were filled with rage male domination the aids plague the penis as a weapon a piece on identity and misogyny stapled to that one was a scrap of newsprint skidmore yawned almost finished one sec i read the scrap the globe again three years old no moriarty byline no byline at all just a news summary one of those roundup items papers run on page of the final edition doctors death tied to overdose cambridge the death of a harvard psychiatric fellow is believed to have resulted from an accidental or selfadministered dose of barbiturates the body of eileen wagner was found this morning in her office at the beth israel hospital psychiatry department on brookline avenue time of death was estimated at some time during the night police would not speculate upon what led them to their conclusion other than to say that dr wagner had been suffering from personal problems a graduate of yale and yale university medical school dr wagner completed pediatric training at western pediatric medical center in los angeles and practiced medicine with the world health organization overseas before coming to harvard last year to study child and adolescent psychiatry i looked over at skidmore his eyes were closed i pulled off the article pocketed it closed the book and said thanks richard now how about giving me a look at her apartment his eyes opened just to make sure i said sure of what that shes not there hurt or worse no way is she there he said with genuine anxiety that was refreshing no way marlowe how can you be sure i saw her drive away a month ago white datsun you can get the plates run some kind of trace right what if she came back without the car you might not have noticed you yourself said the two of you didnt see each other often no he shook his head too weird why dont we just check richard you can stand there and watch just like with the scrapbook he rubbed his eyes stared at me got up i followed him into a tiny dark kitchen where he picked a ring of keys out of a pile of junk and pushed open a rear door we walked across a backyard too small for hopscotch to a double garage the garage doors were the oldfashioned hingetype doorsized inserts were centered in each garage apartments literally skidmore said this one and led me to the unit on the left the doorwithinadoor was deadbolted illegal he said converting the garage you wont tell on me marlowe will you cross my heart smiling he shuffled keys then turned serious and stopped what is it richard wouldnt it smell if she was you know depends richard you never can tell another smile shaky he fumbled with the keys one thing im curious about i said if you thought i was here to dun kathy for money whyd you let me in simple he said material kathy moriartys home was a twentybytwenty room that still reeked of automobile the floor was wheatcolored linoleum squares the walls were white plasterboard the furniture was a twinsize mattress on the floor sheet crumpled at the foot revealing sweatstained blue ticking wooden nightstand round white formica table and three metal chairs padded at seat and back with dollops of yellow hawaiianprint plastic one of the far corners contained a hot plate on a metal stand the other a fiberglas water closet no bigger than an airplane latrine above the hot plate a single bracket shelf held a few dishes and kitchen utensils on the opposite wall was a makeshift closet frame of white pvc tubing a few outfits mostly jeans and shirts hung from the horizontal tube kathy moriarty hadnt spent her sisters money on interior decorating i had an idea where the funds had gone skidmore said oh man the skin beneath his stubble was white and one hand was atop his head snarled in hair what is it either someones been here or shes packed out on me what makes you say that he waved his hands suddenly agitated the kid with the poor attention span struggling to make himself clear this wasnt the way it looked when she was here she had luggage lots of suitcases a backpack this big trunk that she used for a coffee table he looked around and pointed right there and there was a pile of books right on it next to the mattress what kinds of books i dont know i never checked but one thing im sure of it didnt look this way whens the last time you saw it look any different the hand in his hair clawed and gathered a clump just before i saw her drive away when would that be maybe five weeks or six i dont know it was at night i brought her some mail and she was sitting with her feet up on the chest so the chest was there thats for sure five or six weeks ago any idea what was in the chest no for all i know it was empty but why would anyone take an empty trunk right so it probably wasnt and if she packed out why would she leave her clothes and her dishes and stuff good thinking richard very weird we entered the room he stood back and i began circling then i saw something on the floor next to the mattress fleck of foam couple more bending down i ran my hand along the side of the mattress more foam fell out my fingers searched and i found the wound straight as a seam surgically neat barely noticeable even from up close what said skidmore its been slit open oh man he moved his head from side to side flapping his hair he stayed in place while i got down on my knees spread the lips of the slit and peered inside nothing i looked around the rest of the room nothing what said skidmore is the mattress yours or hers hers whats going on looks like someones been curious or maybe she was hiding something inside did she have a tv or stereo just a radio thats gone too but this isnt about burglary is it hard to tell but you suspect nasty dont you thats why you came here in the first place isnt it i dont know enough to suspect anything richard is there something you know about her that makes you think nasty no he said in a loud tight voice she was a lonely dyke who kept to herself i dont know what else you expect me to tell you nothing richard i said youve been a big help i appreciate the time yeah sure now can i close up gotta go call a locksmith put on a new bolt we left the garage once outside he pointed to the driveway and said thatll take you out i thanked him again and wished him luck on his privateeye essay he said cancel that one and went inside the house the first pay phone i found was at a mall on santa monica boulevard the shopping center was brandnew empty storefronts the lot freshly tarred but the booth had a livedin smell gum clots and cigarette butts littered the floor the directory had been ripped off its chain i called boston information and asked for the number of the gala banner there was no listing for the paper but the gay and lesbian alliance had one that i dialed a man answered gala i heard voices in the background id like to speak to someone on the banner please advertising or editorial editorial someone who knows kathy kate moriarty kate doesnt work here anymore i know that shes living in la which is where im calling from pause whats this about im an acquaintance of kates and shes been missing for over a month her familys concerned so am i and i thought someone in boston might be able to help us out shes not here if thats what you mean id really like to talk to someone on the staff who knows her another pause id better take your name and number i gave him both and said thats an answering service im a clinical psychologist you can check me out in an american psychological association directory you can also call professor seth fiacre over at boston us psych department id appreciate hearing back as quickly as possible well he said it may not be that quick youll need to talk to the banners editor thats bridget mcwilliams and shes out of the city for the rest of the day where can she be reached im not at liberty to say please try to contact her tell her kates safety may be at stake when he didnt respond to that i said mention eileen wagners name too wagner he said and i heard the sound of scrawling as in the composer no guess that would be vahgner guess so id forgotten about seth fiacres move to boston until his name had popped into my head as a reference the social psychologist had left ucla for the east last year when an endowed chair in group process had been thrown at him seths specialty was mind control and cults and the forbes father of a sixteenyearold girl rescued from a neohindu apocalyptic sect living in subterranean bunkers in new mexico had consulted seth on deprogramming shortly after the money for the chair had come available back to boston information i got the number for bus psych department and dialed it was informed by the receptionist that professor fiacres office was at the applied social science center a receptionist there took my name and put me on hold seths voice came on a moment later alex long time hi seth hows boston boston is wonderful a real city hadnt been back for any length of time since graduation kind of a nice homecoming how about yourself do any teaching like you were thinking of not yet its hard to return he said once you get out in the real world whatever that means he laughed i forgot i was speaking to a clinician whatve you been up to doing some consulting trying to put out a monograph sounds admirably wellrounded so what can i do for you another bunch of true believers to check out my pleasure last time i gave you data i got two abstracts and a paper in jpsp out of it the touch i said remembering they put the touch on lots of suckers so whore the loony tunes this time no cults i said what im looking for is some information on a colleague former faculty at your alma mater the h place who leo gabney and wife dr prolific yeah i seem to have heard he was living out there know anything about him not personally but were not exactly paddling the backwaters are we i remember having to immerse myself in everything hed written for my advanced learning theory course the guy was a factory i used to curse him for turning out so much data but most of it was pretty solid he must be what sixtyfive seventy little old for mischief whyre you checking him out hes a little younger than that sixty or so and a long way from the glue factory he and his wife have a clinic in san labrador specializing in phobia therapy for the rich i quoted him the gabneys fee schedule how depressing he said here i was thinking this endowment was serious money and youve gone and made me feel poor again he repeated the numbers out loud then said oh well what do you want to know about them and why theyve been treating the mother of one of my patients and some strange things have come up nothing i can get into seth sorry but you understand sure youre interested in his libidinal history and related matters when he was back at h that i said and any financial indiscretions ah that can of worms now im intrigued if you could find out why the two of them left boston and what kinds of work they were doing during the year or so before they left id really appreciate it do what i can though people around here dont like to talk about money because they lust after it so much also those folks at that place uptown dont always condescend to talk to the rest of us even alumni even alumni who stray too far south of cambridge but ill churn the chowder see what bobs to the surface whats the wifes name ursula cunningham she hyphenates it now with gabney shes a phdmd gabney was her adviser in grad school and sent her on to med school her faculty appointment was at the med school department of psychiatry his may have been too as a matter of fact you just raised the hurdle a little higher alex the med schools an entity unto itself only one i know there is my kids pediatrician and hes only clinical faculty anything you can learn would be helpful seth were talking asap of course the quicker the better except in matters of wine cheese and carnal pleasure okay ill see what i can do and think about paying a visit some day alex you can take me out to legal seafoods for untrammeled lobster gluttony my last call was to milo i expected a machine but rick answered with a dr silverman that sounded rushed its alex again rick on my way out alex call from the er bus accident theyre shortstaffed milos out in pasadena spent the morning on the phone and left about an hour ago thanks rick bye alex i just wanted to thank you for getting him the job he was pretty low the idleness i tried to talk him into doing something but i wasnt making much headway until you got him the referral so thanks it wasnt charity rick he was the best man for the job i know that and you know that the trick was convincing him afternoon traffic slowed the drive to san labrador i spent the time thinking about connections between massachusetts and california the gates at sussex knoll were closed i talked to madeleine over the talk box and was let in neither milos fiat nor ricks porsche was in front of the house a cherryred jaguar xjs convertible was a woman opened the chaucer doors before i got to them five three midforties a few extra pounds that rounded her nicely her face in contrast was lean and triangular under a cap of black curls her eyes were the same color large and round and heavily lashed she had on a soft pink dress that would have gone well at a renoir picnic bracelets jangled as she extended her arm dr delaware im susan lafamiglia we shook hands hers was small and soft until she turned on the grip she wore lots of makeup and had applied it well rings graced half of her fingers a strand of black pearls rested on her bosom if it was real it was worth more than the jag its good to meet you she said id like to talk to you about our mutual client not right now because im in the middle of talking to her trying to unravel her finances how about in a couple of days sure as long as melissa consents she already has ive got a release form inside im sorry did you come to have a session with her no i said just to see how shes doing she seems to be doing okay considering i was surprised at how knowledgeable she is about money for someone her age but obviously i dont know her very well shes a complex young lady i said has a detective named sturgis been by milo he was here before just went over to the stepfathers restaurant the police came here to question melissa about this mccloskey characters death i told them she hadnt been informed of it yet and that under no circumstances would i allow them to talk to her milo suggested they talk to the stepfather there was a bit of pawing and snorting but they agreed her smile said success had been no surprise the tankards lot was so full of cars that it appeared open for business ramps mercedes noels toyota the brown chevy monte carlo milos fiat and a dark blue buick sedan that id also seen before milos hired surveillance was nowhere in sight either not on the job or damned good as i got out of the seville i saw someone exit the rear of the building and run across the lot bethel drucker in a white blouse and dark shorts and flat sandals blond hair loose and flying chest bouncing a moment later she was behind the wheel of the brown chevy revving noisily backing out of her space in a squealing fishtail then speeding down the driveway toward the boulevard without stopping she hooked a sharp right and roared away i tried to catch a glimpse of her face behind glass but caught only a boomerang flash of hot white sunlight just as the sound of her engine faded the tankards front door opened and noel stepped out looking confused and scared your mom went that way i said and he swung his eyes toward me convulsively i walked over to him what happened i dont know he said the cops came by to talk to don i was in the kitchen doing some reading mom went out and served them coffee and then when she got back she looked really upset i asked her what the matter was but she didnt answer and then i saw her leave any idea what the cops said to don no like i said i was in the kitchen i wanted to ask her what the matter was but she just left without saying anything he looked down the boulevard its not like her he lowered his head forlorn dark and handsome and forlorn james deanish my scalp prickled i said no idea where she might have gone it could be anywhere she likes to drive being cooped up in here all day but she usually tells me where shes going and when shes coming back shes probably under stress i said what with the restaurant being closed the uncertainty shes scared he said the tankards been her life i told her even if worse comes to worse and don doesnt reopen she can easily get a job at another place but she said it would never be the same because shading his eyes with one hand he scanned the boulevard some more because what noel huh he gave a startled look your mom said it would never be the same because whatever he said angrily noel its not important ive gotta go reaching into his jeans he pulled out a ring of keys ran to the celica and drove off i was still preoccupied as i walked up to the tankards front door the no brunch sign had been replaced with one that said closed until further notice inside the lights had been turned up to cheapening brightness exposing every raw spot in the wood paneling every snarl and stain on the carpet milo sat on a stool by the bar holding a coffee cup don ramp was in one of the booths along the right wall a bottle of wild turkey a glass and a cup that matched milos within arms reach two other coffees sat near the outer edge of the table ramp had on the same white shirt hed worn at the dam he looked as if hed just returned from a guided tour to hell traveling standby chief chickering and officer skopek stood over him chickering was smoking a cigar skopek looked as if he would have liked one too when the chief saw me he turned and frowned skopek did likewise milo sipped coffee ramp didnt do anything it looked like a chapter meeting of the big mans club gone sour i said hi chief doctor chickering moved his wrist and a pellet of ash dropped into a tray near ramps bottle the bourbon was twothirds gone i went to the bar and sat down next to milo he raised his eyebrows and gave a small smile chickering turned back to ramp okay don guess thatll do it if ramp responded i didnt see it chickering picked up one of the coffee cups near the edge and took a long swallow licking his lips he came over to the bar skopek followed but remained several feet behind chickering said doing some routine questioning for my good friends over in los angeles doctor about what happened to the late mr mccloskey anything you want to add to the current pool of ignorance nothing chief okay he said then took another swig of coffee when he finished the cup was empty he held it out without looking back and skopek took it and placed it on ramps table far as im concerned doctor its just deserts but im following up as a courtesy to la so now ive asked you and thats it i nodded he said hows everything else going with little melissa fine chief good pause smoke rings any idea whos going to be running the household i couldnt say chief well he said we were just over there and a lawyer was talking to the girl lady lawyer west side firm dont know how much experience shes got with this side of town i shrugged glenn angers a good man he said grew up here known him for years i said nothing well he said again got to be going never a dull moment to ramp take care of yourself don call if you need anything lots of people rooting for you lots of people want to sniff tbone and new york prime and fm on the grill again he winked at ramp ramp didnt move after chickering and skopek had left i said fm filet mignon said milo we had a nice little chat about beef just before you got here the chiefs a connoisseur buys those packaged steaks from omaha i looked over at ramp who still hadnt budged he join in the discussion i said very softly milo placed his coffee cup on the bar the broken st pauli girl mirror had been removed bare plaster in its place no he said he hasnt done much of anything except suck bourbon what about nyquist not a word not that anyones looking whyd lapd send chickering around so they can avoid ruffling san labrador feathers and still say they did the job chickering have anything new to say about mccloskey he shook his head how did ramp react to hearing about it stared at chickering then took a big gulp of turkey no surprise at mccloskey being dead maybe a glimmer its hard to tell hes not registering much of anything not exactly your stalwart coper unless its an act milo shrugged picked up the coffee cup looked at it put it down don he called across the room anything i can do for you nothing from the booth then a long slow shake of ramps head so said milo switching back to a soft tone have a chance to go to west hollywood yup lets talk outside the two of us went out to the parking lot i said is your surveillance guy anywhere around trade secret he said smiling then at this moment no but it wouldnt make a difference believe me i told him what id learned about kathy moriarty and eileen wagner okay he said your gabney theorys looking better they probably scammed in boston got found out and came west to scam some more it goes beyond that i said eileen wagner was the one who referred me to gina a few years later shes dead in boston the gabneys leave boston and shortly after theyre treating gina anything in moriartys clipping implying wagners death wasnt suicide i handed him the scrap he read and said doesnt sound as if anyone was going to look into it and if it developed into something fishy wouldnt moriarty have kept those clippings in her book guess so i said but theres got to be some kind of connection something moriarty thought she had wagner was studying psych at harvard when the gabneys were still there she probably came into some kind of contact with them kathy moriarty had an interest in all three of them and all three knew gina when you met wagner did anything about her strike you as odd no i said not that i analyzed her it was a tenminute conversation eleven years ago so you have no reason to question her ethics none at all why just wondering he said if she was ethical she wouldnt have talked to anyone about gina specifically would she even to another doctor thats true so how could the gabneys have known about gina from her maybe they didnt specifically but after learning the gabneys specialized in treating phobics maybe wagner talked about ginas case in general terms medical conference that wouldnt have been unethical rich phobic said milo living like a princess in a castle i said wagner used those words shed been impressed by ginas wealth she could have talked about it to one or both of the gabneys and when the time came for the gabneys to seek greener pastures they remembered what shed said and headed for san labrador and hooked up with gina because melissa called coincidence its a real small town milo but i still dont see why kathy moriarty had the clipping of wagners suicide in her scrapbook maybe wagner was one of moriartys sources about the gabneys scam and maybe wagner died because of that whoa thats a big leap he said but tell you what when i get back we can pursue it get suzy to pursue it what a gal if the gabneys have been bleeding ginas estate shed be the one to find out the cassatt could be a good place to start if it wasnt legally transferred shell be on them like a hound on hemoglobin when you get back from where i said sacramento suzys assigned me a trip up there seems attorney douse has been in some kind of trouble with the bar recently but they wont talk about it over the phone and even in person theyre demanding proper documentation of needtoknow im booked out of burbank at sixten shes gonna have the papers faxed to me up there tomorrow morning im scheduled to speak to some bankers at one do my thing at the bar at threethirty after that she assures me therell be other items on the agenda tight schedule the lady doesnt suffer slackers lightly anything else yes i said was bethel listening when chickering told ramp about mccloskey she was in the room pouring coffee why i told him about the waitresss hurried departure its possible it was just sensory overload milo i spoke to noel a moment later and he said shes been under stress worried about her job maybe hearing about another death was just too much to handle but i think she was reacting specifically to the fact that it was mccloskey who was dead because i think mccloskey was noels father the look of surprise on his face was gratifying i felt like a kid whod finally bested daddy at chess talk about your leaps he said where does that come from my quivering antennae i finally figured it out it had nothing to do with noels behavior its the way he looks i saw it just a few minutes ago he was upset about his mother lowered his face and gave this defeated look that was a carbon copy of the expression on mccloskeys face in his arrest photo the resemblance once you notice it is really striking noels short dark handsome almost pretty mccloskey used to have that same type of good looks used to said milo exactly someone who hadnt known him in the old days would never have spotted it the old days he said and walked back inside the restaurant cmon don milo propped a finger under ramps chin ramp gazed back with cloudy eyes okay said milo ive been there don so i know getting the words out is like passing a kidney stone dont talk just blink once for yes twice for no is noel drucker mccloskeys kid or not nothing then dry lips formed the word yes and a sibilant whisper followed does noel know i said ramp shook his head and lowered it to the table boils had broken out on the back of his neck and he smelled like the bear cage at the zoo milo said noel and joel bethel have a flair for light verse or something ramp looked up his facial skin had the texture and color of old custard and his mustache was clogged with skin flakes he said noel because she couldnt shaking his head and starting to droop again milo propped him up she couldnt what don ramp stared at him weteyed she cant she knew joel the way the word looked so noel three letters the same remember he eyed the bourbon bottle sighed closed his eyes i said she couldnt read she named him noel because it looked like joel and she wanted something she could visualize nod is she still illiterate faint nod tried to she couldnt howd she manage to do her job i said taking orders totaling the check unintelligible sounds from ramp milo said cmon dammit stop blubbering ramp lifted his head slightly memory she knew everything the whole menu by heart when theres a special she we rehearse it and filling out the check said milo i look of exhaustion you take care of it i said you take care of her just like the old days back at the studio what was she a country girl came out west to be a star appalachia he said hill billy poor girl from the sticks i said you knew shed never make it in pictures especially not being able to read lines did you help her keep it secret for a while nod joel joel blew her cover he nodded belched and let his head loll pictures for him he caused her to lose her contract at the studio and then hired her as a model nod milo said howd she get a drivers license written tests memorized all of them must have taken a long time ramp nodded and wiped his nose with the back of his hand he lowered his head to the table again this time milo let him remain there have she and mccloskey maintained contact all these years i said ramps head shot up with surprising speed no she hated it not what she wanted what wasnt the baby noel wince loved him but but what don beseeching look what don rape mccloskey got her pregnant by raping her nod all the time all the time what don said milo rape he raped her all the time nod why didnt you protect her from that said milo ramp began to sob the tears landed in his mustache and beaded in the greasy hairs he tried to say something choked milo put his finger under ramps chin used a napkin to dab the weeping mans face what don he said gently everyone said ramp tears flowing everyone raped her sob gulp had her shes not struggling to lift his hand he tapped his head shes not bright said milo everyone took advantage of her nod tears everyone don ramps head lolled and dipped his eyes closed saliva trickled down one side of his mouth milo said okay don and lowered ramps face to the table once more i followed milo back to the bar the two of us sat and watched ramp for a while he began to snore the studio wild bunch i said the dumb illiterate girl everyone passed around howd you know from the way noel acted just before we were talking about his mother he mentioned she said that working anywhere else wouldnt be the same started to elaborate and stopped when i pressed him on it he got mad and left that struck me as unusual hes a kid who controls his emotions needs to be in control typical for someone growing up with a druggie or alkie parent so i knew whatever it was that made him blow up had to be important then when ramp started talking it all fit illiterate said milo living that way all these years never knowing when someone was going to blow her cover ramp taking care of her and the kid out of guilt or compassion or both guess he is a genuine soft guy yeah he said again glancing over at ramp and shaking his head i said it explains bethels willingness to wait tables while ramp and gina lived like royalty she was used to being the doormat failed at acting and got into heavy dope and god knows what else topped it off by getting pregnant by the guy everyone hated posed for pictures that probably werent high fashion the way shes built isnt exactly suited to vogue it adds up to subterranean selfesteem milo she probably figures what ramp gave her is more than she deserves and now shes in danger of losing even that he ran his hand over his face what i said if mccloskey exposed bethel then raped her why would she freak out when she found out he was dead maybe it was still a loss to her maybe she harbored some small bit of good feeling toward him for giving her noel milo spun on the stool ramp snored louder or said milo what if it was more than some little bit of good feeling what if she and mccloskey have been in contact with each other misery loving company a common enemy i said gina they both couldve hated her mccloskey for whatever reason he had in the first place bethel out of jealousy the haves against the havenots what if she wasnt quite so happy playing the underdog and what if there was another ingredient sweetening the relationship money blackmail over what who knows but gina was a member of the wild group you said you didnt uncover any dirt on her so she was better than the others at keeping it quiet making her secret worth even more werent you the one who told me secrets were coin of the realm out here so what if mccloskey and bethel took that literally if mccloskey had been bethels partner in something nasty it would make sense for her to bolt after hearing he was dead joel and bethel noel and melissa i said too goddam ugly i hope youre wrong i know he said i keep coming up with them but we didnt write the movie were just reviewing it he continued to look pained i said what if noel ran down mccloskey hes the first one i thought of when i heard a car had been the weapon cars are his thing he has access to all of ginas think we should open all those garages see if any of the classics have frontend damage waste of time he said he wouldnt have used one of those too conspicuous no one in azusa saw ginas rolls drive up to the dam not true we dont know that sheriff filed it as an accident no one ever did a doortodoor okay i said so noel used some kind of utility vehicle they used to have one back when i was treating melissa old caddy fleetwood she called it a cadillac knockabout theyve probably got one like that today cant use a duesenberg to pick up the groceries its stashed somewhere on those seven acres or in one of those garages or maybe mccloskey was run down with stolen wheels noel could know how to hotwire from toogoodtobetrue to juvenile delinquent like you said things change he swung toward the bar oedipus wrecks he said the allamerican kid runs over his old man how much therapy will it take to patch that one up i didnt answer across the room ramp snorted and gasped for air his head lifted sank rolled to the side milo said be a good idea to get him lucid see what else we can squeeze out of him also be a good idea to wait around and see if old bethel comes back he looked at his watch got to be getting over to the airport you feel like sticking around ill check in with you when im settled lets say before nine what about your surveillance guy cant he take over here nope he doesnt come out into the open part of the deal antisocial something like that all right i said i was planning to play with the phone for a while check out a few more boston things what do i do if bethel comes back keep her here try to get whatever you can out of her using what technique he came around from behind the bar hitched his trousers buttoned his jacket and slapped me on the back your charm your phd baldfaced lies whichever feels best ramp slipped into a deep sleep i cleared the bottle glass and cup from the table put them in the bar sink and dimmed the lights until they were no longer cruel a phonein to my service yielded no messages from boston just a few business calls that i handled for half an hour at fourthirty the phone rang someone wanting to know when the tankard would be open again i said as soon as possible and hung up feeling like a bureaucrat over the next hour i disappointed lots of people wanting to make dinner reservations at fivethirty i felt cold and adjusted the airconditioning thermostat pulling a cloth off one of the other tables i draped it over ramps shoulders he continued to doze the great escape more in common with melissa than either of them would ever know at fiveforty i went into the restaurants kitchen and fixed myself a roast beef sandwich and cole slaw the coffee urn was cold so i settled for a coke bringing all of it back to the bar i ate and watched ramp continue to sleep then phoned the house hed once called home madeleine answered i asked if susan lafamiglia was still there oui one momen a second later the attorney came on hello dr delaware whats up hows melissa thats what i wanted to talk to you about hows she doing right now i got her to eat so i suppose thats a good sign what can you tell me about her psychological status in terms of what mental stability these kinds of cases can get nasty do you see her as someone who can deal with court without cracking up its not a matter of cracking up i said its the cumulative stress level her moods tend to go up and down she alternates between fatigue and withdrawal and bursts of anger shes not stabilized yet id watch her for a while wouldnt get right into litigation until i was sure shed settled down up and down she said kind of a manicdepressive thing no theres nothing psychotic about it its actually pretty logical considering the emotional roller coaster shes been on how long do you think itll take for her to settle down its hard to say you can work with her on strategy the intellectual part of it but avoid anything confrontational for the time being confrontational is mostly what ive seen from her that surprised me what with her mother being dead only a few days i expected more grief that may relate to something she learned in therapy years ago channeling anxiety to anger in order to feel more in control i see she said so youre giving her a clean bill of health as i said i wouldnt want to see her go through any major upheaval right now but in the long run i expect her to do okay and shes certainly not psychotic okay good would you be willing to say that in court because the case may end up hinging on mental competence even if the other side has engaged in illegal activities if that turns out to be the case well be in luck and im looking into that angle as im sure milo told you jim douse just went through a very expensive divorce and i know for a fact that he bought too many junk bonds for his personal portfolio theres talk of some funny business up at the state bar but it may turn out to be nothing more than dirt thrown around by his exwifes attorneys so ive got to cover all bases assume douse and the banker acted like saints even if they didnt with the way books can be juggled major skullduggery can be hard to uncover i deal with movie studios all the time their accountants specialize in that this case is sure to get nasty because its a sizable estate it could drag on for years i need to know my clients solid solid enough i said for someone her age but that doesnt mean invulnerable solids good enough doctor ah shes coming back now do you want to speak to her sure a beat then hi dr delaware hi howre things going fine actually i thought maybe you and i could talk sure when um im working with susan now and im getting kind of tired how about tomorrow tomorrow it is ten in the morning okay sure thanks dr delaware and im sorry if ive been difficult you havent been melissa im just i wasnt thinking about mother i guess i was denying it i dont know doing all that sleeping now i keep thinking about her cant stop never seeing her again her face knowing she never will again tears long silence im here melissa things will never be the same she said then she hung up sixtwenty still no sign of bethel or noel i phoned my service and was told professor sam ficker had called and left a boston number i phoned it and got a young child on the line hello professor fiacre please my daddys not home do you know where he is an adult female voice broke in fiacre residence whos calling this is dr alex delaware returning professor fiacres call this is the babysitter doctor seth said you might be calling heres the number where you can reach him she read off the number and i copied it down thanking her i gave her the tankards number for callback hung up and dialed the one shed given me a male voice said legal seafoods kendall square im trying to reach professor fiacre hes having dinner there spell that please i did hold on a minute passed three more ramp appeared to be rousing sitting up with great effort he wiped his face with a grimy sleeve blinked looked around and stared at me no apparent recognition closing his eyes he drew the tablecloth around his shoulders and settled back down seth came on the phone alex hi seth sorry to bother you at dinner perfect timing were between courses i couldnt get much on the gabneys other than that their leaving wasnt totally voluntary so they may have been up to something unsavory but i sure couldnt find out what it was were they asked to leave harvard not officially nothing procedural as far as i can tell the people i spoke to really didnt want to get into details what i gathered was that it was a mutual thing they gave up tenure and split and whoever knew something didnt belabor it as to what that something is i dont know anything on the types of patients they were treating phobics thats about it sorry i appreciate your trying i did run a search through psych abstracts and medline to try to find out what kind of work they were doing as it turns out not much she never published anything until four years ago leo was still cranking the stuff out then all of a sudden it stopped no more experiments no clinical studies just a couple of essays very soft stuff the kind of résuméfiller hed never have gotten published if he wasnt leo gabney essays on what philosophical issues free will the importance of taking personal responsibility spirited attacks on determinism how any behavior can be changed given the proper identification of congruent stimuli and reinforcers et cetera et cetera doesnt sound too controversial no he said maybe its old age what is getting philosophical and abandoning real science ive seen other guys go through it when they hit menopause gotta tell my students if i ever start doing it take me out and shoot me we traded pleasantries for a few more minutes then said goodbye when the line was clear i called the gala banner a recording informed me that the papers office was closed no beep for messages i dialed boston information and tried to get a home number for the editor bridget mcwilliams a b l mcwilliams was listed on cedar in roxbury but the voice that answered there was male sleepy tinged with a caribbean accent and certain he had no relation named bridget by sixforty id been alone in the restaurant for over two hours and had grown to hate the place i found some writing paper behind the bar along with a portable radio kkgo was no longer playing jazz so i made do with soft rock i kept thinking about missed connections seven oclock scratch marks on paper still no sign of bethel or noel i decided to stick around until milo reached sacramento then call him and beg off the assignment go home attend to my fish eggs maybe even call robin i phoned my exchange again left a message for milo in case i was out when he called the operator recorded it dutifully then said theres one for you if you want it doctor from whom someone named sally etheridge did she say what it was about just her name and number its long distance another sixoneseven area code what is that boston yes i said give me the number please important huh maybe a human being answered uhhuh female music in the background i switched off my radio the music on the other end took shape rhythm and blues lots of horns james brown maybe ms etheridge speaking dr alex delaware calling from los angeles silence i was wondering if youd call back hoarse and husky southie accent what can i do for you im not the one asking did bridget mcwilliams give you my number bingo she said are you a reporter on the banner oh yeah right i interview circuit breakers im an electrician mister but you do know kathy kate moriarty these questions are coming awfully fast she said talking slowly deliberate slowness small laugh at the end of the sentence i thought i detected an alcohol slur but maybe being with ramp all this time had biased my perceptions kates been gone for over a month i said her family yeah yeah i know that tune got it from bridge tell the family not to get bent out of shape kate disappears a lot thats her thing this time it may not be routine think so i do well she said youre entitled if youre not worried whyd you bother to call pause good question i dont even know you so why dont we cut our losses and make byebye hold on i said please a polite one huh laugh okay you got a minute im a psychologist the message i left for bridget explained how i could be yeah yeah i got all that too so youre a shrink so excuse me if thats not real comforting youve had bad experiences with shrinks silence i like myself just fine i said eileen wagner thats why you called long silence for a moment i thought shed left the line then you knew eileen i met her when she was a pediatrician out here she referred a patient to me but when i tried to get in touch with her to talk about it she never got back to me guess shed left town by then went overseas guess so were she and kate friends laughter no but kate was interested in eileens death i found a clipping shed put in her scrapbook boston globe no byline was kate freelancing for the globe at that time i dont know she said harshly why the hell should i care what the hell she was doing and who the hell she was working for definite booze slur more silence i said im sorry if this is upsetting you are you yes why that caught me off guard and before i found my answer she said you dont know me from eve why the hell should you care how i feel okay i said its not compassion for you specifically its force of habit i like making people happy maybe its partly an ego trip i went to school to be a yeasayer yeasayer yeah i like that yea yea yea you and the beatles john paul whatsisname and ringo and shrink psyching the crowd i wanna hold your gland brittle laughter in the background james brown was begging for something love or mercy i said eileen was also a yeasayer im not surprised she went into psychiatry four more beats of brown ms etheridge nothing sally yeah im here god knows why tell me about eileen eight bars i held my tongue finally she said ive got nothing to tell it was a waste a fucking waste whyd she do it sally why do you think cause she didnt wanna

bars of brown the song title popped into my head baby please dont go she said maybe i dont fucking know kate moriarty thought so sally she found out something about eileens therapists didnt she thats what brought her all the way out to california i dont know she repeated i dont know all she ever did was ask questions she never talked much about what she was doing thought i was obligated to talk to her because she was gay howd she get in contact with you gala i did all the wiring on their goddam offices opened my mouth and told her about eileen she lit up like a christmas tree all of a sudden we were sisters in arms but she never talked only asked she had all these rules what she could talk about what she couldnt i thought we were but she oh fuck this fuck this whole thing its been too fucking long and im not putting myself through it again so fucking forget it and fuck you dead air no music i waited a moment called back busy signal tried five minutes later same result i sat there putting it together seeing things in another light another context that caused everything to make sense time to ring another number different area code this one was listed surname and first initial only i copied dialed waited five rings until someone picked up and said hello i hung up without returning the greeting no air blowing through the vents but the room felt even colder after draping a second cloth around ramps shoulders i left five minutes of studying the thomas guide a hundred and twenty minutes on freeway north following through twilight arrived midway through the drive by the time i reached santa barbara the sky was black i picked up the near goleta found the san marcos pass with little difficulty and drove through the mountains all the way to lake cachuma locating what i was looking for was more of a challenge this was ranch country no street signs or lamps or chamber of commerce puffery i overshot the first time didnt realize it until i hit the town of ballard reversing direction i cruised slowly despite straining eyes and a heavy foot on the brake i passed it going the other way too but my headlights trapped a wooden sign just long enough for the image to register as i rolled by incentive ranch private property i cut the lights backed up and stuck my head out the car window cooler up here a breeze that smelled of dust and dry grass the sign was handmade nailhead letters in pine swinging gently over a square wooden gate the gate was low and squat horizontal planks in a wooden frame maybe five feet high connected to tongueandgroove fencing that blocked the entry leaving the engine running i got out of the seville and walked to the gate it yielded a bit when i pushed but remained shut after a couple of false starts i found a toehold between two of the planks hoisted myself up and ran my hand over the inner side of the gate metal latch big padlock the view beyond barely starlit below a narrow dirt road passing between what looked to be tall trees mountains in the background sharp and black as a witchs cap returning to the car i edged out and drove a hundred yards or so until i found a spot where the shoulder was shaded by trees shrubs really scrawny windwhipped things that appeared to grow out of the mountainside and hung suspended over the asphalt not concealment but maybe just enough camouflage to shield the car from casual discovery i parked locked walked back to the gate on foot recovered my toehold and was over in a wink the road was lumpy and pebblestrewn i lost my footing several times in the darkness and landed on my palms as i got closer to the tall trees i picked up a piny scent my face began to tingle and itch unseen bugs feasting on my flesh the trees were packed close together but few in number within moments i was in unprotected space flat space lit gray by a feeble quarter moon i stopped listened heard the blood sloshing in my ears gradually details asserted themselves a stadiumsize plot of dirt planted in no discernible pattern with half a dozen trees lowvoltage spots at some of the trunk bases my nose went to work again citrus perfume so strong my mouth tasted summervacation lemonade unimpressed the bugs stayed with red meat i took a cautious step ten more then twenty fuzzy white rectangles appeared through the leaves of one of the trees i walked around the citrus boughs the rectangles became windows i knew there had to be a wall behind them and my mind drew one before my eyes actually saw it a house modest size single story lowpitched roof three windows lit but nothing visible through them curtained the basic california ranch setup silent pastoral so peaceful it made me doubt my hunch but too many things fit together i searched for more details saw the vehicle i was looking for to the left of the house was stakeandpost fencing a corral behind that outbuildings i headed toward them heard the whinny and snort of horses filled my nose with the mealy aroma of old hay and manure the horse sounds grew louder i located the origin stables directly behind the corral behind that twenty yards back a tall building that appeared windowless feed barn farther back to the right a smaller structure light there too one rectangle single window i moved forward the horses pawed and whickered got louder only a few from the sound of it but what they lacked in numbers they made up in anxiety i held my breath continued hooves thudded against soft wood i thought i felt the earth vibrate but it might have been my legs shaking the horses turned up the volume even further lathering passionately i heard a creak and a click from the direction of the smallest building pressing myself against the corral i watched a column of light spread across the dirt as the front door to the building swung open a screen door whistled and someone stepped out the horses kept whinnying one of them let out a throaty gaseous rumble a deep voice shouted shut up sudden silence the shouter stood there for a moment then went back inside the light column thinned to a thread but didnt vanish i stayed here listening to the horses panting feeling manylegged things tour my hands and face finally the door shut all the way i slapped at my cheeks waited several more minutes before moving forward behind the stable walls the horses were whimpering in frustration i ran past them kicking up gravel and cursing my leather shoes i stopped at the barn door sounds not equine were coming from the small building the single window cast a filmy glow on the dust sticking close to the barn siding i inched my way toward the light step by step the sounds took on tone and form and species human a human duet one voice talking another humming no moaning i was at the front wall of the small building now pressing against rough wood but still unable to shape the sounds into words angry tone in the first voice giving orders the second voice resisting a curious highfrequency noise like that of a tv being switched on more moans louder someone resisting and suffering because of it i ran to the window crouched below the sill until my knees hurt slowly raised myself and tried to peer through the shades opaque all i could discern was the barest abstraction of movement the lightshift of form through space the sounds of torment continued from within i got to the door pulled the screen door open and winced as it creaked the sounds continued i groped in the darkness for the handle to the inner door rusted knob loose on its bearings metallic jingle i quieted it by grasping with both hands turned slowly pushed an inch of spyspace i looked through it heart speeding what i saw spurred it faster my hand pulled the door open in the room was long and narrow and paneled with fake wormwood the color of cigarette ash black linoleum floor light from two cheap looking swag lamps on opposite ends dry smokeflavored heat from a wall unit a pair of chipped white barber chairs were bolted to the center of the floor set three feet apart in semirecline the first chair was empty the second contained a woman wearing a hospital gown tethered at ankles wrists waist and chest by broad leather straps patches of hair had been shaved from her head creating a crude checkerboard electrodes were fastened to white scalppatches and to arms and inner thighs wires running from each site merged to a central orange cable that snaked across the floor and ended at a gray metal box high as a refrigerator twice as wide the box was faced with dials and glassed meters some of the needles on the meters quivered the edge of something stuck out from behind the box chromeshiny wheeled legs a second cable connected the box to a device that sat on a gray metal table paper drum and mechanical arm the arm held several mechanical pens jagged graph lines peaked and troughed across the drum which was rotating slowly next to the machine were several amber pharmaceutical vials and a white plastic inhalator directly facing the woman was a largescreen television console a closeup of a female breast its nipple applesized was frozen on the screen the image shifted closeup of a face a pubic thatch back to the nipple a man stood next to the set holding a black remotecontrol device in one hand a larger gray one in the other he was chewing gum his eyes were hot with triumph that turned to alarm when he saw me the woman in the chair was ursula cunninghamgabney her eyes were raw and swollen and wide with terror and her mouth was stuffed with a blue bandana the man was sixtyish with bushy white hair and a small round face he wore a black sweatshirt over blue jeans and work boots his boots were crusted with dried dirt his eyes widened and blinked his wife tried to scream around her gag what emerged was a thin retch he never looked at her i moved toward him he shook his head and pressed a button on the gray remote the highfrequency sound id heard outside filled the room shrill as a bird being butchered as the needle on one of the meters jumped ursulas body bucked and pitched against her restraints she kept quaking as her husbands finger remained on the button he didnt seem to be noticing her at all was staring at me and inching backward the horror made me dizzy clearing my head i took a step gabneys basso voice said stop damn you as he pressed another button the high noise became a shriek and another needle arced to the right the room smelled of burnt toast ursula growled around her gag and shook as if being throttled fingers and toes convulsed at the end of pinioned limbs her torso rose totally off the seat only the strap seemed to prevent her from flying away the veins in her neck swelled her jaws were forced open and the gag flew out of her mouth followed by a soundless scream her body was as rigid as cordwood skin silvery white except for the lips which looked bluish i fought down nausea and panic gabney had danced farther away from me halfconcealed behind the big gray box finger still on the gray remote i moved toward the barber chair gabney stopped pushing long enough to say go ahead flesh is an excellent conductor ill turn up the voltage and cook both of you i stood still ursula had sunk like a sack of rocks wheezing whistling sounds came from her open mouth she moved her head from side to side throwing off sweatdrizzle chest heaving panting gutturally through grotesquely swollen lips her legs were the last to relax parting slightly the electrode between them was attached to some kind of sanitary napkin i snapped my head away looked for gabney from behind the gray box his voice said sit down farther back even farther thats good and keep your hands in full view exactly he emerged paler than before one arm resting on the top corner of the chromeshiny thing took a sidelong glance at the giant breast wondering if he had help i said quite a setup a lot for one man to handle dont patronize me you insolent shit everythings manageable as long as the proper variables are controlled no dont scoot forward or ill have to deliver more aversives you made your point i said his fingers danced above the buttons on the gray remote but didnt touch them control i said is that the primary goal you call yourself a scientist isnt it yours before i could answer he shook his head in disgust define predict and control otherwise why bother how does that reconcile with your ideas about free will he smiled my little disquisitions how conscientious of you to read them but if you were half as smart as you think you are youd see theres plenty of free will in all of this this is about free will its restoration glancing at the apparatus a person shackled by major personality defect can never be free ursula groaned the sound made his brow crease i said where is gina he ignored me said nothing for what seemed like a long time looked at the floor pulled on the chrome thing and brought half of it into view bed on wheels pullup caged sides adultsized crib the kind they use in nursing homes gina ramp behind the bars lying inert eyes closed sleeping or unconscious or i saw her chest move saw her checkerboard scalp cables attached to her too listen carefully idiot gabney finally said im going to go over there and retrieve that bandana but my hand will remain on the highestvoltage button if you move ill incinerate your precious gina fifteen seconds at this level elicits death irreversible brain damage requires much less lightly tapping a button making the prone body twitch i said im not moving keeping his eye on me he crouched next to his wifes chair picked up the gag stood wadded it and inserted it in her mouth she coughed and made choking sounds but didnt resist the seam of her gown read property mass general relax darling he said using the black remote he switched off the tv taking a stance in front of the screen he gave her a look that i couldnt categorize domination and contempt lust and just a bit of affection which sickened me the most i looked over at gina who still hadnt stirred dont worry about her said gabney shell be out for a while chloral hydrate ye olde mickey finn she responds well to it given her history and weak constitution ive treated her with kid gloves what a guy dont interrupt me again he said louder pressing a button that made the room scream and caused ginas body to flop like a cloth doll no conscious perception of pain was evident on her face but her lips drew back in a toothy rictus that stretched and puckered the skin on her bad side when the noise died gabney said a bit more of that and all that lovely plastic surgery will have been for naught stop i said quit whining this is the last time youll get a warning understood i nodded the burnttoast smell filled my head gabney stared at me contemplative this is a problem he said and tapped the gray remote what is why the hell did you meddle how did you find out one thing kind of led to the other kind of led he said kind of led wonderful grammar who wrote your thesis for you shaking his head kind of led just a loose chain of events was it knocking around aimlessly damn near random i looked at the machines his face darkened dont judge me dont you damn well dare this is treatment youve violated confidentiality i said nothing do you have even the slightest notion of what im talking about sexual reconditioning i said youre trying to rechannel your wifes sexual orientation profound he said just brilliant youre able to describe what you see freshman psych second part of the first semester he stared at me tapping one boot i said what am i missing missing dry laughter just all of it the meat the raison dêtre the goddam clinical rationale the rationale is that youre helping her become normal and you dont think thats worthwhile before i could answer he shook his head and cursed then tightened the arm holding the shock remote my eyes snapped reflexively to the gray plastic i realized id broken out into a sweat waiting for the highfrequency shriek and the pain that was sure to follow gabney lowered his hand smiling empathetic conditioning and so rapidly my you have a mushy heart a pity for your patients the smile dissolved in a pool of contempt well what you think doesnt matter one goddam iota keeping his eye on me he inched over toward ursula lifting her gown with the black remote he exposed her thighs and said flawless except for the bruises nothing that wont heal sometimes creativity is called for creativity i said interesting way to think of torture he stepped directly in front of me just out of arms reach fingers tapping the buttons lightly setting off highfrequency chirps and staccato movements of both womens bodies are you being intentionally stupid he said i shrugged torture implies intent to cause harm im delivering aversive stimuli in order to enhance the rate of learning aversives are potent little buggers only a mushyhearted moron would question their usefulness this is no more torture than a vaccination is or emergency surgery from around ursulas gag came the sound a mouse makes when cornered i said just speeding up the old learning curve prof gabney studied me gave the gray remote a couple of quick jabs and caused both of the women to convulse i forced myself to look casual he said something amusing all your talk about treatment yet you keep using the shocks to vent your anger doesnt that break the stimulusresponse chain and why if youre retraining ursula are you shocking gina shes just the stimulus isnt she he said oh shut up sexual reconditioning i said it was tried years ago back in the early seventies and discredited primitive crap methodologically crude though it might have developed into something worthwhile if the gay lib agitators hadnt shoved their point of view down everyones throat so much for free will i shrugged again he said i dont imagine your mind is capable of opening sufficiently to snare facts but here are a few anyway i love my wife she elicits love from me and for that ill always be grateful shes a remarkable human being first in her family to finish high school i recognized how special she was the first time i met her the flame within she was damn near incandescent so her problem didnt deter me on the contrary it was a challenge and she agreed with both my assessment and my treatment plan what we accomplished together was totally consensual i said fixing her dont make it sound like something veterinary you idiot we worked together to solve her problem if thats not therapy i dont know what is and what emerged from our work together could benefit millions of women the plan itself was simple positive reinforcement delivered contingent upon heterosexually induced arousal and punishment administered as a consequence of exposure to homoerotic material but the application posed a huge challenge adapting the paradigm to female physiology with a male subject measurement of arousal is a snap using a penile plesmographic cuff you record degree of tumescence females are structurally more secretive our initial idea was to develop a sort of minicuff for the clitoris but it proved impractical i wont go into details it was she who came up with the intravaginal moisture probe that she now wears so handsomely given proper baseline analyses of secretions weve been able to correlate bioelectrical changes with perceived sexual arousal the potential ramifications are fantastic compared to what weve done masters and johnson are painting on cave walls fantastic i said too bad it didnt work oh it worked all right for years not for eileen wagner he stroked ursula again and turned back to me now that was a mistake my wifes mistake poor patient selection wagner was pathetic a cow a mushyhearted bovine dogooder psychology and psychiatry are so full of them if you thought so little of her whyd you accept her as your fellow at harvard he shook his head and laughed she wasnt my anything i would have sent her to nursing school she rotated for a month on my wifes service rounds and didactic sessions and clinical supervision my wife learned of her sexual pathology and tried to help her the way id helped my wife i was against it from the beginning felt the cow wasnt suitable for our technique not enough motivation no willpower her obesity alone should have been enough to disqualify her on that account she was squalid but my wife was too kind and i gave in was she your first subject after ursula our first patient unfortunately and as id predicted she did very poorly which says absolutely nothing about the technique he gave a sharp look over at his wife i thought i saw a finger tense id call suicide a very poor response i said suicide his smile was slow almost lazy he shook his head bear this in mind the cow was incapable of doing anything for herself strangled sounds from ursula gabney said im sorry dear i never told you did i harvard believed it was suicide i said somehow the med school found out what kind of research you were doing and asked you to leave somehow he said the smile gone the cow was a scribbler tearstained love notes never sent stuffed in a desk drawer disgusting stuff walking over to his wife again he stroked her cheek kissed a shaved spot on her head her eyes were clenched tight she made no effort to turn away love notes to you darling he said mushy incoherent hardly evidence but i had enemies in the department and they pounced i could have fought it but harvard had nothing more to offer me its really not what its cracked up to be it was clearly time for a move california i said san labrador your wifes suggestion wasnt it go west for clinical opportunities opportunities arising out of ursulas supervision of eileen wagner closeddoor sessions that turned into therapy as supervision often does eileen talking about her past her needs the sexual conflicts that had caused her to switch from pediatrics to psychiatry recounting her experiences years before with a beguiling wealthy agoraphobic a ravaged princess ensconced in a peachcolored castle crippled by fear that had eventually spread to her daughter a little girl so remarkable shed called for help herself an elevenyearold conversation came back to me eileen in sensible shoes and a mannish blouse shifting her gladstone bag from hand to hand shes really beautiful despite the scars sweet in a vulnerable way sounds like you learned a lot from a brief visit the color rising in eileens cheeks one tries her embarrassment a puzzle so clear now more than a brief visit had taken place a lot more than medical consultation melissa had sensed something out of the ordinary without fully understanding shes my mothers friend she likes my mother jacob dutchy had known too made a point of portraying ginas avoidance of me as a generic fear of doctors id questioned it she met with dr wagner yes that was a surprise she doesnt cope well with surprises are you saying she had some sort of adverse reaction just to meeting with dr wagner lets just say it was difficult for her would it be easier for her to deal with a female therapist no absolutely not its not that at all gina and eileen the stirring the inclinations that each had fought for so long cravings gina had dealt with by marrying a physically grotesque man who played the role of father the second time around choosing a bisexual man an old friend with a secret of his own whom she could turn to for companionship and mutual tolerance and the outward appearance of married bliss separate bedrooms eileen coping with the selfloathing shed felt after sussex knoll by abandoning her practice leaving town and traveling the world as a caregiver unpressured to defend herself devoting herself to saving lives as she waged war with her pain losing too many battles and choosing another strategy one so many other bright troubled people have taken the study of the mind child psychiatry because lets get back to the root of it all harvard because lets learn from the best harvard and a bluecollar lover an electrician with no patience for soulbaring then rotation on ursulas service the mischief gods must have been chortling heartily rap sessions confessions pain and passion and confusion someone whod listen to all the things sally etheridge never wanted to hear about ursula heard and was changed herself burying it by playing doctor a behavioral nightmare becomes real the mischief gods beside themselves with glee treatment failure of the worst kind byebye boston time for a move california in search of the princess in search of the idea of the princess wealthy phobics ursula knew she could help playing doctor fee for service big fees all is well then the child calls again opportunities gabney was saying yes thats basically the way she put it a business decision i preferred florida less expensive the airs a hell of a lot better but she pushed for california and not knowing what she was really after i relented its when i relent that things go wrong he looked over at gina his face befouled with rage the flailing mindsearing fury of a man blocked from possessing what he craved because of another woman the ultimate insult to the feeble thing known as maleness suddenly i was certain joel mccloskey had been insulted too thrown over by another woman dirty joke bad joke burrowing through his dopesoftened brain like a spirochete rejection festering the hatred of homosexuals dealing with it by demolishing ginas beauty blotting out criminal womanhood too cowardly to do it himself cowardly about exposing his motives as well for fear of what that would say about him had gina ever understood why shed suffered gabney emitted a low angry sound staring at gina then at his wife ive never been deceptive with her but she chose to change the rulesboth of them did when did you first suspect shortly after that ones treatment began it was nothing specific just nuances subtle variations that a man who knew less or cared less might never have noticed spending more time with her than all the other patients extra sessions that werent necessary from a clinical point of view changing the subject and showing odd resistance when i challenged her and abandoning the ranch she used to come up here regularly despite the allergies took antihistamines and tolerated the pollens in order to spend peaceful weekends with me all of that stopped as soon as she came into our lives he smiled this is the first time shes been up here since then all those stupid excuses for staying in the city that she thought i didnt see through i knew damn well what was going on wanted hard data to preclude any more lies so i made a few modifications to our office intercom and began listening in heard them the round face trembledmaking their plans plans for what to leave he pressed his free hand over his face as if ironing out grief together giant steps melissa sensing the truth feeling edged out by ursulas possessiveness gabney said this is how low it sank my wife accepted a piece of art from her an extremely valuable etching now if thats not an inexcusable breach of ethics i dont know what the hell is dont you agree i nodded money changed hands as well he said to her money means nothing because shes a spoiled bitch never been deprived of anything but it was bound to corrupt my wife she came from a poor family despite everything shes accomplished pretty things still impress her shes like a child that way the bitch understood that pointing at gina she gave her money on a regular basis enormous sums a secret bank account they called it their little nest egg giggling like stupid schoolgirls giggling and plotting to abandon their responsibilities and go gallivanting off to live like whores on some tropical island on top of the perversity what a disgusting waste my wife has a brilliant future the bitch seduced her and attempted to lay everything to waste i had to intervene the bitch would have destroyed her he pressed a button on the remote gina flopped ursula watched and made whimpering noises gabney said shut up darling or ill grill her synapses right now and to hell with the goddam treatment plan tears ran down ursulas cheeks she was silent and still if this upsets you darling blame yourself his finger finally lifted if i were a selfish man i would have simply killed her he said to me but i wanted to give her worthless spoiled life some meaning so i decided to apprentice her as a stimulus as youve so profoundly pointed out in vivo conditioning i said home movies science in the real world so you abducted her no no he said she came willingly patient to doctor exactly he gave a wide satisfied smile i phoned her in the morning informing her of a scheduling change instead of group therapy shed be having a oneonone session with me her beloved dr ursula was ill and i was filling in i told her wed make special progress today surprise her beloved dr ursula with outstanding progress i instructed her to drive her car out of the gates of her estate and pick me up two blocks away at a precise time i specified the rollsroyce told her something about consistency of stimuli because of course it has tinted windows she arrived right on the dot i had her slide over to the passenger side and i got behind the wheel she asked me where we were going i didnt answer that elicited visible symptoms of anxiety she wasnt even close to being ready for that kind of ambiguity she repeated her question once again i said nothing and continued to drive she began to get twitchy and to breathe rapidly prodromal signs when i sped onto the freeway she burst into a fullblown anxiety attack i handed her an inhaler that id doctored to contain chloral hydrate and instructed her to take a nice deep breath she did and passed out immediately which was elegant i was driving at fiftyfive miles per hour didnt want her thrashing around and creating a hazard unconscious she made a lovely traveling companion i drove to the dam where my land rover was waiting transferred her into the rover and pushed that ostentatious hunk of junk into the water pretty strenuous work for one man what you mean to say is strenuous for a man of my age but im in excellent shape clean living creative fulfillment the car didnt sink i said it caught on a flange he said nothing didnt move poor planning for someone as precise as you and with the land rover up there howd you get back to san labrador ah he said the man is capable of rudimentary reasoning yes youre correct i did have help a mexican fellow used to work for me up here at the ranch when we had more horses when my wife used to ride to ursula remember cleofais darling ursula shut her eyes tight water leaked out from under the lids gabney said this cleofais what a name eh was a big husky fellow not much in the way of brains no common sense he was essentially a twofooted beast of burden i was getting close to firing him only a few horses left no sense wasting money but the transfer of mrs ramp offered him one last chance to be useful he dropped me off in pasadena then took the rover up to the dam and waited he was the one who pushed the rollsroyce in but he miscalculated hit that flange or whatever easy mistake to make not if hed been careful why do i feel i said that he wont be making any more mistakes in the future why indeed exaggerated look of innocence ursula moaned gabney said oh stop spare me the dramatics you never liked him you were always calling him a stupid wetback always after me to get rid of him so now you have your way ursula shook her head weakly and sagged in her chair i said whered you take mrs ramp after the rolls was disposed of on a scenic drive through angeles crest forest along the backroads the precise route was highway to mount waterman highway to mountain high to palmdale to saugus to santa paula then straight down to the and onward to the ranch circuitous but pretty nothing like that in florida i said nothing at all why the dam i said its a rural spot comparatively close to the clinic yet remote no one goes up there i know because id been there several times to sell off horses my wife no longer wanted to ride thats all what else should there be well i said id be willing to wager you studied your wifes clinical notes and knew mrs ramp didnt like water he smiled i said i understand about the tinted windows providing cover but wasnt it risky using a car that conspicuous someone might have noticed and if they had what would they have seen a car that would have been traced to her just as it was the assumption would have been made that a mentally ill woman drove up there and either had an accident or committed suicide which is exactly what happened true i said trying to look thoughtful everything was considered delaware if cleofais had reported being spotted we would have moved on to another spot id earmarked several even the unlikely chance of being stopped by a policeman didnt worry me i would have explained that i was a psychotherapist with a patient whod had an anxiety attack and passed out and shown my credentials to back it up the facts would have backed me up and when she regained consciousness she would have backed me up because thats all she would have remembered isnt that elegant yes i said causing him to look at me sharply even traveling the back roads you had plenty of time to set her up here wait for your wife to call and report she hadnt shown up for group therapy then fake concern drive back to pasadena and make your appearance at the clinic where he said i had the not altogether salutary experience of meeting you and trying to find out how much i knew about mrs ramp why else would i bother to talk to you and for a moment you did have me concerned something you said about her having plans to make a new life then i realized you were just jawing knew nothing of any importance when did your wife find out what youd done when she woke up to find herself in that chair remembering ursulas hurried exit from the clinic i said whatd you tell her to get her up here i phoned her pretending to be ill and begged her to come up and take care of me good wife that she is she responded promptly i said how will you explain her absence to her patients bad flu ill take over their care dont expect any complaints two patients gone from the group now the therapist given the kind of anxiety youre dealing with it may not be so simple to reassure them two ah knowing smile bonny miss kathleen our intrepid girl reporter how did you come across that not knowing if kathy moriarty was alive or dead i said nothing well he said smiling wider if you think your evasiveness is going to help her forget it bonny miss kathleen wont be reporting anything anymore nasty little bulldagger the arrogance thinking something as complex as agoraphobia could be faked in my presence trying to bluster her way out when i caught her with threats and accusations she sat right in that chair pointing to ursulas helped me refine the technique where is she now i asked knowing the answer in the cold cold ground next to cleofais probably the first time shes been that intimate with a man i looked over at ursula her eyes were wide and frozen so everythings tied up i said elegant dont mock me mocking you isnt my intention on the contrary i had the greatest respect for your work read all your publications shock avoidance and escape paradigms controlled frustration schedules of fearinduced learning this is just i shrugged he stared at me for a long time you wouldnt he finally said be trying to bullshit me no i said but if i am big deal what can i do to you true he said flexing his fingers fifteen seconds to deepfry you couldnt bear being a party to that and ive got other toys you havent even seen yet im sure you have just as im sure youve convinced yourself its okay to use them on scientific grounds destroy the person to save her no ones being destroyed what about gina she wasnt much to begin with look at the way she lived insular selfish corrupt of no use to anyone by using her ive justified her i didnt know she needed justifying then know it idiot lifes transactional not some fluffy theological fantasy the worlds getting sucked dry resources are finite only the useful will survive who determines whats useful those who control the stimuli one thing you might consider i said is that despite all this highminded theorizing you may not be aware of your true motivations the corners of his mouth turned up are you applying to be my analyst i shook my head no way dont have the stomach for it his lips snapped down i said women the way theyve let you down the custody battle with your first wife the way her drinking caused the fire that killed your son the first time we met you mentioned a second wife before ursula i didnt get a sense of what she was like but something tells me she wasnt worthy either a nonentity he said nothing there is she still alive he smiled unfortunate accident she wasnt quite the swimmer she fancied herself to be water i said youve used it twice freudian theory would say it has something to do with the womb freudian theory is horse shit it could be right on the mark this time professor maybe this whole thing has nothing to do with science or love or any of that other horse shit youve been spreading and everything to do with the fact that you hate women really despise them and need to control them it implies something nasty in your own childhood neglect or abuse or whatever i guess what im saying is that id sure like to know what your mother was like his mouth opened and he jammed his hand down on the button machine screams a higher frequency than before his voice above the whine shouting but barely audible fifteen seconds i threw myself at him he backed away kicking and punching throwing the black remote at me and hitting me in the nose fingers white on the gray module the stench of burning flesh and hair clogged the room i tore at his hands hit him in the belly and he gasped and doubled but his grip was like steel i had to break his wrist before he let go i put the remote in my pocket kept my eye on him he was stretched out on the floor holding his wrist crying the women didnt stop jerking for a long long time i unplugged the machines ripped off the electrical cords and used them to bind his arms and legs when i was certain he was immobilized i went to the women i locked gabney in the barn took gina and ursula into the house put blankets over them got ursula to drink some apple juice that i found in the refrigerator organic like everything in the wellstocked fridge survival books on a kitchen shelf rifle and shotgun in a rack over the table swiss army knife case full of hypodermic needles and drug spansules the professor had been preparing for the long haul i phoned then put in an emergency call to susan lafamiglia she got over the horror remarkably fast turned efficient took down crucial details and told me shed handle the rest it took half an hour for the paramedics to arrive accompanied by four cars of santa barbara county sheriffs from the solvang substation during the wait i found gabneys records no great feat of detection hed left half a dozen notebooks on the dining room table a couple of pages were all i could bear to read i spent the next couple of hours talking to grimfaced people in uniforms susan lafamiglia arrived with a young man wearing an olivegreen hugo boss suit and retro tie had a few words with the cops and got me out of there mr fashion turned out to be one of her associates i never learned his name he drove the seville back to la and susan took me home in her jaguar she didnt ask me any questions and i fell asleep happy to be a passenger i missed my ten oclock appointment the next morning with melissa but not for lack of trying i was up at six watching baby koi the size of threadworms wiggle their way around the pond by ninethirty i was at sussex knoll the gates were open but no one answered the door i spotted one of the hernandez sons who was thinning ivy near the outer wall of the estate and asked him where gina was some hospital in santa barbara he said no he didnt know which one i believed him but tried the door again anyway as i drove away he gave me a sad look or maybe it was pity for my lack of trust id just nosed out onto the street when i saw the brown chevy approaching from the south traveling so slowly it seemed to be standing still i backed up and waited and when it pulled up in the driveway i was ready at the drivers window greeting a frightenedlooking bethel drucker sorry she said and put the car into reverse no i said please no ones here but id like to talk to you nothing to talk about then why are you here dont know she said she had on a plain brown dress costume jewelry very little makeup her figure refused to be suppressed i took no pleasure in looking at it it would be a while before looking would be fun again i really dont know she repeated her hand remained on the gearshift lever you came to pay your respects i said thats very kind of you she looked at me as if id spoken in tongues i walked around the front of the car and got in beside her she started to protest then with an ease that bespoke a lifetime of acquiescence her features assumed a resigned look what she said do you know what happened nod noel told me where is noel drove up there this morning to be with them the unspoken words as usual i said hes a great kid youve done a wonderful job her face quavered hes so damn smart sometimes i think hes not mine lucky for me i remember the pain pushing him out you wouldnt think to look at him but he was a big one nine pounds twentythree inches they told me he was gonna play football no one knew how smart he was gonna be is he going to harvard he doesnt tell me everything hes gonna do now if youll scuse me ive got to be going the place needs cleaning the tankard only place ive got for the time being is don planning to open it in the near future shrug he doesnt tell me his plans either i just wanna clean it before the dirt builds up okay i said can i just ask you one thing something personal her eyes filled just a question bethel sure whats the difference anyway talking dancing posing for pictures everyone gets what they want from me didnt know you were a model i lied oh yeah sure ha sure i was this big famous fashion model with these running her hands over her bust and laughing again yeah i was pretty fancy just like gina we were two of a kind only the ones who looked at me werent ladies buying clothes did joel take those pictures pause her hands were small and white around the steering wheel a cheap cameo ring encircled the ring finger him others what of it i was in lots of pictures i was a picture star even when i was pregnant and out to here some people are sick that way like to see pregnant women something for everyone i said she turned sharply but her tone was resigned youre mocking me no i said wearily no im not she studied me touched her bosom again you saw me she said driving off yesterday and now you want to know why i began to talk but she cut me off with a shake of her hand maybe to you its dumb getting upset over someone like him thats the way i felt about it too real dumb but im used to that being dumb so whats the difference anyway maybe to you it was real real dumb retarded because you think he was pure trash no wait a second let me finish he was pure shit no kindness in him everything made him mad and crazy he had to have his way all the time some of it was probly the dope he shot way too much speed but some of it was just the way he was made mean so i understand your thinking im dumb but he gave me something and no one ever gave me nothing not at that point of my life anyway since then don came through and id cry for him if something happened to him a hell of a lot more than i cried for the other one but at that point in my life the other one was the first one who gave me anything even if he didnt mean to even if he did it because he couldnt have what he really wanted and he took it out on me that didnt matter you understand it turned out good anyway you just said so yourself only damn good thing in my life so yeah i cried a little for him found myself a nice little spot and had a big boohoo then i remembered what pure trash he was and i stopped crying and now you dont see me crying no more that answer your question i shook my head i wasnt judging you bethel i dont think your being upset was wrong well arent you the smart one so whats your question then does noel know who his father was long silence if he doesnt you gonna tell him she said no not even to protect the little missy from what hitching up with a bad seed theres nothing bad about noel she started crying said so much for new years resolutions i handed her a handkerchief she blew noisily and said thank you sir a moment later i wouldnt trade places with that little girl for nothin with any of them neither would i bethel and im not asking about noel in order to protect her what then call it curiosity something else i need to figure out youre a real curious fellow arent you poking around in other peoples business forget it i said sorry for poking maybe he needs protecting from her huh why do you say that all this looking through the windshield at the big peachcolored house this kind of thing can eat you up noels head is on real good but you never know do you really think the two of them who knows i said theyre young have a lot of changes ahead of them because im really not comfortable with that youd think id be the one whod want it but i dont this isnt real it isnt the way real people were made to live hes my baby i pushed him out with a lot of pain and i dont want to see him eaten up by all this i know what you mean i said i hope melissa gets away from it too yeah i guess its not been any jar ahoney for her either no it hasnt yeah she said starting to touch her bust but dropping her hand i pushed the passenger door open good luck and thanks for your time no she said he doesnt know he thinks i dont know either i told him it was a onenight stand no way to ever find out he truly believes that i used to do things i told him a story that didnt make me look real good because i had to i had to do what i thought was right of course you did i said and took her hand and it was right the proof is in the pudding thats true bethel i really meant what i said about noel and the credit you get for it she squeezed my hand and let go you sound for real ill try to believe that milo came by my house at four i was working on my monograph and led him into the study lots of dirt on douse he said shaking his briefcase and putting it on my desk not that it matters much it might i said in terms of recovering anything hes already looted from the estate yeah he said lets hear it for private investigation how you doing fine really really how about yourself still on the job attorney lafamiglia likes my style a woman with taste you sure youre okay im fine there are baby fish down in the pond theyre surviving and growing and im in a great mood baby fish wanna see sure we went down to the japanese garden it took a while for him to see the hatchlings but finally he did and smiled yeah cute what do you feed them groundup fish food they dont get eaten some do the fast ones survive aha he sat down on a rock and exposed his face to the sun nyquist showed up late last night at the restaurant talked to don for a few minutes then split looks like farewell the van was packed up for longterm travel you get that from your guy every detail along with your departure down to the second hes a demon for particulars if id been smart id have told him to tail you would he have been able to help he smiled probably not were talking arthritis and emphysema but hes got damn good handwriting he looked at the paper in my typewriter whats that my paper on the hale school everything back to normal huh when do you see melissa as in therapy as in soon as possible after she gets back to la i called up there an hour ago she didnt want to leave her mothers side the doctor i spoke to said it should be about a week before gina can be moved then therell be extended care jesus he said melissas sure going to need it seeing you maybe everyone involved in this should go into therapy i did you a real favor huh actually you did when i write my memoirs this onell get a chapter of its own attorney lafamiglia said shed be my agent if i ever do it attorney lafamiglia would probably make a good agent he smiled ballsinthegrinder time for douse and anger almost feel sorry for them so you eat recently if not im up for something solid had a big breakfast i said but there is something i could go for whats that i told him he said christ alive dont you ever get enough i need to know for everyones sake if you dont want to pursue it ill grope along by myself he said jesus then okay run everything by me again the details i did thats it a phone on the floor thats all youve got the timings right okay he said it should be easy enough to get hold of the records the question is whether or not it was a toll call san labrador to santa monica is i said i already checked the bill mr detective he said mr private eye the place didnt look like what it was victorian house in a workingclass section of santa monica two stories big front porch with swings and rockers yellow clapboard sides with white and babyblue trim lots of cars on the street several more in the driveway better landscaping and maintenance than the other houses on the block my my i said pointing to a car in the driveway black cadillac fleetwood milo parked the porsche we got out and inspected the big cars front bumper deeply dented and freshly primered yeah looks right said milo we walked up the porch and through the front door a bell over the lintel tinkled the entry hall was filled with houseplants sweetsmelling too sweet concealing something a dark pretty woman in her early twenties came out white blouse red maxiskirt eurasian clear complexion can i help you milo told her who we wanted to see are you family acquaintances oldtime acquaintances i said like madeleine de couer madeleine she said with fondness shes here every two weeks so devoted and such a good cook we all love her butter cookies lets see what time it is sixten he may be sleeping he sleeps a lot especially lately getting worse i said physically or spiritually physically for starters weve seen some deterioration but it comes and goes one day hes walking fine the next he cant move its hard seeing him that way knowing whats in store its such an ugly disease especially for someone like him used to being active though i guess they all are id never even heard of what hes got its even rarer than lou gehrigs i had to bone up and there really isnt much in the medical books how about spiritually she smiled you know how he is but actually hes been real good to have around he cooks for the others tells them stories prods them when he thinks theyre getting lazy he even orders the staff around but no one minds hes such a dear when he when he cant do those things anymore its going to be a real loss sighing anyway why dont we see if hes awake we followed her up to the second floor passing bedrooms each containing two or three hospital beds old men and women occupied the beds watching television reading sleeping eating orally or intravenously young people in street clothes attended to them the place was very quiet the room she stopped at was at the rear smaller than the rest a single bed punch caricatures on the wall along with an oil painting of a young beautiful woman with an unscarred face ad initialed in the lower right corner nothing out of place bay rum aroma fighting to assert itself through the sweetness a man sat on the edge of the bed trying to insert a cuff link through french cuffs starched white cuffs navy tie blue serge trousers all of it much too large he seemed to be drowning in his clothes a pair of mirrorblack bluchers were lined up at the foot of the bed three identical pairs of shoes edged a woodgrain dresser that had been shined far more than its cheap construction merited next to the shoes was a fourlegged metal walker his hair was slicked and rightparted and bonewhite all the plumpness was gone from his face and his cheeks hung loosely in bulldog jowls his skin was the color of a plastic skeleton the cuff links were small squares of onyx people to see you said the young woman cheerfully the man struggled with the cuff link finally inserted it then turned and faced us a look of surprise passed over his face then great calm as if hed experienced the worstpossible scenario and survived he worked hard at producing a smile for the girl worked harder at getting the words out come in voice as fragile as antique crockery anything i can get you mr d asked the woman the man shook his head no more effort she left milo and i stepped in i closed the door hello mr dutchy i said curt nod do you remember me alex delaware nine years ago eyes fluttering he struggled to enunciate doc tor this is a friend of mine mr milo sturgis mr sturgis mr jacob dutchy a good friend of melissa and her mother sit motioning toward a chair the only other furniture was a walnut drum table of much better vintage than the dresser leather top covered partially by a doily tea service atop the doily pattern identical to one id seen in a small gray sitting room tea no thanks you he said to milo taking a long time to get it out look like a police man he is one i said on leave but hes not here in any official capacity i see dutchy folded his hands on his lap and sat there suddenly i regretted coming and wore it all over my face gentleman that he was he said dont wor ree talk no need to talk about it i said consider this a friendly visit halfsmile on bloodless razorslash lips talk any thing then how just guesswork i said the evening before mccloskey was run down madeleine sat by melissas bed and used the phone i saw it on the floor she called you here and told you gina was dead asked you to take care of it step into your old role no he said thats wrong not her nothing i dont think so sir said milo and pulled a piece of paper out of his pocket these are phone records made from melissas private line that night itemized down to the minute three within a onehour period to the pleasant rest hospice circum stantial said dutchy she talks to me all the time we saw the car sir said milo the cadillac thats registered to you interesting frontend damage i imagine the police lab would be able to work with that dutchy looked at him but not with any anxiety he seemed to be appraising milos clothes milo had dressed fairly well for him dutchy was reserving judgment dont worry mr dutchy said milo this is off the record even if it wasnt you havent been notified of your rights so anything you say cant be used against you madeleine had nothing to do with even if she did we dont care sir just trying to tie up loose ends she didnt fine said milo you thought of it all by yourself youre a oneman crime wave dutchys smile was astonishingly quick and full billy the kid what else dyou want to know whatd you use to lure mccloskey out said milo his son dutchys smile quavered and faded out like a weak radio signal dis honest but only way did noel or melissa call him no trembling no no no swear take it easy i believe you it took a while for dutchys face to stop shaking so who called mccloskey said milo it sure wasnt you friends what did the friends tell him son in troub el help pause for breath pat ernal heart strings dutchy made an excruciatingly slow tugging motion howd you know hed fall for that never know po ker you flushed him out with the son story then your friends ran him down no pointing to his starched shirtfront me you can still drive some times uhhuh in dee five hundred genuine glee on the pasty face milo said you and parnelli reedy laughter i guess its stupid to ask why ponderous headshake no not at all silence dutchy smiled and managed to get a hand on his shirtfront again ask milo rolled his eyes i said whyd you do it mr dutchy he stood tottered waved off our aid it took a full five minutes for him to get into an upright position i know because i was staring at the second hand of my watch another five to make it to the walker and lean on it triumphant triumph that went beyond the physical reason he said my job so tiny she said will they survive these are the survivors i said the key is keeping the grown ones well fed so they wont eat the babies howd you manage to hatch them i didnt do anything it just happened but you must have set it up or something to make it happen i provided the water she smiled we were at the edge of the pond the air was still and the waterfall whispered gently her bare legs were tucked under her skirt her fingers toyed with the zen grass i like it down here could we talk here every time sure so peaceful she said her hands left the grass and began kneading one another hows she doing i said all right i guess i keep waiting for something to i dont know break for her to start screaming or falling apart she looks almost too good does that worry you in a way i guess what really worries me is not knowing what she knows what she understands about what happened i mean she says she passed out and woke up in the hospital but but what maybe shes just protecting me or herself pushing it out of her memory repressing it i believe her i said the whole time i saw her she was unconscious totally unaware of her surroundings yes she said dr levine says the same thing i like him levine makes you feel he has plenty of time that what you have to say is important im glad thank god she got somebody good turning to me eyes wet i dont know how to thank you you already have but its not enough what you did reaching out for my hand then drawing back she looked at the pond studied the water i made a decision she said about scheduling a year here and then well see just a semester wouldnt have been enough so many things to take care of i called harvard this morning from the hospital before the helicopter arrived thanked them for extending the deadline and told them what id decided they said theyll accept me as a transfer if my gpa at uclas high enough im sure it will be guess so if i organize my time properly noel left came up yesterday to say goodbye howd that go he looked a little scared which surprised me i never thought of him as not being in control it was almost cute his mother came with him she looked really nervous shes going to miss him a lot are you and noel planning to stay in touch we agreed to write but you know how things are different places different experiences hes been a really good friend yes he has small sad smile i said what is it i know he wants more than that it makes me feel i dont know maybe hell meet someone there who will really be right for him leaning closer to the water the big ones are coming close can i feed them i handed her the feed cup she tossed in a handful of pellets far away from the baby koi and watched the adult fish bob and gobble there you go guys she said stay over there jeez what a bunch of gluttons do you think shell really ever be okay levine says if we give it enough time she should be able to function normally but i dont know what makes you doubt that maybe hes just an optimist making that sound like a character flaw from what ive seen of dr levine hes a realist i said remembering ginas face framed by hospital linen plastic tubing the faroff clatter of metal and glass a thin pale hand squeezing mine a tranquillity that was unnerving i said just the fact that shes handling the hospital so well is a good sign melissa realizing she can be out of the house without falling apart as bizarre as it seems the whole thing may end up being therapeutic for her which isnt to say theres been no trauma or that its going to be easy guess so she said barely loud enough to be heard over the waterfall there are so many things i still dont understand why it happened where does that kind of evil come from what did she do to deserve that i mean i know hes a psycho the things they say he did shuddering kneading susan says hell be put away forever just on the basis of those bodies they found at the ranch which is good i guess i couldnt stand the idea of a trial mother having to face another monster but it just seems inadequate there should be more more punishment yes he should suffer turning to me again youd have to be there too wouldnt you at a trial i nodded so i guess youre glad about there being none its an experience i could do without okay its for the best i just dont what causes someone to shaking her head looking up at the sky then down again kneading harder and faster i said what are you thinking about her ursula levine told me she was released from the hospital went back to boston to her family its weird thinking of her as having a family needing someone i used to see her as allpowerful some kind of dragon lady pulling her hands apart wiping them on the grass she called mother last night or mother called her mother was on the phone with her just as i arrived when i heard mother mention her name i left the room and went down to the cafeteria does that bother you their talking i dont know what she could possibly have to offer mother being a victim herself maybe nothing i said she gave me a sharp look what does that mean just because theyre no longer therapist and patient doesnt mean they have to break all contact whats the point friendship friendship that bothers you its not i dont yes i still resent her and i also blame her for what happened even though she suffered too she was mothers doctor she should have protected her but thats not fair is it shes a victim as much as mother fair isnt the issue you have these feelings theyll need to be dealt with plenty to be dealt with she said plenty of time she turned back to the water theyre so tiny hard to believe theyre able to reaching into the bucket she scooped up more pellets and threw them in one by one staring at the momentary dimple each impact stamped on the waters surface flipping her hair biting her lip i dropped by the tankard last night to bring don some of his things from the house there were a lot of people he was busy with customers didnt see me and i didnt wait around just dropped the stuff off shrug dont try to do it all at once i said yes thats exactly what id like to do fix everything and go on from there fix him the monster it doesnt seem right that hell get to live out the rest of his life in some clean comfortable hospital that he and mother are basically in the same situation i mean that is absurd isnt it hell stay shell leave i hope she will it still doesnt seem fair there should be something more finite justice an end like what happened to mccloskey may he rot in hell did milo find out anything more about who did it my offer to pay for the defense still stands the police havent solved it i said its not likely they will good she said why waste time she trickled more food into the pond rubbed her hands together to get rid of the pellet dust began kneading again her body tense rubbing her brow she let out a long sigh i waited i fly up there every day to see her she said and i keep asking myself why is she here why does she have to go through this why should one person who never did anything bad in her life have to go through being victimized by two monsters in one lifetime if theres a god why would he set things up that way good question i said people have been wrestling with various versions of it since the beginning of time she smiled thats no answer true i thought you had all the answers brace yourself for crushing disillusionment kid her smile widened and warmed she leaned forward holding her hair back with one hand touching the water with the other you saw things she said up at that place things we havent talked about theres a lot we havent talked about all in i know i know due time i just wish i knew what due time was could put some kind of number on it thats understandable she laughed there you go again telling me im okay thats cause you are that so very definitely well she said youre the expert jonathan kellerman jonathan kellerman is one of the worlds most popular authors
