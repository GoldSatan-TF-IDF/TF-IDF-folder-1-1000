sam barone dawn of empire prologue the eastern bank of the river tigris bce the village lay before him like a lamb trapped by a pack of wolves thutmose sin halted his sweat soaked horse on the crest of the hill while his men formed up on each side he surveyed the plain beneath him taking in the crops in the fields and the irrigation canals that watered them his eyes soon fixed on the village barely two miles away there the tigris curled sharply around the cluster of mud huts and tents that nestled against it today the river that brought the very sustenance of life to the dirt eaters would be the obstacle that prevented their escape those who hadnt fled already thutmose sin corrected himself he had planned to catch the village by surprise but word had preceded his band as it so often did the warriors had ridden hard for five days with little sleep despite that effort the dirt eaters had received a few hours warning news of his approach must have traveled down the river faster than a man on a horse even now thutmose sin could see a few small boats paddling frantically to the far side of the tigris those lucky ones would use the river to elude the fate he had planned for them his men had settled into place nearly three hundred warriors formed a single line across the hilltop with thutmose sin at their center each man strung his bow unslung his lance and loosened the sword in his scabbard they had done this so many times that now they spoke little and needed few commands as they prepared themselves not for battle but for conquest only after the weapons were ready did they look to themselves every rider drank deeply from his water skin then emptied what remained over the head and neck of his horse there would be plenty of water for both man and beast in the village his second in command rethnar pulled up just behind him the men are ready thutmose sin the leader turned his head saw the eagerness in rethnars face and smiled at the mans excitement thutmose sin looked left and right along the line and saw that every tenth man had raised bow or lance into the air the warriors were more than ready their reward for the days of hard riding awaited them then let us begin with a touch of his heel to the horses ribs thutmose sin started the descent the men following his lead they took their time negotiating the downslope with fresh horses they would have raced down the incline and covered the last two miles in an exuberant rush but after five days of riding no man wanted to risk a valuable but weary horsenot with the end of their journey so near when they reached the plain the line of horsemen became more ragged as the land flattened out small bands of riders detached themselves from the wings and began sweeping the countryside they would search the outlying fields and scattered farmhouses driving any inhabitants toward the village the main body of warriors cantered through fields of golden wheat and barley thutmose sin at their head they soon reached the broad well trodden path that led up to the village two minutes at a smooth gallop and they had passed the outermost dwellings now the youngest warriors on the freshest horses took the lead their war cries ringing over the thudding of the horses hooves they rode past a few scattered dirt eaters ignoring the screaming women frightened men and crying children a rough wooden fence as tall as a man might have slowed them for a moment but the crude gate stood open and undefended the warriors swept through unopposed thutmose sin saw the first dirt eater die an old man stumbling in fear tried to reach the safety of a hut a warrior struck downward with his sword then raised the now bloodied blade high into the air and shouted his war cry arrows snapped from bows striking down men and women caught in the open the riders fanned out some dismounting to search the huts sword or lance in hand looking for victims anyone who resisted would die of course but many would be killed just for the sport or to satisfy a thirst for blood the rest would be spared the alur meriki needed slaves not bodies thutmose sin ignored the clamor as he rode slowly through the village the ten members of his personal guard now surrounding him in the narrow lane he saw that a few of the dwellings stood two stories tall a display of their owners wealth and prestige some houses hid behind high mud walls while others had small gardens setting them back from the lane he reached the gathering place at the heart of the village a large open space with a wide stone well in its center more than a dozen carts their dirty linen awnings flapping in the light breeze crowded the marketplace a few still had their wares upon them though all stood deserted a rich village as his scouts had promised after a pause to let the horses drink some water from the well thutmose sin picked out a wider lane that led toward the rear of the village they followed its path until they reached the river here he halted then slid easily to the ground handing the halter to one of his men a wooden dock extended a dozen paces into the tigris walking to the jettys end he tightened the wide strip of blue cloth embroidered with red thread that held his hair away from his eyes then he stopped and stared at the opposite bank even at this fording place in midsummer the tigris reached nearly to the tops of its wide banks and flowed deeper than a mans height in places a ferry provided passage to the other side but the abandoned craft sat on the opposite bank along with three smaller vessels all empty he noticed that the flat sided ferry rested at an odd angle some dirt eaters must have opened its bottom on the opposite shore the land rose steeply into a hillside dotted with date palms and poplars thutmose sin could see hundreds of people moving frantically up those slopes some leading animals others carrying their meager belongings men helping their women and children most followed a crooked road that climbed toward a gap between the nearest hills almost all stole quick glances back toward the river terrified that the grim riders would pursue them the cowardly dirt eaters would run as far as they could for as long as they could then hide in the rocks and caves shaking with fear and praying to their feeble gods for deliverance from the alur meriki theyd slipped beyond his reach and the knowledge enraged thutmose sin though he kept his face emotionless the tired horses didnt have the strength to fight the current let alone chase fleeing villagers nor did they have the means to bring any captives or goods back to this side of the river he hated the tigris hated all rivers almost as much as he hated the dirt eaters who dwelt beside them the rivers with their boats that could travel farther and faster than a galloping horse while carrying men and their burdens more important the flowing waters gave life to villages abominationssuch as this and let them grow large and prosperous thutmose sin took a deep breath then walked back up the jetty nothing showed of his disappointment thutmose sin swung back onto his horse and led his bodyguards back into the village where the captives laments rose to greet him when he reached the well rethnar was waiting hail thutmose sin a fine village isnt it hail rethnar thutmose sin answered formally to affirm his authority the two men were of much the same age a few months under twenty five but thutmose sin commanded most of the men and the clans sarrum or king had given him responsibility for the raid the fact that the sarrum happened to be thutmose sins father made no difference in his authority yes but too many escaped across the river rethnar shrugged one of the slaves said they learned of our coming a few hours ago word came down the river just enough time for most of them to escape thutmose sin had driven the men without respite the last three days trying to avoid this situation did the slave say how many were in the village no thutmose sin i will find out then i leave you to your task rethnar the remaining villagers would be hiding under their beds or in holes dug beneath their huts it would take a few hours to find them all thutmose sin dismounted and stepped over to the well one of his men brought up a bucket of fresh water and thutmose sin drank his fill then washed the dust from his face and hands he dismissed most of his guards so they could join in the looting they wouldnt be needed here with only three men he began to explore thutmose sin entered several of the larger houses curious to see what they contained and how the people lived he did the same at a half dozen shops signs of their owners hasty departures abounded from half eaten meals to the goods still displayed for sale on carts or pushed indoors before the owners fled taking his time he examined the leather belts linens sandals and pottery scattered about he even ducked into an alehouse but the sour stench made him move on choosing another lane thutmose sin wondered how the dirteaters could live behind walls of mud that blocked out the wind and sky while surrounded by the stench and fi lth of hundreds of others as dirty as ones self a true warrior lived free and proud unfettered to any particular place and took what he needed or wanted with his sword a larger house nearly hidden behind a wall caught his eye he pushed open the wooden gate instead of the usual garden he found a smiths shop with two forges a bellows and three different sized cooling pots half mended farm implements lay on the ground or on the empty benches but nearly half the workspace held tools for making weapons clay molds for swords and daggers leaned against the garden wall sharpening and finishing stones fi lled a shelf and a large block of wood nicked and hacked showed where the swordsmith tested his new blades the craftsman had taken his tools with him of course or hidden them someplace weapons and tools could be as valuable as horses the blacksmith would have made a useful slave but so important a laborer would have crossed the river at the first warning the smith must be a master craftsman to have such a large house the thought gave him no pleasure the best bronze weapons the alur meriki carried came from large villages like this one he hated the fact that village smiths could create such fine weapons with apparent ease swords daggers lance and arrow points all could be made here and better than his own people could make not that his clansmen didnt know the mysteries of bronze and copper but their smaller portable forges couldnt match the quality or resources of a large village forging a strong bronze sword required care and time two luxuries his people didnt have living in permanent migration few warriors among his people cared about the dirt eaters ways but thutmose sin had a wise father who taught him the mysteries of life of all the many sons of maskim xul only thutmose sin had been born at the fullness of the moon the birthing time for those to whom the gods gave extraordinary perception and cunning by the time thutmose sin came of age his father had appended the rare sin to his name to signify his wisdom and judgment thutmose sin understood the importance of learning about his enemies the dirt eaters harbored a threat even to the alur meriki something his father understood well everyone else in the clan would have scoffed at the thought of the soft villagers competing with them to the warriors an enemy was some other rival steppes tribe they might encounter in their wanderings the pathetic dirt eaters possessed few fighters and even fewer skilled horsemen any of his fighters stronger taller and trained in fighting and horsemanship at an early age could kill three or more dirt eaters in battle without difficulty no the dirt eaters didnt know the arts of war nor could they ever become strong fighters but they possessed another weapon deadlier than any bow or lance the food they coaxed out of the ground the food that allowed them to multiply like ants without having to hunt or fight for their nourishment the more food they took from the earth the more they multiplied and some day there might be so many of them that even the alur meriki could not kill them all that day must never come thutmose sin vowed his father grew old and soon would have to pass on the authority he had wielded for so long on that day thutmose sin already the favorite of the clans elder council would rule the alur meriki it would be his responsibility to make sure the clan grew and prospered as it always had by conquest and pillage he would not fail in his duty hours passed before he returned to the marketplace warriors and their captives filled the area most of the crying had ceased the new slaves knelt in the dirt crowded together shoulder to shoulder the stink of their fear overpowered even the five day old horse smell of the warriors he found rethnar sitting on the ground his back against the well awaiting his leaders return greetings rethnar how many are there two hundred and eighty six taken alive after we dug the last of them out of their burrows another seventy or eighty dead more than enough for our needs all the huts and fields have been searched not one tried to resist how many lived here nearly a thousand dirt eaters living in this filth rethnar answered a look of disgust on his face a few hours earlier and we could have captured another four or five hundred well need horses with wings then theyd ridden as hard as they could did you get any horses no not one no doubt anyone with a horse rode south there are some oxen still in the fields oxen had no value not this far from the alur merikis encampment thutmose sin had hoped for at least a few horses extra horses could carry more booty back he put the thought away are you ready to begin yes thutmose sin after we select our slaves do we let the rest live rethnar fingered his sword thutmose sin smiled at the mans anticipation his second in command enjoyed killing no not this time too many escaped us begin rethnar stood as he gave the orders the warriors moved among the prisoners selecting those unfit for work at swordpoint they separated the old the young the sick and the infirm driving them away from the original group they pulled babies from their mothers hands knocking the women down with their fists if they tried to resist two men struggled against the warriors and were cut down swiftly rethnars men wanted only those strong enough to endure what awaited them the others of no use would die thutmose sin had decreed it the culling went rapidly thutmose sin watched as the warriors divided the dirt eaters into two groups his lips moving as he did his own count scarcely more than a hundred and forty would live when his men completed the division rethnar shouted the order and the killing began warriors moved methodically through those selected to die swords rose and fell the smell of blood quickly saturated the air shouts and screams again echoed from the walls as loved ones cried out to each other the killing efficient and swift took little time warriors found no glory in such slaughter few resisted three children tried to run urged on by their helpless mothers but the line of warriors held the victims in some called out to their gods imploring marduk or ishtar to help them but the false gods of the dirt eaters had no power over the alur meriki when the carnage ended thutmose sin mounted his horse and moved in front of those left alive his guards standing before him weapons in hand as much to intimidate as to protect fresh tears streaked the terrified faces of both men and women silence quickly fell over the survivors as they looked up at this new warrior i am thutmose sin of the alur meriki my father maskim xul rules all the clans of the alur meriki he spoke in his own language even though he could speak the villagers dialect well enough if the village had resisted if some of them had fought bravely he might have spoken to them directly but to do so now would dishonor him one of his men interpreted speaking in a loud voice so that everyone could hear their fate in maskim xuls name you are to be slaves of the alur meriki clan for the rest of your lives youll work hard and youll obey every order you will now learn what awaits those who disobey or try to run he turned back to rethnar teach them rethnar called out to his men and they began the next phase of the slaves training one of his subcommanders quickly selected two men and two women the warriors stripped the men naked then staked them legs spread wide apart on the ground the ropes stretched their limbs as much as possible to prevent the slightest movement at the same time other warriors herded the remaining slaves even closer together still on their knees so they could see the torture all must watch and none could turn away or close their eyes warriors knelt next to each bound victim rethnar nodded and his men began using their knives to slice into their captives or fist sized stones to break or crush their flesh the helpless men cried out in terror even before the first cut or blow when the actual torture began shrieks of pain rebounded off the mud walls the torture must be drawn out so that the victims suffered as much as possible for as long as they could endure their fate would serve as an example to those forced to watch a few spectators trembled uncontrollably in their fear others cried in grief but most just stared in shock anyone who turned away or closed his eyes received a blow from the flat of a sword at the same time other warriors attended to the women a cart one used by the villagers to display fruits or vegetables now served another purpose their simple shifts ripped from their bodies they found themselves side by side bent backward across the cart and held down by laughing warriors while the first group of grinning alur meriki lined up to take their pleasure both women would be raped into near insensibility then cut to pieces a practice that always instilled the proper amount of terror in newly captured women the process wouldnt take long afterward there would be no resistance the new slaves would learn the lesson their new masters intended obey every command instantly suffer any abuse or face even worse punishment the alur meriki had few problems with their slaves male or female death by slow torture for the slightest offense real or imagined made for an effective deterrent that kept slaves docile while their masters worked them to death thutmose sin turned back to rethnar and saw his subcommander pushing aside his undergarment hed be the first to take one or both of the women dont let them die too soon rethnar the rising screams of the victims drowned out rethnars reply thutmose sin turned his horse and rode out of the village three guards still accompanying him this time he inspected the neighboring farms studying the farmhouses fields and even the endless irrigation that carried water to the crops no warrior would ever stoop to farming but thutmose sin wanted to know how this village had grown so large how so many could be fed from these fields the answer eluded him however and by the time he returned rethnars lesson had ended the four bodies now covered with flies lay sprawled where they had died silence filled the marketplace obeying their new masters the slaves kept silent theyd learned the first lesson he dismounted then stepped past the bodies to where the villagers knelt their gaze fixed on the victims as theyd been ordered a few had glanced at the alur meriki leader as he approached but one brief look at his unsmiling face and they turned their eyes back to the grisly tableau in front of them ignoring the men and children he examined the womens faces three or four looked comely enough bring them out for me he ordered his bodyguards they grabbed those he indicated pulling them to their feet out of the crowd of kneeling bodies it took only moments to rip off their garments and force them to their knees in the dirt these looked to be the prettiest of the lot though thutmose sin knew that tears and terror could change a womans face two women their bodies shaking cried softly bitter tears that would soon pass eyes could only hold so much water after all the other two just looked at him fear and shock already fading into hopelessness thutmose sin examined each in turn grasping their hair and pulling their faces upward the two he chose looked older about sixteen or seventeen seasons he liked them at that age when theyd learned enough about how to satisfy a man they would please him he knew after what theyd seen today theyd be frantic in their efforts to give him pleasure rethnar walked over the lesson is ended thutmose sin should we begin dividing the spoils the men are eager to take the rest of the women thutmose sin glanced at the sun still high in the afternoon sky no not until darkness put the slaves to work anything we dont want is to be destroyed if it can burn i want it carried here and set afire everything including the fence the wagons tools clothing everything smash whatever cant be burned then tomorrow have the slaves knock down every house when the dirt eaters return they must fi nd nothing of value and before you begin the march back to camp burn all the fields as well everything every animal is to be destroyed thutmose sin looked around at the houses surrounding him this village grew too large and prosperous these dirt eaters must be taught not to build such places again and when you begin the journey home load the slaves with as much as they can carry let only the strongest survive to reach our camp rethnar smiled ill teach them then you go back to the council yes tomorrow ill take fifty men and return to my father ill bring the choicest wine and women for him if you like send ten of your own men with gifts for your grandfather rethnars grandfather sat on the council as well grandfather will be pleased youve done well rethnar ill speak of you to my father and the council it would take rethnar close to three weeks to rejoin the clan burdened with so many slaves and goods and the number of slaves would increase as rethnars men visited the farmhouses theyd bypassed in their rush to the village thutmose sin mounted his horse then turned to his guards bring my women to the river he guided the animal through the lane until he again reached the waters edge first he would see to his horse then wash himself in the tigris the two women would also bathe so that they wouldnt bring the village stink to his bed tonight as he dove into the cool and cleansing water he thought about what hed accomplished theyd taken much booty and slaves and a large village would be destroyed as a lesson to the dirt eaters the health and power of the alur meriki would be greatly increased the capture of a few hundred more slaves would have made the raid more successful but nothing could be done about that all in all everything had gone well his father and the council would be pleased eleven years later near the headwaters of the tigris thutmose sin rode slowly through the scattered huts until he reached the edge of the bluff from this height he observed the chilled waters of the tigris sparkling in the sunlight and fresh from their birth mountains stretching all the way to the distant northern horizon directly beneath the hilltop a caravan of men and animals had begun the difficult crossing to the eastern bank this caravan would prove far mightier than the watery obstacle nature had placed in its path the people of the steppes the alur meriki traveled wherever they chose and nothing stood in their path they dominated all the peoples of the world just as thutmose sin dominated them he was their king and he ruled the world in his thirty fifth season the leader of the alur meriki stood as strong and powerful as in his youth with not a trace of fat on his tall muscular frame around his neck hung a copper linked chain with a three inch gold medallion identifying the alur meriki leader unlike his followers he wore no other jewelry or rings to show his importance or his conquests the medallion proclaimed his poweronly the strongest and most capable ever earned the right to wear it thutmose sin regarded the scene beneath him with satisfaction the clan extended in a wide and crooked line for nearly four miles a snakelike procession that sent a long plume of reddish dust into the still air four hundred warriors shepherded them along helping the wagons get through places where the earth turned to soft sand keeping the flocks of sheep goats and cattle moving and occasionally dismounting to add their own muscles to those of the weary animals that struggled over the rough ground the caravan traveled slowly but it never stopped the column consisted of horses oxen wagons stock animals women children old men and slaves in roughly that order of importance the real strength of his people its great force of warriors traversed the land many days ride ahead and to each side of the line of march some searched out the best and easiest route for the clans travel but most plundered the countryside taking whatever of value they found to enrich themselves and to keep the clan alive and growing the alur meriki had become the largest gathering of those whod come forth from the northern steppes many generations ago they now numbered more than five thousand people not counting slaves that meant that thutmose sin had nearly two thousand fighting men at his command no other steppes clan had produced so many warriors more important the alur meriki warriors had never suffered defeat in battle it had been more than twenty years in the days when maskim xul led the alur meriki since another clan had even dared to challenge them satisfied with his peoples progress thutmose sin turned his horse away from the edge of the promontory as he did so a small band of riders approached a clan leader at their head greetings sarrum urgo clan leader and kinsman to thutmose sin used the formal title to refer to his lord the first to swear allegiance to thutmose sin after the death of maskim xul six seasons ago urgo stood a hands width shorter but a little broader than his cousin though seven seasons older urgo looked just as fit eight or ten hours a day on the back of a spirited horse kept any man in fighting shape greetings urgo i bring news thutmose sin of the twenty clan leaders who ruled the alur meriki urgos clan had grown into one of the most powerful with two hundred warriors under his standard not that urgo or any of the clan leaders made life easier for thutmose sin even though half of them shared kinship to one degree or another at times the entire alur meriki horde with their endless disputes over women horses or some warriors honor took less effort to manage than the fractious disputes of the twenty council members thutmose sin led urgo back toward the crest of the hill they left their bodyguards behind out of earshot and sat near the promontorys edge where they could watch the procession below it would take three or four days before the clan could ford the tigris theyd camp here for at least a week resting while repairing the wagons and letting the sheep and goats graze on the plentiful grass fattening themselves before moving on a river trader told me something of interest urgo began without ceremony he said theres a great village far to the south its called orak the trader claims there are two thousand dirt people living there two thousand thutmose sins voice rose in disbelief that was easily twice as large as anything the alur meriki had ever encountered before a village that size if it could feed itself would have great resources that would provide much plunder can that many dirt eaters live in one place are you sure your trader speaks the truth yes sarrum i believe him urgo answered others have spoken of this place before let me show you he began to trace out a map in the sand with a few light strokes of his knife and the help of some pebbles to represent the mountains and other landmarks urgo made the rivers appear and the mountains to the east rise up as always he impressed his sarrum as much with his memory as with his skill at mapmaking urgo could re create maps from all the places the clan had traveled as accurately as if hed seen them yesterday instead of five or even ten years ago when we cross the tigris urgo said well continue east in a few weeks well have to choose a route to the south if we turn here or here he indicated places on the map as we planned well pass this orak far to the northeast it will be too distant to raid so if we wish to capture this place we must turn sooner we could head more toward this village perhaps even following the path of the tigris the lands along the river are fertile thered be much grain and goods to capture its not the line of march that we planned but this great village would yield many spoils urgo took a deep breath with whatever route we choose when were a few months closer we can send raiding parties ahead to capture this orak two thousand dirt eaters will have plenty of valuables and no way of hiding them all thutmose sin looked down at the lines in the sand this place it seems familiar it should urgo said with a laugh you raided it a few years before you became sarrum orak was a fat village even then and you brought back many slaves thutmose sin fingered the hilt of his sword trying to recall one raid out of so many the name meant nothing to him but he recognized the bend of the tigris yes i remember a good raid but the village wasnt so large then and we killed everyone and destroyed it can it have grown back so quickly urgo shrugged it must have it seemed a simple decision easy to make no different from many other such choices the clan faced every day still thutmose sin hesitated a village that big defies our way of life urgo he said and for that reason alone it should be destroyed but we hadnt planned to go so far south if we do well add many more miles to our journey wed have to hurry to reach our winter camp what we find when we reach this orak may not be worth the extra weeks of travel yes that may be so urgo answered its the usual problem thutmose sin understood the mans prudence urgo did not make such decisions only thutmose sin or the entire council could change the route but urgo had the responsibility of collecting information about the land through which they passed and suggesting possible raids or routes to follow while the alur meriki would eventually begin to move south what route they chose and how fast they traveled would be critical to the prosperity and health of the clans the sarrum understood the problem urgo referred to all too well if they sent raiding parties that meant delays and difficulties of carrying the loot back to the main camp a mounted warrior burdened by weapons water and whatever he needed for his horse could carry little else loaded down slaves traveled slowly and required large quantities of food and water which must also be carried if instead they took the entire clan closer to orak then theyd be nearly two hundred miles west of where they wanted to be as always not every need could be satisfied no matter what decision he reached some would be displeased if we head toward this place thutmose sin said tapping the pebble that represented orak theyll learn of our coming these large villages empty themselves long before our warriors arrive even the farmers along the way will fl ee after first burying their tools and seed crops deep in the ground no matter what route we choose word of our coming will soon spread ideally they would capture this orak with all its people and goods inside but such an occurrence almost never happened even with raiding parties that could travel far and fast tools grain and valuables would disappear while horses and herd animals would be scattered or hidden the clan would be lucky to capture a third of what the village possessed thutmose sin turned away from the map and stared at the land below but his thoughts stayed focused on this orak such an abomination could not be allowed to exist villagers scratched in the dirt like pigs for their food instead of hunting or fighting for it like true men the dirt eaters lived and bred like ants you could kick over their anthill but in a few years it grew back with more of them than before just like this orak he had leveled it years ago and already it had risen again with more dirt eaters than before now thutmose sin wanted to obliterate it and destroy everyone within it the alur meriki might tolerate small villages theyd be plundered but not destroyed so that they could be raided again in the future but a village of two thousand was more than an insult he considered what might happen if they returned in another ten years to find the village had again doubled in size no this orak must be destroyed to make sure such a thing could never happen it wouldnt be easy thutmose sin needed to find a way to keep all the villagers inside with their goods until it was too late to get away this village thutmose sin said the ford there is a good one urgo nodded according to the trader its the only easy crossing for thirty or forty miles in either direction likely that is what helps the place grow so large then most of the important villagers will flee across the tigris or down the river thutmose sin took his dagger from his belt and moved closer to urgos map perhaps theres a way to take it before too many escape his knife inscribed fresh lines in the sand as he spoke the plan he sketched was simple but unlike anything they had ever done the lay of the land would help as would the tigris by the time thutmose sin finished their heads nearly touched as they leaned over the map its a cunning plan thutmose sin well gain many slaves the tactics are simple enough and weve twice as many warriors as we need and the dirt eaters will do what they always do and so help destroy themselves finally urgo nodded yes sarrum i cant think of anything that can go wrong well capture much of value to the clan ill begin the preparations there are many months to work out the details and we can always change our tactics if something unexpected happens then its decided thutmose sin rose to his feet his subcommander doing the same well discuss it tonight with the council theyd approve it of course especially if urgo supported it he swung back up on his horse his bodyguards again forming up around him then rode back to the edge of the escarpment for one last look at the caravan his people continued their inexorable march their traveling pace would be slow but the rulers of the world had no need to hurry thutmose sin smiled in anticipation as he turned his horse around and put him to the gallop he had set in motion the route and the objectives of the alur meriki for the next six months those plans meant that some villages would be spared their foolish inhabitants thanking the gods for their deliverance never realizing that they existed only at his sufferance this great village of orak would be taken just as easily as the smallest farmhouse in their path oraks inhabitants would die or become slaves he thutmose sin had decided and so it would be no clan no village no force of nature could stop the full might of his people and this time when he finished with it orak would be sunk back to the mud from which it came this time the anthill would not recover part the gathering the eastern bank of the river tigris two hundred miles north of the great sea awake eskkar awake now nicar sent for you you must come at once eskkar realized the words had been spoken several times accompanied by vigorous shaking now they ceased being mere sounds and became instead a message one that slowly found its way through the haze that still clutched at his mind and body from last nights drinking enough eskkar grunted swinging an arm clumsily at the messenger but the nimble youth dodged easily eskkar pushed himself up to a sitting position on his hard pallet while the room revolved around him and the blood pounded in his head from the sudden motion his throat felt dry like the gritty dirt floor beneath his naked feet and his skull seemed ready to split apart at any moment as he paid the price for last nights vinegary wine water he growled after a few moments the messenger placed a wooden cup in eskkars shaking hands he swallowed a few mouthfuls though much of the liquid dribbled down his chin onto his bare chest his eyes refused to focus and the bright sunlight that streamed through the open doorway into the shadowy soldiers quarters added to his misery as soon as eskkar lowered the cup the boy started again hurry eskkar nicar awaits you now you must come at once what in the name of the gods could nicar want from him but nicars name and position as the ruler of the village of orak started him moving stumbling first to the rank chamber pot inside the soldiers common room then back to his pallet to don his tunic leaving the barracks his eyes half shut against the sun esk kar managed to find his way to the well he leaned against the rough stones for a moment then upended the bucket to splash water on his face before drinking somewhat refreshed esk kar looked up surprised to see the sun so high demons below he must have drunk a whole skinful of that bitter date wine he cursed himself for being a fool when esk kar turned away he saw a handful of guards men who should have been busy at their daily tasks standing uneasily near him where is ariamus he asked no one in particular his voice sounding hoarse in his ears ariamus captain of the guard maintained the few laws of orak and defended the village from bandits and marauders ariamus is gone a gray bearded veteran answered spitting in the dirt to show his disgust hes run off taken a dozen men with him as well as extra horses and arms the talk in the market says that barbarians are heading south coming toward orak esk kar let the words penetrate as he studied their faces he saw fear and uncertainty mixed in with the shock of losing their master no wonder they looked toward him if ariamus had run off then esk kar would be in charge at least until a new captain could be chosen that would explain the summons from nicar the grinning messenger plucked at esk kars tunic he refused to hurry taking his time to draw another bucket from the well he washed his hands and face before returning to the barracks to lace on his patched and worn sandals only then did he follow the boy through the winding streets to the imposing mud brick and stone house of nicar oraks leading merchant and foremost among the five ruling families that dictated the daily comings and goings of the village the youth pulled esk kar past the gatekeeper and into the house then guided him up the narrow steps to the upper rooms the house seemed quiet with none of the usual visitors waiting their turn to see the busy merchant nicar stood on the tiny balcony that looked out over the village quite a bit shorter than esk kar the gray haired merchant carried the extra weight around his middle that marked him as a man of wealth esk kar grunted something he hoped sounded like a greeting and stood still as the most important and richest man in the village looked him over esk kar realized nicar was studying him with the same care used when selecting the best slave from a bad lot nearly three years ago esk kar had limped into orak with nothing but a sword on his back and an infected leg wound since then hed seen nicar many times but oraks most important person had never paid any particular attention to the tall dark haired subcommander who rarely spoke and never smiled when nicar finished his scrutiny he turned away and looked out over the village suddenly esk kar felt uncomfortable in his shabby tunic and worn sandals well nicar what do you want the words came out harsher than intended im not sure what i want esk kar the merchant answered you know ariamus is gone esk kar nodded you may not know that the barbarians have recently crossed the tigris far to the north the killing and burning have already begun there it took a moment before nicars words struggled through the vapors clouding esk kars mind finally he understood their meaning so rumor spoke the truth for once he leaned heavily against the balcony wall aware of his aching head his belly cramped painfully and for a moment he thought he would vomit esk kar struggled to keep control of his thoughts and his stomach nicar continued from the far north through the foothills then down the plain toward the river he hesitated to give esk kar time to comprehend his words theyre moving steadily south its likely theyll turn in this direction though it will be months before they arrive nicar spoke calmly but esk kar heard a faint hint of fear and resignation in his voice esk kar ran his fingers through his unruly hair then fingered the thin beard that outlined his chin do you know which clan even after all these years the word barbarian grated on his ears i believe theyre called the alur meriki they may be the same clan that raided here last time esk kar grimaced his own birth clan not his people anymore not for many years not since theyd cast him out the alur meriki are a fierce clan with many men and horses what clan are you from esk kar or is that a question i shouldnt ask ask what you like but i never raided this place if thats what you wish to know i had barely started riding with the warriors when they killed my family is that what happened is that why you left esk kar bit his lip cursing at himself for even mentioning his past even the ignorant villagers knew warriors never left their clans willingly only in disgrace nicar let the silence lengthen until esk kar felt compelled to answer i didnt leave nicar i ran for my life i was lucky to get away i see youre right it makes no difference esk kars thoughts returned to the alur meriki so his familys clan marched toward orak no marched didnt properly convey the slow and steady movement of the steppes people migration came closest to a real description of the steady movement that might take months to advance but a few miles how long have you known of their coming nicar nicar stroked his gray speckled beard word came to me three days ago i told only ariamus he cautioned me to tell no one for a few days while he considered how to defend the village esk kar jerked his head in derision the sudden movement sending a wave of sharp pain through his head that made him regret the gesture ariamus as leader of the villages small garrison had certainly planned well but his plans hadnt been for the defense of the village nor had they included esk kar his lowly third in command the second in command one of ariamuss fawning friends had died a week before from the pox esk kar already knew he would not be promoted hed never bothered to toady up to ariamus instead two days ago ariamus ordered esk kar off on a chase after an inconsequential runaway slave a task that might have taken a week except for the fortunate accident of the foolish slave breaking his leg in some rocks esk kar remembered the brief look of surprise on ariamuss face when hed returned yesterday afternoon then last night a comradely ariamus had invited the soldiers to the tavern for wine and song paying for the powerful spirits that kept flowing long into the night esk kar should have been suspicious after the first drink since the tight fi sted ariamus never bought more than one mug of barley ale for any of his men but tired thirsty and smug with satisfaction at recovering the slave so quickly esk kar hadnt noticed again he cursed himself for being so easily tricked esk kars head began to throb again and his throat felt dry well nicar what do you expect me to do go after ariamus and the others im sure he took the youngest and wildest men hes probably stolen the best horses as well hell be long gone by the time were ready to give chase and with a dozen fighting men he can match any force we send after him the hoarseness returned to esk kars voice and he could scarcely get the last few words out nicar recognized the rasp in his visitors throat and called out for a servant the same boy whod escorted esk kar no doubt waiting on the steps outside appeared at once nicar turned to his visitor water or wine esk kar wanted wine wanted it badly and wanted it right now but hed shown enough stupidity for a while water for a start perhaps wine later eh nicar esk kar didnt try to conceal the sarcasm he had lived in orak for almost three years but had entered the fine house of nicar only once before and then only to deliver a message now nicar offered him wine almost with his own hand he wondered what would come next while the boy poured a cup of water esk kar thought about the captain of the guard who might easily have looted the village before he vanished esk kar briefly wondered why his own throat hadnt been cut the gods knew hed argued with ariamus numerous times the thought of himself lying in bed helpless a drunken pig ready to be butchered sent a shiver through him evidently ariamus hadnt considered him worth killing esk kar drank some water then turned back toward the balcony despite the grim news the cool drink made him feel better he remembered his manners thank you nicar but i ask you again do you want me to chase after ariamus no i dont want him back i was fool enough to trust him to defend orak now id kill him if i could what i want is to make the village ready for defense we must be ready to fight off the barbarians the thought of the soft merchant fighting the hard bitten ariamus almost made esk kar smile he started to speak then hesitated trying to think as he rubbed his hand over the rough surface of the balcony wall nicar hadnt summoned esk kar to his home for casual conversation no nicar wanted to know what could be done for orak more to the point what esk kar could do for orak the thirty odd fighting men who remained would likely follow esk kar at least for a while either out of loyalty or necessity most had women and children in the village or had grown too old to go looting across the countryside esk kar thought of his thirty one seasons hed been fighting since he turned fourteen when hed killed his first man with a knife thrust in the back his father a leader of twenty had somehow offended maskim xul the ruler of the alur meriki and the punishment had been death for the whole family esk kar had seen his mother and younger brother die and his sister carried off but the man who killed his brother would never kill again he never learned what sent maskim xuls enraged guards to his fathers tent esk kar managed to slip away in the darkness never to return to the campfires of his kindred he would have to leave orak he couldnt chance being captured his former clansmen would kill him merely for leaving the clan and if they remembered esk kars family his fate would be even worse esk kar brought his thoughts back to the present and realized that nicar had continued to study him well have to run nicar even with ariamus and his men still here the village would fall thirty even a hundred soldiers will make no difference if the clans are truly in migration there will be many hundreds of warriors maybe even a thousand esk kar shook his head at the idea a thousand barbarians an incredible number of fighting men mounted and well armed could sweep any force of mere villagers aside without pausing nicar said nothing drumming his fingers on the same stones that eskkar still gripped no we must stay stay and fight orak must be held if we run there will be nothing left when we return and well have to rebuild all over again he heard determination in nicars words they turned toward each other at the same moment standing eye to eye this village is mine esk kar when i arrived here orak was hardly more than a collection of mud huts i built it myself along with the other families twenty seven years ive been here and all of us have prospered nearly every day everything i have is here never have so many men lived before in one place in safety with food and drink and tools to share look around you esk kar do you want to return to the ways of your fathers living in tents fighting each day for food killing others to take what is theirs or do you want to dig your food out of the earth at the mercy of any band of murderers esk kar like everyone else knew what nicar had accomplished he also knew that the village had existed here for uncounted years before nicar arrived nor had nicar done it alone other powerful traders and farmers had worked closely with him to rule orak and together their fortunes and power had grown until they reserved the title of noble for themselves and their sons for years the five families had settled disputes and reconciled customs as their houses and influence increased nicar i know what orak means to you but even if we managed to drive off a small band theyd only return with more warriors if the main force of the alur meriki comes against us no esk kar i will not hear it nicars hand smacked down on the balcony stones ten years have passed since they last came that time there was no warning i remember how men fought to get into the boats to get across the river many were trapped in the village they became slaves or died those who got to the other bank we ran until our hearts were ready to burst when we returned nothing remained the huts had all been destroyed the crops burned the animals slaughtered and dumped in the wells it took two years to rebuild then two wasted years do you know how long it would take us to rebuild now esk kar shook his head two years seemed like plenty of time to replace mud huts and plant a few more crops orak is more than twice as big as it was then now i think it would take five years to rebuild assuming our trade doesnt go to another village up or down the river orak might never grow so great again i cannot waste five years esk kar i will not esk kar had lived among villagers long enough to understand their fears but to complain about raiders merely wasted breath nicar bandits from the north and east have been raiding this land for generations nothing can be done about it at least this time youll have plenty of time to prepare your departure nicar looked out over the village again youre like all the others they all say nothing can be done you surprise me esk kar youre supposed to be a fighting man and yet youre afraid to fight watch your words nicar i have fought the alur meriki before but im not a fool much as id enjoy killing more of them i wont fight where theres no hope of winning if there were some way to hold them off if something could be done but theyre just too strong youd be better off taking your gold and leaving no i will not run and i will not give my hard earned gold to the barbarians better to use it to try and defend orak im too old to start over again this village is mine and i will stay that is if you can defend orak nothing can stop the alur meriki perhaps youre right perhaps nothing can be done but before we run away again i want to know why we cannot defend ourselves against them i want to understand why orak with so many people is so helpless tell me that esk kar nicar was right about the village in all his travels esk kar had never seen a village as big a day seldom went by without someone moving into orak a few even used a new word to describe it calling it a city the city the biggest gathering of people ever built a place with a real stockade made from rough cut logs and two solid gates to deny entrance but eskkar knew that the palisade and gates served only to deter petty thieves or small bands of marauders not a migration of the steppes of all the raiders who plagued the land the steppes barbarians aroused the most terror ruthless warriors and superb horsemen no force could stand against them no force ever had at least not in esk kars memory or even in the legends of others nicar where were the barbarians found how far away are they many miles across the steppes to the far north nicar answered it will be midsummer before they reach this place the great curve of the tigris will force them far to the east before they can head south but this time their path seems to point toward us it may be more than a raiding party that comes to orak next summer word of our prosperity has reached even them so the traders tell me so we have nearly six months to prepare of course raiding parties could be here sooner nicar much sooner the steppes people always had two or three groups of raiders operating around the tribes center looking for opportunities to take horses tools weapons or women and not necessarily in that order although none would pass up a good horse to waste time on a woman a village this size would attract them as it attracted everyone there might even be almost as many people here as in the migrating tribe strange he hadnt thought of that before esk kar drained his water cup the sharp pain behind his eyes had lessened replaced by a dull throb nicars earlier words came back to him and now they seemed to contain a challenge you want to understand why we must run nicar is that it its because we dont have warriors we have farmers tradesmen and a few dozen men trained to fight the alur meriki can send hundreds of warriors against us even soldiers wont fight against those odds if we fight them from behind our palisade the palisade will not stand a few ropes over the top and theyll pull it down then we need a stronger barrier nicar said a little more forcefully could such a barrier be constructed in time esk kar glanced out over the balcony the fence that surrounded orak stood almost directly below him only a dozen paces away and he studied it as if seeing it for the first time not high enough not strong enough he knew orak needed a solid wall a mud wall if it could be built high enough and strong enough might give the barbarians pause but even a wall wouldnt stop fighting men well one thing at a time they just needed something with enough resistance to make the attackers move on to easier pickings i need to think about this nicar what you ask may not be possible give me some time ill come back to you by sundown and tell you what i think nicar nodded almost as if expecting the delay come for dinner then after sundown well talk again esk kar bowed and left the house he walked through the twisted lanes back to the soldiers compound thinking about nicars words at the barracks he ignored the idle men standing around and went instead to the stables he called for a horse and while the stable boys readied it esk kar crossed back into the lane he approached the nearest street vendor and spent the last of his copper coins to buy some bread and cheese shoving the food into his pouch esk kar filled a bag with water then mounted up and rode slowly through the village he passed through the main gate and nodded to the guard who looked at him nervously no doubt wondering whether hed be returning rumors must be spreading fanned by the news of ariamuss sudden departure the fresh air cleared the last effects of the wine from his mind and esk kar gave his full attention to the spirited horse which seemed equally glad to escape the villages confines he put the beast to an easy canter until he reached the top of a small hill about two miles east of the village from this vantage he had an excellent view of both orak and the river tigris that looped behind it he reined in the horse and began eating the good bread and poor cheese hed purchased letting many different thoughts drift through his head to his surprise he had several ideas of what could and could not be done licking the last of the cheese from his fingers he studied the village almost as if seeing it for the first time orak sat on a broad slab of hard earth and stone that forced the river to bend around it so that the fast flowing currents protected almost half the village from direct approach the bedrock supporting the village had once been surrounded by marshland as the settlement had grown farmers had drained the marshes growing crops and building huts on the recovered land dozens of canals large and small crisscrossed the countryside around the village bringing water from the river to the farms perhaps the land could be flooded again leaving only one main approach to the villages gates in his minds eye esk kar pictured a line of archers atop a wall standing shoulder to shoulder launching flights of arrows into a swarm of mounted attackers beneath them the bow he decided only that weapon could make the soft dirt eaters equal to alur meriki warriors and then only if the bowmen had a wall to hide behind faced with a strong wall most of the mounted warriors advantages disappeared no storm of arrows to devastate the defenders who could then be overwhelmed and cut apart by the charging riders against such a wall the alur merikis greater physical strength and skill with sword and lance would be lessened yes it might work if orak could build the wall the village might have a chance whether orak could transform itself remained to be seen orak resembled every other village esk kar had seen small huts built from river mud and straw accounted for most of the dwellings though the homes of the rich merchants and nobles tended to be much larger or two story affairs a fence surrounded the village but numerous huts and tents had sprung up outside the stockade including some that against nicars orders butted up against the structure as for the villagers they too were much the same as people everywhere most had few possessions a cotton tunic a wooden food bowl perhaps a few crude tools but the farms around orak yielded plenty of grain which the bakers turned into a hearty bread the one clean smell that constantly scented the village air the farmers produced enough not only to feed themselves and their families but enough extra to trade or sell in the village that surplus filled orak with people who didnt need to farm to survive merchants traders carpenters shopkeepers innkeepers smiths and dozens of other tradesmen these skilled laborers provided any craft required to support the village the river traffic and the surrounding farms taking payment in grain as well as the coins hammered out by the wealthy traders and nobles only its size made orak different from any other place esk kar had visited the village had been large when he arrived and since then it had nearly doubled in his travels esk kar had learned that the larger the village the easier he would be accepted a big village always needed men to defend it so a skilled fi ghting man who knew horses could usually fi nd employment and a safe place to sleep at night even if the villagers might laugh behind his back at his barbarian heritage they seldom laughed to his face the battle scars on his body intimidated most villagers at least they didnt drive him away in their fear something that had occurred more than once in his wanderings those wanderings had taken him as far as the great sea to the south three years ago esk kar decided to return to the land of his youth hed thrown in with a traders caravan destined for orak one of half a dozen guards hired to safeguard the merchants goods when twenty bandits attacked the caravan at night the outnumbered guards caught by surprise had been overwhelmed wounded esk kar and a few servants had escaped reaching orak a week later the servants hed rescued had not only vouchsafed him but they stood by him until he recovered deciding to stay for a few months esk kar joined the force that guarded the village as a common soldier and never got around to leaving since then he managed to work his way up to third in command riding most of the patrols and chasing after runaway slaves or petty thieves putting thoughts of the past aside he decided to look at orak as the alur meriki would taking a gulp from the water bag esk kar rode down the hill and headed toward the river the breeze refreshed him the air cool and invigorating esk kar often longed for the feel of the wind in his face the feel of a horse on the open lands always called to him sometimes making each day spent in the villages confines seem a day of torment youll always be a barbarian even though your own people cast you out for years he had drifted aimlessly across the lands scorned by the villagers and farmers he encountered even beaten and abused three years he had lived in orak longer than he had ever spent anywhere and lately hed thought about moving on frustrated by ariamus and his petty orders perhaps now was the time to forget orak move east and visit lands still new to him no matter what nicar wanted trying to fight off the alur meriki would fail and simply get him killed for his trouble esk kar owed the villagers nothing to them he was just another barbarian just as capable of murdering them in their sleep hed seen the distrust and fear in their faces often enough the idea of leaving tempted him but only for a moment a new place would be no better than orak and probably a good deal worse hed have to start again from the bottom a mere soldier treated scarcely better than a callow recruit no he felt the same way as nicar esk kar wouldnt run away to start that life all over again not if he could find another option especially one that didnt end with him dead the alur meriki had murdered his family driven him from the clan hounded him across the plains and nearly killed him more than once eskkar hated the thought of running from them again assuming something could be done that didnt leave him with his throat cut he wanted the chance to strike an avenging blow against them for a change to repay them for his fathers death if he could accomplish it orak and nicar would owe him much as captain of the guard hed have more than enough gold to settle down for the rest of his days perhaps hed join the ranks of the nobles and become one of oraks rulers that would be almost as satisfying as crushing a part of the alur meriki esk kar put the fanciful thoughts aside he studied the landscape riding slowly to the southwest stopping from time to time to examine the approaches to orak picturing what the steppes people would see when they turned their eyes here he rode for nearly three hours until he completed a circle around orak and found himself back at the hilltop where hed begun his observations esk kar dismounted and sat down with his back to a rock he let his mind turn over the ideas he had this day no one had ever called him quick in his wits but esk kar could build a simple plan as well as the next that ability plus his size strength and quickness with sword and knife had won him promotion until he stood at ariamuss side now esk kar stood alone and nicar had asked him to do something no man had ever done beforeprevent the steppes people from looting and destroying the village the sheer scope of what needed to be done threatened to overwhelm him he forced himself to remember that a plan had many parts and that each part could be considered separately carefully he reviewed the many tasks needed to defend the village repeating them out loud several times to make sure hed remember all of them when he finished esk kar saw that the sun had moved far into the western sky grunting a little he stood and stretched then he mounted his horse and retraced his path back to the village and his appointment with nicar at least he knew what he would say tonight though he doubted oraks leading merchant would like his words riding back into orak esk kar found two soldiers guarding the gate instead of the usual sentry both called out to him looks of relief on their faces nicar must have ordered the extra guard to reassure the villagers by now everyone must know about the barbarians sighted in the north as his horse picked its way through the narrow lanes people stopped their activities and stared a few tried to stop him to ask him what he knew about the barbarians esk kar paid no attention to them everyone seemed to know that nicar had summoned him so now they looked at him for some sign of hope and protection that thought deepened his frown esk kar had no idea what to tell them at the barracks the soldiers waited outside squatting on the dirt or leaning against the wall regular duties ignored anxiety on their faces the soldiers knew about tonights meeting with nicar nearly thirty men and some of their women awaited him eager to learn anything new he dismounted and handed the horse to a stable boy esk kar considered ignoring them then thought better of it you know the barbarians are coming heads nodded they wont be here for at least five months so you can sleep easy tonight he hesitated not sure what to tell them im meeting with nicar to talk about the defense of the village when i return ill tell you what i know he strode past them into the barracks and dumped his gear on his pallet esk kar thought about moving into ariamuss private room but decided that could wait until after tonights meal reminded of his meeting he stripped to his undergarment and wrapped his rough blanket around himself leaving the barracks he went down the winding street and through the villages rear gate heading straight to the river esk kar ignored anyone who tried to speak to him and pushed past those few brave enough to try to block his path at the waters edge esk kar tossed the blanket on a low bush stripped then dove in at first he stayed in the calm of the eddy pool that hugged the rivers east bank then moved away from the shore and took strong overhand strokes against the current that demanded hard work and after a few strokes he had to use all his strength to avoid being swept downriver when esk kar returned to the eddy pool he rested in the chilled water finally he pulled himself out of the river reclaimed his blanket and used it to dry off before returning to the barracks at least tonight he wouldnt meet nicar in a ragged garment with the smell of horses and wine on him putting on his one clean tunic he considered wearing his short sword then decided he wouldnt need it the men who might want him dead had left with ariamus and he doubted he had one enemy left in the village he returned to nicars house a few paces before esk kar reached the gate five men came out of nicars courtyard and headed toward him noble drigo and his son with three bodyguards filled the narrow lane and esk kar had to stand aside to let them by noble drigo glanced at him and smiled as he passed the knowing smile of a man who already had all the answers when esk kar stepped through nicars gate he found the boy whod fetched him that morning again waiting for him once inside the boy closed and bolted the door then knelt with a damp cloth to clean esk kars feet and sandals removing the dirt of the street nicars wife creta had nearly as many years as her husband and her hair had long since turned to silver everyone knew that nicar preferred young slave girls as bed companions but he treated his wife honorably and she managed his household efficiently creta greeted esk kar warmly enough after a quick inspection to see if he were reasonably clean and presentable shed walked past him in the street many a time without ever noticing him she escorted him to the dining chamber at the rear of the house where he found a large table spread for only two creta gave him the briefest of bows and left him alone a matronly servant brought wine but esk kar asked for water in a few moments she returned handing him a cup of chilled water as nicar entered the room please sit down esk kar nicar wore a different tunic tonight one with red and blue stitching around the collar you had a long ride today and we should eat first so that we have time to talk afterward youll have something to drink i trust the servants began bringing food one course at a time and esk kar found that somewhat strange when the soldiers ate everything got dumped on the plank table at once to be wolfed down as quickly as possible before it disappeared esk kar copied his hosts pace and ate slowly taking small bites of the warm vegetables after dipping them in spiced oil imported from some distant land to the west while they ate nicar did most of the talking asking esk kar about his early life and the many places hed seen in his travels he even asked about the steppes clans what kind of people they were why they lived the way they did he talked of everything except the coming of the steppes people esk kar realized that nicar continued to study him wanting to know what kind of man esk kar was more important nicar wanted to learn whether esk kar had the wits to make any plan succeed the food was easily the best esk kar had ever eaten but the wine like the portions was served in small quantities he decided that nicar wanted him to have a clear head when the servants finally cleared the table and refilled the wine cups nicar dismissed them then closed the door esk kar caught a glimpse of creta sitting outside the door sewing a garment by the light of a lamp to make sure the servants didnt eavesdrop on their masters conversation not that it would do any good household slaves always knew everything that went on so tell me about your ride esk kar what did you see nicar returned to the table eyes fixed on his guest you want to know if orak can be defended against the barbarians it can be done but the cost will be great and you may not want to pay it he looked hard at nicar but his host said nothing we cannot defeat them in battle but we can make it too difficult to capture the village if we can hold out for a month or two theyll have to move on driven by a lack of food so thats what we must domake it too costly for them to take the village too expensive in terms of warriors and horses killed too much time for a place that will be barren of food and horses even if they do capture it that means well have to kill many warriors kill enough of them to make their leaders worry esk kar saw the questioning look on nicars face the barbarians always have too many warriors and not enough horses women or food thats why theyre always fighting even among themselves the clan would actually welcome a chance to thin out the ranks kill off the foolish the young or the weak if they lose fifty or sixty warriors in return for the capture of a rich village theyd be happy with the trade nicar nodded thoughtfully i understand so they will welcome the fight at least at first so what must we do to make it too painful for them first you must build a wall around the village a real stone wall something that cannot be pulled down or burned at least four times the height of a man and it will have to enclose a much larger area than the palisade does now the nobles have talked about building such a wall before esk kar but nothing ever came of it there was no need and the cost and effort were too great now the barbarians come now there is a need remember nicar we have to consult the masons to see if such a wall can even be built yes of course what else is needed second all the huts and farmhouses outside this new wall must be torn down removed completely the ground leveled and stripped bare and the farms and fields flooded again the marshland mud will slow the horses down and force them to approach the village from the land in front of the main gate third every man must be trained to fight that means training and arming as many archers as possible only the bow can drive off the alur meriki well need thousands of arrows and hundreds of bows and men will have to train every day until they can hit their targets with confidence while standing atop the wall also there must be training with axes spears and swords and finally with rocks to hurl at the attackers and forked staves to push their ladders away from the wall even the women and children must work and fight well have to train every day build every day and prepare for every possible attack everyone must work as theyve never done before so that when the barbarians arrive all will be ready esk kar took a deep breath and sipped from his wine cup grateful that hed gotten the words out with scarcely a stumble orak must be stocked with food and water enough for everyone for two or three months the rest of the herds must be sent far away across the river where theyll be safe that will take men away from the village as well as soldiers to guard them from bandits the animals will be a tempting target when the barbarians arrive they must learn that we have no horses for plunder no cattle goats or sheep nicar looked closely at him sensing something more was coming and what else must we do esk kar was ready the slaves well need the slaves to labor as theyve never done before and we wont have the time or men to guard them they must work on their own and use all their skill youll have to promise to free the slaves nicar at least some of them so theyll have an incentive to work and fight nicars wine cup stopped halfway to his lips free the slaves you cant be serious after what weve paid for them and if we free the slaves how will we keep the village running not all the slaves only those we need to work on the defenses probably no more than half of them you ran the village before you had so many slaves didnt you besides if the barbarians come youll lose your slaves along with your lives or be enslaved yourself either way your slaves will be gone if we succeed instead of slaves youll have servants that you can pay until you find new slaves to replace them without the promise of freedom nicar they wont work very hard or theyll slip away into the night thinking that even the barbarians might treat them better dont forget many will die both villagers and slaves and youll need to replace them anyway and one last thing nicar you must speak for the entire village and the five families i can organize the defense and determine what needs to be done but there must be no quarrelling or arguing amongst the nobles or from any of the leading tradesmen we must speak in one voice to everyone so that all can see were determined to resist and to win and whatever i ask for in the defense of the village youll have to supply i will not argue with you or anyone else my orders must be obeyed by all and without question even by you nicar so i ask you do you speak for the five families for a moment nicar looked a little taken aback by esk kars demands you ask for much but there is truth in your words the many quarrels among the five families are public gossip they must be put aside to defend orak and you will speak for all the families yes i think they can all be persuaded all except house drigo he will likely choose to go his own way esk kar didnt think noble drigo could be dismissed so lightly for the last few months in oraks day to day affairs drigos men often acted as if their master alone ruled the village even esk kar who rarely had any interest in gossip knew that drigo contested with nicar for authority that drigo constantly tried to sway the other families to his side so far most preferred nicar who was certainly a more just and even handed administrator and if you cannot control noble drigo what then esk kar asked hes powerful and many will follow whatever path he chooses nicar stared at him again openly sizing him up it seems you are not quite as simple a soldier as ive been told he drank from his cup if you can develop a good plan to defend orak we may not need drigo and his gold let me worry about drigo nicar waved his hand as if dismissing the matter but afterward if we succeed in fending off the barbarians what will we owe you esk kar not that much nicar he laughed i have no grand ambitions the five families will become six and ill be your equal in the running of the village each of you will give me two ingots of gold enough for me to set up my own house for that i will remain in orak and we can start the planning for the barbarians next visit because theyll be back in another five or ten years if were lucky enough to drive the alur meriki off they will never forget the insult they have long memories theyll be back someday and well have to fight them again so i think youll need me again and the sooner we start preparing the better nicar shook his head so much waste and destruction it would be better for all of us if theyd leave us alone they can never do that nicar they live by taking what they need from others its the only way they know so they will be back this struggle may never be truly over until one or the other of us is destroyed nicar obviously hadnt considered that the barbarians might return he said nothing for a moment spinning the wine cup in his hands one more thing esk kar some may wonder why youd fight against your own kind what would i say to them tell them the truth that theyre not my kind anymore when you leave the clans your life your memory all gone for the first time eskkars voice took on a hard edge an intensity of raw emotion i want even your gold isnt enough to make me fight them i want the chance to avenge my familys murder to kill enough of them to satisfy their spirits this is the only chance ill ever have nicar nodded in understanding enough talk about the past and the future do you think we can defeat the barbarians if we do all that you ask esk kar met his gaze no village has ever surrounded itself with a wall such as the one we will need i dont even know if such a wall can be built before they arrive but if it can then we may have a chance whether its a good chance or not well find out in the coming months if we put our hearts and bodies into the preparation we may have a fair chance perhaps an even chance if we dont prepare well then we know what will happen that is the best hope i can offer you nicar as i said the price you will pay to defend the village may be more than its worth or more than you can afford and even then we may fail youll be risking more than just your gold all who have tried to resist the alur meriki have been destroyed nicar drained the wine cup then set it down so we must build a wall around orak if we wish to resist he sat there drumming his fingers on the table for several moments before he lifted his eyes i can see esk kar that youre honest you dont promise success if you had i wouldnt have believed you he looked at his guest for a few more moments as if making up his mind you dont have a woman do you the odd question surprised esk kar though he gathered that nicar already knew the answer women good ones at any rate were both scarce and expensive in orak and fathers did not approve marriages for eligible daughters to soldiers with no futures let alone to those who didnt have two coins to rub together no i havent been able to afford one yet esk kar replied unable to keep a hint of embarrassment from his voice once a week or so esk kar spent a copper coin for one of the girls at the alehouse or visited the prostitutes who sold themselves at night along the rivers edge nearly a month had passed since his last visit i received some new slaves a few weeks ago nicar continued one is a girl still a virgin im assured i think shes about fourteen not pretty but attractive enough i was going to bed her myself when i found the time and the will he added with a smile unlike most women she can count as well as read and write the symbols and she seems levelheaded enough i will give her to you and i think youll find her useful for many things in the coming months shell be much more than a simple bed companion youll need someone to help you with the planning and to keep you out of the alehouse at night even through his surprise esk kar knew it to be an exceptional and costly gift given graciously and with subtle advice i thank you nicar esk kar suddenly realized what else it meantthat nicar had agreed to his demands all of us will need your advice and guidance nicar if we are to do this well need many men working together so again i thank you you may not have the wit of ariamus but you can think and i know you can fight nicar replied the rest you can learn and i and the others will help you not many men can know and do everything most of us need to learn to accept all the help we can be given dont let your pride stand in the way of what you can accomplish with the help of others nicar remained silent for a moment know one other thing esk kar if we succeed then i will owe you much more than i and my family can repay and if we fail then let us fail together i meet with the nobles the day after tomorrow when noble nestor returns from the south until then you are captain of the guard when we meet well confirm our decision to resist the barbarians take the girl tonight and move into ariamuss quarters ill send you some gold tomorrow so you can buy whatever else you need in the next few weeks im sure there will be a house available for you the other families will provide servants as well to help free you from everything except the defense of the village esk kar understood his meaning about the house despite what nicar said many would flee orak in the coming months esk kar suddenly understood that a bond had formed between them they shared at least one traitneither gave up easily they would live or die in this together no matter how it ended esk kar knew that his life had changedthat he would never again be the simple warrior who lived by his sword for so many years now hed have to learn to think plan prepare defenses and train people not for the first time that day he wondered whether he was up to the task but hed taken the first steppersuading nicar that he could save orak to accomplish that he would have to change even more become someone different someone better than the drunken fool who passed out last night in the tavern that would never happen again he swore nicar stood signaling the end of the dinner then its settled well do whats never been done we will save the village esk kar smiled already thinking of the girl whod accompany him to the barracks no nicar if we succeed well use the new word and call it the city of orak let us pray for that day nicar said he reached out his hand and clasped esk kars arm sealing the agreement then the merchant strode to the door calling to his wife speaking quietly to her before they disappeared into the living quarters after a few moments esk kar heard womens voices raised in heated debate followed by an anguished cry cut short by the sharp sound of a slap then nicars wife reappeared dragging a girl by the shoulder creta pushed the girl in front of esk kar heres the slave esk kar her name is trella cretas voice now cut like a rasp of course you can change it to anything you like i suggest you give her a good beating to make sure she understands her place shes willful and proud the girl flashed a look of hatred at her former mistress and esk kar guessed nicar might have more than one reason for getting rid of the girl life in the rich homes of the five families might be more complicated than hed thought esk kar took a step and lifted up the girls chin she had large dark brown eyes that refused to meet his gaze her slightly darker skin clear except for a few faint scars from the pox on both cheeks told him she came from the lands to the south her narrow face held a thin nose and small even teeth hiding behind a trembling lip that still held a drop of blood in the corner where creta had slapped her she looked rather thin and plain but she had one treasure her hair dark and heavy fell in a wave around her shoulders he saw the fear in her eyes the fear that came to any slave handed from one man to another esk kar had seen that look many times before she moved her head away from his hand and returned her gaze to the floor suddenly the image of another girl about the same age and just as frightened came to mind a few years after leaving the clan hed befriended iltani saving her life and protecting her from rape and worse shed repaid that debt by giving herself to him his first time with a woman and twice afterward she risked her life to save his an obligation hed never managed to repay perhaps the gods had sent iltanis image to remind him of that debt listen to me girl he said again lifting her chin and keeping his tone gentle dont be afraid youre to help me and i will need your help do you understand her eyes turned up to him and esk kar held her gaze seeing this time the strength that lay behind the dark wide set eyes her lips stopped trembling and she gave him a quick nod the movement making her hair swirl gently around her face good come with me then a thought struck him and he turned to creta does she have anything of her own that she should bring she has some things creta admitted grudgingly she can return for them in the morning whatever trinkets or possessions she might have would be long gone by morning taken either by nicars wife or the other servants he started to turn away hesitated then faced creta once again a cloak shell need her cloak against the nights chill she does have one doesnt she he made his tone reasonable or perhaps you could find one for her nicars wife must have remembered her husbands words she pursed her lips then gave in she has no cloak of her own creta admitted but ill give her one of mine she clapped her hands and another girl appeared almost instantly no doubt standing just out of sight beyond the doorway creta told the servant to fetch a particular cloak in moments the girl returned carrying a faded and patched cloak that looked serviceable enough esk kar took the garment and draped it around the girls shoulders thank your mistress for her gift trella he watched her closely now hed start to learn what kind of girl he had acquired trella looked first at esk kar as if trying to read his face he said nothing just stared at her the silence began to lengthen then trella turned to creta and bowed her head thank you mistress she spoke softly her words properly servile when she straightened up she looked at esk kar as if to say is that what you wanted and he found himself hiding a smile he turned to creta and bowed low and i thank you mistress creta the food you prepared was delicious and well served hed rehearsed the unaccustomed words earlier and was happy to get them out without stumbling out of the house and into the lane esk kar laughed aloud as he took trellas hand fi nding it soft and warm in his own as he guided her toward the barracks did you have a cloak of your own a shake of her head answered him as she kept her eyes on the rough ground underfoot good then at least you got something from her the girl stole a glance at him then looked down again esk kars thoughts raced ahead to the big bed in ariamuss chamber and he quickened his pace glancing up at the stars only a few hours before midnight hed have to be up before dawn turning the corner at the alehouse he nearly stopped in surprise two torches lit the common area outside the barracks illuminating a crowd of soldiers their women and villagers apparently they all had nothing better to do at this late hour than wait for his return automatically esk kar took a quick count and guessed there might be as many as sixty villagers mixing with the soldiers probably a hundred people all told all thoughts of enjoying trella in his warm bed now vanished as he remembered his promise he would have to say something a prospect that dried his mouth and put an uneasy feeling in his stomach everyone started speaking as soon as they spotted him a rush of men surrounded him hands picking at his tunic eager questions tossed at him like stones esk kar knew he must speak to silence the crowd but his mind remained as empty as last nights wine cup as he reached the barracks stopping only because the soldiers waiting there blocked the doorway he had to face the crowd esk kar felt his hand squeezed hard and realized the boisterous crowd had frightened trella he looked down at her and saw the question in her eyes what do they want she asked her voice uncertain he tightened his lips before answering nothing girl theyre only afraid of what is coming they think the barbarians are already camped outside the gate somehow her worry gave him strength and he faced the crowd stay here he commanded trella letting go of her hand and moving a few steps toward one of the mounting stones then standing on it to rise a little above the crowd silence esk kar said loudly he repeated the word this time using his command voice youll wake the whole village with your chattering and no one will get any sleep tonight he jerked his head at the soldiers and they began to move in front of the crowd ordering the excited crowd to be silent when the voices finally died down esk kar began to speak yes its true the barbarians are coming esk kar let the words run through the crowd let them jabber for a moment watching their faces as he confirmed their worst fears but they wont be here for months so go back to your bedsbefore your wives cut your throats for being out so late that brought nervous laughter from some but others shouted at him asking from what direction the barbarians would come whether they should leave the village or whether orak would try to fight them off eskkar raised his hand and eventually they fell silent in two days nicar and the other families will meet then we can begin preparing to resist the barbarians we will fortify orak so that it can turn back any attack shouts of disbelief rose up as well as questions and the clamor grew louder esk kar glanced down at the soldiers quiet them down he commanded his men moved through the crowd silencing the loudest pushing back the most aggressive strange now these soldiers watch my every gesture and obey my smallest command yesterday only his fists backed if necessary by his sword had provided the slimmest shred of authority this must be what real power is like esk kar realized more than a little amazed at the sensation the people are afraid even the soldiers are worried they want to be told theyll be safe told by someone in charge someone in whom they can believe even if only for a little while i know you have many questions he went on when the murmurs abated but theyll have to wait until nicar speaks but hear this my friends we have the means and the men to make orak strong enough to stop the barbariansif we stand together i will guide you all in this and i tell you it can be done and it will be done now return to your homes and to your beds let nicar speak in two days by then youll know what you must do they shouted at him but esk kar ignored them as he jumped down and grabbed gatus a grizzled veteran approaching fifty seasons a subcommander when esk kar joined oraks guards ariamus had demoted gatus back to the ranks for questioning his orders esk kar had no real friends among the soldiers but he respected the old fighter who knew his trade better than most gatus youre second in command now esk kar raised his voice so as many soldiers as possible could hear him clear out this crowd make sure the gates are fastened for the night and guards stationed there have a few men patrol the streets until dawn as well they dont have to do anything but have them armed and looking impressive then come see me the man nodded accepting without question his new authority as well as esk kars and gatus im moving into ariamuss quarters put a guard at my door otherwise some of these fools will be pounding on it until dawn esk kar turned to trella and found her staring at him her fright gone her wide eyes now locked fi rmly on his as he returned to her side taking her hand he led her away from the crowd toward the rear of the barracks where his new quarters were located guiding her inside esk kar noted in surprise that somebody had cleaned and packed down the dirt floor thrown out most of the refuse and moved his few belongings in there as well some of the men had anticipated his promotion the thought of his possessions made him smile it wouldnt have taken long to move a thin blanket a tunic an old horse sword and a common short sword a fire burned in the tiny hearth and someone had piled a stack of wood nearby a soldier entered bringing a precious candle that he set in a pool of wax on the rough table in the center of the room the soldier glanced admiringly at trella then grinned at esk kar before he left them esk kar closed the door and leaned against it the crowd noises already fading as his men started herding the villagers away the candle flared up adding its light to that of the fire trella walked slowly around the room esk kars eyes followed her as she took in her new home she removed her cloak then hung it on a peg near the door from a pocket of her dress she removed a small pouch that no doubt contained the rest of her possessions and hung it over the same peg she crossed over to the fireplace then turned and stood facing him her head held high esk kar saw the swell of her breasts against the thin dress as she took a deep breath and let her eyes meet his i was told your name is esk kar that youre a barbarian and that im given to you as your slave she couldnt keep the hint of bitterness out of her voice when she uttered the word slave creta didnt say that you are now captain of the guard the steppes people dont consider themselves barbarians trella theyre the same as any other clan except they move from place to place but i left them long ago when i was fourteen and ive lived among the farms and villages ever since selling my sword im just a soldier and only the cowardice of ariamus has made me captain of the guard esk kar still had his back to the door and faintly he heard a guard take up position outside the crowd noise had disappeared save for an occasional distant shout as his men went about their assignments his men the words sounded good the day had started badly but by days end hed become captain of the guard with his own room his own woman slave and a bag of gold arriving in the morning perhaps the gods smiled on him after all his future prospects seemed good at least for the next few months when the alur meriki would likely cut off his head and impale it on a lance no sense worrying about that tonight though my father was advisor to the ruler of the village of carnax trella went on they were both killed by treachery and my brother and i sold into slavery now i belong to you esk kar wondered whether she told the truth everyone knew that all slaves lied about their past her parents could be peasants in the field who sold their daughter for a few coins because the rains came late or the sow died hed never heard of carnax and in truth it mattered little what she said or claimed trella was a slave and would be so for the rest of her life he saw the tension in her body and guessed that she would resist him when he took her to his surprise the thought of taking her brought no excitement and suddenly his legs felt as weary as his head he pushed himself away from the door the movement brought fear to trellas eyes she took a step backward her hands coming up to cross over her breasts he sat down at the table and stared at the burning candle for a moment trella today has been long and filled with many surprises for both of us until now he hadnt realized how much effort it had taken him to talk to nicar forcing himself to think and to present his plans and ideas clearly swinging a sword or cracking skulls took less effort and he knew hed spoken more words today than in the last month his head wasnt used to this much activity and now he felt too tired even to force himself on the girl he was getting old thirty seasons gone and he knew he was lucky to be alive and tomorrow will probably be worse im weary ive eaten too much food and drunk too much wine and there are too many thoughts in my head tell me if theres anything you need and well go to sleep her head came up and he thought he saw color come into her cheeks though the flickering light made it hard to be sure i have never been with a man he smiled at her though at this particular moment he didnt know whether that was good news or bad i think youll be safe tonight girl i need my sleep more than i need to wrestle with you he stood up looking around the room theres the chamber pot i dont think you should use the latrine outside not tonight anyway he turned away from the table and went outside nodding to the guard as he headed down to the barracks privy finishing at the latrine he found gatus waiting for him the old soldier wasted no words did nicar make you captain of the guard gatus looked him straight in the eye standing directly in front of his new commander for now but i told him i would be in charge of all the village and its defenses or nothing at all hell confirm that when he meets with the nobles or perhaps not and if not gatus asked if not then i and my slave will be leaving the village but nicar will confirm it im sure gatus shrugged then shook his head the motion swirled his long gray hair around his shoulders do you really think the village can withstand the barbarians gatus i wont lie to you i know its never been done but this is no small village there may be as many people here as there are barbarians on the move i think we can make its defenses strong enough to resist until they are forced to move on the thought that he might slip out of the village at any time in the next few months had also occurred to him and the promise of nicars gold kept the thought in the back of his head the man looked dubious and rightly so still gatus had to be persuaded or esk kars tenuous authority with the men would vanish they respected gatus and his words would matter follow me for a few weeks and lets see what we can do ive spent the day thinking about this and it can be done im certain of it meanwhile your pay is doubled and youre second in command gatus moved a step closer you are changed from what you were yesterday have you been touched by the gods esk kars laugh rang out into the night the gods and he were not exactly on good terms no im not out of my head though my skull does spin with all these new ideas he started to walk past the man but gatus gripped his arm hard and now their faces were inches apart you are changed esk kar a fool can see that even the rest of the men ill follow your orders for a while at least but if you lie to me ill put a sword in your back i swear by the gods i will ive a wife and two boys and ill not have them taken by the barbarians tend to your duties then tomorrow will be a long day and youll have much to do he moved away and gatuss hand slipped from his arm esk kar thought about how quickly things had changed yesterday he would have struck anyone who laid hands on him now it meant nothing when esk kar returned to ariamuss room the candle had been extinguished and the fire had burned itself down to glowing embers dropping the wooden bar across the door he untied his sandals and stripped off his tunic and undergarment ignoring the growing chill in the room he took his short sword from the wall where it had been hung drew the blade from its scabbard and placed it next to the bed since hed run from the alur meriki there had never been a night when he didnt keep a weapon close at hand briefly he wondered whether the girl would use it on him in the middle of the night but decided he was too tired to worry about it the bed had more than enough room for two as ariamus had liked his women large for a moment esk kar thought it was empty until he realized the girl had wedged herself against the wall as far from him as possible fine let her stay there tomorrow maybe even in the morning hed take her and thered be no more nonsense esk kar rolled onto his side putting his back to her while facing the door he pulled the single blanket up over his shoulder and let his body relax as he prepared for sleep but his mind refused to obey thoughts of nicar the alur meriki the command of the guard the village itself all kept running through his head a week ago esk kar couldnt have imagined this could happen now he could have power gold slaves anything he wantedif he could save orak from the barbarians a big if despite what he had told nicar and gatus there was so much to do it was difficult to know where to start tomorrow there would be many tasks to set in motion he would have to talk with gatus choose new subcommanders prepare to meet with nicar and speak to the soldiers esk kar knew he faced long odds but there might be a chance and if he could win if he succeeded if the gods gave him luck if if if his thoughts kept traveling in circles going from nicars dinner to the meeting of the nobles thinking of all the things he should have said to his men and the crowd tonight what else he should have discussed with nicar all the tasks he would have to do tomorrow how he must address the men what he must say to the families each time he tried to follow one particular thought another popped into his mind and started the cycle all over again the blanket shifted a little and abruptly he felt trellas body against his back her legs barely brushing against his something softer touching his shoulder youre still awake she whispered almost as if it were an accusation its cold against the wall she explained further to justify moving closer to him what are you thinking about whatever hed been thinking about vanished with the first contact of her flesh you i was thinking about you thoughts of orak along with his tiredness disappeared and he felt himself beginning to harden dont lie you were thinking about nicar and his gold he laughed a little she was certainly quick about her wits and bold enough to challenge her new master well i was thinking about nicar but not about his gold but now i cant remember my thoughts only the touch of your body you are very beautiful trella she didnt answer for a long moment then her arm crept over his shoulder and somehow it seemed both cool to his skin and warm to his touch esk kar took her hand in his and held it firmly the way hed held it in the street earlier that night she drew a little closer to him and now he could almost feel the length of her body against his warm and soft and what do you think about now he felt her breath against his ear i think about holding you in my arms holding you and kissing your lips his manhood raged now almost painfully with an intensity he hadnt felt in a long time but he didnt want to move or do anything to break the spell cast by her words and touch i am your slave esk kar she said her voice low in his ear moving more of her body against his back her words surprised him but he rolled to face her putting his arms around her feeling the muscles in her back as he pulled her against him esk kar could feel her whole body against his her skin almost hot to his touch something strange had come over him perhaps the events of the day aroused him or the fact that she belonged to him suddenly he wanted her more than any woman he could remember most of all he wanted her to be willing wanted her to want him as well a slave is taken if you were just that i would take you whether you wished it or not but youre more than a common slave girl even nicar knew that and im only a simple barbarian not someone good with words but he couldnt stop his hands from reaching out for her and he heard trella catch her breath as he cupped the softness of her breast i saw the fear in your eyes when you first beheld the crowd outside but you said the right words and i think now that you believe them he said nothing surprised at her words and a little shamed that his nervousness had been visible at least to the girl but he thought hed managed it well enough and perhaps no one else had noticed her mouth brushed his cheek banishing all such thoughts once again im afraid too esk kar afraid of the barbarians afraid of the future but it is past time for me to become a woman and i think you will not hurt me too much she let her body relax under his touch burying her head against his shoulder after a few moments her hand slipped down between his legs and she gasped he kissed her cheek then her mouth gently at first then harder and deeper as she clung to him caressing her body touching her stroking her stomach he held off as long as he could until he thought he would burst with desire held off until she moaned for him and he could feel the wetness between her legs before he mounted her moving as slowly as he could knowing he would hurt her but trying to be as gentle as possible then she cried out a sharp exclamation of pain and intake of breath as her nails dug into his back then smoothness and a gasp of delight as he entered her esk kar lay still for a moment until she relaxed and her arms encircled him tightly once again he began to rock against her and now her small sounds of pain and pleasure mixed as her desire grew when it was over all too soon he held her close stroking her hair enjoying her presence until he fell asleep in her arms sleeping the deep sleep of the emotionally spent as well as physically exhausted feeling a sense of comfort in her clasp he hadnt known since childhood trella waited until she was sure she wouldnt wake him then she gently disengaged her arm from around esk kars neck though she stayed close to him and could feel his breath against her breast he stayed on his side breathing heavily with his arm thrown across her stomach she stared up at the darkness thinking about their lovemaking as silence surrounded them while the village slept now her troubled thoughts kept her awake it had been lovemaking something she had wanted though not for all the same reasons as the man beside her her virginity had become a problem nicar his son the other servants in nicars home even the slave traders who had delivered her to orak all of them had desired her and her maidenhead offered an added attraction this esk kar hed wanted her as well and he would have taken her willing or unwilling this night except for the events of the day but tomorrow would have been different and as captain of the guard he would have lost respect with his men if he hadnt taken her if shed resisted he would have beaten her and she didnt want such a beginning with him no better to get it over with while she still had the gift to give to him much would be happening in the coming months and shed need all her wits to stay alive especially if the barbarians did come still he had wanted her and the thought pleased her back at nicars house shed seen it in his eyes despite her cast off garments and the tears sprinkling her cheeks trella recalled the despair that had washed over her when she first saw the tall barbarian with the grim face who now owned her thus she reasoned though occasionally the memory of her own desires questioned her logic how strange she admitted to herself that when he chose not to take her when he left the room that was when she decided that despite her apprehension she wanted him to be the one and by offering herself rather than just letting herself be taken shed kept some dignity a man must be more than an animal and this esk kar barbarian or not had shown that he possessed something more than what appeared on the surface she might be a slave but even a slave could share in her masters life his life was now hers and trella meant for both of them to rise in the future she hadnt heard anything of what esk kar and nicar discussed during dinner but she had overheard much of nicars earlier talk with his wife creta and later with noble drigo including how nicars worries about the coming barbarians had forced him to send for esk kar somehow this barbarian had convinced nicar that he could handle the villages defense and that accomplishment had surprised even nicar who had sharp wits of his ownas keen as those of her father the thought of her father sent a pang of sorrow through her but she forced her mind away from the image of his body lying on the floor blood pouring from his wounds eyes staring sightlessly at the ceiling hed taught her well too well her mother used to say recognizing in his daughter a mind as keen as his someday she hoped to avenge his death but for now she had no more tears to shed over her parents or her own misfortune this barbarian she needed to learn all about him as quickly as possible he might be a strong fighter and experienced in battle but she needed to know whether he had the wits to survive long enough even to meet the barbarians let alone defeat them that concerned her the most tomorrow she would learn much more about her new master everything in her future now depended on him starting tonight she belonged to a soldier and a barbarian at that so her status was little more than that of a camp follower or prostitute however if esk kar succeeded as captain of the guard and took the lead in oraks defense then his status and hers would be immeasurable though she knew even that feat might not be enough to overcome the stigma of his being both an outsider and a barbarian nonetheless if nicar had seen something worthwhile in this man then she must look for it also and any place or any owner would prove better than remaining in nicars house with his disgusting son fondling her at every opportunity a servant by day she soon would have passed from father to son to the servants even life as this barbarians slave would be preferable to that existence this ones lovemaking had surprised her her mother had warned her of the first nights pain but that had passed in one brief moment her fear turning to surprise and pleasure hed treated her gently more so than she had expected and her own reactions to him made her twitch with embarrassment trella knew shed been shameless and she could still feel the wetness between her legs that brought back the sensations that had spun through her body faster than she could control them at last her thoughts slowed and she began to drift off to sleep thinking about the man in her arms and knowing that tomorrow she would begin a new life as slave to this upstart captain of the guard it wouldnt be the life she had foreseen the one she and her father had discussed often as he trained her instead of guiding and helping some wealthy and powerful trader she now had to help this rough soldier turn back a barbarian invasion a task that daunted her the more she thought about it she was too young for this halfway into her fourteenth season but she had to attempt it and hope her fathers teachings would be enough to overcome her inexperience still even esk kar admitted that no one had ever driven off barbarians before so perhaps her new master would listen to her advice trella decided she must use all shed learned and her body as well to keep him close he would need her need her more than he could know just as nicar had said and if esk kar succeeded then only the gods knew what the future could bring for them there would be much work in the days ahead her final thought before she drifted off to sleep was that tomorrow night she would once again be in his bed and his arms and this time there would be no fear only pleasure the pounding on the door woke esk kar with a start his hand reached for the sword even as he bolted upright confused momentarily by the unfamiliar bed and surroundings until he remembered the events of last night the pounding increased until the door shook on its already loose hinges gods cease that noise he shouted who is it gatus captain get yourself up nicars messenger is here curse you and all the gods he muttered then raised his voice im coming esk kar glanced at the tiny window covered with its scrap of leather for a shade a bright wedge of sunlight slanted onto the dirt floor almost an hour after sunrise he shouldve been up and about long ago last nights good food and better lovemaking had let him sleep deeply and he felt wonderfully refreshed in fact he couldnt remember when hed last slept so soundly esk kar arose and looked at the empty bed trella had vanished her cloak missing from the peg run off no doubt after playing me for the fool but the recollection of the nights intimacy brought a smile to his face and a closer look at the bed showed the small stain of blood from her virginity well he had no time for the girl now dressing rapidly he opened the door buckling on his short sword as he stepped outside squinting against the sunlight gatus had gone but two men stood waiting esk kar recognized the older one as one of the merchants trusted servants the other much younger wore a short sword and must be a guard in nicars pay the older mans face plainly showed his impatience what is it esk kar growled had nicar decided to call the whole thing off or perhaps demand that his slave be returned the servant stepped forward nodding in the shortest bow possible nicar sends his greetings and asks that you come to his house tomorrow at midmorning the man waited a moment then continued when esk kar said nothing i am to give you this he handed over a small leather pouch that jingled pleasantly as esk kar took it tell your master that ill attend him at that hour deciding he might as well be gracious he added and im sorry i kept you waiting i was up late thinking about the barbarians mollified nicars messenger bowed also more respectfully this time he wished esk kar a good morning then headed back toward his masters residence his escort scrambling behind him esk kar turned toward the guard leaning on his spear wipe that smile off your face or ill rip out your insides the mans smile broadened further before it disappeared and wheres the girl did you let her run off in the night while you slept at your post the mans smile returned no captain she went out a little while ago to get food she told me to let you sleep shell be back shortly yes if she wasnt halfway across the fields trella had probably charmed the guard as easily as shed beguiled him curse the gods he should have told the man to watch her hed be the butt of every joke in orak the great captain of the guard who couldnt keep his girl slave even for one day he kept his grim thoughts to himself as he went first to the latrine then to the well to wash walking back to his room he saw smoke coming from the tiny opening that served as a chimney inside he found trella heating water at the fire that seemed to smoke as much as it burned an oval of fresh bread lay on the table scenting the air with a solitary dark sausage on the rooms single cracked plate he gaped like an idiot at the sight of her and couldnt stop himself from smiling when she turned toward him she watched him as he sat down at the table before turning her attention back to the blackened and dented copper bowl resting amid the flames grasping it with a bit of rag trella carried it to the table and poured the warm water into the wooden cup before him good morning master she said tonelessly as she set the pot on the table i thought youd run off when i awoke and saw you gone i thought youd slipped away in the night and what would you do if i had run off she asked her voice still empty of emotion id have gone after you trella he reached across the table and touched her arm enjoying the feel of her flesh as his thoughts returned to last night you talk with nicar tomorrow as everyone knows how could you chase after me if you were meeting with him there are more important things to me than nicar and orak if you ever run from me ill come after you a smile appeared briefl y on her face turning her instantly back into a young girl she touched his hand ill not run away at least not today she said her voice more pleasant now eat your breakfast master you have much to do today to prepare for your meeting tomorrow join me then he broke the bread in half then ripped the sausage in two equal pieces she carried the pot back to the fire and returned to the table picking up the sausage she took a bite but returned most of her portion to the plate youll have a long day and youll need your strength trella said indicating the meat besides its not fit for the slave to eat as much as the master esk kar washed down the bread with a mouthful of warm water then pushed the meat back to her eat woman youll need your own strength tonight she turned red with embarrassment and looked away women were a great mystery esk kar decided tearing the skin off your back in the night then refusing to meet your gaze in the morning he changed the subject how did you pay for this did creta give you some coins before you left that old cow she gave me nothing only took the few things i owned no i just asked the guard where to find food then went to the street vendor with the best looking wares i told him i was esk kars woman and i needed food for your breakfast he gave me the bread and meat i told him you would pay him later and he gave you the food esk kar asked amazement in his voice no one in the village had ever given him credit before he was eager to help she chewed on a piece of bread for a moment master may i speak he rapped his water cup sharply against the table say what you like trella i told you last night you were to be more than a servant and that id need your help so speak your mind men say things at night they forget in the morning she toyed with the scraps of bread in front of her as women say things to get what they desire what is it you want girl do you want to leave or go back to nicar ill not stop you if thats what you wish so speak your mind and be done with it she touched his hand again then met his eyes for the first time eskkar im just a girl no not even that a slave but last night after you fell asleep i thought long about what i want she took her hand away my father is dead my family is gone either dead or sold and ill never see any of them again so last night i decided that i want to stay and help you help you succeed against the barbarians because if you do then you can have the wealth and power to establish your own house thats what i want now to be part of your family and so ill help you in any way i can for a few moments he just looked at her last night in the darkness i began to doubt if i could truly defend the village from the barbarians this morning it seems even more impossible i can help you esk kar she leaned across the table im sure i can help thats why nicar gave me to you but you must tell me everything all your thoughts all your plans everything he stared at his plate while he considered her request hed never made any friends in orak certainly no man he trusted enough to confide his doubts as for gatus and the rest they had little to offer esk kar had no doubt that he knew more about what needed to be done than they did he could talk to nicar but esk kar didnt want to approach oraks ruler so soon with his own misgivings no esk kar had no one he could confi de in nicar said she would be useful so he might as well talk to her as anyone else though he doubted how much she could help still he had little to lose by talking to her nevertheless he hesitated shed come from nicars house perhaps what esk kar told her would find its way back to her former master even if nicar trusted his new captain of the guard the noble might still wish to know esk kars private thoughts but shed been given to him not loaned and the hatred between the girl and creta seemed real enough master whatever you tell me ill repeat to no one her words made him wonder if she could read his mind he more than half believed shed cast a spell upon him last night in the end the look in her eyes convinced him a gaze so intent that it seemed to pierce his thoughts as she leaned forward across the table waiting for him to make up his mind ill tell you what i know trella he began though i dont see how you can help it may be i can do more than you know since i was a child ive been trained in many things my father was a noble and taught me to understand their ways i sat at his feet as he worked and i listened to him advise the leader of our village and i learned many things in nicars house because i could read the symbols and count i worked with nicar and his stewards nearly every day i heard them speak about orak about noble drigo and the other nobles he wanted to believe her more than that he wanted to trust her even if she repeated his words to nicar what did it matter esk kar had the gold and the slave and enough of the soldiers would follow him if he decided to leave no one would try to stop him what did he have to lose very well where should i start they spoke for nearly two hours esk kar described building a wall explained about using the bow to keep the attackers at arms length about flooding the lands around the village he told her how he would train the men what arms he would need what forces he hoped to muster and what the coming months would bring she asked about the barbarians and he described them why they fought and their tactics he pointed out every detail of the coming struggle as best he could answering her questions and endless requests for details when hed finished she leaned across the table and took his hand in both of hers thank you master but you talk only of the fighting of the men and the wall you dont tell me what you fear what you worry about what concerns you the most please master tell me about those things esk kar stroked her hands they felt as warm and exciting as they had last night the girl had surely cast a spell on him but it didnt matter anymore all right trella i worry about the nobles i dont know how to deal with them theyre quicker in their wits and easy with their words nicar is a good man but i dont fully trust him he only sent for me because he had no one else the rest of the nobles are worse and drigolast night drigo looked at me in the street and i saw the laughter in his eyes he mocked me without speaking a word and i could do nothing the memory stirred him to anger and he tightened his grip on her hand just for a moment im not afraid of drigo but he has power and men who obey his will i could kill any one of them easily enough but even a small pack of wolves can bring down one man he took a deep breath but most of all i fear looking foolish in their eyes and in front of others never in his life had esk kar admitted fear to anyone let alone a slave girl now that the words had been spoken they couldnt be called back he decided to go on and its the same with the merchants i dont know how to ask for bows or swords or any of the other things ill need let alone how many or when ill want them even with nicars help i wonder if ill be able to get what i need hed voiced his doubts and fears but instead of shame at admitting his weakness esk kar felt a feeling of relief trellas hand gripped his with surprising strength master you worry about these things because you dont know these men ive lived with such people all my life theyre nothing to be afraid of as youve spent your life fighting theyve spent their lives talking and counting and bargaining but with the barbarians coming the time for talk is past now they will both fear and need you because they know only fighting men can save them and their gold may i tell you what i think will happen that the nobles might fear him seemed odd at first go on trella she told him how she thought the five families would react what the men of power would likely do and say and how their arrogant need to dominate everyone and everything might overcome even their fear of the barbarians she told him of nicars doubts and concerns especially his worries about the other noble families particularly noble drigo remember no matter what happens with the barbarians the nobles will never fully trust you or accept you youre not their kind esk kar thought back to last night when hed casually assumed that nicar and the other nobles would welcome him into their circle how childish that must have sounded to nicar i thought that theyd be grateful if i saved their village but youre right they will always think of me as a barbarian they are what they are master and none of them likes to share power especially with a stranger not even nicar he may be good to you now when he needs you but later he will take his authority back and what about you trella you dont mind belonging to a barbarian you are not a barbarian master you treat even a slave girl with respect i saw that and more last night and im a stranger here too perhaps the gods sent us to each other her last words came with a brief smile that disappeared quickly now can we talk about your meeting with the nobles tomorrow you should prepare yourself to meet with the families with growing confi dence she talked about what questions might arise at nicars meeting and how he should respond her ideas surprised him though once she explained he saw how likely they were to come up eskkar realized his offer to defend orak was even more complicated than hed thought last night you said that you came from carnax its a large village close to the great sea in sumeria you said your father was advisor to the villages ruler i doubted you then but now i see that you spoke the truth you think like a noble you understand power and how it can be used yes master my father trained me differently than the other girls he taught me the nobles ways and instructed me in the mysteries of gold the farm and many other subjects you must teach me all these secrets he smiled if it is not too late to learn them in time you will learn them all now we should go over your preparations once more she led him through several situations that might arise what he should say and how he should deal with each the more they spoke the more his trust increased and of all the things they discussed they talked longest about noble drigo trellas thoughts about drigo startled esk kar she believed drigo presented the biggest problem and the greatest danger shed learned much in nicars house about drigo and his plans and her words sent a chill through him he hadnt realized the immediate threat drigo represented slowly his resolve hardened nothing he decided nothing and no one would push him aside again not in the street not in nicars house he would be captain of the guard and even drigo would acknowledge him when they finished speaking their hands joined again across the table he looked at her differently now seeing someone with fire in her heart and bronze in her thoughts esk kar knew hed found a woman worth more than a fistful of gold coins with her beside him he felt he could accomplish anything dare the five families and even defeat the horde of barbarians you give me strength trella he said simply stay at my side her grip tightened on his hand and again her strength surprised him you have the power now esk kar but you must learn to use it and quickly or it will slip away you must act as if you have always had it when you speak speak with authority and certainty if youre not sure what to say say nothing just look confident the crowd will follow if you lead them i saw that last night and again in the streets this morning even the soldiers looked to you for direction and dont be in awe of any man from now on esk kar not even any of the five families theyre just merchants and theyre all frightened only you seem not to be afraid and that is your power dont hesitate to show that power starting today everyone will look to you searching for weakness or doubt if you have any conceal it if any oppose you push them asidekill them if you have to no one will question you in times of trouble people look to strong leaders not merchants and tradesmen no matter how much wealth they have tomorrow you must take the power or not at all the hard words no longer surprised him not even her casual reference to killing the nobles thought that way careless of lives other than their own hed stopped thinking of her as an inexperienced young girl a slave or even a woman whose ideas didnt matter shed become a window into the lives of the nobles perceiving their plots and plans and offering herself as a partner to his own ventures but trellas strength of will did surprise him some women could be stronger than their men though the idea made him a little uncomfortable such women often eclipsed a man in reading peoples thoughts and faces trella had all those qualities the toughness of a man in the body of a young woman a thought crossed his mind he reached into his tunic and brought out nicars leather pouch he hadnt even looked inside but he opened it now and dumped the contents on the table counting slowly he found twenty gold coins he knew ariamus had gotten only ten each month for a moment esk kar played with the small golden squares touching them enjoying the feel of the cool metal and the power it represented many men worshipped gold he knew schemed and plotted to obtain it then caressed it at night behind locked doors before burying it deep in the ground looking up he found trella observing him not the gold abruptly esk kar pushed two coins across the table take these and change them for copper then pay the street vendor for the food ill not owe any man for my bread make sure youre not cheated in the exchange use the rest to buy a decent dress for yourself and anything else you need and buy new sandals for me the sturdiest you can find the kind a man can fight in esk kar pushed the rest of the coins toward her trying not to think he was trusting her with what until today he would have considered a small fortune keep the rest of the gold safe for me there will be more things to buy in the coming weeks he put his finger on one coin the brightest and shiniest of the lot then picked it up and held it to the light this one is a gift for you one gold coin is enough to buy a good female slave if you ever desire to leave me give me this coin and you can have your freedom a look of confusion covered her face and esk kar sat back and laughed it will save me the time and trouble of chasing after you otherwise for now and between us let there be no more talk of master and slave he put the coin in the palm of her hand and closed her fingers lightly over it trella opened her hand and looked at the gold glittering brightly on her palm may i have your sword she said quietly surprised he hesitated then drew the sword from its scabbard reversed it and handed it to her she stood up put the coin near the edge of the table and placed the middle of the blade where the edge was sharpest against the coin using both hands she leaned on it with all her strength the muscles straining in her tanned arms when she lifted the blade the coin was nocked down its middle by a thin crease she handed him back the sword then gathered the rest of the coins and put them in the pouch now it is marked and ill keep it safe she put the pouch around her neck then tucked it inside her dress you should get ready for your meeting with the men its nearly noon esk kar stood glancing at the window and seeing the sun race ever higher into the sky i have time for this trella he pulled her to him kissing her hungrily feeling an unaccustomed thrill of pleasure when she stood on her toes and wrapped her arms around his neck her body pressing against him he would have thrown her across the bed and taken her right then orak and nicar be damned if she hadnt pushed herself away face averted and gone outside esk kar picked up the last scrap of bread and followed her out the door the guard still held his post watching trella as she walked away watch your eyes dog esk kar snapped if you know whats good for you he grabbed the startled mans spear and pulled it from his hand follow after her and stay at her side at her side you hear me make sure she comes to no harm and that everyone knows shes esk kars woman if any man bothers her slit his throat now go he shoved the man on his way making him stumble as he hurried to catch up esk kar twirled the heavy spear easily in his hand a few times then turned and hurled it with all his strength at the side of the house fragments sprang from the mud wall as the heavy spear buried itself in the structure esk kar grunted in satisfaction before he went off in the other direction looking for gatus time to prepare for tomorrows meeting with nicar this time trella paid more attention to her surroundings the soldiers hanging around the barracks stopped whatever occupied them and turned to stare at her as she walked by some called her by name while others made rude remarks about her first night with esk kar at first the words and bold looks made her uneasy but then she realized they all knew who she was that their words were spoken in rough jest and that there was little chance of any of them hurting her when she passed into the street she realized one of the soldiers had followed walking a few steps behind turning she recognized the sentry whod guarded esk kars room this morning captain esk kar told me to escort you around the village trella to protect you in case anyone should not know who you are she didnt know what to say and briefly wondered if esk kar had ordered him to ensure that she didnt run off but the mans simple expression couldnt conceal any guile and she remembered the touch of eskkars hands only moments ago thank you soldier what is your name im called adad trella well adad can you tell me where i can find a merchant who sells good clothing i need to buy some things for my master he directed her as they walked slipping through the stream of people who walked oraks narrow dirt lanes a noisy mixture of men women children and animals she saw that most of the mud brick houses had a single story but the homes and shops of the better off merchants usually had a stall or table in front to display some wares images painted on the wall identified the type of establishment or what goods could be had though she had lived in orak for almost two months shed rarely been allowed outside nicars courtyard and then only to accompany creta or one of the senior servants now she looked closely at the people and stalls that lined the streets at each stall a merchant his wife or an older child tended the merchandise both to deter petty thieves and to encourage those looking to buy orak seemed much like her former village only much bigger and with more fine houses she would have liked to take her time and explore but she wanted to get back to esk kar so she hurried until she reached the shop adad had suggested entering the low doorway of the merchant rimush she found two other women ahead of her the older dressed like the wife of a well off tradesman her younger companion looked to be a servant or slave in more humble clothing the large room illuminated only by the sunlight coming through the door and a small hole cut in the ceiling held several rough cut tables and shelves all covered with clothing or lengths of wool and linen the intense smell of the fresh linen tingled her nose goods were stacked on the floor as well covering nearly every open space and trella had to be careful where she stepped a colorful blanket curtained off another room at the rear the women and shop owner gave her a quick glance then ignored the poorly dressed slave ignored her until adad followed her inside looked around then leaned in the doorway the sight of the armed soldier accompanying trella stopped all conversation and now rimush turned to her taking only a moment to guess who she was youre the new slave of the soldier esk kar rimush spoke rapidly his curiosity plain esk kar and his new status were the main topic of conversation everywhere in orak since sunrise although not particularly tall trella knew how to stand properly and how to deal with merchants so she drew herself up before answering my master is esk kar captain of the guard he wishes me to purchase sandals and a tunic for him do you have such items or should i seek elsewhere she kept her head high her voice low but firm the merchant would recognize the tone of one accustomed to dealing with shopkeepers and servants the older woman seemed annoyed at the interruption when im finished slave you may buy whatever it is you can afford ill look elsewhere then trella said calmly and turned to go no wait girl rimush called hastily after her i have what you need here he turned to his other customer i will return to you when i have finished with what is your name girl trella she watched in amusement as rimush ignored the tradesmans wife to go to the darkest corner of the shop returning in a moment with a pair of sandals while he went to fetch some tunics trella inspected the sandals then called to him these sandals are not strong enough rimush i want the finest strongest pair you have sturdy enough to fight in muttering under his breath he returned in an instant handing her another pair of sandals hed picked up without stopping then went again to the back room his other customer angered at rimushs treatment banged down the cloth shed been inspecting and left the shop her companion gave trella a broad smile as she passed trailing behind her mistress trella inspected the sandals then rapped one sharply on the counter next she twisted it with both hands to make sure nothing shifted these are of fair quality she commented as rimush returned carrying half a dozen tunics ill take them upon my masters approval of course there are no better sandals in orak your master will be pleased he pushed a bolt of cloth out of the way with his elbow then put the tunics down on a narrow table fanning them out your master is tall and has broad shoulders not many carry tunics of his size you know my master then no he has never come here but i know who he is trella ignored the first four garments soft decorated tunics for rich merchants or nobles the one she selected looked more fitting to a captain of the guard well made but unadorned except for a red stripe around the simple square collar she wet her finger and rubbed the stripe to make sure the dye stayed true then reversed the garment to check the stitching and the seams tugging on the half sleeve to make sure it held fast this one will do she announced also i need a dress for myself something simple have you anything for me this required the assistance of rimushs wife who had come out from the back of the house to stare at the captain of the guards new slave she helped trella make her selection then escorted her into the back of the house where she could try it on you look very pretty in it trella like a fine lady she added admiring the way the dress fit are you sure you dont want a newer one or something of finer quality trella smiled at the compliment this is good enough now i must be on my way she took the new garment off and put her old one back on the haggling over prices went faster than trella had expected five silver coins for the expensive sandals four for the tunic and two for the dress the price seemed reasonable enough but she countered with an offer of eight coins for everything rimush complained about being robbed but eventually accepted a price of ten silver coins when trella tossed everything on the counter and prepared to leave rimush looked surprised when she handed him a gold coin gold was scarce and slaves not often trusted with such coins he took the coin pinching it hard with his fingernail to make sure it was real and noting nicars mark on it before he gave her ten silver coins in change trella smiled as she watched him rimush would spread the word that esk kar had access to nicars gold gathering up her goods she thanked him and his wife no trella our thanks to your master the gods protect him and may he save us from the barbarians and from noble drigo as well im too old to start over in another place noble drigo yes noble drigo rimush spat the words out his bullies take what they like and pay as little as they can if they pay at all they say drigo will take charge of orak soon nicar wont allow that trella answered nor will my master he will protect you rimush she told him confidently hell protect all of us outside in the street adad waited patiently for his charge they walked back toward the barracks the soldier two steps behind her stopping once for trella to purchase a good quality comb to manage her hair her own having more broken teeth than good ones then again to buy a small oil lamp as she walked and shopped however trella noticed that everyone was staring at her no one had ever seen a soldier assigned to protect a slave before shed have received quite a bit of attention for that reason alone but they all knew her status as esk kars slave the man who claimed he could defend orak against the barbarians that made her someone of importance a few people asked what she knew about the barbarians or about eskkars plans she smiled at anyone who spoke to her but said nothing fear of the barbarians showed in their faces so worried that they looked even to her for some sign of hope the walk through oraks streets gave her much to think about shed seen the villagers apprehension the anxiety she had warned esk kar about and that meant anything could happen in the next few days for good or evil trella pushed the thought from her mind she had more than enough to worry about in the next few hours eskkar found gatus sitting against the barracks wall dozing in the early afternoon sun while waiting for his captain climbing to his feet gatus yawned loudly then led the way to the stable fewer than a dozen horses remained ariamus had taken the best leaving behind animals past their prime not that esk kar would have trusted any of them in a hard fight including those taken by ariamus it took gold to buy maintain and train good horses and the miserly nobles spent as few of their coins as possible on the soldiers mounts they picked two horses that needed work and esk kar led the way to the hilltop where hed done his thinking yesterday the two men sat facing each other and esk kar repeated everything hed told nicar this time in much more detail gatus made suggestions about the food and supplies needed the quantity and quality of weapons and how the men would be paid they discussed the soldiers talking about individual abilities and how best they could be used gatus agreed with the three esk kar had in mind for subcommanders they tried to come up with everything needed to raise train and support a large number of fi ghting men then they attempted to put tasks in order what must be done first what could wait a few weeks longer last they discussed the barbarians guessing what they might do when they saw the wall how theyd use their weapons and horses and the most likely points of attack esk kar had never had such a discussion before all his life fighting was something you just did not something you planned for you might try to ambush your enemy or catch them asleep but for horsemen there was little else in the way of tactics in true steppes tradition esk kar believed the best plan of all was to have more men and better horses than your enemy if outnumbered barbarians tended to avoid battle preferring to fight another day neither esk kar nor the alur meriki felt any loss of honor in turning away from such unfavorable conflicts now esk kar had to devise ways to resist not only a numerically superior foe but one whose individual warriors were stronger and more capable just as important he had to convince villagers that his tactics would be effective for someone village bred gatus had plenty to contribute he had survived years of fighting and had ideas of his own and no hesitations about putting them forth especially those concerning weapons and training he kept challenging esk kar looking for weaknesses or flaws that would doom oraks defense when gatus did fi nd a weakness they worked out how to resolve it nearly three hours later esk kar nodded in satisfaction they had reached agreement on every item gatus had helped him specify his plans for the first time esk kar felt confident he could answer any question at nicars meeting that no one could brush off either his ideas or his facts they might not share his beliefs but that would be a matter for debate the two men rode down the hill to repeat esk kars survey of the land this time they paid particular attention to the farmlands north and south of the village flooding these would change the usual approach to oraks main gate when they finally finished their circuit gatus admitted orak might have a chance with luck of surviving the invasion esk kar wanted more than just gatuss approval he wanted the old soldier waiting outside nicars house in case the nobles wanted a second opinion gatus had lived in orak for more than five years and most of them would respect his words but well need to train bowmen three or four hundred of them at least gatus said and assuming you can provide weapons for all of them its still going to take at least two months to train a good archer esk kar didnt understand why it took so long to teach someone how to use such a simple weapon but he had to defer to gatuss experience with villagers then wed better get started at once gatus you know how to train men better than anyone theyll do as you say and they would do it faster for gatus than for a barbarian esk kar might be captain of the guard but he hadnt proven himself to the men theyd follow him for now but for a real battle where men had to trust their commander completely and be willing to risk their lives that needed a leader with a different kind of authority and what of everything else that must be done are you sure you know whats needed from nicar and the nobles yes i went over all that with trella she thought of a dozen things id missed she knows how to ask for what well need we just have to tell her then she can deal with the craftsmen she knows the symbols she can count and she remembers what she hears she comes from a noble family her father taught her the ruling ways ah shes one of those those what he looked toward gatus one of the special ones youve spent time in other villages havent you yes now stop talking in riddles what about her gatus took his time before answering how many women in orak know the symbols or can count higher than ten i dont know he shrugged none i suppose all the clerks and scribes are men you dont know the symbols i dont know them but nicars wife knows them gatus saw the surprise on esk kars face there are a few others wives of the big traders and merchants who do you think runs their trading business when theyre away or sick there are some women you ignorant barbarian who are trained for more than just bedding if shes one of those tell me what else trella said esk kar grimaced at the slur but told him everything hed learned then she was raised to be a wife to someone like nicar or drigo gatus mused a ruling noble what does that listen to me you were raised to fight trained from childhood taught how to use weapons how to be strong yes thats the barbarian way you spend your whole life learning how to fight how to trella was raised to help rule she probably spent her whole life at her fathers feet watching the rulers of her village learning how to read mens faces listening to what they say judging when they lie trellas what fourteen seasons she may have spent every day for the last five years watching her villages nobles learning the mysteries of gold and bronze the secret symbols studying the ways of farmer and villager if her wits are as sharp as you say they are esk kar said trying to grasp this new concept it had never occurred to him that the nobles in orak might have trained to learn their ruling ways as hed been trained to fight trella learned to use her wits to study men and their ways their talk this morning he realized that trella had guided him through the preparations for tomorrows meeting with more than just her knowledge of nicars house if she knew the secret ways of the nobles could read mens thoughts then she might be worth even more than hed thought not used to dealing with women who have their wits about them are you esk kar closed his mouth and frowned at gatus no i didnt know such women existed well think about what that means esk kar before you have her fetching water from the well and washing your feet nicar may have given you a bigger prize than you know at fi rst i thought she was just for remembering things helping out after last nights bedding and our talk this morning shes bewitched you already i saw the way you look at her gatus laughed at the memory but will the nobles listen to a slave girl when the time comes ill make sure they do gatus and shell speak in my name if the nobles refuse or give us trouble well leave orak i wont argue with drigo or any of them thats what i told nicar yesterday and thats what ill say at tomorrows meeting thats why youll be there in case they want to hear your thoughts my thoughts are that youre going to get us both killed esk kar esk kar laughed perhaps but dont tell them that besides weve time to get out if things start going badly and enough men to follow us if it comes to that so well just have to see what happens time will tell then gatus said putting his heels to the horse they cantered through the gate before slowing to a walk gatus was right the next few days would decide all but esk kar had persuaded the old soldier a difficult enough task and now gatus would stay as long as he believed they could endure winning over gatus would help persuade the soldiers too a good days work esk kar decided he just needed to do the same at nicars meeting tomorrow carrying her purchases trella returned to esk kars room she sat at the table enjoying a rare moment of privacy the events of last night and this morning threatened to overwhelm her sunlight streamed in through the open door illuminating her new home only a few months ago the stark surroundings would have seemed bleak and wretched even worse than the tiny unventilated nook shed shared with two other girls at nicars house now everything within these walls was her responsibility she had become mistress of esk kars house if you could call a single room attached to the soldiers barracks a house her new duties might be limited but at least she didnt have creta or more senior servants ordering her around and shed avoided the distasteful fate of having to pleasure first nicar and then his son and the other servants she could have accepted being nicars occasional bedmate he was after all the kind of man her father planned for his daughter though shed hoped for one closer to her own age no nicar wouldnt have been a problem she knew she could have pleased him enough to earn further responsibilities the troubles in nicars household came from creta and nicars youngest son caldor the servants had described their degrading experiences with caldor and even now trella couldnt repress a shudder shed seen him enjoying one of the other slaves a girl even younger than trella and barely into the secrets of womanhood hed taken her from behind positioning her on her knees with her head and shoulders on the floor the poor girl couldnt stop crying and her sobs echoed throughout the house but a slaves tears meant nothing not even to the other servants caldor had prolonged the act no doubt reveling in the girls humiliation as much as her body while ignoring all those who walked by his room trella wondered what she would have done when caldor had finally sent for her told her to remove her dress and display herself she shook her head in anger like the other girl trella would have obeyed and later cried herself to sleep comforted by the older women slaves did not resist their masters no matter what they commanded and pleasuring a master sexually was expected as routine a task as washing his clothes or serving his food she pushed the dark thoughts away instead she recalled last nights lovemaking and that memory sent a wave of pleasure through her a pleasant anticipation of tonights intimacy no whatever this new life brought would be a definite improvement and she wouldnt waste any time complaining about her surroundings not with so much to do a slaves duty was to please her master she reminded herself shed accomplished more than that last night and today esk kar had unburdened himself confided in her hed also offered her a compliment without realizing it hed treated her differently almost as an equal something she hadnt enjoyed since her enslavement more than that esk kar respected her ideas uneducated he might be but he knew the truth when he heard it no matter who spoke it so that would be her role from now on advisor by day lover by night last night shed been a frightened virgin and unsure of herself tonight would be different and shed start learning how to satisfy esk kars desires how to keep him aroused and hungry for her body her mother had warned her about men and their needs about how they could lose interest in a woman after a few bouts in bed fortunately her mother had instructed her in the mysteries of the love act with what she had learned and what she would soon discover trella would keep esk kar close to her nevertheless she felt her secret places grow warm at the thought of having him inside her tonight she might be a slave but shed become a woman she determined to make him desire her to make herself the most important thing in his life but right now trella needed to pay attention to her other duties she stood and looked around the room wondering where to start esk kar hadnt given her any commands he likely wouldnt have minded if she sat around all day combing her hair and waiting for his return the chamber was dirty and unkempt though she doubted esk kar or the previous owner noticed such things that meant work to be done trella didnt plan to live in filth she went to the door adad glanced up then smiled for a moment he reminded her of her brother adad id like you to get me some things she found herself speaking in what her father called her serious voice the tone she used when she wanted something what do you need a broom a bucket and some rags then i want you to go and buy some mats plain ones three no four of them at least this big she held her arms wide apart tell the merchant who theyre for and that ill pay him later can you do that for me im not supposed to leave you alone esk kar told me i know what he told you i promise ill stay inside until you return he hesitated then gave in aware that esk kar wouldnt return for some time ill be right back dont go anywhere he leaned his spear against the doorway and walked off trella smiled the soldier obeyed her almost as quickly as if esk kar had given the command she went back inside looked at the bed and decided she might as well start there she dragged the heavy frame away from the wall revealing a mix of trash and debris accumulated beneath it a fat brown spider scuttled through the pile unaccustomed to the light she frowned at the sight of it it looked large enough to give a nasty bite a layer of clean sand might once have covered the dirt floor but over time the topping had vanished what remained looked more like soil from the fields adad returned carrying a broom in one hand and an empty bucket in the other ill go get the mats he moved off at a trot anxious about leaving her alone trella took the broom and started sweeping the debris toward the door as soon as she finished sweeping and smoothing under the bed she shoved the heavy pallet back into the corner grunting with the effort then she started on the rest of the floor she worked steadily most of the time on her knees using her hands to scoop and move whatever objects she encountered tossing all the pebbles and refuse into the bucket she used her fingers to strain the mix of sand and dirt and squashed the occasional insect with the heel of her hand by the time adad returned shed cleaned the room together they moved the table then set the mats down one near the bed one just inside the entrance and the other two under the table and its rickety benches smoothing the dirt she made sure the mats lay flat with no lumps underneath finished at last trella examined the room it looked as clean as she could make it on such short notice and at least tonight there would be no scraps of food or bits of bone to attract bugs or mice on her next visit to the market a copper coin would purchase a cartload of clean sand enough to re cover the dirt if this were to be their home shed have the inner walls recoated with fresh mud then smoothed and whitewashed that might get rid of the stale odors that lingered within that reminded her of the mattress only the gods knew when it had last been changed shed have that refilled with fresh straw too she looked down at herself and laughed covered with dust and grime she thought half the dirt from the floor now covered her body she needed a bath taking her cloak she tossed it over her arm then gathered up the garments purchased earlier and the greasy rag shed used at the fi re bundling them together she set out toward the river adad fell in behind her and had to stretch his legs to keep up with her rapid pace trella enjoyed her newfound freedom the guard actually made things easier since she could now go wherever she chose and feel perfectly safe she knew the way to the river and it didnt take long to reach oraks rear gate they passed through and headed to the left moving quickly through the crowd trella kept a step ahead of adad and this time no one noticed her they passed the jetties where men worked the boats and soon reached the start of the womens area fringed by a few willow trees that lined the riverbank wait here adad i need to wash esk kars clothes and bathe myself please hold my cloak adad looked uncomfortable but complied by custom men did not venture too close to the womens bathing place though often enough boys or men took their time passing by laughing and staring at the women trella went to the riverbank then climbed down to the rocky bank this late in the day only three people labored there washing clothes an elderly matron and her granddaughter seemed to spend more time splashing than cleaning the remaining woman looked only a few years older than trella a glance back toward adad showed him standing where shed left him about fifty paces away she took a few steps into the river and ducked beneath the cool water letting it flow over her entire body when she came up for air she turned her back to the bank and pulled her dress up over her head then held it under the water and rubbed it vigorously she cleaned herself rubbing the cold water all over her body she finished up by ducking her hair several times then retrieved her dress pulling the wet garment over her head and wriggling it down around her body gathering the other garments she washed them as well as she finished the other girl came over to her moving slowly through the water her dress bunched up around her waist you are trella the new slave of esk kar trella examined the young woman a large bruise covered her left eye and her lower lip was split and swollen yes im trella and you are shubure im a slave in noble drigos house i must finish cleaning my masters clothing then return home his son may summon me to pleasure him again before supper she lifted her hand to her face trella had heard stories about drigos son and felt pity at shubures plight trella thanked the gods nicar not drigo had purchased her at least in nicars home the master and his sons did not beat their women not even their slaves why did your master hit you shubure shubure ignored the question as she moved closer tell your master to be wary noble drigo is not happy with nicars choice for captain of the guard a chill went through trella not entirely caused by the cold water swirling around her thighs what did you hear shubure moved back to the rocks picked up a garment from her basket and dipped it into the water the girl looked around to see if anyone was watching the matron still chattered with the little girl and only trellas guard glanced in their direction not much just noble drigo speaking to his son he said this esk kar took too much upon himself and needed to be taught a lesson one he and the other soldiers wouldnt forget thats all she shrugged and turned slightly away concentrating on washing the already clean garment in her hands trella moved her own hands through the water why did he beat you shubure the girl turned back to face her and a shudder passed through shubures body my mother is too ill to work she doesnt have any copper to buy food for my brothers and sisters theyre all hungry soon my mother will have to sell them as slaves as i was just to keep them fed so last night after young drigo bedded me i asked if i could have a copper coin or two for my family to keep them from starving i promised to work extra hard to please him to do anything he asked her eyes closed as if reliving the memory he hit me once to shut me up then again for bothering him with such things a slave could be well treated or badly treated a hard master drigo had put one of his slaves to death a few weeks ago the whispers said the son was even worse than the father trella had never been beaten at nicars house not even slapped until the night esk kar took her away yet young drigo used his fist on shubure merely for trying to feed her family whatever shubures misfortune trella needed to know more about drigos plans stay a moment shubure trella turned away from the shore and opened the pouch that still hung around her neck copper and silver coins now mixed with esk kars gold she removed two copper coins from the pouch and reclosed it tightly before turning back keeping her hand in the water she waded closer to shubure take these for your mother if anyone finds them say you picked them up in the street shubures hand met hers underwater if you hear anything else about my master return here tomorrow ill have more coins for you what hour can you come an hour after sunrise trella mistress trella ill thank the gods for your gift mistress trella for the first time in her life someone had acknowledged trella as the head of a household its little enough shubure youd better go before they wonder why you dally so long and give you another beating shubure nodded and moved off slipping the coins inside her dress trella waited splashing water around her as if she still worked until shubure disappeared behind the jetties then trella gathered her garments and climbed up the riverbank walking back toward adad she saw his eyes staring at her body her wet dress outlining her breasts and hips what would be a disgrace in her fathers house meant nothing now no one cared about a slaves clothing or lack of it adad finally remembered his manners and looked away as he handed her the cloak she rubbed her hair vigorously with it for a few moments then wrapped it gratefully around her body carrying the wet clothes in her arms she started back home thinking hard about what shed just heard nicar knew of drigos ambition to become the first man in orak to lead the nobles and decide the future of the village drigo had pressed that goal more and more in the last few months but with the barbarians coming nicar believed drigo would leave removing himself and his ambitions and solving at least one problem for nicar he wanted the council of nobles to vote to stay and fight if drigo abandoned orak and the barbarians were driven off hed find it difficult to reestablish his authority but if drigo persuaded the other nobles to leave orak nicars authority would be weakened when they returned to pick up the pieces and rebuild it would be drigo wielding the power and influence hed take nicars place as the first man in orak but nicar wielded great influence if esk kar proved he had a workable plan and if nicar chose to stay and resist the nobles would likely side with him trella stopped short so suddenly that adad bumped into her theyd passed back through the gate she stepped away from the center of the lane and leaned up against the closest wall hugging the wet bundle to her chest and ignoring the looks from those who passed by until now trella hadnt really worried about the consequences of tomorrows meeting if they all stayed and fought esk kar would win great honor and be able to establish his own house in orak that made it worth the risk though esk kar had repeated that he wouldnt remain unless he thought they could prevail if drigo left and orak survived the noble would have lost face and honor but wouldve saved all his gold and would soon reestablish his trading routes then why would drigo want to discredit esk kars plan surely the arrogant noble would benefit if the village held out even without his presence what trella had just worked out nicar must have reasoned as well thats why he told esk kar not to worry about drigo even esk kar though not politically astute knew that drigos choice mattered that it would influence many in orak perhaps drigo had a different plan something nicar hadnt thought of trella considered drigos alternatives they seemed simple enough go or stay leave taking everything of value with him or remain and risk his life and his fortune under nicars orders the choices seemed straightforward so clear unless drigo had discovered a third course of action she recalled everything shed heard about drigo ambitious arrogant and cruel to his servants miserly with his goods and gold always seeking more and more gold but gold she reminded herself could be obtained in more ways than just buying and selling for drigo the barbarian invasion might be seen as a blessing from the gods not the disaster that nicar foresaw and then trella knew the answer knew that shed guessed drigos plan something even nicar had failed to do she looked at adad but then her eyes focused on the sword belted to his waist she needed to learn something else just to be sure come adad we must get back i must speak with esk kar esk kar handed off his horse then went to the well to wash the dust and horse smell from his body he looked forward to an hour in bed with trella afterward theyd go to one of oraks better inns one where they could get decent wine and food a previously unheard of luxury before returning to bed entering his room esk kar looked about in surprise even in the afternoon shadows the room seemed brighter he noticed the new flaxen mats that covered half the floor then saw that the rest of the dirt had been cleaned and brushed evenly the place looked almost as clean as one of nicars rooms though the poor furnishings and begrimed walls left much to be desired the fact that trella had managed all this in a few short hours whetted his desire his previous women had cared little for cleanliness hed just hung his sword up when trella entered a bundle of damp clothes in her arms his satisfied mood vanished as soon as he saw her face master we need to talk she looked toward the open doorway adad had gone his duties done for the day another soldier already stood guard outside she lowered her voice can you send the guard farther away so we can talk privately the last of esk kars feelings of warmth disappeared he stepped outside and told the guard to watch the door from beneath the tree out of earshot esk kar returned shutting the door behind him trella had finished spreading the clean clothes to dry she came into his arms putting her face against his chest and squeezing him tight surprising him with this show of emotion he felt her body outlined by the damp dress and inhaled the clean river smell from her hair before he could react she stepped back took his hand and led him to the table they sat facing each other but she kept hold of his hand master i met a girl at the river this afternoon a slave from noble drigos house she had bruises on her face drigos son had beaten her she told me that drigo wants to put you in your place before the meeting tomorrow i fear nicar has underestimated drigos intentions a wave of anger went through him at the idea drigo might interfere with his newfound happiness and prosperity then he shrugged probably just talk womens gossip at the river what can drigo do trella he can refuse to fight and leave or he can stay and ask that someone else be named captain of the guard it doesnt matter to me i told nicar id deal only with him if the nobles dont want to fight or want someone else for captain of the guard then you and i will take gatus and some men and leave who else could drigo put forward as captain esk kar thought about that among the soldiers only gatus had enough experience and he didnt want the job gatus hated drigo and his gang and wanted nothing to do with them hed been ready to leave before eskkar talked him out of it last night drigo had plenty of men all of them carrying swords as they strutted through the village their leader naxos drigos personal bodyguard was dirty and crude neither nicar nor any of the others would entrust their lives and fortunes to naxos even if drigo suggested him i dont know of anyone else in orak unless theres someone here i dont know about someone whos fought the barbarians and led men in battle how many soldiers does noble drigo have master theyre not soldiers he corrected annoyed at the usual villager confusion between hired guards and trained fighting men theyre big and carry swords but mostly they bully the farmers and tradesmen men weaker than themselves or unarmed theyre brave when theres enough of them but not one of them could kill the youngest alur meriki warrior she said nothing and it took a moment before he realized he hadnt answered her question drigo has plenty of guards more than the other nobles maybe nine or ten the determined expression on her face made him consider his words each of the nobles hired his own guards paid better than the soldiers they tended to drink and congregate among themselves they looked down on the soldiers and the soldiers had always given way to them i think drigo may have hired a few more in the last few weeks and the other nobles how many men do they have esk kar had already started down that path each of the nobles had at least seven or eight armed men even without nicars guards that meant the others outnumbered the thirty remaining soldiers the last of his feelings of contentment vanished would those other guards follow drigos man this naxos esk kar took a deep breath i dont know trella theyd do as their masters told them but without orders theyd probably listen to drigos man tomorrow morning ill go back to the river drigos slave said she might return an hour after sunup you wont meet with nicar until midmorning and perhaps shell be able to tell us something more if she doesnt get her throat slit for telling tales on her master esk kar said hed heard the same stories about drigos household i gave her two copper coins for what she told me and promised her more tomorrow master if you approve the polite request made him smile give her a handful if she learns anything useful esk kar certainly had changed his ideas about gold overnight ill need to think about what drigo and naxos might do in the next few days she shook her head tomorrow master you dont have two or three days whatever drigo plans it will be tomorrow she squeezed his hand across the table what do you think he might try he looked at her wondering how she had gotten him so worried over a few chance words if hed heard the same words himself he might have laughed them off or ignored them trellas perception gave them weight i was surprised when nicar sent for me there must not have been anyone else he could turn to if id said last night that orak couldnt be defended nicar would have given up the idea of resisting that much seemed true enough he decided if i were gone then or if you were dead trella said then drigo could take charge of the soldiers get rid of the ones he didnt need or couldnt control and orak would be his what would that gain him the barbarians would still come and he still wouldnt fight them the barbarians wont be here for months if drigo controls the sixty or so soldiers and guards plus any more that he might hire then who could stop him from doing whatever he wants taking whatever he wants he could plunder the entire village take the loot across the river then return when the barbarians left with enough men and gold he could rebuild orak as his own he wouldnt need nicar or any of the other nobles hed rule orak alone she waited a moment but he didnt say anything drigo didnt count on you didnt expect you to convince nicar now even the villagers think of you as the one man not afraid of the barbarians i dont think noble drigo likes that esk kars anger rose up he wanted trella to be wrong curse these nobles and their schemes now he was threatened by them he struck the table with his fist saw trellas eyes go wide he got up and went to the door opening it he called out to the guard find someone to fetch gatus right away then get back here to your post trellas hand touched his arm shed followed him to the door send for adad also you should keep him close by tonight he was with me today and saw me talk to the girl he might mention to someone that i spoke to one of drigos women her suggestion annoyed him esk kar knew trella had gone to the river and a guard had accompanied her but he would never have thought of what that guard might do or say in his off duty hours he raised his voice and called after the already moving guard bring adad back with you i want him guarding my quarters tonight he closed the door so hard it shook then stepped over to the hook where his sword hung he belted it around his waist the gesture might look foolish but he felt better with the sword at his hip the room seemed to close in around him the air close and stale he had to get out its almost dark trella stay inside for the rest of the night where are you going nowhere i need to think by myself for a moment in truth he felt himself coming under her influence doing what she wished instead of making his own decisions he jerked the door open and went outside he walked over to the tree then leaned against it the scent of roasting chickens hung in the air floating in from the street esk kar had lost his appetite hed wanted to walk with trella into the village tonight showing her off to everyone then stopping at one of the inns for wine and dinner his hand clenched the sword hilt in frustration now hed stay here afraid to leave his room worried about a knife in his back he didnt fear any of drigos hired bullies not alone but three or four together could bring down any man the urge to leave orak swept over him take trella and go there was plenty of nicars gold left in moments he could be on a horse the guards at the gate would open it for him one way or another esk kar swore a string of oaths at nicar the nobles ariamus and especially the villagers whod distrusted and hated him behind his back for years and who now wanted him to save their cowardly lives and miserable property he despised them as much as they feared him to them he was just an outcast a tame barbarian but one who would still turn on them if given a chance he should go leave orak nothing good would come of staying trying to fight the alur meriki gambling his life on the will of these dirt eaters hed take trella and she didnt want to go she hadnt answered when hed spoken about leaving thered be nothing for her a noble born girl accompanying a soldier selling his sword he didnt even know if she could ride few enough women knew how to handle a horse he swore again and he couldnt leave her not after last night the guard returned accompanied by an annoyed adad interrupted at his supper the two men slowed when they saw their captain under the tree he stepped toward them his hand on the sword hilt stay together and stay alert dont leave your post for any reason call out if you see anything suspicious there may be trouble tonight ill have more men join you later he brushed past ignoring their questioning looks and went inside in the darkening room he could just make out trella sitting at the table without food she had nothing to do esk kar closed the door went over to the fireplace and began building a fire the task gave him something to occupy his hands while he kept thinking finally he got the fire going and added more wood than necessary he carried a burning stick back to the table and lit the new lamp shed purchased trella hadnt said anything when the lamp added its light to the fi relight he turned toward her can you ride a horse no master but im sure i can learn she kept her voice even but he heard the disappointment she knew what the question implied esk kar felt disappointed too but for a different reason hed taught enough dirt eaters how to ride even for an apt pupil with strong hands it took at least a week to stiffen thigh and leg muscles properly maybe longer assuming that trella didnt fall off and break something still she could always walk while she learned a knock sounded on the door as gatus pushed it open and stepped inside whats going on why he saw the sword on esk kars hip shut the door esk kar said we need to talk gatus sat down his eyes moved from esk kar to trella and back hed seen the extra sentry standing guard outside whats happened nothing yet trella overheard something at the river drigos men may try something maybe to beat or kill me it seems noble drigo is unhappy with nicars choice for captain of the guard and doesnt want to wait for tomorrows meeting esk kar turned to trella tell him everything she related what shed learned at the river and added her ideas of what drigo meant to do gatus sat there chewing on his lip taking his time while he thought he turned toward esk kar what will you do i dont plan on taking orders from that fool naxos or even drigo not that theyd want me around maybe its time to forget all this silly talk and leave orak moments ago that would have been what esk kar wanted to hear but hed watched trella as she related the story he knew she wanted to stay wanted him to stay though she hadnt said it suddenly he didnt want to disappoint her didnt want to admit that he couldnt meet drigos challenge no gatus im going to stay and fight the words came out almost without thinking i wont let drigos bullies chase me off not as long as nicar wants me for captain of the guard that is if youll stay with me esk kar hated to ask any man for help but he had no choice im not sure which of the men we can trust youve lived here for years and know them better than anyone certainly better than me most of em hate those guards gatus said scratching his beard but there might be a few fools eager to earn drigos silver he took a breath but there wont be more than three or four if they try something when will it be it has to be tonight gatus or tomorrow at nicars house either before the meeting or after it id guess he turned to trella what do you think those words surprised him too he was treating her as an equal partner in the planning master if anyone attacks you after nicar has confirmed you captain of the guard it will be taken as a challenge to nicar the other nobles wont like such a thing but if drigo can humiliate you before the meeting then the nobles will not be eager to give you their trust no matter whos at fault not with their lives and property at stake well that seems simple enough gatus said we just take all the men to nicars and if anyone gets in our way the nobles might take that as a threat gatus showing up at nicars house with thirty armed men trella had voiced her opinion unasked but by now neither esk kar nor gatus cared that a slave girl was giving them advice she went on before they could say anything and there must not be bloodshed nothing to make the nobles think theyll be risking their lives at your hands esk kar tightened his fist on the table but restrained the impulse to smash it down again hed faced death in battle often enough but drigo had more than enough gold to hire a dozen men willing to take their chances the thought that a pack of curs would be at his throat sent a wave of anger through him though he kept his voice calm blood will flow trella unless we leave blood in the streets will not give the nobles confidence in you master cant you find another way damn the gods this time it was gatus who pounded the table with his fist my wife was happy to hear we were staying even if it meant a fight with the barbarians if i leave now if we leave with you eskkar therell be women children carts animals a regular little caravan id hoped we could stay so he had three choices esk kar thought leave alone with trella lead a group of soldiers with their wives and children or stay and fight both the nobles and the barbarians well the time for prudence had passed he couldnt admit to being worried in front of trella and gatus and he wouldnt take back his words were staying gatus if you will gatus snorted put it on my shoulders will you im too old to go wandering about the countryside not while theres a chance to stay here then well fight esk kar said we just need to have nicar confirm me as captain of the guard after that we can take care of drigo esk kar felt better now that hed decided gatus make sure no one leaves the barracks tonight and keep a dozen men awake and ready yes captain gatus stood and gave trella a grin youve earned your keep already girl you may have saved my head as well as your masters from being broken try to keep him out of trouble for the rest of the night he turned to esk kar will you still meet with the men tomorrow yes right before nicars meeting as we planned and what are you going to do tomorrow ill think of something before then esk kar said he walked gatus outside watching the old soldier disappear into the darkness esk kar leaned against the house thinking about what the last few hours had brought for the last fifteen years hed been on his own making his own decisions and living with the consequences hed survived thanks to his fighting skills but there wasnt much more that he could add to that accomplishment now he was listening to a girl someone trained to look beyond the obvious to see what he would likely have missed more than listening he and gatus were starting to rely on her esk kar had never given heed to any womans advice before and now he was seeking it out part of him wanted to ignore her words to make his own decisions even mistakes if it came to that that would be foolish he knew more than that it might get him killed he hadnt survived this long by ignoring the truth realistically if trella hadnt put the pieces together he would probably have walked unaware into whatever drigos men had planned for tomorrow so he might even owe her his life esk kar didnt like admitting such a debt but no warrior could ignore such an obligation between her and nicar his life had changed nicars summons had offered him a future now trellas advice might offer even more at the very least he owed her the chance to help he still wanted her wanted her even more every hour and if keeping her with him meant having to swallow his pride and accept her advice then he would do it shed saved his life once maybe she could do it again after all things couldnt get much worse perhaps the time had come to try a different way esk kar took one last look at the guards then went back inside closing and securing the door behind him she still sat there outlined by the remnants of the fire waiting waiting for him to decide not only his fate but hers nothing mattered he realized he needed to be with her keep her for his own everything else meant nothing including his foolish pride we will think of something wont we trella awoke before dawn slipped out of bed and dressed the night had passed uneventfully esk kar sent out for a roasted chicken bread nuts and wine and theyd eaten the dinner with the door closed the fresh chicken had been well cooked though neither noticed it shed filled his wine cup but refused any herself when he drank half the cup she watched as he refilled it with water leaving the rest of the wine untouched she hadnt said anything but felt grateful her master knew better than to drink too much on such a night gatus came back twice once to report everything in order and men in place and the second time to grab a hunk of chicken and tell esk kar to get some sleep before retiring esk kar blocked the entrance with the table and benches and hed placed his sword and knife next to the bed in the darkness he held her in his arms but didnt speak and she knew he was thinking about tomorrow to her surprise esk kar soon came up with a plan for handling the guards dangerous to be sure but perhaps a way to avoid bloodshed when nothing more remained to discuss trella moved astride him feeling a thrill at her boldness she kissed him again and again then leaned down and rubbed herself against him moving her breasts slowly over his chest and stomach then to his lips and back again suddenly she felt him inside her heard herself moaning at the wave of pleasure she kept her movements slow enjoying the new sensations that passed through her holding him back until he cried out both of them forgetting all about the world outside when the lovemaking ended hed fallen asleep almost at once a deep sleep that permitted no worries to interrupt it she slept lightly waking often waiting for the dawn today she wanted to be at the river early at the first sign of daylight she woke esk kar and they opened the door nothing greeted them except two tired guards standing at their post moments later gatus arrived yawning and carrying a long wooden trencher filled with bread and cheese breakfast for all of them including the men whod watched esk kars door all night afterward trella went with gatus into the barracks and offered to clean some of the soldiers garments they filled a basket with as much as she could carry shed hoped adad would accompany her back to the river but hed already gone to get some sleep tired after his all night vigil so gatus chose another man to accompany her at that early hour only a few women had come to wash their households clothes but more would arrive soon the women recognized her immediately they gathered around while she worked introducing themselves eager to hear the latest gossip from someone who might actually know something trella reassured them but kept busy with her washing eventually they took the hint and moved away trella found herself washing the same tunic over and over before she saw shubure approaching unnoticed now trella moved farther downriver wading out into deeper water that reached nearly to her waist even so shubure did not come near until her own washing was well begun this time trellas eyes studied the shore and the other women but no one was paying any attention to them only the bored guard whose gaze wandered up and down the river as shubure drew near trella let the tunic slip from her hands the current took it straight to shubure who caught it up then handed it back to trella as their hands touched trella let three copper coins slip into the girls hand shubures eyes looked down for a moment then she turned slightly away searching those along the river bank your master meets with nicar at midmorn drigo has ordered naxos to keep esk kar from nicars house they want to embarrass him and nicar before the meeting in front of the other nobles if he resists naxos will kill him naxos will be the new captain of the guard so it would happen this morning trella turned away so no one could see them talking did you learn anything else no nothing except drigo said he will rule in orak within a few days he and his son are already making plans they expect to gather much gold before the barbarians arrive i thank you for your news shubure my mother and i thank you for your coins mistress trella shell be able to feed our family for a few days if your mother can be trusted to keep her tongue ill send more coins to her if you learn anything more you tell her and she can tell me it would certainly be easier and safer for shubure to meet with her mother shubure nodded she moved away as new arrivals splashed closer to them eager to speak with trella but trella gathered up the wet clothes and waded carefully back to the shore she lifted the heavy bundle in her arms the wet dress clinging to her legs as she walked back toward the gate the guard followed no doubt watching her figure she found esk kar waiting for her outside the barracks he followed her inside and closed the door did she come yes she repeated what shubure had said surprisingly the news seemed to calm him he went to the table and sat down his brow furrowed she spread the wet garments across the bed then sat down across from him will you keep to your plan master he looked up his face grim oh yes ill take care of naxos she knew what he meant if you kill drigos servant hell hire someone else to murder you he wont tolerate the insult and the nobles if naxoss death is too bloody for them trella then well move on i wont spend my days wondering when drigos assassin will find me trella studied him carefully not a hint of worry in the man he seemed relaxed and assured no trace of last nights doubts she realized how different he was from the merchants and traders shed grown up with a warrior he needed only to know what to do he would work out the how and once begun he would be like an arrow launched from a bowstringno hesitation and no turning back is there anything i can do to help he smiled at her a real smile full of warmth and caring perhaps ive been thinking about the meeting i still need to talk to the men but i think i will need your help she smiled back and reached her hand out to his across the table tell me what to do in two hours i meet with nicar and the five families esk kar began speaking to gatus and the three men hed selected as subcommanders they sat shoulder to shoulder at the small table in esk kars quarters gatus sat next to esk kar bantor jalen and sisuthros faced their new captain across the table a water jar and cups rested between them bantor a reliable man who could follow orders was a little older than esk kar jalen about five years younger had come to orak from the west an excellent fighter and one of the few good horsemen in orak jalen had quarreled with ariamus and his toadies even more than esk kar sisuthros had just reached his twentieth season but had sharp wits to match his skill with a sword except for gatus none had commanded any significant number of men before ariamus had kept them in the ranks promoting his favorites who followed his orders without thinking esk kar had marked these three as men of courage and ability who could be relied on most of all theyd dared to disagree with ariamus therell be much arguing at nicars meeting but most of the nobles will decide to stay and fight afterward nicar will go to the marketplace and speak to the people as will i you and the men will be there to keep order follow my lead and help sway the villagers if any in the crowd get out of control dont be afraid to break a few heads there will be plenty of blood shed before this is over so we might as well start today esk kar studied them they seemed steady enough bantor youll take charge of the gates assign three men to each no one leaves the village without permission from nicar or me no oneand that includes any of the five families their faces showed disbelief their doubts clearly visible breaking a few headsthat they could understand but standing up to the five families and their armed guards clearly involved more danger esk kar saw the question on the mans face we cannot have men leave the village and take with them anything or any slave well need to defend it he explained so if a man wants to leave and take say a craftsman or builder slave with him we must not allow that our lives may depend on such men what about those going out to the fields bantor cocked his head better to question than not esk kar knew i dont mean those just going for the day bantor only those planning to leave the village permanently and taking their goods with them if any want to leave on their own fine but no men of property taking either slaves or tools or baggage leaves without our approval noble drigos men are in the streets and in the market talking to everyone bantor offered theyre acting as if they already rule the village some are saying drigo will take command of orak and the soldiers well i have a surprise for noble drigo esk kar said thanking the gods for trellas warning but well talk of that later men wont want to give up their slaves esk kar gatus remarked theyll make trouble if you try to stop them esk kar nodded if they have something we want well pay them for it be it slave or tool or weapon nicar and the families will pay them that is the men exchanged glances but said nothing he ignored the looks he needed them to believe in him at least until after today when theyd see for themselves how events played out starting tomorrow we begin recruiting and training in the next few months hundreds of people will be pouring into the village fleeing the barbarians we must be ready to arm and train them you cant train men to fight barbarians not in a few months jalen objected his voice rising in protest were not going to go out and fight them man to man instead well battle them from the wall we build around the village we will fight them with archers any man can bend a bow gatus and i have discussed this and it can be done esk kar turned toward gatus who nodded agreement ive always wanted to train a large group of men to fight as one gatus said now ill have my chance the old soldier had many strange ideas about how to train men and nothing gave him more pleasure than sweating recruits into shape theyll surround us and rush the village from all sides jalen insisted even bowmen cannot stop that kind of attack not so fast jalen esk kar gave a short laugh well make sure they can come at us in force from only one direction against our strongest point well wait behind our wall wait until they run out of food wait until they must move on we dont have to defeat them or drive them off we just have to make them grow tired of attacking us i know we can do that esk kar rapped his cup on the table and every time they attack our wall well slaughter them well force them from their horses and kill them with arrows he saw the skepticism in their faces theyd seen action against barbarians at one time or another they knew how tough they were you know once a man is off his horse esk kar went on hes easy to kill and barbarians are even easier from childhood they fight from their horses their swords and lances are meant to strike from the horse their bows to fire while racing at the enemy once dismounted theyll be poor fighters and easy targets for archers standing behind a wall the barbarians are archers too esk kar sisuthros had encountered the barbarians before and still carried the scar they can shoot our men off the walls just as easily perhaps not as easily as you think sisuthros but im glad all of you are thinking of these things barbarians use short curved bows well use hunting bows longer and more powerful with a heavier arrow well start killing them before they can get into range and the wall will protect our men from their arrows you really think a wall can stop them captain sisuthros asked yes theyve never faced one before a wall full of well armed and well trained men gatus pulled at his beard can a wall strong enough and high enough be built in time i mean how high must it be esk kar shrugged now youre ahead of me thats one of the things i need to find out and it will take several days of working with the artisans and builders thats why none of them can be allowed to leave he looked at each of them in turn the hardest part of this battle against the barbarians is going to happen in the next few hours he said glancing at the window he didnt have much time if the five families accept our plan the village can be held thats why its important that you all be in the market and that you follow my lead nicar and i will sway the five families you must help us convince the crowd youre asking us to risk our lives esk kar as well as our families sisuthros said if we stay and fight if we fail nicar and i will risk as much or would you rather take your families and start roaming the countryside looking for a safe place to live when we drive the barbarians off your places here will be secure besides ive doubled your pay that should stiffen your backbones when the barbarians are driven off youll each receive twenty gold coins plus a double share of any loot taken from the barbarians the mention of gold had the desired effect but thats not enough to keep men fighting ive fought them many times and even when ive killed them ive always had to give ground im tired of giving way to them and im tired of being told what great fighters they are its time to make them afraid of us esk kars words hung in the air for a long moment before jalen spoke up i have not spoken to anyone of this but seven years ago barbarians overran my village murdered my father and took my mother and sister as slaves ive killed many of them since and i want only the opportunity to kill more ill follow your orders esk kar as long as you stand and fight them im not afraid of them even on their horses esk kar nodded understanding the mans pain the village held many more like him and now he knew why jalen had often looked at him with anger in his eyes seeing only a man from a barbarian clan not the soldier esk kar had become were all fi ghting men and our fi ght against the barbarians begins today the first step will be to stop drigo from taking control of orak even with nicars backing i expect well see some blood spilled before dark what im asking wont be easy it will likely be the most danger youve ever faced but if we win the rewards will be great so i ask you will you follow me down this road to win gold for ourselves and to save orak or must i look to other men to join me one by one they looked at each other and slowly nodded assent esk kar smiled in satisfaction hed gotten them this far now hed fi nd out just how much they were willing to risk he glanced up at the sun good now theres one more thing we have to plan and cursed little time to do it the crowds thronged the narrow lanes esk kar had never seen so many in the marketplace every man wanted to stop and question him as he pushed through on the way to nicars house gatus sisuthros adad and two others accompanied esk kar dressed in his new tunic and sandals esk kar moved confidently taking long purposeful strides that parted the crowd ahead of him his short sword hung from his belt freshly oiled to stay loose in its scabbard behind him walked trella head properly downcast wearing her new dress the garment hadnt been woven from the fancy cloth worn by rich merchants or wealthy farmers but it fitted her new station and looked much better than the cast off garment shed worn as nicars slave esk kar hadnt thought to tell her what to buy or how much to spend but it didnt surprise him that she had sense enough to buy something practical turning into the lane where nicar lived esk kar found what hed been told to expect almost twenty men lounged about the hired bodyguards of the families using the authority of their masters they lorded it over both the villagers and the soldiers for at least as long as esk kar had lived in orak when they saw him approach most of them straightened up and a rough line formed across the lane a dozen paces from nicars gate most of those blocking the way wore drigos emblem on their tunics naxos noble drigos chief bodyguard had broad shoulders and a coarse red beard that failed to cover a poxed face and a missing tooth he stood in the center of the lane directly in esk kars path the meeting of the five families is closed to soldiers naxos said in a loud voice as esk kars party approached making sure everyone heard his authority naxos hooked his thumbs on the thick leather of his sword belt ive been summoned by nicar esk kar answered reasonably stopping about five paces from the line am i forbidden to enter as well naxos one of the few men in the village as tall as esk kar stared him in the eyes and took his time before replying you may enter he answered still speaking in a forceful tone that carried the length of the lane as if deciding the matter himself but the rest of your men must return to their shit hole of a barracks theres no need for play soldiers here so they wanted him alone no doubt drigo didnt want too much bloodshed either then theyd jump him as he passed through their line esk kar mentally thanked the man for his offensive words nothing could have provoked his men or stiffened their resolve more theyd all been bullied and ridiculed by naxos and the other guards esk kar looked at the men standing boldly beside naxos hands on their swords smiles on their faces confident in their authority esk kar could hear the crowd behind him begin to melt away my men go where i tell them naxos esk kar said firmly stand aside and let us pass naxoss laugh boomed across the alleyway youre a pig of a barbarian esk kar and should have been taught a lesson long ago ill have your head on a plate if your men arent on their way the man standing next to naxos burly and young drew his sword eyes wide with excitement let me kill him for you naxos he said eagerly esk kar didnt reply instead he slowly raised his left hand above his shoulder palm outward as if to appease the man but instead of saying anything esk kar simply pointed his finger at the troublemaker there was a hiss in the air and a soft thud and the man looked down to see a long arrow buried in the center of his chest no one moved as the dying man first gasped a long breath then looked up the sword slipping from his hand and falling to the ground then he was on his knees pitching facedown into the dust nobody moved all of naxoss men looked up open mouthed at the rooftops along the alleyway where ten archers rose up five on each side of the street jalen commanded them and they stood ready bows drawn to the nock targets selected waiting for esk kars next signal the rest of the bodyguards made no movement their eyes locked on the archers as gatus shouted an order bantor and a half dozen men raced up to stand on either side of esk kar and gatus they carried shields and drawn swords as they quickly fanned out in a line facing naxos and his men the bodyguards bravado had changed to fear in an instant and now they were paralyzed with indecision no one attempted to draw a weapon and most took their hands off their hilts a few especially those serving the other nobles stepped back a little as if to distance themselves from naxos and drigos men esk kar calmly drew his sword but kept the tip pointing toward the ground as he crossed the five paces that separated him from naxos the mans eyes stared up at the roof looking at the three men aiming arrows at his chest he didnt even react when esk kar raised the blade and held it against his stomach instead naxos looked down at the sword as if hed never seen such a weapon before all of you men esk kar called out dont move throw down your weapons anyone who draws a sword dies here in the dirt nothing happened the guards seemed rooted to the ground most of them still stared at the archers above them now esk kar barked the command savagely his voice broke the spell and in a moment the dull sound of weapons striking the dirt was heard esk kar looked into naxoss eyes and saw fear replace the shock of seeing the line of bowmen esk kar gave him no more time either to speak or to act thrusting the sword deep into the mans belly a grunt of pain and astonishment escaped from naxoss lips even as he tried to grasp the blade that pierced him viciously esk kar turned the blade wrenching another groan from naxoss open mouth then jerked it from his body blood spurted everywhere escaping through the mans hands as he tried to cover the fatal wound sagging to his knees as his legs gave way then falling hard on his back one leg under him the other twitching in the dust naxos tried to speak but couldnt get the words out even before he died esk kars men had moved closing to within striking distance of the guards stooping down esk kar wiped his sword on the dying mans tunic ignoring his death sounds and twitches esk kar even changed hands and cleaned his right hand and arm both spattered with the blood gushing from the mans stomach none of naxoss men moved or said a word esk kar returned his blade to its scabbard turning his back on the cowed guards esk kar faced the frightened villagers whod hung back behind him hoping to see some excitement they too stood rooted in place and stunned into silence i do not like to be called a barbarian esk kar said his voice carrying down the lane nor do my men like to hear their commander so addressed he turned to gatus gather their weapons and keep them quiet trella had stopped a few paces behind gatus and his men esk kar called her name and she followed him as he pushed past the still shocked bodyguards they walked through the open gate and entered the spacious garden that separated nicars house from the street the door stood slightly ajar and unattended and they entered without knocking once inside esk kar realized that no one was aware of what had happened in the lane outside the house servants busy waiting on nicars guests had no time for events in the always noisy lane trella held his arm for a moment took a scrap of cloth from her pocket moistened it in her mouth and wiped a drop of blood from his cheek and another from his arm she examined him carefully for any other blood traces her face looked pale and her hands shook a little but her eyes showed no panic he guessed she had never seen men die like that killing people is never pretty he kept his words low so only she could hear if i hadnt killed him hed have challenged my authority every day he touched her arm for a moment can you still face what may come inside she nodded they turned at the sound of footsteps to find creta coming toward them good day esk kar she glanced at trella then stared more closely noting her new dress come this way theyre waiting for you youre already late good day creta esk kar answered nodding his head well follow you creta stopped abruptly and esk kar spoke before she could protest nicar said i should use trella to assist me and i need her with me he kept his voice firm and hard without a word creta turned and led them to the same room where hed dined with nicar she knocked once then opened the door esk kar and trella moved past her and she shut the door behind them today the room looked different set up for business rather than dinner gone were the soft chairs and cushions used for dining another table had been brought from somewhere and joined to the one nicar and esk kar had eaten from last evening forming a large expanse of wood that nearly filled the room the scent of wine hung in the air noticeable even over the thick spray of jasmine in the far corner of the room set there to mask the odors of so many men in such a confined space ten men sat around the table the leaders of the five families each accompanied by an eldest son or a trusted advisor nicar sat at the head of the table with nobles rebba and decca to his right the two cousins owned several shops and many of the boats that plied the river drigo and nestor took the other side nestor owned most of the large farms surrounding the village one empty stool at the foot of the table remained and esk kar crossed to it and bowed low to the assembly his doubts had vanished the killings in the lane committed him fully and he could not turn aside he had to leave this room as captain of the guard otherwise hed be lucky to get out of orak with his skin intact drigo would certainly put a price on his head for killing naxos esk kar realized he had one although temporary advantageno one in the room knew what had happened outside that their guards had been disarmed and now sat in the dirt under the soldiers control noble nicar i come at your request he looked at the other men and noted the brief look of surprise on drigos face greetings to you all trella had stressed that he be polite at all times and keep his temper in check no matter what provocation or disagreement might arise your slave does not belong here drigo said though the meeting was supposedly under nicars control this is the meeting of the five families and we follow our customs women and slaves are not permitted drigo had recovered quickly from his surprise strange esk kar thought yesterday he would have been in awe of the nobles authority now he was merely an obstacle to be overcome nobles im a simple soldier i have no training or memory to speak with you my slave is here to remember what we discuss so that i dont forget anything of importance my father told you to send the slave away these words came from drigo the younger a few years ago as a young bully he had terrorized the weaker children with his fists now hed reached manhood and considered himself a leader of men taller and broader than his father he had nineteen seasons three men who had offended him died mysteriously murdered in the night at least two others had died by young drigos own hand his words brought stern glances from the other leaders and esk kar guessed only the elders could speak freely she stays with me esk kar answered firmly or i can go if you wish the first test of wills even as trella had foretold one of the leaders looked to drigo the other two glanced at nicar esk kar stood there at ease his hands relaxed at his sides trella remained two paces behind him eyes down and where would you go esk kar countered drigo ignoring his sons comments back to the barbarians from whence you came perhaps we should send you to them today the wind blows in many directions noble drigo esk kar answered but i thought the families wished to defend orak if thats not true merely say so and ill leave you to your business fighting men can always find work in these troubled times youre an impudent dog snarled drigo the younger ive a mind to have you thrown out into the street this time the reaction came from nicar drigo your son speaks out of turn if he cannot restrain his tongue perhaps it would be best if he left the room nicar glanced around the table and the others nodded their agreement my son will keep silent drigo responded but i will not we dont need this soldier we cannot resist the barbarians in any case several members of the families began speaking but esk kars voice sounded clearly over theirs nobles if you dont wish to fight then your village will be destroyed the barbarians will tear your houses down to the ground and burn everything they dont toss into the river or you can resist them drive them off and save your village the choice is yours and you must make it today his words silenced them momentarily esk kar looked around the table and saw doubt in their eyes mixed with confusion at the boldness of a man theyd thought of only as a common soldier he went on before they could say anything whatever you choose the people are waiting to hear your words i told them you would speak to them today so youll have to decide now if you tell them the nobles are not going to resist many will begin to leave once gone they wont come back and so youll all have to leave taking what you can carry crossing the river and hoping to avoid the barbarians you had no right to speak to the people noble rebba said speaking for the first time only the families can speak for orak noble decca nodded in agreement the villagers know the barbarians are coming esk kar answered keeping temper and voice under control they know ariamus took men and horses as well as all he could carry before he fled they know that im meeting with you now if you dont say something today many more will go including myself and the rest of the soldiers no one will stay here guarding your wealth until its too late to escape so orak will fall in a few weeks months before the barbarians arrive when you leave here i think youll find that many things have changed he looked at nicar for a moment as i said if you dont want me to defend the village say so and ill be gone i dont need to risk my life defending orak nothing can stop the barbarians esk kar answered nestor the oldest member of the families nestor had lived in and around orak even longer than nicar nestor resided in one of the large farms that ringed the village you should know that more than any of us noble nestor i believe they can be stopped and that i know how to stop them as i discussed with nicar it can be done but its only possible if we start now and only if everyone puts their hearts and backs into it the villagers must believe orak can resist or theyll leave we dont need the villagers drigo answered easily we rule here and we decide what is to become of orak you may rule here but the people of the village give you power esk kar countered without the craftsman the baker the winemaker the tavern keeper even the farmers in the fields what will you do make your own bread plant crops yourself rule over your own family there are other villages drigo said sure of himself still speaking down to esk kar yes and they have their own rulers esk kar said recalling trellas words youd have to buy your way into them perhaps you would not find yourself a noble in your new village we can start our own village said drigo the younger ignoring the admonishment to keep silent we dont need the villagers here for that esk kar laughed yes ruler of a dung heap of fifty or a hundred people here is the river fertile soil trade with the other villages hundreds of tradesmen and crafts of many kinds where else can you find all that keep silent my son the elder drigo said glancing at his heir but my sons words have truth in them we can return here after the barbarians have gone true you can start over again esk kar replied mentally thanking trella for her foresight so far they had said nothing she hadnt anticipated of course the barbarians will return again in another five or ten years or perhaps other strangers may come and maybe they will be interested in being rulers of a new orak esk kar looked at nicar and saw him leaning back in his chair at ease clearly enjoying the debate as he gauged the faces of the other leaders but i dont want to waste your time nobles esk kar went on and i dont think it is my place to explain to you the value of a village the size of orak he stumbled a little with the words trying to get the sense that trella had voiced but they didnt seem to notice his lapse perhaps we should ask esk kar to tell us how he plans to stop the barbarians nicar said quietly he waited a moment but no one spoke please sit esk kar would you care for some wine esk kar sat down mindful of the sword at his waist that no one seemed to have noticed water noble nicar my slave will fetch it he nodded to trella she went to the water jug standing on a side table and filled a cup then placed it in front of him wine for me slave sneered drigo the younger sliding his cup hard across the table toward trella she caught it deftly before it could fall over the edge she looked at esk kar her face expressionless and he nodded wine for master drigo esk kar repeated even as he decided he would kill the young fool for the insult some hint of his thoughts must have crept into his voice because all eyes turned toward him including those of the elder drigo as if they sensed something beneath his words no no more wine for my son drigo said his tone somewhat more cautious were finished here the rest of you can waste your time talking about stopping the barbarians but in the end youll all be leaving the village he stood up his son joining him i have more important things to attend to esk kar smiled tolerantly at drigos son even as he saw the dagger under the young mans tunic when he stood no one else left their seats father and son started for the door but the youngest couldnt resist the urge to speak one more time he stopped a few steps from esk kar and barbarian youd better watch your tongue or youll find it gone from your head trellas musical laugh surprised everyone including esk kar and stopped all talk everyones eyes turned toward her all except esk kar who kept his eyes on young drigos hands my apologies nobles my tongue betrayed me trella said contritely but the laughter remained in her voice and her eyes whats so funny slave a crease appeared in the elder drigos brow as if hed missed something important nothing noble drigo she answered humbly enough except that the last man to call my master a barbarian is dead we care not if he slits some pig farmers throat spoke young drigo his temper matching the flush rising on his face the girls laugh had pushed the boy past his senses young drigo wasnt used to being laughed at in public and by a slave at that no young master drigo it was not some peasant trella responded her voice steady and with just the tiniest hint of insolence needed to further fan the flame of anger it was naxos and one of his men who lie dead in the street outside the smile stayed on her face as she looked at the boy every eye turned to esk kar who picked at a fingernail still keeping an eye on young drigo the youths hand moved toward his tunic inches from the dagger is this true nicar asked unable to keep the indignation and anger out of his voice yes its true esk kar replied leaning against the table with his left arm as he turned sideways on the stool to face nicar drigos man tried to keep me from your house naxos also said my slave wasnt permitted to enter he called me a barbarian then he and another tried to attack me not quite true but close enough esk kar waited a moment before he went on shifting his body even further so that his sword was pinned against the table as he turned to face the elder drigo his right side now turned toward the younger man but dont worry noble drigo i spared the rest of your guards youll find them outside and theyll be much more polite to my men in the future from his new position esk kar glanced back at drigo the younger saw his face had flushed an even deeper red and smiled at him the way a man smiles at a small child with a cry of rage the youth snatched the dagger from his tunic and lunged toward esk kar certain he could strike before esk kar could stand or free his sword but instead of trying to rise up and meet the thrust esk kar shifted more of his weight to the heavy table and lashed out with his leg his sandal caught the boy squarely in the chest the knife point stopping inches from esk kars body before the kick sent the boy reeling back into the wall staggering him for a moment but long enough as esk kar sprang from the stool the sword flashing from its scabbard and crossing over his body before thrusting home in the boys throat esk kars move had been so quick so unexpected that the rulers of orak sat rooted in their chairs stunned by the death blow the usual reaction of men who gave orders not sword strokes only drigo the elder found his voice no stop he screamed too late as he watched his son take the death cut he threw himself at esk kar he had no weapon and a stiff arm in the chest would have sent him staggering back but not today esk kar thought as he twisted his body to meet the mans rush stepped back and extended his sword arm letting drigo run himself against the blade his weight and momentum carrying him forward until the hilt nearly touched his chest his right hand twitched in front of esk kars face and drigos eyes widened with amazement for a moment before they turned up in their sockets death had taken him even before his son who gurgled and twitched for a few more moments before the loss of blood killed him everyone was on their feet but nobody said anything they stood there in shock eyes wide as they watched the drigos die esk kar tried to jerk his sword free as the fathers body slumped to the floor but the flesh had closed tight around the blade esk kar had to put his foot on the body and pull hard still no one said anything blood continued to ooze from the two bodies esk kar handed the sword to trella take this and clean it stooping he recovered the dagger the foolish boy had dropped and sat back down at the table dropping the knife in his lap esk kar picked up his water cup and drained it though much of its contents had spilled when he pushed against the table i think you should all sit down he said his voice calm we still have many things to discuss he noticed a sharp knocking on the door that grew louder see to the door trella then find gatus the door opened before trella reached it and creta stood in the doorway two of nicars guards behind her she started to speak then glanced in horror at the bloody scene at her feet her hand flying up to cover her mouth the guards behind her looked as frightened as their mistress noble nicar esk kar began perhaps you should tell your men that theres no danger to esk kars relief nicar quickly recovered yes of course creta wine for everyone and have slaves remove these bodies immediately he looked at the crowd of servants gathering in the antechamber and raised his voice so all could hear him an unfortunate incident has occurred drigo and his son tried to kill eskkar the new captain of the guard he paused and were themselves slain for the next ten minutes chaos ensued as frightened servants dragged the bodies out wiped the floor clean and straightened the furniture trella returned with gatus in tow she handed esk kar his sword wiped clean of blood resting her hand on his arm for the briefest of moments the still nervous nobles gulped their wine even as more was poured before a still trembling creta closed the chamber door during this time esk kar studied the men around the table the five familiesno now it was the four familieshad been given a fright and were no doubt all thinking it could have been any of them they needed to be reassured and quickly noble leaders esk kar began humbly i offer sorrow for what happened here but i didnt provoke anyone not outside in the street nor here in this room mostly true he thought but hed certainly been prepared to kill anyone who tried to stop him looking around the table he saw his words sinking in now these men would start thinking again trying to discover what in oraks power structure had changed and who would benefi t eskkar took another breath but noble drigo wasnt interested in defending orak only in taking control he planned to seize your village and your property watching them he decided that trella had been right better to pour a bucket of oil than a cupful youre oraks leaders my men and i will stay and fight to defend the village if you wish it he looked at each man in turn nicar said that he wants to fight i told him orak could be defended and that i would lead the battle if the families agreed to my conditions now its time to decide we hold this place to the death or we all move on which do you choose for the next two hours the nobles argued as much among themselves as with esk kar nicar sent out for more wine and voices rose as esk kar explained what happened outside and what drigo and his men had planned for orak finally satisfied with drigos demise the talk shifted back to the wall and the coming invasion esk kar explained his plans again and again repeating how the barbarians could be beaten from behind a wall the tide turned when rebba posed a key question suppose esk kar the wall cannot be built high and strong enough in the time we have after all it can take months to build even a house what then noble rebba thats the most important question and the one i cant answer we must meet with the builders and masons and learn whether a wall can be built if it cannot then were all free to stay or go rebba wasnt finished yet suppose they say it can be done and we start work but the barbarians come before the wall is finished wed be trapped here defenseless esk kar and trella had spoken of that possibility we can only try rebba but the first moment we learn we cant finish in time then we can leave i dont want to fight them in the open esk kar recalled more of trellas thoughts but if we run now we abandon everything youve built here and orak will never be so great again the trade up and down the river will dry up remember too we face danger in leaving a place and starting over every man becomes a looter and every clan becomes a robber tribe but if we drive them away we break the old cycle of death and destruction orak will become the greatest village in the world and you will own it rebba stared down at his wine cup esk kar wondered if all of them had drunk too much to think clearly hed wanted some wine himself but one look at trella standing behind him and hed stayed with water now rebba shifted his gaze toward nicar and nodded esk kar began nicar leave us for a moment we need to discuss some things privately i understand he stood up and it felt good to stretch his legs come trella well wait in the garden take this he said handing her drigos blade small and well made it would be a fitting gift she might need it in the coming days when esk kar opened the door he found creta there and this time he knew she overheard every word her attitude had changed and she bowed nervously toward him this time with genuine respect at the front entrance a manservant his mouth agape rushed to open the door for them esk kar found gatus and his men bunched inside the front garden theyd moved the nobles bodyguards into the courtyard they sat weaponless on the ground their backs to the wall that hid nicars sanctuary from the street through the open gate esk kar saw villagers filling the lane jammed together as tightly as possible in the narrow confines soldiers using spears kept them away from the entrance a shout went up from the crowd when they saw esk kar emerge the rising clamor was a mixture of people cheering and calling his name gatus strode over a broad smile on his face greetings captain he said formally bowing properly so that everyone could see esk kars authority when they brought out drigos body word spread like a steppes fire we had to bring the guards inside its a good thing drigo and his whelp were so unpopular he moved closer so that only esk kar could hear him i sent for the rest of the men when i saw the crowd growing maybe you should say something to them esk kar could barely hear him over the noise from the street at least five hundred people packed the lane more villagers than hed ever seen gathered together before he turned to trella what shall i say just as hed gotten accustomed to speaking freely with the families he now had to speak to a rabble and had no idea what to tell them she pulled his arm down so she could speak in his ear it doesnt matter youre a hero to them now tell them that all will be well that nicar and the others will speak to them soon but the nobles havent finished talking yet suppose they decide to run never they decided to stay and fi ght an hour ago they just needed to talk themselves into it he forced a smile to his face and strode toward the gate propping his foot on the gates crossbar he pulled himself up so he rose above the throng and held up his hand for silence it took time for the noise to cease helped along by stern words from the soldiers in front which gave him time to think people of orak he began raising his voice the four families will speak to you soon youll hear from them what we plan to do an angry roar answered him some people shouting that the families would run others that he must save them some merely crying his name over and over they began to press against his men soon theyd push their way into the garden silence he roared in his battle voice loud enough to be heard the length of the street silence or ill leave you to the barbarians that stopped both the noise and the push of the crowd toward the house he took another deep breath go to the marketplace and await nicar and the other families go now he swung down from the gate but his sandal caught in the crosspiece and he lost his balance only gatuss strong arm kept him upright gods if hed fallen on his ass the villagers would have laughed themselves senseless he and trella went back into the house the door already opened wide by the waiting servant when it closed safely behind them he breathed a sigh of relief then looked up to find nicar walking toward him well esk kar what other surprises do you have for us perhaps you should tell us what youve decided to do i begin to wonder what i have unleashed despite the irony in nicars words esk kar heard respect in them as well nothing you need worry about nicar i only want to hear your decision do we stay and fight or do we run the families have decided to stay and lead the defense of orak nicar answered raising his voice and knowing his words would be heard and repeated youll be in command of orak until the barbarians have been driven off he lowered his voice so only esk kar and trella could hear though i wonder what will happen then nicar shrugged resignedly it doesnt matter what must we do now take the nobles to the marketplace let everyone see that all are united in this you know better than i what to say after all of you speak then ill tell them how hard its going to be nicar nodded pulling at his beard is there anything else no nothing im sure there will be trella grasped his arm and whispered in his ear oh yes i think you should send men to take possession of drigos house and goods we can begin paying for the defense of orak with his gold yes an excellent suggestion esk kar nicar glanced at trella that may soften the blow to the families as well nicar hesitated for a moment and what do you want from drigos goods for yourself i want nothing to do with his gold murdering men for their goods might bring down the anger of the gods or so the priests said and hed tried to avoid their wrath as much as possible since he ceased his raiding days but his house is large and will make an excellent headquarters for my men as well as a place to begin storing our weapons when you have emptied it perhaps youll approve our using it and after this is over youll keep it i suppose nicar answered well why not i did promise you a house though i wasnt expecting it to be larger than my own nicar if i live long enough to keep his house ill pay you and the other families fairly for it you can tell that to the nobles if any ask nicar studied him for a moment you continue to surprise me esk kar take the house at sundown tomorrow that will give us time to search it and discover drigos hiding places nicar faced trella once again i wonder if i made a mistake in giving you away your laughter started the killing as surely as a blow for a moment i thought you both planned it in advance he shook his head no that cant be true young drigo the fool brought it on himself nicar turned back to esk kar though you didnt need to kill his father you could have if i hadnt he would have killed me if not today then soon enough esk kar had acted instinctively but he knew hed done the right thing father and son both had to die yes i suppose so nicar agreed reluctantly anyway its too late to think about such matters lets go to the marketplace and reassure the people weve much to tell them if were going to convince them to stay and fight it was five hours after sundown before esk kar blew out the flame from the lamp since the morning theyd not had a moment alone in the long day that changed esk kars fortune more than any day since his birth he crawled under the blanket where her waiting arms folded around him for a long time they held each other the events of the day still a whirlwind in their minds we made it through the day thanks to you trella that was true enough she had probably saved his life by warning him about naxos and by provoking drigo at the right time shed guided the outcome as surely as his own actions in the market nicar had spoken to the crowd he promised grain silver coins and new or better houses for those who stayed and fought he guaranteed the craftsmen protection in their trade food and grain would be stockpiled in the village enough to feed everyone until after the danger had passed and finally slaves and bound servants who worked on the wall would earn their freedom in return and their owners would receive compensation shouts of anger from some and cheers from the slaves greeted that announcement but nicar stood his ground orak had to survive and the villages defense needed skilled men he repeated the warning that those trying to leave with critical tools or slaves would be stopped the other nobles and even oraks two priests spoke to the crowd they all answered questions and stressed the need to stay and defend their homes and families only nicars pronouncement that esk kar would be in charge of the villages defense put the crowd at ease your words pleased the villagers esk kar i could see they trusted you in the market trella had sat at his feet her back to the crowd to make sure that he didnt forget anything of importance hed warned the people about the dangers of leaving orak the risk of traveling on the roads and the bandits that would follow the barbarians again and again he assured them the barbarians could be driven away and that a wall would protect them he promised he would defend all of them and it had worked in the end most of the crowd roared approval of both nicar and esk kar as men who would save their families and their lives they ignored esk kars origins he was one of them now their protector the shouting and talking continued long after esk kar and the nobles left the marketplace i hope we persuaded enough of them to stay many will need to work on the wall trella stayed silent for a moment then clasped him tightly again before she spoke ive never seen men killed like that before i mean so suddenly in carnax i watched an execution but i never saw men killing like that it was more bloody than i expected she pushed closer to him moving her leg over his rubbing herself against him and you could have been killed when drigo rushed at you with the dagger i thought you would die and i provoked him wanted him to attack you laughed at him until he lost control men die all the time and men like drigo and his foolish child they die more easily because they know nothing of real fighting ive fought many battles and ive learned something from all of them what of naxos he was no pampered brat and he was standing close enough to you her concern was real shed been truly frightened for him naxos was different but he was already beaten when the archers rose up behind me if his men had been trained fi ghters they would have rushed us when the first arrow struck and the bowmen would have had no targets instead they just stood there and their will to fight vanished killing him only made it easier to provoke drigo and control his men and what would you have done if they had attacked you he laughed softly in her ear as his hand found her breast the touch excited him naxos and his guards were bullies used to swaggering through the streets and breaking villagers heads guards dont expect to fight archers thats why they frightened so easily but that arrow had passed closer than he liked to admit flying just above his head the archer and jalen had split one of esk kars new gold coins as a reward an act of generosity he already regretted a few silver coins would have sufficed and that was in addition to the three silver coins hed promised each of the archers she shivered under his touch and her hand moved from around his neck to begin stroking his chest now the people will follow you even the families will do what you say now that drigo is gone she moved her hand down to his hip letting her fingers explore drigo would have made himself ruler of orak it was better that he died quickly rather than stand in our way her touch made him even more eager and his worries faded as his desire hardened the picture of drigo running onto his sword flashed into his mind and that image made him even more excited killing often did that he knew made a man lust for a woman any woman simply to prove that you still lived after the fighting stopped that youd survived and someone else was dead and what a woman was in his bed tonight he thought as his hands began to roam her bodyone more precious than any in the village perhaps the killings had excited her as well women often became aroused after seeing a kill she had after all helped bring them about the warmth in the bed grew and not all of it from the thick blanket trellas mouth found his for a long kiss that left them both breathless and what plans does my master have for me in the morning she whispered seductively as her hand reached down to touch his manhood tomorrow will take care of itself he rolled onto her stomach unable to restrain himself any longer and feeling her legs part easily beneath him tonight you have much more important duties the next morning esk kars regular habits asserted themselves and he rose before daybreak he dressed quietly and left trella asleep in the warm bed at the well he washed his hands and face in the cold water as the first rays of the sun reached over the eastern hills and covered orak with its soft light a long drink from a second bucket satisfied his thirst then he strode toward the barracks room to wake the men but the door stood open and gatus dressed and wearing a short sword emerged as esk kar approached i just woke them up captain the lazy brutes will be surly all day not many went to bed early last night thank you gatus his second in command must have arisen even before esk kar they went over the orders for the day as men still half asleep stumbled forth into the sunlight nicar had stressed to oraks inhabitants that they must remain under control and go about their daily affairs and the soldiers needed to keep order esk kar and gatus had discussed these plans briefly last night but esk kar wanted to make sure the men kept busy for the rest of the day by the time esk kar returned to his room the sun had cleared the horizon he found the door open to freshen the air trella had laid out their breakfast today the bread came from a baker who specialized in a different more expensive type of grain a glass bottle scarcely taller than his thumb and with its own wooden stopper held a handful of brown salt water from the well now rested inside a graceful pitcher next to another that contained weak beer a new clay plate had also joined esk kars increasing supply of worldly goods two dark brown sausages both larger than yesterdays mixed their aroma with that of the still warm bread good morning trella he took her by the shoulders and kissed her enjoying the taste of her lips after a moment she put her arms around his neck and returned the kiss the sight of the bed only a step away began to tempt him she must have sensed what he was thinking because she pushed herself away good morning master you must eat corio will be here soon they sat down at the table and began to eat trella explained her new arrangement with one of the street vendors a boy would deliver their breakfast each morning esk kar knew he could look forward to more good meals from now on when they fi nished esk kar and trella went over ideas about the wall theyd discussed this last night but esk kar wanted to be sure he didnt forget anything trellas ability to anticipate problems continued to impress him she was teaching him to think like a ruling noble something his years in and around orak and other villages had never succeeded in doing not that her wits or ideas mattered to him any longer if she were deaf and dumb hed keep her for her lovemaking already he looked forward to the coming night a tall shadow appeared in the doorway darkening the room and a voice called out greetings esk kar nicar asked that i speak with you enter honored corio esk kar put thoughts of trella in his bed aside rose from the table and extended his hand to the master artisan join us at table would you care for some wine not at present thank you corio spoke in a deep bass voice he sat down at the table the builders eyes examined his host closely no doubt sizing up the new esk kar who yesterday had magically been transformed from a common soldier into a leader of men trella this is master corio the most important builder in orak eskkar looked at corio trella will join us i find her most useful to keep track of things if corio found anything strange in that he said nothing esk kar noticed that he did give trella a thorough look well then esk kar whats all this about a wall i wasnt at the marketplace yesterday but i heard you and nicar promised a wall would be built around the village a wall big enough to stop the barbarians he tightened his lips i meant no disrespect with the word esk kar laughed he guessed the thoughts in corios head yesterday esk kar would have bowed to him in the street today corio would worry that he might be killed as easily as young drigoand with as little consequence esk kar smiled to put the man at ease im well civilized corio so use the word as you wish as you say i promised a wall to the villagers yesterday and now i must ask you to help me keep my promise i need a wall around orak high enough and strong enough to keep the barbarians at bay a wall that i can fill with bowmen to pour arrows into their ranks can you build such a wall any wall can be built captain how high a wall would be needed at least twenty five feet high that height gives my archers a clear field of fire even as it increases their range of course the wall would have to be strong enough so that it could not be easily pulled down when corio didnt respond esk kar went on the wall need not surround all of orak wed have the outlying houses torn down and the fields on both sides flooded i rode around the village two days ago the wall would have to be bigger than the palisade is today but not too much more corio shifted a little on the bench as if he found it uncomfortable a wall such as you describe would take at least a year perhaps as many as two to build you expect the barbarians to arrive in five months your pardon master corio trellas voice was properly subservient my master does not mean to tell you what to construct you are the master builder he only asks what can be built that will stop the barbarians is that not correct master eskkar kept his face impassive yes of course thats what i meant i would not tell the blacksmith how to cast me a sword i can only ask for what i need esk kar leaned back in his chair hed asked corio politely and respectfully for his services honor required that the artisan give an honest answer corio drummed his fingers on the table assuming that i remain in orak to work on such a project how many men would be available to work on this wall also materials would need to be purchased from other places along the river and we might need craftsmen from other villages as well how much coin is nicar willing to pay youll have every man in the village corio everyone including myself and my soldiers if necessary plus the hundreds of new men wholl begin arriving driven south by the oncoming barbarians seven days a week and long into the night no man will be spared even nicar has promised to labor on it and all the gold of the families will be made available to buy whatever is needed as the master artisan sat contemplating this information esk kar did some sizing up of his own about the same age corio stood a few inches shorter with thinning hair already tinted with gray his face had almost no trace of a beard and his eyes gleamed with intelligence esk kar knew him to be a skilled craftsman used to naming his own prices working at his own pace and following his own rules nothing could compel him to build the wall they needed a key to get him involved something that would make him want to stay esk kar remembered what trella had suggested listen corio esk kar leaned across the table if we can hold off the barbarians orak will be the biggest and most important village for a hundred no two hundred miles in every direction the man who builds the wall that saves orak will be the most famous and skilled artisan in the land it will be the wall that defeats the barbarians not the soldiers not the villagers your fame would spread up and down the river and youd be remembered forever and youd be well paid for your efforts and if you cant esk kar thought to himself as he settled back then well all begin planning our departure master i recall that noble nicar spoke about establishing another house to replace drigos trella added if corio agreed to build such a wall surely nicar and the families would accept him as their equal nicar had said no such thing but esk kar liked the idea anyway even he knew of corios reputation as an honest man who treated everyone fairly nicar and the families could do worse its a chance to join the nobles corio think of the honor youd become one of oraks rulers the artisan sat there glancing from one to the other and nicar has agreed to that he asked pointedly if hes forgotten my master will remind him esk kar nodded yes im sure nothing will be denied the man who raises the wall that saves orak we have him now esk kar decidedeven corio couldnt resist the thought of establishing his own noble house esk kar had run out of words so he waited in silence watching as corio thought some more the artisans fingers again drumming on the tabletop the drumming stopped abruptly as corio stood up excuse me a moment captain he stepped to the doorway and called out to someone immediately a young man carrying a large cloth pouch rushed to his master taking the pouch corio returned to the table extracted a cylinder of leather about the size of a quiver of arrows and removed its cap carefully he withdrew a roll of papyrus and set it out on the table holding down the corners with four small weights that also came from the pouch the papyrus proved to be a map one that showed the bend of the river and the village esk kar had heard of such a thing before but had never seen one even the papyrus sheet itself was rare not something found in the lands nearby but an expensive item traded on the river as for the map it was as if esk kar were a bird flying high in the sky looking down at the tigris and the village from above the river flowed in a pale blue stream but everything else had been stroked in black or brown the village showed clearly with a line around it that indicated the palisade esk kar caught the excitement in trellas eyes and knew that she had never seen such a treasure either this is a map prepared by my slave several weeks ago after yesterdays events i sent him round the village and palisade again and then we worked on other details most of the night so whats shown here is correct in most respects esk kars eyes stayed on the map but he thought about corios words working through the night meant burning lamps or candles expensive items even for corio even more interesting was that corio had heard all the talk about the barbarians and the wall and prepared himself for this meeting that meant that corio had the wit to see what would be asked of him even before hed received the summons it also meant that corio had his answers readyand that esk kar had better ask the right questions trella kept telling me to anticipate everything under the table and out of corios sight his hands tightened into fists can you understand the map esk kar many men have trouble understanding the lines and representations the question had been repeated and esk kar focused his thoughts on the map again looking carefully to see the location of the village river docks palisade farms and the two roads that met a mile from the village before joining to carry the traffic into and out of orak yes its clear enough hed scratched out enough maps in the dirt while campaigning and the papyrus made everything easier to follow reaching out with his finger he started to trace the river please captain dont touch the sheet with your hands the inks may smear from the wetness of your fingers and papyrus is delicate use this pointer he handed esk kar a small piece of soft wood with a bluntly rounded tip taking the pointer esk kar identified aloud the key points on the map even noting the directions for north and south indicated by an arrow point in one corner corio explained the few details he didnt understand a glance at trella showed she too grasped what the map represented you do well esk kar remarked corio some men have trouble with the scale of the drawing now show me where youd have your wall and what you would exclude esk kar didnt know what corio meant by the word scale but he decided not to ask especially since he was supposed to understand it he repeated the word to himself to remind himself to ask trella later the wall should go to here corio here and then back to the rivers edge esk kar touched the map lightly with the pointer and these places will be flooded turned into a swamp i want to force the barbarians to send their main force at the front of orak where my men can kill them from the top of the wall also the wall on the river side should be extended as close to the bank as possible so that the barbarians cannot gather enough men to rush the wall from the rear or sides at the front of the village i will kill them by pouring arrows down on them corio sat silent for a long moment before he looked up the barbarians have seen wooden fences before and learned to use ladders and ropes against them theyll use the same tactics against a wall if your men are busy using their bows how will they stop men on ladders ive used such ladders myself against stockades such as our own a length of wood with a fork on the end can be used to throw the ladder down two women pushing together can shove back a ladder even with a warrior on it esk kar didnt bother to add he had firsthand experience with that practice having been thrown down himself and nearly skewered on his sword in the process thats why we need a true wall a strong structure that cannot be pulled down or burned and that gives us enough room to position two or three rows of archers to defend it corio went into another of his long trances seeming to stare at the map esk kar used the moment to glance at trella she appeared confident and gave him a quick smile of encouragement the master builder took a deep breath and looked up when i came here this morning i expected to tell you truthfully that it was impossible to build a wall around orak in the time we have it is not possible to construct a wall of that length and twenty five feet high not in the time available such a height would require too much strengthening and support work also the base would require preparation and settling how about a height of about fifteen feet esk kar had to stop and think trying to visualize the height in his mind he knew fifteen feet to be a little less than the height of three village men barbarians tended to be taller though most of them stood less than six feet tall but a fit rider could stand on the back of his horse and jump high enough to pull himself over fifteen feet of wall even dead horses and men could be used as stepping stones and ladders that high could be easily constructed and carried no thats not high enough esk kar replied explaining his reasons sensing even as he did so that corio already had an answer i suggest esk kar that we make the wall fourteen or fifteen feet high but that in the front of the wall we dig a ditch at least ten feet deep and at least thirty feet wide that would effectively make the height of the wall the twenty five feet you want when esk kar didnt reply corio hastened to add its much easier to dig a ditch than build a wall and any villager can dig the dirt from the ditch can be used to make the mud bricks that will form the wall and the earth and stones can be used for fill corio had thought all this through the idea of a ditch was new something esk kar had never seen or heard of he pictured himself standing at the bottom of such a ditch looking up the wall would indeed appear to be twenty five feet high wouldnt the ditch weaken the wall at the base esk kar knew solid earth was needed to support a walled structure a smile crossed corios face youre quicker than most men esk kar to think of that but no the ditch wouldnt come all the way to the walls base it would stop about one long pace away and we would taper the slope to make it difficult to stand on the bottom of the wall would be reinforced with stones to make it difficult to dig through that way the base of the wall retains its support and the attackers cannot easily dig the foundation away corios own words seemed to give him some discomfort you realize captain that if the barbarians begin digging at the base of the wall then eventually it will weaken and begin to crumble if we allow them time to dig at the base of the wall then we are lost stones arrows spears everything will be used to stop them no theyll not have time to dig master corio trella asked politely could the ditch be flooded with water from the river corio started to say something then paused perhaps remembering again what happened to young drigo no if we flood the ditch then the water itself might weaken the earth at the walls base if we had more time we could line the ditch with stones and logs to reinforce it corio finished with a condescending smile trella hadnt finished still master corio if we flooded the ditch just a little for a day or two might it not turn the ditch into a river of mud which would rob the attackers of their footing yes but the mud would dry after a few days and the ditch would be as it was before he explained a little less patiently again drumming his fingers on the table esk kar decided corio wasnt used to listening to suggestions from slaves and young female ones at that master corio what if we were to flood the ditch every few days or whenever it began to dry out if we are locked inside the walls trella we wont have access to the river to open trenches at our will the fingers drummed even faster on the tabletop and corios reply sounded final trella went on ignoring the little signs of impatience we could use water from the wells inside the village the wells in orak are steadily refilled from the river could not a water wheel be built to lift the water over the walls the fingers stopped their drumming and the confident smile vanished from corios face what in the name of the gods was a water wheel but esk kar saw that the master builder understood the words the man went into another of his long moments of thought abruptly corio arose from the table strode to the doorway and passed outside into the sunlight eskkar got up also curious about whatever was outside winked at trella and went to stand in the doorway to his surprise he found five of corios apprentices and helpers squatting in the dirt each carrying a different bundle one boy had only a large drawing slate hanging from his neck corio spoke quietly with his senior apprentice a man about his own age the talk went on for some time eskkar felt trellas arm on his back slipping up under his tunic and rubbing at the hard muscles on his shoulders whats a water wheel he asked absently watching corio another apprentice had been summoned into the conversation this one handed his bag to another and dashed off down the lane corio resumed his discussion with his assistant both of them becoming more animated its a tool we used in our village to draw water from the river with it a few slaves could easily lift many barrels of water from the river corio turned from the assistant and walked back toward them when they were all seated again corio turned to trella my apologies trella i see both you and your master are wiser than you appear sometimes its better to keep ones wits hidden and so conceal your abilities your idea is a good one corio went on and one i should have thought of myself ive sent a boy off to find the well maker we need to know about the force of the water inside the wells and how long it takes to dig new ones and where they could be placed the water wheel would be an excellent way to lift and move the water but i dont think we would need to lift the water over the walls holes can be constructed in the wall just above the ground to pass the water through to the ditch yes i think that would work corio paused for a moment we could use clay pipes inside the holes and build some lengths of wooden troughs to carry the water from the wells to the pipes the dirt in the ditch would remain a pool of mud forcing the attackers to move slowly in it but not so wet as to threaten the base of the wall or rob it of its strength esk kar thought about corios comment about hiding ones wits and realized the master builder included himself in that group esk kar had always believed that people like young drigo who spoke sharply and arrogantly all the time were smarter than he was smarter than most others perhaps it wasnt true perhaps there were many like corio and trella who kept their wits and their mouths to themselves and so avoided the difficulties of appearing to know too much he would talk about it with trella later captain for the first time i begin to believe what you propose is barely possible whether it can be built in time im not sure but i will study the matter and give you an answer tomorrow it will be close i warrant that much but it may be that we can do what you ask master corio trella said what of the gates to the village can they be made strong enough if that is where the barbarians will attack the gates can be strengthened until theyre stronger than the wall and the ditch can be twice as wide and even deeper there well need great logs from the forests of the north for that as long as we keep them wet enough they wont burn the barbarians will try to use a ram against them but that will take time and your soldiers will have to kill them he looked at esk kar i hope youve thought about barbarians shooting arrows at whatever sticks out over the wall yes corio i have he didnt explain further since he didnt know yet whether the bows could be crafted in time or men trained esk kar tightened his lips and remained silent until corio realized nothing further would be forthcoming corio wasnt the type to ask again at that moment the apprentice returned accompanied by the villages well maker solus had been appointed by the families and was the only one in orak allowed to construct wells one of the oldest men in the village short and stooped he claimed nearly sixty seasons the man had lived in and around the river all of his life yes master corio i come at your summons what is it you wish to know solus had trouble speaking mostly because he had so few teeth left in his bald head how difficult is it to construct new wells inside orak solus corio asked getting right to the point we already have four large wells for public use as well as many private ones that provide more water than we can use why would we want more wells another man with pride in his station and his trade esk kar thought with amusement the old man had ignored him completely obviously corio had worked with solus before because he took the question in stride we plan for the defense of orak and i need water supplies closer to the palisade i need to know how much pressure is in each well in case i need to draw large quantities of water each day so tell me master digger how long does it take solus scratched his bald pate and took his time answering plainly not used to rushing at the beck and call even of corio let alone some upstart captain of the guard to do it properly cutting through the rock and walling the sides about two months solus looked around the table as if waiting for someone to challenge his estimate corio said nothing just drummed his fingers on the table solus went on as for the water pressure the force of the river is powerful and the wells in orak cannot be emptied as fast as you take water it will be replenished even with a water wheel corio asked why would you need a water wheel when he saw corios expression darken solus hastened to amplify his answers yes even with a water wheel further inland the ground is dry and even a good well can be emptied in three or four days of heavy use corio stood up and bowed to the digger of wells thank you for your time and your wisdom solus youve been of great assistance ive taken you away from your work for long enough when the man left corio turned to esk kar hes an old fool but a good stone mason as for the wells im sure a working well could be dug in about a week or two solus is very good about taking his time and lengthening out the work but i believe hes correct about the pressure of the water corio glanced out the door at the sun then carefully rolled up his map replacing it in the case which he sealed tightly ill go and review my estimates by noon tomorrow ill return and tell you what you need to know my thanks to you master corio esk kar replied he stood and clasped corios arm ive learned much this morning as have i corios smile this time was more relaxed he started for the door but then stopped and turned back honorable captain he began formally i dont wish to offend but i would ask something he looked at trella then continued if you should ever wish to sell your servant then i would be prepared to pay almost any price in my trade i must search constantly for people with certain skills and talents your servant seems to have many such skills his eyes fl ickered from esk kar to trella and back to esk kar master builder i thank you for your generous offer but trella is not for sale esk kar smiled to show that he hadnt taken any offense and we look forward to meeting you tomorrow he bowed to corio as did trella corio hesitated as if wanting to add something but instead merely smiled he bowed and left the room calling out to his apprentices as he did so esk kar went to the doorway and watched him depart with his entourage the master artisan had given him much food for thought but now esk kars thoughts were elsewhere he stepped out into the bright sun and called out to the guard standing patiently at his post i dont want to be disturbed by anyone for the next hour if someone asks tell them im busy planning the defense of orak the guard looked at him and nodded his understanding keeping his face under control returning inside esk kar closed the door and dropped the wooden bar across the entrance trella was clearing the table of the water cups but looked up at the sound put down the cups and walked into his arms you should be meeting with nicar and with the tradesmen she put her arms around him and her head against his chest master corio seems to be the most important person in orak right now and we should be quiet girl his voice already hoarse with passion or ill sell you to corio im sure he could keep you busy building things his hands slid under her dress feeling her softness he marveled once again at how she roused him maybe i would like him better he might not keep me up all night her hands were under his tunic now making him even more excited he lifted the dress up over her head and tossed it toward the table then picked her up carried her to the bed and deposited her gently on the blankets he stood over her looking down at her naked body as he removed his tunic she moved sinuously in the bed looking up at him and arching her back a little in anticipated pleasure remembering his promise from last night he vowed to keep better control of his desire trella my woman you belong to me and with me you will stay he sat down on the bed and began kissing her breasts and then he had no more words in his head for anyone or anything an hour later esk kar unbarred the door and stepped out into the courtyard the guard still attended gatus had joined him both men sitting under the tree from the grim look on gatuss face esk kar guessed that his own contentment was about to vanish yes gatus what is it can we speak privately captain he glanced toward the house trella was up and dressed but the room still reeked of sex yes lets go to the tavern for some food and beer esk kar had worked up an appetite and what had formerly been an unheard of luxury was nothing now he started walking and gatus followed bypassing the cheaper alehouse near the barracks esk kar strode two streets over to a smaller tavern one not usually frequented by soldiers this taverns wine and ale didnt wrench your stomach and if you wanted something other than bread theyd fetch it from the street vendors the innkeeper tried to seat his guests near the doorway so anyone passing by could see them but esk kar chose a dark corner and told the owner they wanted privacy along with some bread and beer esk kar might have gold now but he didnt plan to waste it on drink well gatus he began after taking a deep draught of the ale whats the problem now the men while youre taking your pleasure theyre standing about worried about the barbarians and all this talk about fighting them off gatus stopped to take a sip of his ale they know there arent enough of them to resist the barbarians even with a wall you need to talk to them some are getting ready to run like ariamus i see it in their eyes they turn away when i look at them say something to them and soon or theyll be gone esk kars hand had tightened on the ale cup when gatus mentioned his time with trella but he relaxed it immediately he couldnt get angry at gatus over that when ariamus had wasted away hours or even the whole day his dalliances annoyed all those who needed him including esk kar besides gatus kept close to the men if he said they had a problem then there was one otherwise gatus would have handled it himself a week ago esk kar would have stormed out of the tavern returned to the barracks and started knocking some heads that response wouldnt work not with the threat of the barbarians moving toward them now he needed the soldiers more than they needed him without them any wall would be useless worse the wall would never be built without the threat of force from oraks guards esk kar sat there thinking listing in his mind what he could say and do some ideas occurred and he examined them slowly and in more detail than was his wont perhaps trella was right he should think everything through before he spoke or acted they sat there in silence what did corio have to say gatus finally asked as he finished his beer can the wall be built in time esk kar told him what corio said now that you know as much as i do lets get back to the men heres what i want you to do ticking them off on his fingers he listed the items he wished gatus to assemble when he finished gatus smiled as he leaned back against the rough stone wall and called for more beer two hours of preparation later including some time telling trella what he would do and say esk kar walked around the barracks to the training area gatus had brought in all the men leaving only a single man at each gate esk kar wore only a short linen skirt leaving his chest bare he carried his long horse sword in his hand gatus jalen bantor and sisuthros waited together in the open space in front of the men two blankets at their feet concealed what lay beneath a high wagon with four large solid wheels stood behind them sit down in two ranks esk kar growled at the men he counted twenty seven seated before him at least none had run yet though the day and week were far from over he looked at each of them as he strode up and down in front of their ranks you men scum that you are are going to help me defeat the barbarians youre going to do that by training all the hundreds of new men and villagers that will be pouring into orak in the next few months before you can do that however youll have to be trained properly yourselves and thats what we he waved the sword toward gatus and the others are going to do starting today he watched their eyes shift and a few squirmed in their positions but they said nothing proving theyd learned the two basic lessons of soldieringnever volunteer and never be the first to ask a question i see you have your doubts esk kar said with a smile well good maybe well have a little wagering you all like to wager dont you lets pretend that i am a fierce barbarian warrior gatus come here gatus stepped forward at the command drawing his short sword as he did so and faced esk kar ten feet away now men lets make a little wager the barbarian against gatus esk kar hummed his horse sword through the air it was nearly twice the length of the short swords carried by the soldiers who would win no one said anything so he shouted at them answer me dogs who would win grudging replies of you or the barbarian answered him this time he waited a moment so nobody thinks the soldier can win and why not he prodded them until he heard the reply he wanted because of the long sword i can cut him down before he even reaches me he glared at them or can i jalen gatus stepped back jalen reached under the blanket put on a thick leather vest and lifted up a stout wooden shield reinforced with two thick strips of weathered copper sliding his arm into the straps he drew his sword and walked aggressively toward esk kar raising the shield to his eyes as he did so the short sword that had looked so puny a moment before now seemed much more menacing esk kar instinctively gave back a pace as he raised his sword before jalen halted the same ten feet away well men lets get back to our wager the barbarian or jalen whod win now after a moment most of them began muttering jalens name what happened to change your minds the shield makes the difference doesnt it now the barbarians long sword is of little value instead the protected short sword becomes deadly jalen can move in to close quarters with the barbarian take the sword stroke on his shield and kill him easily one of the men called out the barbarians dont fight on foot they use their horses as shields ah we have a leader of men here i see esk kar remarked and nodded at gatus again lifting his fi ngers to his lips esk kar gave a shrill whistle and in a moment a stable boy ran up leading a horse esk kar leaped on the animal and raised the sword on high the horse reared up showing high spirits and forcing esk kar to grip him tightly with his knees and pull back hard with the halter rope gatus meanwhile had dragged out a training post a four foot tall post he set into a block of wood buried in the ground the block held the post upright and on its top he set a melon from the market esk kar wheeled the horse and rode a short distance away then turned and raced the animal back toward the post giving voice to a barbarian war cry that acted like a whip to the excited animal as he flashed by the post esk kar leaned outward and struck down hard with his sword exploding the melon as a man might crush a grape and splitting the post as he thundered past in a spray of flying dirt and splattering fruit he rode back slowly talking to the horse soothingly and smiling to himself because hed nearly missed the melon esk kar stopped in front of the men who wants to stand against the barbarian and his horse no one answered come now men ill even give you a horse of your own though ill warrant youll have a better chance on the ground what still no takers he looked down at them and laughed turning toward gatus he nodded again this time gatus and bantor jumped into the wagon and gathered bows and arrows which they notched but did not draw the two of them stood shoulder to shoulder standing over the side of the wagon now who will you wager on the barbarian on his horse or the men standing with drawn bows on their wall because thats what the barbarians are going to see when they reach orak only the wall will be twenty five feet high show them jalen jalen and sisuthros jogged to the rear of the barracks and returned with two saplings bound together end to end with rope to make a crude joint jalen set his end on the ground and braced it with his foot while sisuthros at the other end lifted it with a grunt and walked it upright hand over hand until he joined jalen the two men now held the beam vertical that pole is twenty five feet high when the barbarians are beneath it their swords and horses will be useless he walked the horse closer to the pole so that they could see the height difference clucking to the animal to overcome its nervousness at the strange object looming over its head picture yourselves on top of the wall pouring arrows down on the barbarians and their horses now who would you wager on he looked at their open mouths hoping his message was getting through one of the men called out to him captain the barbarians have bows as well they can shoot back at men on the wall it was alexar the same man who had asked the first question ah i see our leader of men has his wits about him esk kar replied getting down from his horse walking to the wagon he reached up and bantor handed him his bow and arrow walking back to the men he held up the bow in one hand the arrow in the other this is the bow used by the barbarians he explained talking as if theyd never seen one before its short because it must be fired from the back of a horse while at a dead run its curved because it must be bent to provide enough force this bow is made of three different kinds of wood glued together and tipped with horn for strength a craftsman takes about six months to make a bow like this esk kar knew most of the men had no idea how much effort it took to make a bow or how many were discarded or shattered in the process he held out the arrow the arrow is short because it must fi t the bow and be carried on the horse the tip may be of hardened bone or bronze it weighs almost nothing esk kar tossed the arrow in the air a few times so they could see how light it was then put the arrow to the bow he turned toward the wagon bent the bow and launched the shaft the arrow quivered into the thick wheel with a bow such as this even the slowest barbarian on his horse can launch ten to fifteen arrows per minute whether these men knew it or not that was a frightening number of missiles for any massed group of men since a mere fifty horsemen could shoot at least fi ve hundred arrows per minute and each rider might carry thirty or forty arrows in his quiver warriors could empty their quivers and completely break a mass of men five times their size they could inflict huge casualties on their hapless opponents shattering their ranks and making them easy prey for the final attack with lance and sword but the killing range of this arrow is less than one hundred paces with any accuracy a few shafts might kill at one hundred and fifty paces eskkar let that sink in at close range the arrow is deadly after a hundred paces it will not pierce armor or shield at two hundred paces or more the arrow is nearly spent and wont penetrate even a leather vest most of you men know how to use a bow even forno esk kar pointed with the bow at the marksman whod killed naxoss henchman at least when hes sober can put a shaft in a man at fifty paces our own bows will be longer and heavier and theyll cast a heavier weight of arrow enough to kill a man at two hundred paces unless hes wearing bronze and since they dont have to be small and compact we can make our bows in less than three months esk kar gave them a grim smile so men you will have to train others many others in how to fi ght with bow spear and short sword master builder corio will construct our wall and it will enclose most of orak well tear down the rest of the village and then flood the surrounding land well force the barbarians to come up against us at the main gate and well kill them with arrows from the wall starting tomorrow all of us will put in three hours a day with the bow gatus and forno will lead the training he glanced over at gatus who nodded agreement in three months i want every one of you to be able to shoot the eyes out of a man at two hundred paces when the wall is ready well mark out the distances on the ground so youll know the range he had their attention now and could almost read their thoughts from the looks on their faces they were thinking that maybe just maybe it might work give them something to believe in something to keep them here a few more months as long as they thought they had a chance theyd stay when you can shoot at least ten arrows per minute standing behind the wall wearing leather armor and picking your targets youll do to the barbarians what they usually do to others you will smash their ranks and kill hundreds of them remember a horse is a big target if you kill or wound the horse the man goes down as he falls he may lose his bow and quiver his sword or his wits even if he doesnt break his neck in five months i expect well have between three hundred and four hundred men well trained in the use of the bow to defend the wall with all the remaining men and women of orak to back us up we will have food and water while the barbarians will find nothing to eat outside the village when they get hungry enough theyll move on well have other tricks for the barbarians as well but i dont want to burden your heads with too many things at once but remember this when the arrows start flying ill be standing beside you on the wall so tomorrow starts our training and ill be training with you as more men arrive youll begin training them as gatus and forno have trained you he saw more doubt on their faces oh dont worry men will comedriven from their homes by the barbarians men whose families have been killed by them men who are tired of running from them every few years even now dozens of men in the village are looking for a chance to pay off old scores when they hear we intend to fight more will join us esk kar stopped as if to consider his words glancing at every man we can beat the barbarians as long as we fight them our way and on our terms i know how they fight and i know they can be beaten you men will be the ones who do it unless you would rather run than fight he let that thought take root for a moment starting today your pay for each month is doubled and youll get better food you get your fi rst payment tomorrow and there will be an extra months pay when the barbarians are beaten off no doubt nicar could handle that small sum easily enough especially with drigos gold that brought the expected cheer and he waited until it stopped but starting tomorrow you work you train and you guard the village if you train well many of you will become leaders of ten and therell be more pay for that he let his voice go hard to make sure they understood his meaning but if you slack off i may not even kill you they went silent again i might just have you thrown out of orak and let you fend for yourself he glanced up at the waning sun gatus take these poor excuses for soldiers to the alehouse and feed them some beer but not too much they start training at sunrise esk kar walked off thinking hed have to be there himself at least for the next few days he could use some practice with sword and bow sitting around the barracks had weakened his muscles and he didnt feel ready yet to meet the barbarians one on one killing fools like naxos and drigo was easy enough but hardened alur meriki warriors would be a different matter turning the corner he found trella waiting for him behind her stood more than a dozen women as well as an assortment of children and dogs i kept them away master as you ordered she said raising her voice so all could hear they were sure to be a distraction his eyes widened in surprise the barracks women barely obeyed their men let alone the female slave of another man shed managed it somehow imposing her will on others twice her size or age some of the women began making rude comments about esk kars body parts and he felt glad that trella had kept them away though hed told her no such thing good trella come with me he nodded politely to the women who already pushed past him eager to learn what new fate had befallen their men we must get ready for the evening meal and you must wash and dress trella told him then wrinkled her nose you smell like a horse nicar had invited esk kar to his home for dinner whether or not the invitation included trella didnt matter as he had decided to take her anyway yes im sure i do but before dinner i want to see to the village bowyer and the fletcher ive just made some more promises about bows and arrows and i need to make sure theyre kept back at his quarters he told the guard to have the bowmaker and the arrowsmith brought there in an hour then esk kar and trella walked down to the river to bathe separating into the two areas customarily reserved for men and women after a quick wash and even quicker swim he dried himself then waited a few moments before trella appeared her hair wet and stringy but glistening in the fading sun his eyes lingered over her dress which clung tightly to her still wet body and he regretted his summons to the craftsmen he took her by the hand ignoring the smiles of the villagers at the gesture and they walked back to the barracks the knock on the open door came as esk kar finished belting on his sword two men stood there men who differed in aspect as much as any two men could the bowyer rufus was a hunched over old man with long stringy gray hair and yellowed teeth he wore a dirty tunic marked with multicolored stains and carried with him the scents of the glues and resins of his profession the fletcher stood much taller and his clean tunic marked him as a well to do craftsman he carried a goodly amount of weight on his frame that proved arrowmaking to be a more lucrative occupation than soldiering though that could be said of almost any trade even farming basically a carpenter who specialized in making tools and small implements tevana created many different items for the local tradesmen as a profi table sideline tevana had been making arrows for the soldiers for years esk kar knew him by sight but had never spoken to him the fletcher spoke first in a deep and pleasant voice bowing to esk kar and giving trella a quick glance good afternoon captain rufus the bowyer didnt bow your summons interrupted me in my work and i lose time while we speak what is so important it couldnt wait until morning his tone was irritating esk kar had met twice with rufus once to accept delivery of some bows and again to complain when one of the weapons had broken after a few days esk kar had been ignored on the first occasion and laughed at on the second for rufus gave no guarantees after all how do i know what some fool will use it for when it leaves my shopto hammer a nail or dig a hole it bent properly here you paid for it and thats the end of it esk kar had to report to ariamus that he failed to get a replacement please sit down rufus tevana bring wine for our guests trella eskkar kept his voice calm and resisted the urge to draw his sword and sweep rufuss head from his shoulders the old man made the best bows not only in orak but in the surrounding regions now his sons and apprentices did most of the work but their reputation matched their masters the three men sat down and trella poured wine then took her place on her stool behind esk kars bench rufus practically snatched the cup from her hand and gulped down half the cup then gave esk kar a look that seemed to say he didnt think much about the taste once again esk kars sword hand twitched at the insult thank you captain tevana said after taking a sip how may we help you i wont keep you long from your work rufus esk kar began i meet with nicar tonight but i wanted to make my needs known to you both as soon as possible the barbarians are moving toward us and ill need bows and arrows to resist them i think youll need more than that to stop barbarians rufus said with a dry cackle that tempted esk kars sword hand yet again but i can sell you all the bows you need if you can afford to pay for them good rufus im glad to hear that if the old fool was going to take that attitude so be it trella tell rufus and tevana what we need trella scraped her stool closer to the table my master desires four hundred bows all of them five feet in length and capable of penetrating leather armor at two hundred paces as for arrows we will need one hundred thousand war arrows plus at least ten thousand target arrows all properly feathered and tipped with bronze arrows could be tipped with almost anything though hardened bone or bronze was preferred while the bone tip could actually penetrate deeper the bronze point left a more vicious wound and was more difficult to remove and of course my master will need all the other materialsbowstrings thumb rings and wrist pads tevanas wine cup stopped an inch before his lips while rufus laughed outright slapping his hand on the table his cackle rising in volume until even tevana turned toward him in annoyance the fletcher regained his voice first captain thats impossible no one has ever asked for such a quantity of arrows beforeand bronze tipped why thats at least three maybe four tons of bronze by itself and then theres the wood the feathers the glues i couldnt possibly make that many rufus leaned forward interrupting and pushing his face toward eskkar if youd asked for fifty bows perhaps i would have made them for you but four hundred ill not even try he picked up his cup and drained it then held it out to trella for more staring at her his business with eskkar apparently finished esk kar raised his hand as she rose to fetch the wine jug no more wine for master rufus we still have much business to discuss not with me you dont rufus answered standing and starting for the open doorway im returning to my shop before the last light is gone esk kar raised his voice guard outside the guard straightened up and gathered his spear into a ready position as he moved quickly toward the doorway guard if master rufus tries to leave kill him they could hear the spear as it hummed through the air spun down to a level position the slim bronze tip hovered a foot from rufuss skinny chest as he stood in the doorway he stared at the weapon then he turned back into the room you cant threaten me esk kar im not trying to threaten you rufus im only telling you whats going to happen if you cross the doorway you die on the spear now get back here and sit down we have things to discuss and not much time rufus returned to the table and sat you dont scare me esk kar ill appeal to nicar and the five families esk kar shook his head the man must be senile not to understand the events of yesterday rufus in case you havent heard things have changed in orak do you really think that you can tell the families youre too busy to make bows right now that youre too important to work to save orak i plan to leave the village anyway esk kar ill not risk my life trying to stop barbarians nothing can stop them find someone else to make your bows if you wish to leave rufus you may ill escort you to the gate myself right now if you like but your family stays in orak and lives and dies with the rest of us maybe you didnt hear nicars words yesterday he said no one was to leave without his permission but ill make an exception for you im sure all your sons and apprentices will be glad to see you gone youre obviously too old to be the master bowyer any longer he watched rufuss face blanch as the harsh words hit home you cant keep me here im a free man and a master craftsman i have a right to leave if i choose besides theres no way to make that number of bows in five months i didnt say you had to make them all yourself rufus find others to make them this is why ive asked you and tevana here today both of you must figure out a way to meet my needs wood copper bronze cordage feathers glue bindings skilled craftsmen whatever you require if you cannot do the work yourself find others to share in the labor send word to other villages up and down the river esk kar turned to tevana the same for you tevana if you cant make that many arrows yourself then hire others or buy them nicar will arrange payment so i suggest that each of you return to your homes and begin planning to meet my needs the two men looked at each other but said nothing trellas voice broke in master you asked me to remind you about the quality of the goods oh yes of course dont think that you can throw some sticks together and call them bows they must be perfect our lives will depend on them and i want not more than one broken bow for every fifty delivered tevana the same goes for the arrows the shafts must all be straight and true nocked feathered and tipped properly and all of the same length and weight i want no differences in the shafts to make my archers miss their targets master do you wish to discuss payment now trella added damn hed forgotten the gold always the most important factor when dealing with a tradesman he leaned back from the table payment yes we should discuss that rufus whatever your price is for a top quality bow thats what well pay but for every twenty bows you deliver well pay you for twenty five and there will be a bonus of twenty gold coins when the barbarians are driven off he turned to tevana the same for you master fletcher for every twenty arrows youll receive payment for twenty five but you will be personally responsible for the quality of the shafts no matter who shapes them my mens lives will depend on how true they fly and how hard they strike if the quality of your weapons isnt perfect ill not hesitate to take your heads off and the same bonus tevana asked slowly a hint of a smile on his face if the barbarians are defeated esk kar understood the smile tevana had the better deal since it was a lot easier to craft an arrow than a bow the same arrangement for you master fletcher i just want the weapons and youll both get rich in the process and when this is over youll be the heroes of orak the men who made the weapons that saved the village master its time to go or well be late yes esk kar said and now we can tell nicar the good newsthat work on our weapons has already begun he smiled at the men and what time should these fine craftsmen return tomorrow to discuss their plans for making or obtaining the bows and arrows at one hour past noon master she answered if the plans are not complete we can work on them together ah yes i had forgotten that trella will be working with you both to make sure your plans and schedules for delivery are sound and that you get all the supplies and materials you need youll work with her as you would work with me or nicar youll find she has a keen mind for details so bring what help you need and dont waste time trying to fool her it would not be good for your health he stood up noting that dusk had arrived they really would be late soon good evening rufus tevana i look forward to hearing your plans he saw the guard standing ready at the doorway the man had heard everything and would spread the word about esk kars treatment of rufus guard the master bowyer may depart when they were gone esk kar draped his arm around trellas shoulder i think youll have no trouble with them now but if you do let me know he felt her head lean against his shoulder there should be no problems master but i did think of someone else we need to speak to the dockmaster the dockmaster why him the dockmaster managed the six wooden jetties that allowed the river boats to land and the slaves to load and unload cargoes he also arranged for the transportation of goods into and out of orak or onto other boats or carts for portage into the countryside you told rufus not to leave but you think only of the roads it would be easy for either of them to arrange passage on a ship they and their families could be well away before we even knew it frowning he realized she was right a horseman hed only been on a boat once and he had no desire to repeat the experience that means guards at the docks as well i suppose and well have to talk to all the boat captains too everything he needed required more men more attention to details more time that he didnt have he sighed arrange a meeting tomorrow with the dockmaster and bantor esk kar looked down at her and felt wonderfully happy now lets go and join nicar think how glad creta will be to see you and to feed you at her table im sure youll both have much to talk about nicars dinner unexpectedly turned into a family affair his two sons lesu and caldor had returned that afternoon from a two week trading trip nicars eldest lesu had overseen the small caravan leading a pack train of animals loaded with trade goods hed escorted seven new slaves his father would resell no doubt for a fat profit trella knew lesu to be bright and courteous only nineteen he planned to take a wife in a few weeks and would soon be fully capable of carrying on his fathers trading business caldor a year or so younger than lesu sat directly across from trella he fidgeted in his chair for most of the meal reminding trella that nicars youngest boy lacked the patience and self control of his elders not that she needed any such reminder at least tonight he avoided staring at her breasts she remembered the rough touch of his hands on her body and resisted the urge to shiver nicar must have warned both boys not to provoke esk kar or to speak disrespectfully to her dining in the very room where esk kar killed two people nicar must have wanted to make very sure there wouldnt be any more accidents nobody made the mistake of calling esk kar a barbarian the meal ended at last trella and esk kar left nicars house and passed through the courtyard as soon as they reached the street trella took eskkars hand and held it tight thankful the evenings activity had ended she took several deep breaths trying to cleanse the memories of that house from her lungs nevertheless she resolved never to return there if she could avoid it they walked briskly and trella had no problem keeping up with eskkars longer stride she felt esk kar squeeze her hand in anticipation of the warm bed that awaited them you were very quiet tonight i thought youd have more to say to nicar its not my place to give advice to nicar master nor should women speak about such things to their men in front of others at the tables of the nobles women keep silent when the affairs of men are discussed she paused for a moment and i didnt like returning to that house even to eat nothing good happened to me there id prefer never to go back there again they followed the lane as it twisted around a sharp corner a torch burned at the entrance to the barracks was it so bad there trella i mean tell me about it please master not tonight its just that im grateful to be away from that place then we wont speak of it he placed his arm around her shoulder as they passed through the rickety fence that marked the entrance to the soldiers area perhaps we can speak of other things in our bed she leaned briefly against him in a silent promise the cool night air had finally driven away the smells and memories of nicars household she felt a wave of anticipation rush through her loins her body already eager for the coming lovemaking once inside their room esk kar hung up his sword then took her into his arms her arms went around him and she held him tightly they stood that way for a few moments and she began to relax enjoying the sensation of being safe once again the warmth built up between them and she felt him harden against her esk kar pushed himself away and removed his tunic get under the blanket trella she heard the hoarseness in his voice the first sign of his passion dont you want me to build a fire no youre fire enough for me ill keep you warm i promise he kept his promise and their body heat soon spread under the blanket when their lovemaking ended she relaxed in his arms while he stroked her hair the excitement of lovemaking still so new to her kept her passion high and she enjoyed the feel of his body against hers master i saw esk kar call me that when were alone and especially in bed she snuggled against him esk kar i saw tonight that you did not drink much wine or even eat much didnt the wine and the food please you ive never tasted better wine in all my wanderings but now i have to train with the men and too much spirits make a man weak if i have to make love to you each night girl ill need all my strength nicar worried you drank too much that you couldnt be depended on i heard him say that the day he gave me to you he sighed nicar was right in the last few months i spent too much time in the alehouse if id had more coins id have drunk even more he laughed then his voice took a serious tone the night ariamus ran off i passed out in the tavern and the men carried me to my bed i could have been killed in my sleep that must never happen again you are wise to keep your head clear master esk kar you will need all your wits especially when you work with corio im glad the families will accept corio into their ranks hes a good man i think during dinner nicar had agreed to elevating corio to the rank of noble mentioning that the nobles had considered his name before young caldor didnt think much of your suggestion that corio join the noble families caldors just a boy trella fresh off his first caravan if you can call it that scarcely more than sixty miles to the east and back two days ride for a man with a good horse he kissed the top of her head how much gold do you think they took from drigos house nicar refused to reveal how much had been found though he did say one quarter of it had been given to drigos wife she and her daughter along with their most trusted servants and guards had boarded a boat and been sent downriver to return to her fathers village at nicars house i worked with his clerks and they said that nicar had more than twelve hundred gold coins trella mused she remembered her first day in orak nicar had questioned her for almost an hour tested her to ensure she could count and write the symbols before he assigned her to work with his senior clerk she needed only a single day to learn the differences between the symbols used in orak from those in her native village nicars clerk soon found her more useful than the other two slaves who served as nicars record keepers shed quickly learned the full extent of nicars holdings the clerks gossiped that drigo was nearly as rich as nicar id guess at least a thousand gold coins were found more than enough to start paying for the defense of orak no wonder drigo walked the streets as if he owned them so much gold and he sought even more and he wanted to be the first family in orak my father said greed can do such things to a man drigo would have torn orak apart do you regret killing him if he were a beggar in the street id have killed him for insulting you no one will ever do that again i promise his words pleased her and she turned to him they shared a long kiss enjoying the taste of each other that kiss led to other caresses and trella sighed contentedly as she felt esk kar becoming aroused once again trella tomorrow will be a special day for you after i finish the morning training well stand before nicar and the other families startled she raised herself on an elbow to face him what why do we need to see them tomorrow ill give you your freedom i spoke with nicar when we were alone and asked him how the thing could be done nicar will enter it as a contract with another of the nobles as a witness his words caught trella by surprise she pushed herself upright in the bed why are you doing this esk kar this isnt the time for such a thing later perhaps or when the barbarians are gone now as your slave i have your status and i can speak for you as a free woman ill be just another camp follower a soldiers woman i thought youd be pleased esk kar sounded stunned besides i dont want brats like caldor looking down at you as a free woman you can choose to be my servant and you can still speak for me is that why youre doing this so you wont be embarrassed by a slave who thinks and talks too much by the gods no i do this because i want you with me he grasped her roughly by her arms and i want you to choose me freely all my life ive never cared for a woman as i do for you if you say the word we will leave orak tomorrow and let the village fend for itself orak means nothing to me only you mean anything trella stayed silent for a long time when she spoke her voice was firm no we must stay here and you must defeat the barbarians only then can we have power and be secure and she hesitated now unsure of what to say you say that you want me that do you wish to take me for your wife when he didnt answer immediately trella poked him sharply in the ribs well what are you thinking about cant you make up your mind he laughed and rubbed the spot where she had hit him before lying back on the bed well i hadnt thought about taking a wife i was thinking about that new slave that lesu had brought back she looked pretty enough and well rounded as well she might do trella pushed him away and tried to leave the bed but esk kar caught her and pulled her back she struggled hard to break free but he pinned her with his weight and held her by her wrists as he rolled on top of her youre very strong for a girl trella i suppose we could be married at ishtars temple after nicar seals your freedom though im sure youll make a terrible wife and i will have to beat you regularly he bent down to kiss her but she turned her head away still struggling when she wouldnt meet his lips he kissed her neck and her hair then forced her legs apart letting her feel his desire against her finally she turned her lips to his trella im not sure what people mean by love but im sure i love you and want you to be my wife i swear it before all the gods in the sky and under the earth his body had aroused her she stopped struggling and moved her legs farther apart and he slid easily inside her her body remained moist from their earlier lovemaking trella gave a long sigh of pleasure and her legs slowly wrapped around him i suppose i could marry you you need someone to look after you her arms went around him and she suddenly tightened all of the muscles in her body gripping him as hard as possible after a moment she slowly relaxed letting esk kar move against her once again and our children will need their fathers name children i hadnt thought about children his hand slid down to her hip yes master she answered reverting to her role as his slave if we make love like this every night the gods are sure to send a child soon or hadnt you thought of that the thought of getting her with child excited him he thrust himself against her even harder moving faster and faster until she cried out at the pleasure he gave her esk kar made no answer just forced himself against her with all his strength trella felt her body begin to spin out of control and she heard herself moaning he held back waiting for her until her moans of pleasure increased until she tightened herself around his manhood and cried out his name she felt his seed flow as he cried out and a wave of pleasure rippled through her through both of them that went on and on until they were exhausted he stayed inside of her not moving for a long time until she could barely breathe and she had to ask him to move off her they held each other for a long time until her pleasure subsided and she could think again trella felt him drifting off to sleep so she raised her voice to keep him awake you need me to manage your household to make sure everything is done properly and there will be many tasks to make sure the village is safe drigos house is ready for us we can move in there tomorrow she stayed silent for a few moments but you will not free me or marry me yet though your offer pleases me greatly i can better help you in the coming months as your slave than as a wife i will wait when the barbarians are driven off then you can set me free if you still wish to i never heard of any slave refusing their freedom suppose i change my mind she touched his lips with her finger then i still have my coin master or have you forgotten your words already keep your golden coin trella or return it to me on our wedding night and i would never take back my words no warrior would ever do such a thing he kissed her tiredly now can i get some sleep im not the one keeping you awake instead of working to defend the village you spend much of your day and night taking your pleasure who else did you tell about setting me free only nicar and he will tell no one i made sure of that good then tell nicar tomorrow that youve decided to wait for a while now sleep he turned on his side and fell asleep in seconds trella stared up at the darkness relaxed but wakeful her body pleasantly reminding her of their passion her mind turning over esk kars startling offer for a soldier recently too poor to afford a decent tunic hed been ready to give away a valuable gift not that she needed the offer of her freedom to know he cared for her she could see that in his eyes and shed known it from their first morning together when he gave her the gold coin somehow that gift changed her made her look at him differently and now she saw in him many admirable qualities that counterbalanced his rough edges and soldiers habits his unexpected offer had surprised her she had already decided that at some point shed ask for her freedom certain that he would give it for a moment her thoughts returned to drigo and his son esk kar had killed the son not only to provoke the father but because the boy had insulted her when the boy demanded his wine esk kars eyes went cold and for a brief instant she saw the pitiless warrior that still dwelt within him blood flowed quickly among the barbarians where an insult could lead to drawn swords and death in moments young drigo and his father should have left quietly if they had theyd still be alive and the nobles in orak split in two factions fighting with each other and creating havoc now drigos gold would pay for the villages defenses and the nobles stood united behind nicar no man would insult her again she thought tonight even caldor had been polite keeping his eyes off her no doubt well lectured by his father nicar showed caution as well seeing esk kar as a new man one who now dealt easily with the likes of corio and rufus nicar would have his own concerns about the future should the barbarians be defeated but first the village must survive like nicar she would bend all her efforts to make that happen taking her freedom now would be a mistake better to work in the background both for esk kar and for herself a slaves mistakes could be easily ignored or brushed aside and they both might need that excuse at any time trella had been a slave for over three months more than enough time to learn the bitter realities unlike someone who sold himself into bondage for a season or two and consequently was treated more like a servant a bound slave became the property of her master for the rest of her life with no rights and no expectations the slave traders had beaten her twice the first week until she learned to obey a shudder passed through her at what they might have done if they hadnt wanted the extra price for her virginity even so theyd stripped her naked for their amusement or for any prospective buyers who examined her much the way they would look at any breeding animal even nicar had looked at her with lust in his eyes running his hands over his property hed seen only a young girl to be used to give him pleasure no the life of a slave was too bitter for her to bear trella had lived too well in her fathers house and learned too much to accept such a fate with the barbarians coming toward them her status or even nicars meant little esk kar had told her how even the meanest treated slave in the village had a better life than any captive in the barbarians tents trella shook off the dark thoughts much work remained ahead and the future was uncertain with no clear path before her shed wait for her freedom the words of her father came to her a good leader thinks six months ahead for his people a great leader thinks six years ahead she pondered the words for a long time her master did not seem accustomed to planning more than a few days ahead hed need her to guide him and chart out the coming years still he continued to surprise her coming up with ideas and plans in response to her questions but only in response to her prodding she could see he had the wits but had never learned to use them all that would have to change yes she must begin now if she and eskkar were to survive orak would stand or fall by what she and esk kar did in the next few months not by what happened when the barbarians arrived on the plain before the village her fate and esk kars depended on oraks survival such thoughts surprised her now so different from a few days ago now she not only wanted esk kar to survive but to take his place as a powerful noble in the years ahead her father had planned for her to join some noble family through marriage and hed trained her hard for such a role shed learned the mysteries of trade and barter gold and silver of the farm and even of the bronzemaker and each night her father had spoken to her of the events of the day explaining the choices the rulers faced and the decisions they made in her time with nicar she saw nothing that she did not understand her fathers dream ended with his own death now the barbarian threat loomed over her providing both great danger and a rare opportunity if the village survived trella would be the wife of the soldier who saved orak esk kars family her children that would come must survive and grow powerful esk kar was a strong man there would be many babies from his seed she felt the first wave of sleep approaching and her thoughts began to slow their house must be rich and powerful to protect her and their children the thought of her children gave her pause and she breathed a prayer to ishtar goddess give me a son but not yet please goddess not yet repeating the prayer she fell asleep nestled within esk kars clasp next morning corio sent word postponing their scheduled meeting to midafternoon and asking that esk kar come to the master builders home esk kar didnt mind he felt good having spent the morning training then watching gatus put the men through their paces his second in command loved nothing better than sweating men into soldiers none of the men had run off during the night though of course they had many months and opportunities to do so in high spirits they seemed to take pride in the fact that esk kar would stand and fight beside them the news that starting today esk kar and nicar would begin taking in new men to swell the ranks added to the soldiers good dispositions most of the new recruits would be farmers or villagers driven from their homes or even just men searching for a new life nevertheless there would be some fighting men among them as well two guards accompanied esk kar trella and sisuthros as they walked to corios house the show of force might not be necessary but a few of drigos followers still remained within the palisade and many of oraks villagers felt displeasure at esk kars rules forbidding them to leave the builders home stood on the northeast side of orak about as far as one could get from the barracks and the rivers edge and yet be within the palisade the house had two stories and stood behind a high wall that protected it from the busy street a stout wooden door led into a small courtyard adorned with well tended beds of tulips roses geraniums and other greenery that gave a pleasant scent to the air parts of the garden were paved with flat stones from the river set in a mix of hardened mud and straw that would resist all but the strongest rains bringing sisuthros along had been trellas idea when shed asked eskkar which of his subcommanders had the quickest wits hed named sisuthros choose a man of quick wits to work with corio while he builds the wall youll have many other things to occupy your time the young subcommander hadnt looked pleased with the assignment sisuthros wanted to fight not help build a wall telling the guards to wait in the garden esk kar trella and sisuthros entered corios workroom inside a large plank table awaited them its surface covered by a thin cotton cloth corio his two sons and assistants surrounded the table this time trella stood at esk kars left an equal participant in the proceedings corio seemed in a fine mood no doubt because of his earlier meeting with nicar and his elevation to noble family status corio extended greetings to all then introduced his sons and apprentices esk kar noticed corio pointed to each of them with great care even the youngest giving honor to all of them their chests swelled with pride as he announced their names thats how one builds loyalty esk kar realized by showing respect for ones people in front of others perhaps he could learn from men like corio and nicar esk kar resolved to remember this practice in dealing with his men captain of the guard corio began in a formal manner i told you i would answer your question about building a wall to defend orak my sons and i have worked long into the night and this morning to answer that question he nodded to his assistants and they removed the cloth from the table trella gasped while sisuthros slapped his sword hilt in amazement esk kar just stared the map of yesterday had come to life as a model of orak only larger and now it revealed the village and its surroundings little blocks of wood represented rows of buildings the palisade was made of twigs the river of pale green pebbles the whole structure stretched about four feet long by three feet wide thin flat strips of wood painted green indicated the farmlands corio pointed with his measuring stick explaining what each miniature item represented this is orak today corio went on now well change it like magicians his sons began moving things around removing some features adding others in moments theyd transformed the model the tiny blocks that represented houses and farms outside the palisade disappeared a green cloth covering them a taller wall represented by thin strips of wood set on edge replaced the original palisade now surrounded on all sides by a narrow cloth ribbon dyed the brown of the earth to represent the ditch corio had proposed the docks vanished the gates changed to bigger and thicker sticks a wall can be built esk kar corio touched the models wall with his pointer for emphasis the wall will be fourteen feet high around three sides of the village and sixteen feet high on either side of the main gate well flood the marshlands and using water from trellas wells keep the ditch in front of the wall wet and muddy at our need the distance from the bottom of the ditch to the top of the wall will measure at least twenty five feet a rare compliment from any master to give credit to a slave especially the slave of another all this can be built in five months time it will be a close thing captain but yes i believe so providing everyone works on it as you promised we must start at once tomorrow gathering the things well need such as wood from across the river and from the forests up north only willow and poplar trees grow around orak and theyre too soft and too small for our needs well need hundreds of logs of all sizes including large ones for the main gate my son will build for you most of these will have to come down the river by boat messengers and traders must be dispatched at once to buy them then stones must be taken up from the riverbed fortunately those are close at hand and in good quantity next we must set up a site to make the sun dried bricks in huge numbers they take weeks to harden properly so we must start soon with them well need every shovel and digging tool we can find as well as sand from the hills to the south wagonloads of sand and slaves of course to do the digging and the other heavy work then we start tomorrow esk kar said staring at the miniature orak studying where the wall ended and the marshland began it looked remarkably like what hed envisioned from the hillside only a few days ago you must show this to nicar and the families he will be pleased im sure esk kar turned to sisuthros and gripped his subcommanders arm sisuthros you see what must be done a strong hand will be needed to make sure the lumber arrives the stones moved the bricks made both slaves and villagers must be pressed into work as soon as corio is ready and kept at it until they drop from exhaustion everyone must do his share even the women and children there must be no villagers hiding in their huts while others labor ill give you ten soldiers to start it will be a difficult task but im sure you can accomplish it sisuthros nodded fascinated by the model and now eager to undertake the assignment hed questioned only this morning ill do it captain it will be worth it to see the faces of the barbarians when they see corios wall blocking their path come there is more follow me corio went outdoors then along the side of the courtyard two apprentices waited there these boys built a model of the wall so that you can get an idea of the scale youll be using using common river mud the boys had built a wall about three feet high and four feet in length at the front side dirt had been scooped out to represent the ditch on the back of the wall a platform made of wood rose almost as high as the wall itself corio squatted down and pointed to a doll the figure held a tiny wooden sword on high and had been positioned in the ditch before the wall thats how high a man will be standing before the wall theyll need long ladders to reach the top he shifted his position to the other side of the wall inside the wall will be braced every twenty feet by a support wall which will also carry the weight of the fighting platform that platform which we call a parapet will be built of rough planks and will be four feet lower than the wall and ten feet across that should be wide enough to allow men to pull a bow or swing a sword or even for some to move along the wall as others fi ght esk kar joined corio squatting down beside him how high will the parapet be inside the village esk kar wondered how he was going to get men up and down so that they could fight another detail he hadnt thought about before one of the apprentices giggled apparently at esk kars ignorance and received a sharp smack across his arm from the measuring ruler corio still carried keep your mouth still boy corio looked annoyed clearly embarrassed by this flaw in his presentation all of corios staff must have been warned not to laugh or say anything should any of the ignorant soldiers particularly their barbarian captain fail to understand what they saw or be unable to do a simple sum in their heads but sisuthros had the same question yes master corio how high will it be well need to move men up and down very rapidly and theyll be carrying heavy loads and well need clear space at the base so men can move quickly from one point to another the parapet will be ten feet high we will put wooden ramps or steps inside so your men may mount the wall we can use lifting poles to haul heavy stones to the top so that you can hurl them down at the attackers not wooden ramps corio esk kar commented at least not anything that will burn easily well be getting fire arrows shot over the wall i want nothing nearby that can burn or even make smoke fire was always a major hazard in the village even in the best of times the walls of the huts might be made of river mud but their roofs could be any combination of cloth wood or straw and most burned easily cooking fires set roofs ablaze often enough during the siege if the villagers detected smoke many would panic the defenders would have to be prepared for fi re and smoke esk kar decided yet one more detail to think about a good point corio conceded well build everything using as little wood as possible master corio if i may trella began perhaps we can coat anything inside the walls that might burn with a layer of mud and we can have women and old men standing by with water buckets to fi ght any fi res that break out but besides fire arrows wont there be many arrows shot over the wall into the village itself trellas right sisuthros agreed arrows will be landing everywhere we may need to shelter some of the ground just inside the wall it may be safest right under the wall corio nodded thoughtfully there will be many such things to consider in the next few weeks he stood up and turned to esk kar esk kar rose with him ill work with sisuthros starting tomorrow corios eyes looked directly into esk kars well give you your wall captain now you must make sure you have the men to defend it five days later much had changed esk kar and trella had moved into drigos house the lower story of the spacious home contained five good sized chambers in addition to a large central space that could be used for meeting or dining and a separate area for cooking the upper fl oor which esk kar took for himself and trella held only two large rooms one for sleeping and one for working with all that extra space esk kar provided quarters for bantor and jalen bantor had a wife and a daughter of eight seasons after meeting bantors wife trella hired mother and daughter to help run the house bantors family was more than grateful to get out of their wretched hut all bantor could afford a clerk provided by the noble nestor and skilled in writing the symbols arrived the morning after esk kar and trella moved in the clerk kept track of expenses but returned to nestors house each night where he no doubt reported everything of interest gatuss two boys and their friends began spending their days at the new headquarters and right away became runners relaying messages at esk kars or the subcommanders need nicar contributed an older woman slave as a cook hed planned to put her on the auction block but she would have fetched little instead he made her a gift to esk kar the grateful slave took over the cooking and soon esk kar and trella began to enjoy bread and vegetables fresh from the market to go with the occasional chicken to men used to communal living in the filthy and crowded barracks the house seemed vast and luxurious but esk kar knew that soon more commanders would be eating and sleeping there meanwhile he ordered each commander to sleep three nights in a row in ariamuss quarters this would keep them close to the men not only to keep an eye on the soldiers but also to stay aware of what they thought and felt the main house had a smaller single story building adjoining it where drigo housed his guards and slaves it had five separate rooms each large enough for four or five men esk kar decided to keep a force of ten soldiers near him at all times should the villagers or even the families grow troublesome he had to put men there anyway since the old barracks could at best provide beds for fifty men gatus helped pick the ten soldiers making sure only the steadiest and most reliable men moved into esk kars quarters esk kar and trella began to settle into a routine each day he trained until midmorning with his men after a brief break to wash up he met with his four subcommanders and trella to plan the rest of the day they gathered in what had been drigos workroom the large room outside eskkars bedroom and sanctuary while nicar had stripped the house of most of its furnishings no one had wanted the workrooms two tables esk kar purchased them at a good price he used the smaller one as his private work table while the other easily accommodated esk kars meetings with his four subcommanders at the initial session esk kar had spoken first according to the custom afterward trella suggested he allow the others to speak first by doing so he would not be contradicted by facts or new information he didnt have when he spoke she added he didnt need to impress his men with his authority esk kar saw the wisdom in her suggestion so the next morning he let gatus begin the target range has been completed gatus announced since sisuthros wanted some building materials and we needed the space we tore down almost all the huts on the northeast side of the palisade we set up a range of up to three hundred paces right up to the rivers edge and the training most of the soldiers could bend a decent bow but these men needed to train others that required better than average archery skills plus the knowledge of how to teach others theyre doing well but slower than id like i wont trust the best of them on their own for another week at least gatus went on to the next topic in the last few days weve taken in forty recruits when i reached that number i stopped accepting new men at least until weve got these other men trained gatus we need men as soon as possible so move them along as quickly as you can esk kar said but i dont want half trained men strutting around orak carrying weapons or fools killing themselves or some villager how long before you can take more men at least two weeks maybe longer gatuss words brooked no argument after that well be able to take in another forty or fifty tevana already supplies us with target arrows though he has requested four tons of bronze plus a new forge and a dozen other wood and metal working tools i think master tevana wants to make sure he never has to buy anything again esk kar grimaced at that but nothing could stop tevana or other craftsmen from taking advantage of the situation if orak survived many tradesmen would profit handsomely by their dealings with esk kar and nicar and thanks to trella gatus continued with a smile we now have plenty of bows to work with good ones too tell them trella all eyes turned to trella she sat to esk kars left and always a little away from the table when i went to work with rufus at his home i said i was ignorant of the bowmaking process and asked him to show me everything at first he resisted but finally he took me to the room where the bows were shaped and assembled and the glues were prepared i saw the tubs where they soaked the wood and the presses where the wet shafts were bent but i never saw any finished bows after i finished i went to gatus he brought some men and we searched the house in a tiny attic above the bowmasters sleeping chamber we found the drying and storage room inside were twenty two finished bows ready for use i told gatus to take them since rufus had denied having any inventory i told him there would be no payment he wasnt happy gatus laughed at that no not a bit he started to scream at trella his sons were quick to restrain him good thing too or i wouldve knocked the old fool down make sure the tale is told throughout the village esk kar said laughing as well though hed already heard the story it may persuade others to be more honest and keep training the men gatus archery first then sword and spear practice everything from behind a wall if you can sisuthros how goes our wall captain im worried sisuthros answered gloomily for the last five days corio and his helpers have been digging small holes in the ground driving stakes here and there and mixing batches of mud and straw there are many meetings with his apprentices where they talk and talk the masons are working from dawn to dusk making bricks but corio has yet to lay one brick on another though he seems busy enough i asked when hed begin but soon was all he said esk kar frowned what have you done for him weve confiscated lumber and tools and set up three different work crews i also cleared some land near where the new gate will be but thats all that has happened so far master do not be concerned yet trella offered ive watched houses built and theres much talking and preparation before the actual construction begins its always this way at the beginning much confusion and seemingly little progress better to have them certain of what they must do than to begin wrong and have to start over well lets hope so for our sakes esk kar shook his head though id like the wall finished at least a day or two before the barbarians arrive he turned to bantor and the guards at the gates bantors duty had turned into the busiest of all larger numbers of people came into and out of the village and traffic on the road had increased to match already hed stopped two fights at the gate involving people trying to leave the second struggle had nearly overwhelmed the gatekeepers esk kar had to assign additional men and now four men guarded both gates at all times we search every cart and wagon that leaves orak bantor answered no slaves or tools of value have left and we make sure that no villager on nicars list leaves without his approval he looked around the table captain the men are growing tired of guarding the gate they complain they train for ten or twelve hours a day then stand a four hour watch at the gate or patrolling the streets bantor i know the duty is hard right now tell the men its only for a few more weeks until the recruits are trained not that esk kar believed it any slack time created by the new recruits would likely be used up somewhere else you can lead them in this bantor treat yourself no better than they and your men will endure it because you do bantor nodded then sat back relieved to know his commander understood his problems trella leaned forward again bantor has anyone tried to bribe your men to get out of orak if not they will soon some rich tradesman or merchant will offer your men gold and the temptation will be great like rufus you mean gatus said with a laugh im sure hes planning it as we speak esk kar hadnt considered that possibility though of course he should have thought of something so obvious he sat thinking about what he would do if he were a rich merchant who wanted a few underpaid guardsmen to look the other way bantor tell your men that anyone offered a bribe is to accept it once he has it in his hand then hes to report it and you will double it no matter how much the bribe well double it where will this additional gold come from sisuthros asked why from the person who offered the bribe esk kar answered if a man can offer five silver coins then he must have at least another five somewhere this way any man offering a bribe will pay twice and still be kept in orak bantor tell your men if they can keep it to themselves it may give them some incentive for their labors a few may get some extra pay before the word gets out they all smiled at that everyone could picture the look of consternation on some merchants face when he found out hed been swindled esk kar turned to jalen and listened to him report about the condition of the docks for a few moments then held up his hand to interrupt jalen you havent been given any tasks of importance this week because ive got something special for you i want you to take four men good riders and the five best horses in the village then i want you to ride north and find the barbarians i want to know where they are and when we can expect them to reach orak youre the best horseman in orak esk kar went on and youve seen the barbarians in action we need to know as much as we can about their movements how many alur meriki there are anything you learn would be useful but most of all we need to know how much time we have all eyes turned to jalen the young man looked calm i know this is risky this will be dangerous because if you get too close youll likely end up dead or captured ill do it captain jalen answered though it might be better if i took more men no more men i dont want you fighting i want you scouting and reporting jalen exhaled a long breath but didnt argue how soon do you want me to go leave in the morning esk kar replied spend today picking your men and getting ready each of them will receive ten gold coins when they return in addition to their regular pay and double that for yourself jalen for that much gold most men would risk their lives gladly youll travel light and travel fast and you can only take two experienced soldiers choose the others from the new recruits pick only good horsemen who are steady and will do as you tell them and not get their blood rushing if they see the barbarians esk kar intended that advice as much for jalen as for any men he might pick and the horses take any in the village even from the families didnt drigo have some good horseflesh esk kar slapped the table in irritation for forgetting drigos horses no doubt already appropriated by the families breeding and maintaining a riding horse took plenty of silver coins and only the richest could afford the luxury the soldiers mounts provided grudgingly by the nobles were mostly inferior animals used for local patrols or as pack animals those horses must be around somewhere well find them but remember jalen your task is to get information not fight i want you back here alive not with your head on some warriors lance if you think fit send two men back early to report take a boy as a servant and to ride an extra horse a boy could always be abandoned should the horse be needed trella stood and went to the other table returning with a small leather pouch she removed a light brown cloth and spread it out on the table everyone leaned forward to look then gasped the cloth was a map with details sewn into the material using green blue and red threads the river and orak were clearly marked as were most of the villages in the northern countryside she set a slim wooden needle and two small spools of thread one red and one white on the table you can sew these threads on to indicate what you find and where you find it my master obtained this for you yesterday esk kar didnt mind explaining when i saw corios map it stayed in my thoughts so i went to him and asked if he could make one for me corio told me he got his from noble rebba who had a slave skilled in making such things so i went to rebbas house and convinced him that i needed the slave to work on this it had taken more than polite conversation esk kar had threatened to take the slave by force if the map wasnt completed by this morning i spent an hour with the slave he said a cloth map is easier to carry and use than a papyrus one hell explain certain things to you about the map and show you how to judge the distance between landmarks stay with him jalen until everything is clear in your head now men lets get back to work esk kar said jalen join us for dinner at sunset and we can discuss things im going to visit corio and see how things are progressing he stood up to indicate that the meeting had ended and that another day in the transformation of orak had begun esk kars following was already so routine as to be scarcely noticed by the villagers he traveled with trella and two guards one a seasoned veteran and the other a recruit expected to watch his elder and follow his example with sisuthros leading the way they found corio working outside the main gate leaning over a small table and talking with one of his sons a half dozen slaves and craftsmen surrounded them no one seemed to be doing any building most of the men just stood around tools lay on the ground a few shallow holes had been dug and piles of wood were scattered about not one brick sat atop another good morning corio greeted each of them by name an expansive smile on his face i expected a visit from you captain i fear sisuthros is dissatisfied with our progress we know work such as this takes time corio esk kar replied determined to show the master artisan he understood something about the nature of his craft but i wanted to see whats been done and get some idea of when the wall is likely to be finished actually esk kar we are almost ready to begin come ill show you he walked toward the north stopping in front of a shallow trench esk kar estimated the hole to be four feet wide six feet long and three feet deep this is the start of the wall well dig it down a little deeper to make sure the base is solid and we will layer the base with stones then sun dried bricks of mud and straw will form two walls and well fill in the center with dirt stones and upright bricks to add strength well add the dirt slowly and tamp it down tightly as we go some bricks will be placed inside at angles to the face of the wall to give it additional strength that way the wall will be solid enough even though it will only have bricks on the front and back naturally if we had more time we would make the wall deeper taller and thicker corio spoke to his son who ran off and returned in a moment carrying a heavy mud brick with a few strands of straw sticking out of it this is the brick we will use about eighteen inches long six inches wide and four inches deep it looked quite heavy esk kar started to take it from the boy but corio spoke first captain if you hold the brick do not grasp it by the ends it might break in half hold it from underneath and support its weight esk kar took the brick as instructed surprised at its weight he handed it to sisuthros who hefted the brick before giving it back to the boy who took it and carefully laid it flat in the bottom of the hole then ran off to fetch a second brick when he returned he placed the second brick in a straight line with the first one leaving a finger sized gap between the two he raced off to fetch another while corio explained further the bricks are placed thus in the hole then covered with a thin layer of wet mud and sand then a third brick is placed atop the middle of the first two then we add more mud and repeat the process the wall grows out of the earth and becomes stronger as the mud and sand dry around the bricks then we smooth the outer face of the wall with a different mixture of sand and mud which will also harden quite well master corio began sisuthros poking at the bricks with his foot it doesnt seem very strong isnt it just mud i mean wont the barbarians just be able to push it down esk kar thought much the same thing but hed learned not to ask the obvious questions nevertheless he felt relieved sisuthros had voiced his doubts sisuthros the wall will be strong enough to protect your men and give them a fighting platform it wont be easily climbed or torn down but if they bring tools to dig at the wall or a ram to try and punch through it then the wall wont stand for very long to make the wall strong enough to resist tools or a determined assault of that kind would take more time than we have master builder esk kar said your task is to build the wall ours to defend it he turned to sisuthros if we allow the barbarians time to stand before the wall and dig at it with shovels and axes then well be lost if we give them that much time no we must kill any of them that make it to the ditch or to the base of the wall corio thought about esk kars words for a moment the wall will not yield easily and the packed dirt will be difficult to dislodge but if enough men with the right tools attack the base of the wall then in twenty or thirty minutes hard work they could make a small breach less time than that esk kar thought knowing corio had never witnessed the ferocious energy of the steppes people at war well not give them even ten minutes corio just make sure the wall doesnt fall down he looked at trella to see if she had anything to add master builder she began if you think it a good idea perhaps you could build a small section one that esk kar and his men could pretend to attack to see how long it would take them to break it apart what they learn might help you in your designs corio rubbed his chin as he considered her words an excellent suggestion trella ive never tried to tear down anything ive built were almost ready to begin anyway so we will construct for you a ten or twenty foot section of wall wherever you desire and how long before we see an actual wall standing before us eskkar asked they still needed to know if it could be done in time but that question didnt seem to worry corio very much return in ten days and youll see the first section of the wall completed he answered right now its more important for you to make sure that all the supplies and men that i require are delivered then i go to attend to my task esk kar gave a formal bow to corio and i leave you and sisuthros to yours esk kar walked away with trella at his side ignoring the custom of having the slave walk behind the master well what did you think corio is sure he can complete the wall in time unless something unexpected occurs but i dont think he gave much thought to how strong the wall would actually be hell think about it now and im sure he will make the base of the wall stronger than hed planned at least at the places you say the barbarians will attack she gave him a smile so master you have done well this day corio will build you a fighting wall not a house wall esk kar laughed then put his arm around her giving her a hearty squeeze and a slap on her backside ignoring the looks and smiles from the people in the lane well then tonight you will have to work extra hard to make sure your master is rewarded for his quick thinking when their lovemaking ended and esk kar slept trella lay in the crook of his arm she had to force her thoughts away from the warm glow of their passion but she finally cleared her mind and thought about her future the coming months would require long hours of hard work she knew shed be busy enough helping esk kar manage the details of the defense to make sure no key item was forgotten but all the coordination and planning for the attack would be only background to the real struggle that lay ahead her few days with esk kar had convinced her somewhat to her surprise that her master possessed many good qualities and more wits than many gave him credit he had proven capable and resourceful uneducated and rough he might be but he had a personal code of honor that had won her respect and then her heart esk kar had convinced nicar then the soldiers and finally the rest of the villagers he could defend orak and now even she believed in him give him the men and supplies make sure that nothing is overlooked and every detail well planned and he would have an even chance against the barbarians and so she promised herself that she would do everything she could to give him that chance nevertheless trella knew that even a successful defense of orak would not guarantee esk kar would survive the moment the threat disappeared the nobles and the leading merchants would remember drigos destruction and how much gold esk kar had cost them theyd want to eliminate or remove the upstart captain of the guard the nobles considered themselves too clever too wealthy and too powerful to submit to the rule of an outsider like esk kar even less would they want someone like him to share in their rule a constant reminder of what they owed to him so while his dream of joining the nobles might be possible it seemed doubtful that he a barbarian himself could long survive in that group no theyd find a way to get rid of him and that now included her as well theyd remember she had provoked drigo that she had given esk kar the help he needed to win over the merchants and most of all that shed been a slave her fate was bound up with her masters and just as sealed even if she survived even if she were not kept as a slave shed be given in marriage to some minor son who would keep her in his household a mere plaything or a source of children locked away from everything and everyone and soon forgotten thus esk kar might win the battle but lose the victory so that must be where her true efforts should go all her wits and resources committed to making sure that esk kar and she retained the fruits of their victory not only would it prove difficult she must do it quietly so quietly that nobody knew what she was about even esk kar for now was better off knowing nothing of her activities knowledge would be the key to know everything that went on in orak would be her goal and already she had several ideas about how to begin that task today as they walked hand in hand through the village streets shed seen how the people looked at her the slave girl who walked side by side with her master the slave whod surely cast a spell on the tall soldier the slave who had brought down the house of drigo the slave who attended the councils of the nobles those looks had reinforced her own assessment tomorrow shed begin winning over the common people starting with the women once shed swayed them to her side she would use them to gather information she would win allies and friends from among the villagers especially the new ones that would flock to orak in the next few months the landless and friendless ones who would have little loyalty to the nobles or the wealthy merchants that started a new train of thought and she shifted her body slightly the small movement causing esk kar to turn on his side but not to wake from his slumber she smiled as she thought about herself and esk karthe barbarian soldier and the educated slave everyone in the village thought shed bewitched him used magic or potions to turn him into a leader of men even nicar half believed it perhaps that could be another ally let all of them think she had the gift of power over men her wits were sharp she knew sharp enough to see quickly and easily many things that others saw only slowly or not at all the common people would be one of the keys to power in the new orak she decided a strong balance against the might and money of the nobles well she would find a way to win the hearts of the crowd she already had piqued their interest a good first step yes that was the way to power and security for herself and her lover she smiled in the darkness and turned on her side her arm crossing his body as she pulled herself close to him and fell asleep almost at once feeling safe in his arms the next four weeks passed quickly for esk kar who started every morning before the sun rose and climbed exhausted into bed at night each day brought some new crisis or an unexpected setback but the first group of recruits had joined the ranks and another group of forty had started at last bantor and gatus had enough soldiers to man the gates the docks and the lanes allowing esk kar the luxury of sending out local patrols their reports confirmed men were converging on orak some looked for a chance to fight the barbarians others simply sought refuge or a place of safety to bring their families more arrived each day and as many came to stay as had left bantors men stopped everyone at the gate where the arriving refugees learned they could either fight dig or move on only traders with their caravans and goods passed freely into orak patrols walked the village each day to make sure every man performed his assigned work task slackers received only one warning at the second offense esk kar simply ordered them out of the village forcing them to leave behind anything of value to the defense one foolish craftsman had resisted the order and drawn a knife bantor killed the man his death was less than a pebble thrown into the great river but the villagers rich and poor understood the warning since then no one tried to leave the village by force all those who remained worked on the wall adding their sweat and blood to the sand stones and mud that comprised it the wall it became the focal point of everyones lives and the main theme of conversation the fi rst topic of discussion centered around the backbreaking labor as men toiled under heavy loads of earth bricks or stones nicar corio and the village elders walked the construction area each day encouraging slaves and freemen to keep up their efforts sisuthross soldiers made sure everyone did their fair share of the work adding their own muscles to the toil and using the whip only to deal with slackers men labored and sweated and the wall began to grow out of the earth but it grew slowly as if resisting the efforts of impatient men to lift it from the dust the soldiers training was the next subject of discussion as hard as the villagers labored to build the wall so did esk kars men sweat in their brutal training cursing their drillmasters as they first hardened their bodies then learned how to use their weapons they trained in the shadow of the new wall as they tested their archery from makeshift platforms use of the bow took first place in the training for at least three hours every day each group of soldiers devoted their time to archery they fired hundreds of arrows daily until their fingers ran red with blood and muscles trembled from the strain when they finished with the bow they learned to fight with sword spear and axe practicing from the makeshift walls days end brought them no respite for esk kar still needed soldiers to guard the gates and the docks patrol the village and enforce discipline on the work crews everyone complained but to no effect as their commanders labored as hard as their men the third topic which was usually the most interesting was the captain of the guard and his female slave few villagers had known or noticed esk kar before nicar appointed him captain those who recalled him from those days admitted hed changed still aloof and rarely smiling he now stood out from other men as he strode about the village everyone deferred to him everyone looked to him to defend orak and save them from the barbarians all watched him carefully each day searching for the slightest sign of fear or doubt but he gave no such sign and each day the wall grew a few feet longer the soldiers trained a little harder and gradually the villagers began to believe they might survive if esk kar made for poor conversation trella was another matter as she went about her duties or accompanied her master everyone found something to say about the slave girl whod cast a spell on the soldier defying custom she walked at esk kars side and he often put his arm around her letting everyone see how much she meant to him the village women began to respect her and their men soon grew as awed as their wives trella showed wisdom beyond her seasons and her voice commanded attention in the councils she seemed to radiate a power over men and women and now many sought her advice as she passed through the streets nevertheless at each days end the tired villagers wondered whether there would be enough soldiers to defend orak and the soldiers worried if the laborers could complete the wall in time esk kar threw himself into the effort as if by hard work he could single handedly guarantee success his daily training soon made him the most proficient swordsman in the village but many a time esk kar found himself knocked to the dirt by some especially skillful or lucky opponent the men always cheered at that and esk kar learned to nod approval to his challenger though it seldom happened twice several times each week esk kar took a horse and rode the countryside around orak studying the land while he practiced his horsemanship each day brought some new bruise or scrape and each night trella would massage her masters stiff muscles trella worked just as tirelessly she took charge of all the weaponry and supplies needed by the soldiers she met daily with rufus and tevana coordinating their needs and doing the same for those making the spears shields and axes she spent an entire day with esk kar and gatus learning everything about the mens weaponry and clothing they showed her the leather vests caps and wrist guards they wanted for the archers since bowmen standing atop the wall would be exposed from the waist up leather armor would provide a great deal of protection while the vest would not stop an alur meriki arrow at close range it would certainly save some lives trella did the same with the other weapons gatus showed her the kind of short sword spear and axe that he wanted demonstrated how each would be used and taught her how to judge their quality she noticed esk kar listened intently to gatus the old soldier knew his weapons and knew what he wanted soon trella knew all she needed to know in order to deal with merchants and traders gatus would inspect and accept each new weapon but the haggling over prices and delivery schedules were off his shoulders trella made sure all the weapons and supplies arrived on time even as she kept track of the gold needed by taking care of the logistics she allowed esk kar to concentrate on the recruiting training and organizing of the men it also gave him more time to meet with nicar corio and the rest of the noble families at the end of each week she spent a day with nicars clerks going over the accounts and making sure no merchant received payment for something not delivered it took trella only a few days to discover how much silver the previous captain had stolen by purchasing poor quality food and as little of that as possible honest bargaining with the farmers as esk kars representative made sure that sufficient and wholesome fare arrived regularly and at a reasonable price for the first time the soldiers had decent food to eat and enough of it to maintain them through their strenuous training fresh bread and vegetables complimented the lamb and chicken the soldiers normally ate trella dealt directly with the farmers who supplied the food and added a staff of cooks to prepare the meals for that alone the soldiers would have loved her but she did even more using esk kars gold she paid a few copper coins to those willing to clean out the barracks and the grounds around them after a few days even the malodorous barracks smelled and looked cleaner not satisfied with her accomplishments trella looked for other opportunities to expand her influence the first such she found involved working with nicar and nestor on the housing problem by nicars order anyone leaving orak forfeited their house and any belongings left behind this policy forced any villagers who thought of leaving to make a hard choice if the village survived and they returned their homes would be gone given to someone else or they could stay and fi ght nevertheless many left orak and those who remained clamored for even the humblest of the abandoned houses and huts working with the clerks trella inventoried each hut and home and recommended new owners favoring those who could best help orak she argued skillfully forcing the clerks to abandon their plans of helping friends or those willing to pay trella focused on those who had the skills needed for the villages defense if they possessed those skills and were willing to stay and work trella would present their case only once did she have to involve esk kar the clerks wanted to give an empty home to a wine merchant while trella insisted that the dwelling be given to a family of five that included a father and two grown sons willing to fight esk kar lost his temper and threatened to have every clerk run out of the village trella had to plead with him not to go to nicar after that she had no more problems with the clerks with each day that passed esk kar and trellas lives became more entwined with the fate of orakand the fate of orak depended on the wall everyone who could worked on the wall fight dig or move on no other choice existed for anyone hoping to remain in orak esk kar made that decision backed by nicar the soldiers swords enforced it everyone labored in oraks defense including the members of the families no work on anything else was permitted unless approved by nicar and esk kar those caught away from their tasks received some punishment and esk kar would make no exceptions for the sons of the families though he did allow them to be assigned lighter duties than digging or rock carrying as long as they performed their duties well gatus sent more men out to patrol the roads and to keep bandits and robbers from attacking those bringing goods to orak sisuthros now had twenty men to make sure those working on the wall put their backs into it while corio directed a workforce of over four hundred men and boys and even women and old men the master builder walked back and forth among the workers driving himself and his apprentices as hard as any laborer slaves and free villagers alike worked all covered with dust and mud except those who gathered rocks from the river and could occasionally wash themselves clean each evening their work completed villagers came to stare at the wall which grew longer and longer each day the wall now extended one hundred feet on both sides of where the new gate would be each side grew at least twenty feet every day arms spreading themselves wide to encompass all of orak corios oldest son alcinor directed the construction of the main gate it would be made of heavy beams carefully shaped and closely joined by the carpenters all fire hardened to resist flame arrows and reinforced with wide bronze strips inside the gate holes were lined with stones for the bracing logs that would reinforce the structure when closed underneath the gate a trench six feet wide and ten feet deep had already been dug this pit would be completely filled with heavy stones and packed with the usual mud and straw mix creating a solid foundation that would frustrate any attempts to dig under the structure soon the gate would be functional though not fully completed and would enclose the new extended boundaries of the village each day more than a dozen boats arrived carrying timber of all types and sizes finished tools weapons and leather goods came by land and by river food and wine disembarked as well to help swell oraks storehouses for the siege word had gone out throughout the countryside as well as up and down the great river and other villages proved eager either to assist in resisting the barbarians or simply to make a profit boats filled with costly copper and tin arrived regularly desperately needed by the bronze workers for dozens of items the ores were in short supply and difficult to obtain the mines lay many miles distant and produced only a small output from their pits each day since only slaves could be forced to labor in them for some mysterious reason slaves died quickly in the mines few of them lasting more than six months esk kar learned this was why it took so much gold and silver to buy copper and tin but esk kar demanded bronze weapons and only these ores could be turned into the lustrous metal and so nicars gold kept flowing oraks smiths labored from dawn to dusk transmuting the raw ores into gleaming bronze weapons and tools timber from the north ranked as the second most important cargo as wood was needed not only for the gate but to reinforce the walls and parapets to make shields for the soldiers and even as firewood for the forges other ships brought the first deliveries of weaponsfinished swords spears and even bows and arrows in addition to those made in orak the boats used by the rivers sailors were small propelled by a few oars and perhaps a tiny sail and they couldnt carry much cargo but more arrived daily as word about oraks needs continued to spread throughout the land each boat captain rushed to unload his vessel take on his trade goods or payment and return whence he came for another consignment the dockmaster permitted no other cargoes to land except for food and wine though esk kar had no doubt other goods somehow managed to smuggle their way inside a large market had sprouted at the docks where traders bought and sold the ships contents each day the families of decca and rebba took responsibility for that function buying and selling and making sure the prices stayed reasonable esk kar didnt trust any of the families certain that if they had the opportunity they would steal from the village to guard against that nicar and his clerks assisted as well checking the accounts and watching the cargo manifests it seemed to be working since every merchant and shipmaster complained of being robbed while the families shouted that they were being reduced to poverty but the trading never stopped and each day the boats continued to arrive and depart gatus trained the men hard each day he and esk kar argued for a full day before esk kar gave his approval to gatuss novel ideas the old soldier wanted to train the men to fight in units of ten esk kar had never heard of such a thing before nor had any of the men but gatus fought hard for his ideas declaring the archers would be more effective if they fought this way and that foot soldiers could support each other in battle esk kar eventually agreed since there would soon be so many men under arms that some organization would be needed just to control them as soon as gatus began his new regimen esk kar saw the benefitsthe mens morale improved along with their effectiveness veterans had four hours of training either at sunup or an hour past noon when they finished training they worked for sisuthros or bantor or taught the new recruits who trained all day long the training for the new men was even harder because they needed to be physically fit in order to fight well in exchanging sword strokes the weaker man or the one who tired first usually died and esk kar wanted men who could fight and kill for hours if need be so gatus made them run holding heavy logs over their heads until they staggered and fell then put swords in their trembling hands and made them hack at the posts until their hands blistered and bled before hardening into calluses sometimes the men formed ranks and marched with their shields and spears holding the heavy weapon aloft to strengthen arm muscles then thirsty shaken and exhausted they stood at the archery range and shot arrows until each man hit his target fifty times no matter how many arrows it took gatus and his men watched to make sure each man drew the shaft fully and aimed it properly wooden rods awaited any that shirked and each day the targets moved a few feet farther back until after three weeks of training even the newest recruits could hit the mark at sixty paces five times out of six when the men finished their session they rested by retrieving the target arrows from the butts and preparing them for the next group bowstrings had to be checked and replaced as needed a well made bowstring would launch between two and three hundred arrows before breaking or stretching and it took the effort of a dozen women working all day to weave and braid the coarse flax into suitable bowstrings esk kar did his part as well first training with regular men then working with the recruits the new men felt proud knowing their captain didnt think himself too haughty to sweat with them for a few hours each day it made the training more bearable for them as did his encouragements you miserable dogs he shouted at them i want you to be more afraid of gatus and me than any barbarian and each day a few villagers mostly old women and children came to watch the training and cheer the men on esk kar permitted this so everyone would know the soldiers worked as hard as those straining at their loads of dirt and rock trella constantly reminded esk kar that he must befriend the villagers make them aware of what he did for them and change them into his supporters your strength she reminded him lies in making sure the people believe you are defending them not just the rich merchants so he forced himself to say a few words of encouragement or a simple hello to the villagers each day esk kar felt strange doing it but he soon grew used to it he now trusted trella completely if she believed something was important then esk kar would do it even if he didnt understand why amazingly all of it was working the mood of the soldiers and recruits stayed positive reinforced by the steady progress of the wall as it slowly crept across the face of orak it grew at least twenty feet each day and corio promised more as the workers skills improved esk kars body had hardened once again and he made sure that he grunted under the logs with the weakest men to build his own strength if they could keep up this pace and the barbarians didnt arrive before the walls completion the whole plan might work esk kar had never thought villagers could be trained well enough to beat barbarians one on one but now seeing their progress he began to think differently men had been trained as soldiers before but never under the threat of a barbarian migration gatus and the other commanders became more experienced and efficient in their training methods if the villagers could fight the barbarians on their terms if the barbarians did what esk kar expected if they didnt come too early if if if each night in bed esk kar whispered his doubts and worries to trella he whod never shared his thoughts with anyone in his life talked openly to trella who reassured him if she could or held him tight when she couldnt their lovemaking became less frequent but more intense as if they shared a burden that threatened to overwhelm them each day esk kar learned something new looked at someone or something differently gained a new insight or made some mistake each day brought a dozen different decisions a dozen situations for which he had no experience he had no sympathy for his commanders when they erred and he was harder on himself the worst of his errors were those he was unaware of those trella or somebody else pointed out to him were bitter in his mouth he forced himself to listen to trellas explanations silently vowing never to repeat the same mistake again nothing in esk kars life had prepared him for this situation and more than once he considered leaving it all behind taking a horse and just riding off but always the thought of trella kept him to his task he now wanted the future she foresaw he also knew that slowly subtly he was changing learning to think before he spoke to consider before he acted and most of all to listen to and take the advice of others somehow he knew the gods had linked his fate to hers and that both of them would face whatever future the barbarians brought to orak and each day the wall continued to grow those same weeks passed even faster for trella who set for herself an even more diffi cult task one she could not go about openly that task began after theyd moved into drigos house as soon as she finished her morning duties trella spent two or three hours walking through the village accompanied always by a guard and dressed in the old shift shed worn in nicars house she talked to the women at the market helped with their laundry at the river even visited with the women working in the fields or on the wall she did more than visit her own labors at the wall were as strenuous as any mans though she seldom worked more than a few hours she carried stones and bricks or dug in the trenches along with the other women the first time corio noticed her working he tried to get her to stop she refused saying what she did was little enough compared to the other women even that first day groups of curious women gathered wherever she went eager to speak to her and as eager to offer advice after the first week bantors wife annok sur began to accompany her a plain practical woman a few seasons younger than esk kar annok sur showed she had the skills and experience needed to manage a large household the two soon transformed the former house of drigo not only into a home for esk kar and his men but into a planning center for oraks defense between them they organized the servants assigned the days tasks and established a routine that began to run itself despite their age difference they became friends trella sat at a small table in her bedroom while annok sur combed trellas hair neither of them thought it the least bit strange for a free woman to comb the hair of a slave mistress trella annok sur said keeping her voice low out of habit though they were alone on the second floor your walks among the villagers have become the high point of the day for many of them they stop whatever theyre doing and wait for you to pass by disappointed if you choose another street i like to meet with people annok sur there is much to learn from them about orak perhaps youre teaching them more than they realize so many of them ask for your advice or help and you give many of them copper coins why are you so generous to everyone trella countered with a question of her own youve been married to bantor for a long time its a hard life isnt it being the wife of a soldier very hard mistress my fi rst two children died one in childbirth and one a few months later only ningal our daughter has survived she sighed bantor is a good man who works hard but sometimes he is a little slow of thought until esk kar promoted him we had very little and no hope of improvement there were many bitter things i had to do to help bantor and ningal survive things better left unspoken trella thought but now life is better is it not yes for now but after the barbarians are defeated then i fear the hard times will come again you are certain that well defeat them no of course not i know how strong they are but if our men fail then it wont matter if were not killed out of hand you and i will become slaves in some warriors tent taken and beaten at his pleasure no what i fear most is growing old with only a soldiers pay with no dowry to find ningal a good husband since esk kar became captain my husbands future seems blessed by the gods bantor is very loyal we both know what esk kar has done for him trella reached up and touched annok surs hand taking the comb from her and turning to face her i too am the woman of a soldier and i have the same fear as you annok sur that when the barbarians are driven off things will return to the old ways esk kar is powerful now but when orak is no longer threatened then perhaps the nobles will not need so strong a captain of the guard perhaps they will not need so many soldiers either especially those they did not raise up themselves so this is why you walk through the village mistress to gain the friendship of the people their friendship wont be enough to protect your master theres much more i want from the villagers and theres much you can do to help me if you choose such help would not be forgotten in the future annok sur i will help you gladly trella you wont be a slave for long everyone knows that no you will be a great lady in orak and esk kar will found a great house and as he rises so may bantor then there is much to be done to ensure that future we must use the people to help secure orak after the barbarians are defeated the villagers must bind themselves to esk kar and his future so that one cannot be without the other there must be no return to the old ways you see a way to make this happen the nobles would not like to hear of such things no they wouldnt there would be much danger in fact trella said nothing further just waited while annok sur considered i dont wish to return to the old ways tell me what i can do to help you trella spoke of her plans when she finished the older woman took her hand once again and squeezed it it can be done trella we can make these things happen ill do whatever is needed help me annok sur and you will have a great house of your own someday i promise it more weeks passed with esk kar too busy to notice trellas quiet maneuverings or to care about them if he did instead he worried about jalen almost three weeks overdue esk kar feared not only had he lost a capable commander but that he lacked any information about the barbarians progress or location an even gloomier thought troubled himif theyd captured and tortured jalen the alur meriki would know all about esk kars plans he didnt want them sending a raiding party early before they fi nished the wall whatever jalens fate esk kar needed to send out another patrol one hed lead himself the barbarians must be located and he didnt trust anyone else to do it men continued to arrive with stories of barbarian hordes only a few paces behind them but almost all their sightings had no value as each day passed esk kar worked harder to appear confident more than two months had elapsed since esk kar became captain of the guard each day he met with corio and sisuthros to talk about the walls progress their work proceeded smoothly and esk kar had no doubt the wall would be completed in time nevertheless he needed jalens information he decided to wait three more days for jalen then hed lead the second scouting party himself this mornings training had gone poorly esk kars worries distracted him and a sword swung by an eager recruit had struck esk kars head and knocked him to the ground if the blade had been bronze instead of wood hed be dead a few hours after the sun reached its zenith one of bantors messengers found esk kar at corios side inspecting the days progress captain bantor asks you to come to the gate there are travelers there who wish to speak with you tell bantor im on my way esk kar smiled at the grinning youth who dashed off at a run to return with this new message esk kar bade goodbye to corio then followed the path to the main gate where he found bantor and two guards speaking to three strangers as esk kar approached he understood why the travelers stood out from those who wandered into orak these strangers must come from a land far to the north where men had darker beards and hair that contrasted with their lighter skin all were unusually tall and well muscled even their clothing looked odd a mix of leather and somber colors rather than the raw linen or flax shades preferred by those in the surrounding countryside each stranger carried a heavy bow and a fat quiver full of arrows but no sword or axe only a long dagger at each hip a small ass tethered a few steps away rested wearily under its load of packs blankets and cooking utensils no doubt holding all the travelers worldly possessions greetings bantor esk kar nodded to the accompanying guards as well he tried to remember as many of his mens names as he could when he couldnt recall a name he still gave each man some kind of greeting it pleased him to see a simple gesture of recognition made them stand a little straighter greetings captain bantor replied these travelers asked to speak to the leader of the village and i thought it would be better for you to meet them here bantor had learned much in the last few months in the beginning he would probably have directed them to esk kars house and forgotten about them now he kept them under guard until his captain could determine what to do with them esk kar turned to the newcomers easily selecting the oldest and guessing by his age and resemblance that he was the father of the other two greetings im esk kar captain of the guard esk kar was one of the tallest men in orak but he found himself looking straight into the eyes of all three strangers an unusual sensation for him what business brings you here he knew they werent merchants or farmers even the boys the youngest probably no more than fifteen seasons looked hard and capable the elder man bowed slightly to show he considered himself an equal my name is totomes and these are my sons narquil and mitrac weve come south to fight against the alur meriki we may consider fighting with your village if indeed you plan to fight the mans voice had a strong accent and his words came slowly as if he had to translate each thought into words esk kars eyes narrowed not one villager in twenty knew the name of the advancing steppes people most villagers thought all barbarians the same and the fact that a particular clan actually might have a leader with his own name never seemed to occur to them the alur meriki took their name from one of their early leaders though esk kar knew the original alur meriki had been dead for at least a hundred years that these strangers would know such a name seemed unlikely unless they had some encounters with them why do you wish to fight them instead of replying totomes leaned closer to esk kars face staring hard into his eyes before drawing back youre from the steppes yourself captain are you not from what clan do you come esk kar felt his mouth harden at the unexpected question one that few dared ask and he felt tempted to order them out of the village instead he remembered trellas warnings about losing his temper ive been gone from the steppes people for nearly twenty years totomes and here in orak its rude for strangers to ask too many questions now whats your business here our business is to kill as many alur meriki as we can thats why i ask youfrom what clan do you come if you wish to fight go back through the gate and head north i promise youll find all the alur meriki you desire he turned to the men standing behind the strangers keeping his voice calm but firm escort these visitors outside the village and see them on their way the youngest put a hand to his bow though it remained strung across his chest if you touch that bow again boy youll leave here without it as esk kar spoke the guards behind the strangers drew their swords with a rasp and moved apart while bantor stepped to the side and put a hand on his sword totomes spoke sharply to his son in a language strange to esk kars ears and the youth immediately took his hand from the bow shaft my son mitrac still has much to learn about the ways of strangers but i warn you that should anyone try to take one of our bows they will die esk kar kept his voice calm i think you should be on your way before my guards put their swords in your backs or i regret my generosity youll do no killing in orak are you the ruler of orak totomes said his temper flaring that you can threaten those who want to enter your village even though they wish to fight against the barbarians esk kar stared for a moment at totomes these men were hard of head no doubt of that but they looked ready to fight barbarians or anyone else for that matter theyd journeyed through a countryside filled with warriors bandits and thieves and had somehow managed to survive the fact that they were foreign to these lands made that journey more remarkable travelers from distant lands took more risks in their journeys always the first choice of robbers since the victims would have no kin to demand revenge one more reason why most men seldom traveled more than a few miles from where they were born esk kar glanced at the bow the man was carrying it was hard to judge its size stretched diagonally across the mans back but it looked to be a foot longer than the ones esk kars men trained with which might make it a formidable weapon esk kar glanced at the weapons of the two boys their bows were every bit as long as their fathers someone behind him coughed esk kar realize a crowd had formed everyone frozen in place ignoring the hot sun and staring at the men caught up in the sudden tension and expecting to see blood spilled at any moment he decided that such men as these could be useful but harsh words had been spoken and now needed to be undone he wondered what trella would do probably offer them a cup of water or wine well why not he turned to bantor see that care is given to their animal he turned back to totomes follow me without waiting for a reply esk kar turned on his heel and began retracing his steps walking purposefully and moving at a good pace his guard struggled to keep up with him and esk kar resisted the urge to turn around to see whether totomes and his sons were following traveling down the main street of orak he turned left on a smaller lane and almost immediately entered a small tavern one that catered to travelers he paused for a moment letting his eyes accustom themselves to the dim light and he felt his bodyguard bump into him not many customers patronized the alehouse at that hour and the innkeepers largest table stood empty esk kar headed there calling out to the serving girl as he went ale for myself and my companions he sat down facing the door and saw the strangers standing just inside the doorway squinting into the darkness esk kar motioned to his bodyguard sit down and keep your hand off your sword the guard grinned with admiration captain i thought they was going to stick us both in the back esk kar smiled grimly we could use men like these now sit down and keep your mouth shut he kept his voice low as totomes approached the table and stood hesitantly before it looking around the shadowy room are you going to stand there or sit down and drink some ale or arent you thirsty after your travels totomes looked as confused as hed been angry and before he could reply or even sit the serving girl approached carrying five wooden beakers and a large bucket of ale as the men stood there she expertly poured the dark brown brew into the cups i hope girl that this is decent ale esk kar remarked as she finished i wouldnt want my friends to be offended she giggled then looked at him with a provocative smile our finest ale captain in our best cups anything you want anything just ask she smiled at him then gave a quick bow and walked off totomes slipped his bow over his head and placed it lengthwise across the table between himself and esk kar his sons followed his example and sat down on either side of their father the table was scarcely longer than the bows esk kar raised his cup welcome to orak totomes he searched his memory for a moment then added narquil mitrac glad that he had repeated the boys names in his mind when he heard them another trick hed learned from trella my name is esk kar and this is my lazy bodyguard for the day hykros totomes picked up his cup and matched esk kars gesture to orak the five men all drank deeply though esk kar put his cup down first still half full im glad that we left the gate captain i dont like weapons at my back if were going to talk totomes we might as well do it in the shade and with a drink in our hands but if you think youre any better off here than at the gate youre mistaken i can have you driven from orak at any time youve no place to go inside the village where you couldnt be found totomes considered that for a while then nodded i suppose youre right he drank more ale then wiped his mouth with the back of his hand we came here looking for a chance to kill barbarians in the countryside men say orak is planning to resist them though i dont see how thats possible but we decided to come and see for ourselves oh its true enough esk kar leaned back against the rough wall though we may all die in the trying as you saw when you passed through the gate were building a wall around the village when its completed we intend to fight the barbarians from it and kill them with arrows youll need many bowmen for that captain totomes remarked and skillful ones barbarians arent easy to kill even with arrows we should know my sons and i have killed many in the last two years esk kar considered those words if these three had been fighting the steppes people for the last few years and managed to survive they must indeed be capable he picked his words carefully i dont wish to offend totomes but how have you been able to survive so long unless there are more of you somewhere an expression of sadness passed over totomess face our people live far to the north high on the steppe near the great northern sea where the clime is much colder than here an earthquake forced my clan to move south and wed started to build a new home when our camp was attacked by an alur meriki raiding party they killed almost all of us my brother my wife and several children all dead he looked down into his ale cup my sons and i and some others were away exploring in the mountains looking for ores and timber when we returned we saw the barbarians riding away not all of our clan were dead when we arrived many had been tortured and mutilated then left to die my sons watched their mothers slow death totomes glanced at his sons those of us who remained swore a blood oath to take revenge and fourteen of us began to trail the barbarians some of us died fighting them and others have turned back but my sons and i have not yet killed enough to satisfy our oath esk kar nodded in sympathy though it was an old story to him one repeated a hundred times well totomes if you wish to kill barbarians youve come to the right place providing that you can take orders i need as many expert archers as i can fi nd and more than that i need men who can teach others even now were training men to use the bow esk kar glanced down at the bows resting on the table in the dim light they appeared different from any hed ever seen may i examine your bow i dont think ive seen one quite like it that brought smiles to their faces nor are you likely to captain totomes handed him one of the bows theyre a new design that my grandfather created made from the heartwood of a special tree that grows only in certain parts of the steppe the wood closest to the heart of the tree is thicker and stronger than the outer wood so it acts as if two pieces were glued together esk kar examined the bow carefully aware from his experiences with rufus the bowyer that he had just learned a great secret the bow had considerable heft but was not so weighty as he had expected lifting the bow toward the light he saw that it was indeed made from a single piece of wood esk kar knew a bow made from only one piece of wood could not take much stress and certainly could not fire a heavy arrow any great distance the wood on the outer side of the bow had to bend so much farther than the wood on the inner side and so tended to break to solve that problem the bowyers fashioned their war bows from several pieces of wood bent at differing angles joined into a center socket and held together with glue on totomess bow the wood on the inside looked as if it had been dyed but closer inspection revealed only the wood grains normal coloring the bows center had been wrapped with thin cords and leather strips to add strength as well as to provide a better grip putting the bow down he looked at totomes the man took an arrow from his quiver and handed it to esk kar esk kar noted that it was almost three inches longer than the arrows his own men used and so slightly heavier but otherwise seemed no different how far can such a bow fling an arrow like this we can hit whatever we aim at up to two hundred paces with the full weight of the arrow the bow can shoot such a shaft well over five hundred paces weve hit targets at even longer distances a hint of pride sounded in his voice that sounded like boasting to esk kar but he let it pass hitting anything at two hundred paces was fine shooting handing the arrow back to its owner he picked up his ale cup so what are your plans totomes if you wish to stay and fight then youll fight under my command and follow my orders otherwise you may stay a few days in orak to rest and buy what you need before you move on i cannot have fighting men loose in the village all men carrying arms in orak are under my command im the leader of my clan i cannot take orders from others well enough esk kar answered sipping at the last of his ale then in three days you must leave if youre still here ill take your bows and whatever else of value you have and have you driven from the village he stood up hykros did the same you can sleep here in safety and theyll not charge you too much now theyve seen you drinking with me good day totomes esk kar nodded to the two boys and started to walk out totomes rose also captain please stay theres still much i would discuss with you esk kar turned and stared at the man until totomes let his eyes drop you say youre the leader of a clan totomes but your clan is dead or far from here and now you have only these boys following you you say you wish to fight but here in orak we fight the barbarians my way or not at all esk kar let that sink in but continued before totomes could reply if you wish to stay then you pledge yourself to me until the barbarians are defeated and gone or until we are all dead youll obey me in all things as does every other man who fights in my command and youll draw the same pay if you can use those bows as well as you claim youll help train my archers and that will keep you from carrying rocks or digging ditches though youll do that too if need be ive said all that needs to be said choose now totomes stood there pride struggling with his desire for vengeance narquil who looked to be the older of the boys spoke to totomes in his own language they exchanged words and even the younger boy had his say totomes turned back to him i accept your offer captain will you please sit down he asked theres much we would like to know esk kar bowed formally sealing the bargain and returned to his seat the serving girl who had stood there listening to every word rushed back with more ale and poured another round then im glad to have you join our forces totomes and there is much the door flew open with a crash that startled patrons and customers alike everyones hand reached for knife or sword the bright sun illuminating the same messenger whod summoned esk kar earlier captain bantor says come to the gate at once he gasped a moment to catch his breath riders are coming he thinks it may be jalen esk kar bolted upright bumping his head on the low ceiling and started toward the door before he remembered his new recruits hykros take totomes and his sons to gatus tell him we have new instructors for the archers then bring them to my house esk kar ducked under the doorway and began to run the messenger leading the way back to the gate as esk kar reached the gate bantor descended the last steps of the wooden ladder that provided access to the top of the wall a big smile on his face that grew even larger when he saw his captain is it jalen esk kar couldnt keep the excitement out of his voice i think so it looks like his horse at least walking with bantor to the gate he looked down the road and saw a small group of horsemen riding slowly toward them he counted four men only two less than had departed and when they drew closer he noted that the youthful servant had survived though two fighting men obviously had not esk kar stood at the side of the old wooden gate as a group of villagers rushed through a hand took his and he looked down to see trella had joined him how did you hear so quickly he asked putting his arm around her enjoying her touch he looked behind him to make sure her guard was present since his own had been left with the visitors a few of drigos men remained though most had left weeks ago while the danger from drigos followers had lessened the number of villagers who had no kind thoughts for oraks war leader and his hard discipline had increased bantor wasnt sure where youd gone so he sent a messenger back to the house the boy told us about the three archers that you turned your back on and invited to go drinking after they threatened to kill you esk kar laughed it wasnt like that trella theyre interesting folk though no im sure it wasnt she answered tightening her grip on his hand but id like to meet them you will tonight weve just enough room in the small house for three more i think conversation ceased as jalen trotted through the gate in a swirl of dust to the cheers and shouts of the crowd he swung down from his horse stiff from his long ride esk kar found himself hugging his lieutenant pounding him on the back while the villagers called out jalens name gods below jalen id given you up for dead days ago now you ride in as easy as can be come back to my house we can talk there by the gods its good to be back jalen glanced up at the wall his mouth agape at the sight and much has changed since i left he stepped back to his horse and untied a leather pouch from his blanket then followed esk kar and trella as they headed home halfway there they found nicar waiting for them in the street he invited them all to his house saying the other nobles would be coming there as well moments later nicars guests filled his meeting room to capacity with every seat and stool occupied a dozen others stood wherever they could find space all waited for jalen hed stopped to wash up though esk kar knew it would take more than a few moments at the well to remove the smell of horseflesh from body and clothes the room already felt warm from the presence of so many bodies once again esk kar sat at the foot of the table with trella near his side gatus sisuthros and bantor stood behind their captain when jalen entered damp from his washing he wore one of nicars old tunics a garment too large for his frame jalen sat down in the last open seat next to his captain and drank from the wine cup already poured in front of him noble nicar i thank you for your wine and the loan of your tunic mine is not worth saving im afraid whatever you want you have only to ask nicar answered but come were eager for news did you find the barbarians the smile disappeared from jalens face yes i found them and theres much to tell he reached for the leather pouch hed entrusted to his captain jalen removed the cloth map and spread it out on the table torn at the edges and dirty from much handling it had obviously served its purpose well esk kar saw many new threads sewn onto it all heads craned toward the cloth as if its secrets would be clearly visible looks of concern replaced the smiles as they wondered what news they would hear jalen put down his wine and began his tale before wed gone five days we began to hear word about the alur meriki as we went farther north we met people moving west and we learned of raiding parties that ranged far to the northeast to avoid those we traveled closer to the river and there was little activity for another week until we began to encounter many folk moving south trying to stay ahead of the main party many of these people knew of orak and were heading here have any arrived yes more and more are on the roads all coming here esk kar replied some stay if theyre willing to fight or work others camp outside and move on in a few days jalen nodded more will come we continued to ride north for another week and began to see small scouting parties five or ten barbarians we ran south each time they saw us once they chased us for a full day before we lost them thank the gods for our strong horses each time we circled back north again and moved farther away from the river esk kar leaned forward his eyes hard you saw no big raiding parties only scouts they should have encountered at least one large band of warriors yes only scouts we couldnt continue north so we moved east we talked to many travelers and even some bandits the farther east we went the clearer things became jalen drank again from his cup every eye rested upon him the barbarians have a plan the main body of the tribe with at least seven or eight hundred warriors is coming slowly toward us more or less following the river two large raiding bands are ranging far to the south and east of the main body killing everyone in their path or forcing them to head west he put his finger on the map and everyone stood or left his seat to get a closer look the nobles jostling each other dignity forgotten jalen pointed at some red threads here is where the main camp is or was about two weeks ago they travel slowly and stay close to the river the raiding parties range eastward sweeping everyone toward the river again jalen pointed to the map indicating two curved seams of black threads that hooked far to the southeast they ride great distances but always to the east and south though sometimes they send captives and loot back to the main camp they do that every week or so and perhaps they exchange men as well so all can share in the looting esk kar stared at the map as did the others but already he could understand the strategy he sat there lost in thought until nicars words interrupted him well esk kar what do you make of it it seems they may pass us by if they are raiding so far to the east when the river bends the main party may continue eastward thats the path they traveled the last time they passed through these parts esk kar glanced at jalen and saw that his subcommander understood all too clearly what the barbarians had in mind esk kar leaned over the map tracing on it with his finger the main body follows the river tigris and right now that group is traveling almost due east when the river bends theyll continue to follow it and will be moving southeast when the river straightens theyll be heading almost due south and well be right in their path by then these raiding parties will be ranging far to the southeast of orak and theyll start to move toward us as well first driving west then north theyll approach orak from the south following the river and driving anyone seeking to escape from orak back toward us he looked up at the men and saw them all listening intently to him mouths open as they tried to grasp his meaning this time the barbarians are not just passing nearby and were not just another village near their path this time they make straight for orak were their main destination they herd everyone toward us knowing that the crowds of escaping farmers and villagers will overwhelm us with their numbers even as they concentrate all their goods and livestock here they expect to pluck a rich prize before they move on esk kars words silenced everyone for a moment before nicar spoke how sure can you be of this esk kar they could still turn east and not head directly here nicars question rang of desperation they heard the words but not what they meant tell them jalen tell them what you think i think its as esk kar says jalen said theyre coming here otherwise the main band would have turned east weeks ago thats why theyre moving so slowly they want people to get word of their approach and to come here thinking themselves safe until they have nowhere to go the village will be overwhelmed with people from the countryside the barbarians know theres no easy ford of the tigris for forty miles on either side of orak that put another thought into esk kars head pulling the map toward him for a moment esk kar glanced at it and grunted then shoved it back toward the center of the table yes and eventually theyll send a band of warriors across the river to make sure nobody crosses over even from the ford here that will keep us penned up they wont care whether orak resists or not well have nowhere to run for a long moment no one uttered a sound each man deep in his own dark thoughts of the future caldor the younger son of nicar broke the silence you speak of ignorant barbarians having a strategy just because they wander along the river they may just as soon head back the way they came as come here nicar whirled toward his son his voice hot with anger you are not to speak at this table unless asked to if youre unable to obey leave the words chilled the room everyone remembered the brash words of another youth killed in this very room caldor flushed red at the rebuke and sat back in his chair looking away from the group everyone turned to esk kar expecting an outburst of some kind esk kar heard trellas stool scrape softly on the floor behind him a reminder she was close by he didnt answer caldor directly responding as if nicar himself had asked it if any here think the alur meriki leaders whove led their clan through hundreds of battles and thousands of camps are not capable of planning their route with care and forethought you are mistaken if you think that it takes no wits to rule three or four thousand people organize hunting and food gathering repair your own wagons smelt your own ores forge your own bronze make your own tools and raise your own livestock all while moving hundreds of miles then youre even more mistaken if we make mistakes of that kind were as good as dead or captured no one said anything in answer and they avoided looking at caldor jalen esk kar said breaking the silence did you get any idea of how big the tribe is how many men wagons horses jalen clutched the empty cup no doubt wishing for more wine but too nervous to ask for any the great clan has grown there must have been a joining in the last few years they say the tribe numbers more than five thousand not counting slaves esk kar thought that over as gasps of amazement went around the table five thousand was an incredible number of people more than twice the number of people in orak but esk kar knew it wasnt the number of clansmen that counted only the number of warriors they could hurl against the wall everyone started talking at once but esk kar rapped his cup on the table five thousand is a great number of people but only about one in five will be a warrior the rest are old men women and children at most there will be fifteen hundred warriors probably less maybe only around twelve hundred its a great number of warriors but well have over three hundred defenders it will be more difficult but still possible when we agreed to defend orak nestor said his voice tense with anxiety as he leaned across the table we spoke of possibly six or seven hundred barbarians now we speak of twice that number and you say its still possible are we mad to think we can stop that many barbarians the wall can stop them corios words made everyone turn toward him it will be high enough and strong enough ive seen esk kars men in their training firing arrows into targets at a hundred paces seven and eight shafts each minute ive watched and i believe what ive seen youre committed to building the wall rebba countered youre being swayed by your own work no matter how strong the wall there wont be enough men to defend it its true i believe in the wall corio admitted but if we can get additional men then it can be done im sure of it and where are you to get these additional men nestor shouted putting his fist hard on the table he turned to esk kar your plans to recruit and train are already stretched thin there are fewer men willing to fight each day isnt that so captain another silence fell over the table as all eyes turned back toward eskkar he saw the fear in their faces and found he had no words if the barbarians hurled everyone at the wall in one rush he didnt know for certain they could be stopped everyone waited for his answer the sound of trellas stool being scraped along the plank floor made every eye turn toward her including esk kars pardon me nobles for speaking out but are not the barbarians sending you all the men you desire she kept her head bowed as she spoke properly submissive her words just reaching their ears by the gods trella youre right the more fool i for not seeing it esk kars confidence returned and he looked first at trella then at jalen who nodded his head in agreement well have more men than we know what to do with and many of them will be fighting men at that driven here from all the smaller villages to the south and the east looking for a chance to strike back well easily add another hundred or more men and many will know how to swing a sword he grasped trellas arm in excitement we can do it we dont have to match the barbarians in numbers one man behind the wall will be worth four or fi ve below it well have to plan on more people inside the village but it can still be done then you think orak can be held enough men will be found the excitement in nicars voice betrayed his emotions esk kar turned back toward the table the smile that trellas words had brought still on his face yes nobles im sure we can with another hundred fi ghting men we should he stopped and turned back toward his slave is there anything else we should be wary of trella she lifted her eyes for a moment i should not speak at your gathering speak up trella corio snapped and forget those customs if you have anything to say just say it and let us decide if its worthy nevertheless trella kept her voice humble nobles it seems to me that you will soon be facing the problem of what to do with so many people if hundreds more farmers and villagers flock to orak from the south and east theyll overwhelm the village even as you work to defend it already there are many strangers in the streets i fear they interrupt the work or cause other problems perhaps you should consider closing the gates to all except those who will fight and their families and send the rest across the river that sounded wise to esk kar and he was about to agree before he managed to get hold of his tongue let others speak first trella kept telling him listen to what they say before you speak and youll know better what to say yourself corios voice rose once again yes by the gods ive already been slowed down by interruptions and people wandering in and out of the work areas asking stupid questions each day it grows worse its hard to keep men working when newcomers stand there gawking murmurs of agreement sounded around the table were risking all that we have nicar said to save orak these strangers owe nothing to us or to the village let us take those who we want and send the others away fight work or move on esk kar said quietly thats what weve been saying and its the choice well offer those who can help us we can establish a camp for the newcomers at the old village site to the south they can stay there until they decide to move on that will keep them out of orak the first people to settle in orak had dug a well about two miles to the south and lived there for many years before moving the village to its current site more guards will be needed at the gates and at the old site jalen suggested and youll need more patrols in the countryside esk kar smiled at that we already have over a hundred and eighty men under arms and well trained men too another sixty are in training and will be ready in a few weeks now that weve enough men available we can increase the number under training are you certain youll have enough men nicar voiced everyones concern yes nicar im sure of it now i want to have three hundred and fifty men ready to defend orak with another five hundred villagers behind them to help fight and carry loads with that many men i can hold orak as long as the wall stands and the food holds out but i think well need another fifty fighters to send across the river nestor looked puzzled why send men across the river when theyre needed here to guard your livestock noble all the spare cattle sheep and horses must be moved out of the village and the countryside we wont have food or space to keep them here anyway and the stink and filth would be unbearable besides the barbarians will learn that we have no livestock here it will make them less eager to fight remember gold is not so important to them horses first then animals then women thats how they think so we send all our beasts away across the river and to the west with fifty men to guard them esk kar reached out and pulled the map toward him putting his finger on the spot indicating the main barbarian camp jalen when do you think the barbarians will arrive do we have enough time based on what i saw and heard i think they will arrive here in two months or so at the earliest raiding parties could be here sooner of course but i dont think thats their plan theyre moving slowly taking their time enjoying their conquests they see no need to rush what if they learn were building a wall to stop them nicar asked wont that make them change their plans jalen shrugged its likely theyve already heard about our wall we found plenty of peasants up north who knew we were planning to resist esk kar pushed the map back to the center of the table they wont change their plans he answered firmly they wont believe a wall can stop them still we must take no chances in case a big raiding party arrives early he looked at corio how long before the first section is completed corio must have expected that question in a few days we can seal the main entrance to orak the new gate will be ready in a week or so but until then we can use wagons and men to close it he turned toward his eldest son seated beside him alcinor you will make the gate functional even if its not fully reinforced as soon as possible when his son nodded agreement corio turned back to esk kar and the others weve already speeded up our pace on the walls construction materials are arriving in sufficient quantity and weve enough laborers though we can always use more he glanced around the table as he made his commitment i will give you your wall at least a month early what about the ditch nestor inquired no one speaks about starting on the ditch the ditch is the last thing we will do corio said esk kar and i have discussed this with three or four hundred men we can dig the ditch completely around orak in a week or ten days well do that at the very last moment so that even if the barbarians learn of the wall they will not think it very formidable nicar looked around the table is there anything else we should consider everyone glanced around but nobody had anything to add then nicar saw trellas eyes come up to meet his trella do you wish to say something she bowed humbly again noble nicar i know youve discussed flooding the land alongside the village but no work has started on that perhaps now we should prepare to do so in case the barbarians come early i dont know how long it will take or how much water will be needed apparently no one else did either because no one spoke up nicar turned to rebba who sat there stroking his beard in thought rebba owned two large farms north of the village and hed been the original force behind draining the swamps many years ago in matters of agriculture he decided what crops would be grown for orak how much and by whom his family built the largest irrigation ditches and knew more about moving water than anyone rebba took his time thinking and esk kar felt his patience about to snap before the man spoke my family will work with corios men to build some wooden breakwaters if we place them properly we can divert thirty or forty feet of river into the surrounding farms that should flood the land in less than a day and be more than enough to stop the barbarians from trying to drain the water after a few days the water will sink deep into the earth and the land will return to a muddy swamp that will take months to dry out well build additional ditches to allow the water to flow where we wish it im sorry that your lands must be covered with water rebba nicar answered but you know it must be done dont be sorry old friend rebba smiled resignedly the crops wouldve been ruined by the barbarians anyway instead the waters will refresh the land and afterward it will be even more fertile than before nicars eyes went around the table and stopped again at trella anything else trella his tone was calmer now and his look encouraged her to speak noble nicar theres one thing more that you might consider she paused then went on when the livestock is sent across the river you may want to include men from the village perhaps from your own families if anything should happen to the animals orak would be without food and herds for the coming season the soldiers may be loyal but there will be great temptation perhaps an equal number of villagers under your direction should accompany them and rewards promised for everyones safe return nicar sat quietly for a moment yes thats worth considering there will be a rich value of livestock and grain and if its not returned safely orak will face starvation we will speak further about it he glanced around the table but no one seemed to have any more words then were finished with our meeting again lets give thanks to the gods for jalens safe return and for his information esk kar added to himself he left the house his commanders following and he invited them to dine with him bantor jalen and sisuthros headed off on their separate ways but gatus walked with esk kar and trella though they went in the opposite direction to gatuss house when they were alone in the street gatus jerked his head toward esk kars bodyguard to move him out of earshot then he grabbed esk kar by the arm captain he began moving close to esk kar then turning to include trella im not sure whether you saw the look on young caldors face when trella spoke out i could just catch a glimpse of him seated behind his father the puppy was hot with anger when his father put him down gatus scratched his beard well if looks could kill young trella here would already be in the ground he looked worried youd better watch him esk kar i wouldnt put it past him to do some hurt to you or trella gatus thank you for your concern trella answered kindly and for your warning well be watchful good and if needs be i can have one of my rogues put a blade in his back ill even do it myself just let me know he nodded to esk kar till dinner then and went on his way striding down the street esk kar looked thoughtfully at trella then put his arm around her they started walking back to their house his guard moving in a few steps behind mistress trella he said echoing the title of honor given to the senior woman of a household i see we have much to talk about this evening much it seems goes on that i know little about when you have much to say at night then i know i will be sore the next morning though youve been too busy and too tired for me lately then ill have to make time for you perhaps you should make sure tonights dinner is short and our guests depart early afterward well have plenty of time to talk yes master but she took his hand and held it until they entered the courtyard of the former house of drigo it took little effort to keep dinner brief that evening jalen weary from his journey and eager to return to the girl hed started bedding just before his mission north left the table first gatus and the others took the hint from annok sur jalens news interested everyone but once he left nobody really wanted to linger esk kar found trella in the kitchen helping the cook and annok sur clean up he took her by the hand and led her up the flight of stairs that hugged the wall and gave access to the second floor at the top covered by a linen curtain was a small privy containing a large chamber pot this allowed the servants to empty the container without disturbing the master at his work a marvel of construction the upper level of drigos home boasted many wonderful features not even nicars house possessed a stout door led into a good sized room drigo used for his private workroom it now contained a large table an impressive cupboard six chairs and a smaller table from the workroom another heavy door provided the only entry to the bedroom the bed chambers size nearly twenty five feet long by twenty wide had astonished esk kar four small openings spaced evenly and high up on the two outer walls provided light and air not even a child could crawl through them a narrow window covered by a thick shutter and fastened with two beams provided the only means of escape in case of fi re the shutter would take more effort to force than the door a coil of stout rope waited in a decorative clay pot beneath the window for use in an emergency and the opening could be observed and guarded from the interior courtyard below drigo had taken care in building his private rooms to ensure no one could enter or eavesdrop on his private bedroom activities or conversations all this effort now benefited esk kar as they passed through the workroom into the bedroom making sure to fasten each door for the first time in his life he had something more valuable than goldprivacy he could speak and be assured that no one could hear he took her in his arms and held her looking down at her face and breathing in the scent of her hair trella all day ive wanted to hold you to thank you for your words at nicars table you make everything possible and now even the families listen when you speak her hands went around his neck and her face pressed itself to his breast you said you wanted to talk master teasing him with the slaves salutation or did you bring me here for other reasons once again shed roused him with a few words and the press of her body i think we will talk later he took off her dress pulling it slowly up over her head enjoying the sight and feel of her body against his she spoke the truth earlier three days had passed since hed taken her a length of time that suddenly seemed far too long then we should make haste she whispered loosening his belt and letting it drop to the floor she helped remove his tunic her desire no less than his esk kar guided her gently down into the bed and ran his hands over her taking his time forcing himself to hold back while he aroused her wanting her pleasure as much as his own hed never done such things before until trella hed cared little whether any of his women felt much of anything hed heard such things described and men told stories of women who enjoyed lovemaking as much as their men stories he had previously dismissed as lies or soldiers tales whatever magic trella possessed she brought to him something special something that increased the love act and made it better than simple coupling he resolved to keep it that way later he lay there relaxed resting on clean pillows and a soft linen mattress filled with cotton and feathers a small lamp provided just enough light to see trella left the bedroom and when she returned she carried a tray holding a water pitcher and two glass goblets the expensive glass cups rare and hard to fashion came as a gift from one of many merchants seeking favors esk kar drank gratefully but trella drank only half of hers then poured what remained onto a cloth she used that to wipe esk kars brow then rubbed down his chest and wiped clean his genitals turning the cloth over she rubbed down her own breasts and loins as well when she finished she snuggled against him pulling the blanket up over them he loved the way she looked after him almost as if he were a child you know trella this life is very good weve a fine house servants and gold to pay for everything for me its like a dream his arm went around her shoulder and most of all i have you and if you did not have me youd have some other girl in your bed men are much the same my father nicar the rulers of my village ouch he pinched her to stop her words yes id have some other girl but it would not be this bed id be in the barracks with a dozen men grinning as they watched esk kar turned on his side to face her serious now i know to whom i owe this soft bed all this is because of you and ill not forget that he moved the hair away from her face then kissed her cheek so say what you wish even if you know its untrue then you still want me she whispered her voice suddenly that of a timid young girl even if im not as pretty as the women who now cast their eyes on you yes more than ever he slapped her thigh playfully but you must tell me how such a young girl knows so much about lovemaking if all the girls from carnax are like you then i must visit this place he pulled her on top of him where did you learn to make a man so happy she hid her face and he knew she was blushing though the lamp barely revealed her face one day my father caught me watching him take his pleasure with one of the servants he decided that since i was so curious i should learn how to please a man to make sure i would be well treated by my future husband so he had one of his slave women instruct me in the mysteries and i was allowed to watch her with her husband he wondered what else shed done not that he cared your father was a wise man he gave you a great gift one that i will always keep close to me that reminded him of something unpleasant now tell me about caldor what about this look she sat up pulling the blanket close around her and turned toward him i saw the same look gatus did just for an instant he was embarrassed by his father before everyone the foolish boy should have kept silent then when i spoke and the nobles listened he was even more angered that i could speak when he was forbidden he her voice trailed off esk kar took her hand pressed it to his lips then squeezed it yes what else did he do when i was at nicars house caldor wanted he wanted me he told me he was just waiting for his father to take me first and then id be given to him but he didnt even want to wait for that he wanted me to to get down on my knees for him she stopped the words coming hard i pushed him away and ran off i would have run from the house but creta grabbed me and made me tell her what happened she must have spoken to caldor because after that he only looked at me and smiled i i was afraid of him ill kill him for that esk kar decided but he kept his hand steady on trellas so she wouldnt know what he was feeling he cursed himself for a fool not to have asked her anything about her life at nicars house as if nothing that had gone on before mattered once hed taken possession of her still he couldnt go around killing everyone who wanted to bed trella since that now included most of the men in orak then what happened nothing a few days after that nicar returned from his travels two weeks passed and caldor and lesu went off on their trip then you came to dinner and i was given to you and you didnt know who was worse the barbarian or the spoiled child he said lightly glad to coax a small laugh from her you seemed reluctant enough to come with me why didnt you tell me of this before because i didnt think it mattered id decided anything was better than being a slave so i planned to run away but you were gentle and treated me with respect after i heard you speak to the crowd that night i decided to help you to do as nicar asked but for my own reasons she touched his cheek and then after we made love together i felt different and now i want only to be your woman i will have no life but with you esk kar if we fail then well both die here and nothing will matter if we win then caldor is of no importance esk kars hand tightened at caldors name you cannot kill him esk kar much as i would wish you to if you kill another one of the families sons theyll never forgive you she twisted in his arms so that her cheek pressed against his you must listen to me more is at stake here than just the barbarians if we win the victory may be as deadly for you as the barbarians youll have to survive the families who will remember you were born a barbarian remember drigos death remember those of their own families killed in battle and remember how much of their gold youve spent he started to speak but she put her finger to his lips even the soldiers may try to take power from you with the help of the merchants and the families when this is over many people will be dead many of them your friends and youll have made new enemies to hold power over them there is much you must do starting now her breath was against his cheek and he wanted to hold her in his arms and forget about everything but her damn the gods wasnt it enough to fight the barbarians now he had to worry about a knife in the back and plan for the future at the same timewhen he didnt even know if hed survive the coming battle demons take them all to the fire better a hard fight than all this cursed planning and plotting he could take trella and leave orak behind trusting to his sword and the gold hed already earned part of him still longed to live from day to day without having to worry about the schemes of men he reached out to touch her hair trella we dont have to stay here we can still leave anytime there are other villages other lands and weve enough gold when she said nothing he went on isnt that better than staying here and risking all fighting the barbarians and whatever will come afterward you must choose for both of us my choice is already made and i will follow you as long as you want me esk kar had a flash of insight trella would accept a lesser existence as his woman traveling the roads in search of a new life if that were all he could offer he sighed well stay and well fight now tell me what i must do ive watched you closely esk kar and ive learned much from you but now its time to make new plans the men are training well the wall grows every day and your commanders have settled into their roles watching you train i see youve improved your strength and skills now we should show orak a different captain of the guard and how will we do that wife i think you should leave orak for a while i have thought much about this she sat up and poured more water into his glass which of your commanders is the most important to you right now she asked sisuthros is the most important he has the quickest wits and ive given him the most responsibility no i think not i say bantor is the most important because he deals every day with a multitude of people and he can speak for you to them also hes slower of thought and he knows that youve been patient with him so he is the most loyal but youll lose that loyalty if you dont spend more time with him and make sure he gets the respect he deserves you may be right about his loyalty although i would have chosen gatus as the most loyal gatus is a good man and like an uncle to me but now he merely trains the men and there are many here who could do that think of jalen who wants only to fight and will be loyal to you if you let him gain his victories esk kar considered her words seeing his men in a different light and sisuthros what of him sisuthros is the most dangerous to you because hes the one the families will turn to when they want you removed already corio and some of the others are more comfortable with him than you and that is something we must change remember he hasnt killed any of them nor does he travel about orak with armed guards and remember too that thoughts of drigos fate are never far from their minds sisuthros has spoken to caldor at least once that i know of so when you leave you should take sisuthros with you how do you know so much about sisuthros and corio and their affairs for the last month ive met each day with dozens of women slaves as well as wives and daughters ive given copper coins to those in need and befriended others because of you there is respect for me and now they come to me for advice or assistance or just to talk women are everywhere and men like caldor dont even notice them for those who bring me information theres a copper coin or whatever they need many of our servants have given me good information or have access to those who talk too much these and others are helping me gather all the secrets men think their women dont hear or are too stupid to understand between all of them i hear many things and soon there will be little that goes on in orak that doesnt come to my ears trella had been spending his gold but he had more than enough for his needs and she spoke the truth men did talk in front of women as if they were deaf and dumb hed done so himself numerous times well he would talk carelessly no more lest his own words come back to haunt him and these women report all they hear to you yes they spy on their husbands and lovers most men talk too freely in their lovemaking as well you know spy a new word to deal with and esk kar thought about what it meant a gatherer of information of secrets others did not wish you to know such knowledge could certainly be useful and youll continue to get this information yes and more but ill need much more of your gold esk kar his twenty gold coins per month was about to vanish he stroked her neck thinking that his attitude toward gold had certainly changed in the last few months now it was just a means to an end take what you need trella what else must i hear before i can sleep they spoke long into the night when he disagreed or questioned her he listened carefully to her reasons until there was agreement or at least understanding between them and so they whispered watching the moon rise and fall watching the lamp burn itself out well into the morning hours trella challenging not only his thoughts but his very way of thinking one thought however he kept to himself when the time was right young caldor would die that put a smile on his lips before they both drifted off into a deep and sound sleep the next morning esk kar trained as usual with the latest batch of recruits his natural fighting ability enhanced by months of exercise and good food now allowed him to teach as well as to train with the recruits nevertheless he often received as good as he gave for some of the new men recruit meant only that they hadnt been trained as gatus wanted not that they werent experienced fighters so esk kar observed different styles of swordplay and had already picked up several new techniques today luck favored him no new bruises pained his body tired and dirty he joined the men as they washed up before moving on to the next part of the training esk kar guided the recruits through the lanes out the river gate and to the archery range on the north side the bow remained the most important part of the training in esk kars mindthe only weapon that could give villagers a chance against the barbarians esk kar and gatus discussed this training often and both were determined that by the time the barbarians arrived every man would be an exceptional marksman the soldiers needed not only to become proficient with the bow but to master the shooting techniques gatus developed specifically for use from the wall as esk kar and his troop arrived they found a large crowd at the range soldiers made up most of the throng but enough idle villagers men and women alike joined them bringing a frown to esk kars face villagers and soldiers should be at their assigned duties not wasting time watching archery practice his anger grew as he pushed through the crowd the recruits following him the crowd roared as he reached the firing line and esk kar saw totomes pointing downrange with his bow another roar went up he watched totomess son mitrac draw his bow and launch a shaft at the farthest target the spectators voiced their approval with another cheer even before the boy tending the targets signaled a hit to the center of the mark esk kar stood there as impressed as any while narquil loosed his arrow at the same mark when the boy had finished shooting totomes and his sons moved back twenty paces and began again the master bowman and his sons already stood well past the maximum range at which the most experienced archers practiced gatus standing on the edge of the crowd noticed esk kar and joined him morning captain you shouldve gotten here sooner this totomes and his boys have been putting on quite a show theyve hardly missed the mark at any range forno says hes never seen anything like it forno the senior archer among esk kars men had slain naxoss man forno led the archery training for the recruits so theyre marksmen but can they teach their skill to others gatus rubbed his beard as the crowd shouted approval at another hit forno thinks so hes already been given some tips by totomes who even let him draw his own bow though only at close range no archer ever wanted to break another mans bow by trying to hit a distant mark it said much for forno that totomes had allowed him to try his weapon another round of shafts were delivered and again the crowd backed up another twenty paces totomes caught sight of esk kar standing there and nodded by now the distance stretched over three hundred paces and even the butts behind the targets looked small indeed despite the distance totomess arrows reached them easily enough with only a slight arc forno walked over to join his captain and gatus shaking his head in disbelief marduks blood but that man can use a bow better than anyone ive seen forno turned and squinted at the marks and his boys are almost as good narquil shoots slower but is the most accurate though mitrac hits his marks nearly as often can they help you train the men esk kar asked captain i think ill be helping them train in a few days forno replied id like to see them shoot with our bows but im sure totomes has been training archers for twenty years totomes and his sons as far away from the butts as possible still arched arrows into the sky that almost always struck the targets esk kar made up his mind and turned to gatus let totomes start by training this group of recruits and gatus ill train with them gatus raised an eyebrow up to now esk kar had postponed any intensive training with the bow concentrating mainly on his swordplay this might be as good a time as any to begin before long esk kar stood at the head of the recruits bow in hand quiver of arrows strapped to his waist the targets a mere thirty paces away totomes began his instructions he put aside his weapon and demonstrated with one of the soldiers bows if anyone thought it strange that the captain of the guard should be standing rigid with the latest batch of recruits no one said anything as totomes stood next to esk kar and watched him notch an arrow aim and let fly again totomes ordered his eyes fixed on his pupil esk kar launched another though the first shaft had hit the mark almost dead center totomes shook his head youll not hit a target of any distance like that captain he turned to his sons show him the two boys moved on opposite sides of esk kar grasping his elbows adjusting his stance and shifting his weight more to his rear foot you shoot too much on your front foot captain totomes continued so as you draw the bow you become unbalanced and make unnecessary movements and you bring the arrow up from the ground as you bend into the bow always raise the arrow skyward and bring it down as you put your shoulder into it that way a shaft released too soon may strike a target in the rear rather than the ground in front of you the two boys held esk kar firmly making him draw the bow slowly keeping more weight on his rear foot and adjusting his right elbow esk kar held the drawn bow while they checked his stance and grip taking plenty of time until they were satisfied esk kars left arm began to tremble before totomes gave the order to loose the shaft flew into the straw butt but missed the wooden target hanging in its center it feels awkward at first captain but youll get used to it its different from the way the the way you learned try again totomes moved on to the next man leaving narquil to keep an eye on esk kar and again and again until esk kars left arm felt weak as water and the fingers on his right hand swelled and burned from the friction of the bowstring but his pride drove him and he refused to show weakness in front of his men up and down the line totomes mitrac narquil forno and even gatus kept close watch on the recruits every movement making sure they followed totomess instructions exactly by the time they finished esk kar felt as exhausted as any of the men and wasnt even shooting as well as some youll do better in a few days captain totomes said with a friendly laugh as he walked with esk kar back toward the barracks if you want accuracy youll have to unlearn some of your bad habits but youll do fine you have the eye for it if you like mitrac can work with you privately if you feel uncomfortable with the others watching a little late for that he offered to train with this batch of bowmen and now his honor had been challenged he determined to do as well as any of them no totomes though i thank you for the offer ill stay with these men for a while that meant an extra four hours per day with the bow for at least a week in addition to his usual hours each morning training with the sword spear and battle axe but he couldnt avoid it not if he wanted to experience exactly how totomes and forno trained the men oraks fate would rest in the arms of these bowmen it took ten days before he felt comfortable with the changes in his shooting style and before he could again plant his shaft within the mark with confidence hed long since admitted totomes knew his craft esk kar led the recruits with the best scores until he realized some of the men would occasionally let a shaft or two fly wide to make sure their captain always scored higher but by then he could hit a target at seventy paces three times out of four and he felt more than satisfied with that a few days later they practiced from the main wall looking out toward the low hills where their real enemy would appear now the soldiers fired as a group aiming not at individual targets but at a particular range the targets had changed from the straw butts to stick figures planted in the earth at various distances the men drew aimed and loosed their arrows together on command learning how to gauge the distance and walk their shafts in from the farthest mark to the closest the fi rst day on the wall esk kar noticed something unusual the men were always laughing raising coarse jests or doing all of the usual things soldiers and recruits did to take their minds off their own discomfort and to pass the time during training but the first time they stood on the wall the laughter stopped of its own accord taking their places exposed from the waist up they realized that a deadly business would soon be at hand so they listened to the instructors words a little more attentively and took a little extra care in their work at the end of the first session totomes took esk kar aside youre finished with your training captain he said youre as good as youll ever be but youll never make a master archer youre too old for that leave the training now before too many of the others pass you by youve proven your skill to your men there are other more important tasks for you esk kar rode out of orak six days later taking sisuthros nine riders two boys and one pack horse with him they traveled south at a steady pace jalen had explored north to get information about the barbarians main camp esk kar wanted to observe the far ranging alur meriki war parties reported to the south the men were fit hard and ready to fight six were hard bitten veterans recent recruits made up the remainder men whod proven both their fighting ability and horsemanship when you went to war against the barbarians skill with a horse was as important as fighting mitrac excepted totomess youngest son had only limited experience with horses nevertheless mitrac practiced hard for the last week under jalens tutelage once esk kar saw totomess expertise esk kar wanted someone with him who could draw one of the great weapons even so it had occasioned a four sided argument between esk kar totomes and his sons before the father consented worried he might lose mitrac on some minor raid totomes gave in only when esk kar promised to look after the boy personally each day they rode south resting the horses often esk kar spent time with sisuthros mitrac and the rest talking to them asking their advice or just joining them in rough song get close to your men from the lowest recruit to your commanders trella advised first make them respect you then let them know you thats how you build loyalty her words matched what hed seen in corio and nicar esk kar didnt know where trella had learned so much about leading men but her ideas made sense hed only to recall all the mistakes of his previous commanders or even his own to see the wisdom in what she said so he began in earnest to build respect then loyalty in his men only with loyalty can you have true power the words echoed in his thoughts if enough of the soldiers and people believe in you you will be safe because your enemies will fear the anger of those who trust in you and so eskkar made sure he got closer to his men in this esk kar had changed greatly in the last months gold women horses weapons all the things hed previously considered desirable meant nothing to him he wanted power now power to place himself above the reach of the nobles power to found his own house power to build a clan that would last forever most of all he wanted to safeguard trella to make sure their future remained secure but now esk kar needed to concentrate on the present so he put thoughts of trella and orak out of his mind and focused on his mission by the fifth day theyd traveled over a hundred miles south of orak and soon he began hearing stories of an alur meriki raiding party wayfarers refugees and travelers turned pale with fear when esk kar and his riders approached their faces turned to smiles when they learned esk kar came from orak from these wanderers he pieced enough stories together the barbarians had finally reached the banks of the tigris almost two hundred miles south of orak as yet they hadnt started north they would do that soon enough no one had any real idea of the size of the war parties wild estimates of hundreds of warriors stripping the lands meant nothing esk kar divided every count by four knowing fear and inexperience would infl ate the numbers he felt certain that two separate raiding parties existed esk kar warned those they encountered not to go to orak unless they wanted to fight otherwise they should cross the river as soon as possible that night after caring for the horses they sat around the small fire enjoying fresh meat for only the second time since leaving orak theyd found a dying calf separated from its mother and the young animal had barely enough flesh on its bones for a hearty meal the warm meat provided a respite from grain cakes and stale bread when the meal ended esk kar sent one of the boys to a nearby hill to keep watch and gathered the rest of the men each night he spoke about the coming day so everyone knew what they were likely to confront weve gone south long enough any day the alur meriki may turn north so tomorrow we head eastward the barbarians have already passed through those lands why not go farther south sisuthros asked to see how many men they have well learn nothing more by going south the barbarians have reached the river with at least one large raiding party if we encounter them after they have turned north theyll pursue us and in a few days ride us down even with our fine horses what will we find to the east captain sisuthros still sounded unconvinced we should find groups of men and slaves moving north and south between the main body and these southern raiders they wont be expecting men to come at them from this direction now that their warriors have swept this land id like to capture one or two to learn how many they are and what they plan remember were not out looking for a fight just information i want to get you back to orak alive most commanders gave little thought to the lives of their men so he knew his words had touched them so if we encounter any barbarians sisuthros said we run the men itched for a fight young and brave they trained hard for weeks and that training had given them confidence and the urge to test themselves against the enemy yes we run unless we meet a small party one closer to our size then maybe well have a chance to test our blades the next morning they traveled at a moderate pace with two men ranging ahead and another to their rear they rode that way for three days stopping often to rest the horses traveling only ten or fifteen miles each day seeing fewer farms or people and instead more empty land as the cautious riders moved deeper into rough country to the east they reached the beginnings of hill and canyon country with the great mountains looming ever closer by now orak lay far to the northwest the ninth day since leaving orak the morning showed a sky gray and heavy with clouds hinting at rain they kept to their usual pace keeping away from the hilltops and stopping often to rest the animals an hour past noon after they dismounted to rest the horses the man keeping watch raised a shout and pointed toward the mountains in an instant esk kar leaped on his horse looking eastward he saw the southernmost of his scouts galloping back toward them turning to his left he saw the other scout also returning but at a more reasonable pace the fi rst scout a veteran named maldar pulled up in front of esk kar all the men had mounted their horses readied their weapons and let their eyes scan the horizon in every direction captain theres a large band of barbarians about three miles ahead maldars voice betrayed his excitement or maybe two bands i couldnt be sure but it looks as if theyre fighting lots of dust and noise fighting among the barbarians that didnt sound right to esk kar the alur meriki had serious penalties for fighting amongst themselves when on the clans missions at home in the main camp individuals often fought but conflicts between groups of warriors seldom occurred even if two clans opposed each other everyone preferred to let the leaders fight it out but who else could they be fighting maldar switch horses with one of the boys he wanted maldar on a fresh mount sisuthros get the other scout in and follow us but keep at least half a mile behind esk kar waited until maldar had moved his gear to the new animal the fright esk kar saw on the boys face would have made him laugh once but now esk kar smiled encouragement stay steady boy well not leave you behind then esk kar and maldar rode off at a canter a small cloud of dust rose and soon settled in their trail before long the two men reached the base of the outlying hills from there successive ridges of earth rose ever higher until the base of the great peaks blocked the path esk kar imagined he could hear the distant clash of bronze weapons and the cries of men fighting but when he stopped and listened he heard nothing here captain from this hilltop i saw them a winding trail marked by the hoof prints of maldars horse led to the top esk kar could ride up as maldar had done or he could climb the steep hill on foot esk kar decided not to risk the horses come he ordered well climb on foot they rode the last few paces to the base of the hill dismounted and tied the horses fast to a small tree esk kar made sure he tied his knot tight and that maldar did the same if they had to run esk kar didnt want to be fighting his own man over a horse should one of the animals get loose they began the long climb scrambling much of the way and slipping back occasionally until they reached the top none of his recent training had prepared him for climbing steep hills and he was breathing hard by the time they gained the summit low boulders covered the narrow crest with patches of grass sprouting between them he dropped down between two rocks looking out over the spreading foothills esk kar found himself on a hilltop somewhat higher than those in front of him it provided a good vantage point to observe the grayish red slabs of rock that protruded down from the higher mountains and formed a labyrinth of canyons and gullies that twisted and turned back on themselves maldar pointed to the northeast see there they are no wait theyve moved toward us another ridge crest separated esk kar from the swirling cloud but he could make out the dust of many riders a constantly churning cloud that moved and shifted as he watched it did look as if two groups battled each other in a running fight as he watched one band broke through the ranks of the other and headed toward esk kars position following the line of hills that ran roughly parallel to the ridge esk kar occupied but more than a mile away in moments the other riders regrouped and took up the chase count the first group maldar he ordered while he tried to estimate the second and larger body the strange riders were still far off and the horses moved and merged making counting difficult sixty five or seventy men he guessed forty maybe a few more why do they fight each other captain esk kar turned his attention to the first troop close enough to distinguish some detail they either had no standard or had lost it in battle yet even the dust couldnt hide the yellow streamers that decorated many lances and bow tips yellow meant another clan for red marked the predominant hue of the alur meriki so a different tribe of steppes people had somehow gotten involved in a fight with the alur meriki esk kar watched the leading band turn toward them seeking a path out of the hills and canyons that threatened to pen them in the pursuing band began to gain on their quarry their horses obviously fresher though all the animals would be tired by the fighting and the chase hed seen enough lets go maldar we dont want to be here when his voice trailed off as he watched the yellow riders gallop into a canyon from his vantage point esk kar could see their path led nowhere in a few moments the yellow riders whirled their horses about and rode back out the gap between pursued and pursuers shortened by the time wasted on the false trail a short ride would bring them to another fork one branch led to a narrow twisting trail that would lead to the open plain where esk kars men now waited the other branch twice as wide led into another larger canyon one that twisted and turned alongside the cliffs but one he could see ended in a second cul de sac but it wouldnt look that way to the harried riders a flash of insight possessed him almost as if he could see what would happen at the same time an idea a foolish one perhaps took hold of him his eyes marked the landmarks beneath him come he ordered his mind made up and he began scrambling down the steep hillside grasping at roots and the hard rock edges that jutted through the thin grasses at the bottom esk kar waited for maldar to come rattling down then grabbed his arm to halt him walk slowly toward the horses maldar dont spook them they reached the horses that watched nervously nostrils flaring and eyes wide at the unusual sight of men and stones sliding down the hillside esk kar made sure he had a firm grip on the halter before he undid the knot looking at maldar to make sure he followed his example once mounted esk kar led the way back to sisuthros and the rest of his men hidden from view by yet another tiny rolling swell sprinkled with skimpy grass captain we should hurry maldars voice betrayed his excitement theyll be here any moment were right in their path esk kar reached the top of the grassy mound that opened up to the plain and spotted the rest of his men he waved to them summoning them forward the faint sounds of the barbarian horses could be heard now echoing off the rocks the warring parties were less than half a mile away maldar began again but esk kar cut him off no theyll take the wrong turn into the canyon and be caught in a trap they dont know this ground or theyd never have gone up the first blind canyon were safe for now sisuthros rode up at the head of the men and looked toward the hills esk kar saw fear on each mans face especially the new men and the boys everyone could hear the pounding hooves amplified by the cliff walls and they all knew danger lay just over the ridge he waited until theyd bunched up around him listen carefully esk kar kept his voice calm and assured there are two tribes of barbarians engaged in a battle inside the canyon over there he pointed to his left the larger band is alur meriki and there are about fifty or sixty of them no sense frightening them even more by telling them the exact truth they fight against another smaller band of about forty barbarians one that i dont recognize but clearly from a different clan by now the alur meriki have trapped the first band in a box canyon and will soon be attacking them then weve time to get away sisuthross voice showed his relief the men nodded agreement no were not riding away esk kar watched their faces go blank at his words their mouths opening in surprise were going to attack the alur meriki from the rear weve enough men on fresh horses to tip the scale of battle why fight to save barbarians maldar asked why not let them kill each other while we get away esk kar shook his head barbarians have a sayingthe enemy of my enemy is my friend if we help this other tribe we gain allies against the alur meriki and orak needs all the help it can find with our help these alur meriki can be defeated he saw the doubt and disbelief on their faces you said you wanted to fight didnt you well heres your chance or would you rather run away he gave them no time to answer as he turned his horses head back toward the canyons mitrac come with me and ready that great bow of yours sisuthros prepare the men and walk the horses two hundred paces behind us esk kar rode off without a backward glance in a few moments mitrac reached his side pale but determined his eyes wide esk kar looked at the young man trust me lad we can do this i promise that youll kill at least five alur meriki today esk kar rode through the creases in the hills the sounds of shouting and excited horses growing louder the first party realized theyd ridden into a trap and now both sides took their time readying their men for further battle no doubt the first band had ridden to the end of the box canyon and would regroup from there but the battle hadnt started yet so esk kar knew he had some time checking the landmarks hed noted from the hilltop esk kar took his position and dismounted he tied his horse to a gnarled tree limb then retied mitracs mount that was a poor knot esk kar said your horse would have bolted loose at the first sound of trouble always make sure of your horse he slapped the lad lightly on the shoulder now string your weapon and follow me without waiting or looking behind esk kar moved silently the last hundred paces up the narrow trail boulders rose up on either side twice his height until he came to the final bend in the path he slipped through the rocks and took a quick look up the trail the barbarians had left two riders to guard the opening against the chance of any opponents breaking through their ranks and escaping their gazes were fixed down the canyon mitracs rapid breathing announced his arrival and esk kar stepped back behind the rocks mitrac esk kar said noting the youths bow was strung and an arrow fi tted to the string there are two warriors both with bows across their mounts just around the bend about forty paces away neither has an arrow to his string yet shoot the one farthest away first because hes closest to the canyon entrance and i dont want him getting away then shoot the other one if you miss keep shooting if he charges ill take him with my sword esk kar looked at the lad who seemed steady enough though his lip trembled and the bow shook a little in his hand are you ready mitrac swallowed hard but managed to nod esk kar had seen the signs of fear before its an easy shot and they wont be expecting it just do it and think about it later now lets go take three good paces and let fly ill be right behind you esk kar pulled his sword from the scabbard more to give mitrac a sense of security than out of actual need at that moment a great war cry sounded from the alur meriki inside the canyon mixed with the pounding of horses put to the gallop as they launched their attack mitracs hands shook a little just enough to betray his nervousness he bit his lip took a deep breath exhaled half of it and stepped forward three long paces then he turned and braced his left foot the boys long training under the stern tutelage of his father paid off the bow bent smoothly and with scarcely a moment to aim he launched the shaft on its flight the first warrior cried out when the arrow struck him behind the right shoulder the second man looked the wrong way as he turned back to his rear mitracs second arrow which had leapt from quiver to string struck its target full in the chest the alur meriki pitched slowly off his horse esk kar darted back toward his men and waving his sword urged them forward he raced back to mitrac clasping him on the shoulder to give him confidence take a stance up in those rocks shoot anything that comes your way wearing red pushing him on his way esk kar ran ahead and gathered up the two riderless horses leading them away from the canyons opening up close he saw that the gap between the canyons walls was about forty feet wide at the entrance he handed the horses off to sisuthros who rode up sword in one hand leading esk kars horse with the other esk kar nodded at his subcommander partly from relief that his men had followed him he handed the ropes of the captured beasts to one of the boys then took the halter of his own mount and swung back astride hold these animals fast we may need extra mounts esk kar turned to sisuthros and the men follow me and once in the canyon form a line they wont be expecting an attack from behind when we charge ride as hard as you can and kill everything in your path wearing red red remember that esk kar spoke rapidly giving the men no time to think or doubt in a moment esk kar was at the center of a line of ten mounted men that stretched across the canyons mouth the noise of the battle sounded loud in his ears just out of sight mitrac he called out to the lad standing in the rocks with his bow an arrow to the string follow us in but stay in the rocks kill as many as you can dont let any get away esk kar glanced at the men on either side remember kill only red or well be fighting the whole lot he gave them no more time to worry think about all the gold theyre carrying use your horses and scream your heads off i want them more scared of us than the other barbarians now follow me and do as i do he kicked the horse forward and hoped his men followed if they didnt hed be dead very soon his own fear rose up bitter in the back of his throat as it always did at the start of a battle death might wait a few paces ahead but he refused to think about the danger or his decision to fight esk kar took a deep breath glad that the time for thinking had passed rounding the small bend just inside the canyons mouth the full sound of men and beasts fi ghting and dying hit them in all its fury huge clouds of dust swirled madly but esk kar paid no mind urging nicars best horse forward with savage kicks even as he gripped the beast tightly with both knees he reached the rear of the fight as the first alur meriki heard the horses behind him and turned his head esk kars sword swept down and he sliced through the mans shoulder as the warrior tried to wheel his horse around without slowing esk kar urged his horse directly at the next man letting his beasts shoulder crash into the warriors horse knocking loose the mans grip as esk kar followed up with another savage stroke the fi ghting madness enveloped him possessed him completely only killing mattered now his own men rode close beside him yelling at the tops of their lungs and hacking away like madmen an alur meriki warrior whirled his horse around and launched himself at esk kar swinging his sword high in the air before he could strike one of mitracs arrows thudded into the barbarians breast and he pitched backward off his mount the fight turned into a melee horses bumped each other screaming and biting warriors clung to their mounts and tried to fight at the same time but the fresh horses of esk kars men pushed the tired animals of the alur meriki back and esk kars long sword rose and fell again and again spattering blood from both man and beast attacked from behind by an unknown force they had no idea how few assailed them the shouts of oraks men rose up and mixed with the cries of the dying and wounded the din resounding louder in the confined canyon echoing off the walls and adding to the confusion esk kar tried to keep track of the battle even as he struggled to master his horse and fight but the chaos of the combat overwhelmed him as desperate men fought one on one one moment esk kar found himself practically surrounded by attackers in the next the clashing waves of men left him almost alone a dismounted barbarian flung himself upon sisuthros and pulled him from his horse the two men rolled together at esk kars feet he reached down and pushed his swords point into the barbarians back as the warrior raised his knife for the killing blow then sisuthros was forgotten as another warrior rode at esk kar leaning forward over his lance and screaming his war cry esk kar had faced lances before and knew he only had to turn the point a few inches to survive he kicked his horse forward hugging the animals neck and keeping his arm rigid and his sword low until the lance point passed over the tip of the blade then esk kar pushed his sword out and up catching the wood just behind the bronze tip and feeling it burn its way across his arm his arm stayed locked and his blade straight as the horses crashed together the hilt of his weapon smashed against the mans chest before the impact wrenched the sword from his grasp the collision sent esk kars horse to its haunches esk kar pitched backward and fell going heels over head as he hit the earth from the ground everything looked different and more frightening a barbarian spotted the easy victim and twisted his horse around to head for him but a dozen steps from esk kar the horse suddenly reared up an arrow protruding under its neck its rider suddenly fighting for control of the dying animal esk kar scrambled over to the warrior hed just killed and retrieved his sword grabbing the hilt with both hands esk kar braced one foot on the body and heaved with all his might pulling the sword free of both earth and carcass an arrow hissed by his head but he didnt know who shot it or where it went his horse back on its feet spun and twisted in panic too confused to get free of the melee three quick steps and esk kar launched himself across the back of the beast nearly going over the other side struggling to regain control of the terrified mount he called out to it so that it would recognize his voice it took a moment to shift his weight and lock his knees on the horse as he reached forward for the halter another arrow hissed just beyond the horses neck and this time esk kar looked up to see another red clad barbarian pitching off his horse a few paces away the moment esk kar had the halter the animal steadied looking around he saw the alur meriki being pressed back oraks men hacking away like fiends he stretched his body upward in an effort to see more of the battle esk kar spotted six or seven warriors still pressing forward against the yellow riders the red standard moved closer to a small knot of the unknown tribesmen follow me orak follow me esk kar bellowed as he urged the horse forward aiming the beast straight at the red standard orak orak he screamed as he crashed the horse against a rider knocking the other mans beast back and slashing down with his sword then esk kar burst into their midst hacking left and right screaming to his men to follow the fighting madness came over him again no thoughts no fear just strike and strike again hed pushed through the line of barbarians who had turned to face the men from orak now he reached the backs of those alur meriki fighting the weakening group of yellow riders he stabbed his sword into the haunches of one horse then slashed at the head of another wild eyed mount the stricken and terrified beasts reared up lashing out with their hooves their screams joining the battle din esk kar drove his horse between the two wounded horses killing one man outright as he struggled to regain control of his mount esk kar then turned toward the other and struck downward at the mans arm a burst of blood and a scream erupted as the mans hand disappeared severed at the wrist esk kar whirled forward once again hed nearly broken through the alur meriki ranks but one of the red warriors wheeled to face him the two horses standing shoulder to shoulder as the swords clashed a thick bodied warrior in the full strength of manhood he struck down at esk kars head esk kar blocked the blow but the man struck again and again the strokes pushed esk kars blade back giving him no time for a counterstroke esk kar fought harder trying to overcome with sheer strength what he couldnt do with skill but the alur meriki proved as strong and determined esk kar jerked at the halter trying to disengage but his horse was trapped from behind he felt his sword arm growing weaker and saw the gleam of victory in his enemys eyes that light suddenly flickered out when a heavy feathered shaft appeared as if by magic at the base of the mans throat the dying mans horse felt his masters knees relax and yielded to the pressure of esk kars mount he rode past the man whose dying eyes turned toward him as he pushed by esk kars right arm shook with weakness but he kicked his horse forward and struck down another man from behind an alur meriki rider appeared and crashed his horse into esk kars esk kar tumbled yet again to the ground but an orak rider arrived and cut the barbarian down almost in the same instant esk kar gained his feet and lurched toward the last few alur meriki still fighting to reach the leader of the yellow riders esk kar saw that the clan chief of the yellow riders had been wounded and unhorsed with a single warrior standing in front of him for protection again esk kars sword stabbed into the rear quarters of a horse that turned in pain and bucked its rider off hindquarters lashing out and nearly catching esk kar in the face an arrow hissed by and struck down another red marked warrior as esk kar raised his sword to slash at the legs of the last rider the alur meriki saw the danger turned and swung his sword at eskkar he tried to parry the heavy blow but his sword arm trembled with exhaustion the impact pushed esk kars blade back and nearly tore the weapon from his grasp the force of the blow knocked esk kar to his knees and he struggled to meet the warriors killing stroke but the final stroke never came the last of the yellow warriors struck the horse a savage blow on the fetlock crippling the animal and sending it into a frenzy before it sank to its knees in pain and terror the alur meriki rider fi ghting to keep his seat raised his sword toward esk kar then turned his eyes toward the last of the yellow warriors his instant of indecision cost him not only his life but also any chance to strike a blow esk kar still on his knees thrust out with his sword at his assailant now just within reach lunging forward with his whole body determined to strike one more blow to thrust his blade into his enemys body even if he took a death blow in return the blades of esk kar and the yellow clad warrior struck at the last alur meriki warrior from either side and the man grunted in agony before he died with esk kars sword low in his stomach and the barbarians blade thrust under his armpit the struggling horse fell on its side tearing the sword from esk kars grasp he struggled to get back on his knees and finally managed it eskkar reached out and tried to pull his sword free but couldnt the fatigued muscles in his trembling arm refusing to obey and he found himself unable to get to his feet letting go of the hilt in disgust esk kar fumbled for his knife but there was no need looking around he saw the fight was over no warrior wearing red survived only the men from orak and the yellow barbarians remained alive and they immediately began eying each other esk kar forced himself to his feet knowing the moment of danger had come he struggled to catch his breath and his legs shook with exertion and excitement he raised his voice and shouted to his men to dismount and put away their weapons the warrior who had shared the final kill with esk kar turned to help pull his fallen chief to his feet the younger man holding the bloody sword hed pulled from the dead alur meriki looked suspiciously at eskkar his chief called to his men who moved quickly toward him lowering their weapons as they came apparently the chief shared esk kars concern about more fi ghting the younger warrior repeated the chief s words in a louder voice and this time they made some sense to esk kar who hadnt heard his native tongue spoken for some time at least they werent going to start killing each other if esk kar understood the chief s words as esk kars men gathered around him swords still in their hands but pointing at the ground mitrac joined the group his face flushed with excitement esk kar wanted to get his men aside to make sure nothing unexpected happened he tried to speak but couldnt get the words out he took a deep breath and tried again get the horses stand over there he stopped as maldar stepped up to him and took esk kars left arm and placed it over his shoulder sisuthros moved to his other side and grasped him around the waist youre wounded sisuthros said looking down at esk kars right arm covered in blood aye and you cant stand for shaking maldar added we need to bandage that arm before you bleed to death and take a look at that leg the two half carried him to a spot near the canyon wall where the carnage had left some empty space then set him down no wonder his right arm had betrayed him esk kar realized as he glanced down at the blood that ran from shoulder to wrist it must have happened when he turned the lance thrust the weapons tip had sliced open half the length of his arm esk kar felt his left leg trembling uncontrollably and saw a huge bruise already arisen in the center of his thigh getting knocked off his horse must have done that suddenly waves of pain shot through his leg making him gasp his eyes didnt want to focus he cursed as he realized that if his thigh bone had snapped he was as good as dead unable to ride and so far from orak his men propped him against an outcropping of rock and maldar ripped a garment off one of the dead and tore it into strips sisuthros held a water skin to esk kars lips until he could swallow no more then poured more over the cut in his arm to rinse most of the blood off and clean the wound before maldar quickly and efficiently bound it up how many dead esk kar sat there stoically as they worked on him sisuthros and maldar looked at each other everyone mentally counting four are missing sisuthross grim voice removed the smiles of victory from their faces and the horses esk kar had to force the words out what of the boys sisuthros turned and ordered one man to go back to the canyon entrance and bring back the boys and horses one boy is dead mitrac squatted on the ground near esk kars feet i saw him fall they were told to stay back esk kar said angrily a village boy wouldnt have lasted a moment in that fight and the other im not sure mitrac answered they both joined the fight but i didnt see him fall hes probably dead too i owe you my life mitrac at least twice that i remember he turned to maldar sitting on the ground a few steps away and to you too maldar esk kar turned back to mitrac and saw his quiver of arrows held only two shafts better go and collect your arrows before the strangers use them for firewood he looked to sisuthros who seemed to have no major wounds a wave of dizziness swept over esk kar and he had to fight to keep his thoughts from wandering his leg began to tremble again and he gripped his knee to stop it look after the mens wounds and see to the horses they went off to do his bidding and esk kar leaned back against the rock as another wave of dizziness blurred his vision he closed his eyes for a moment it must have been a long moment for he suddenly sat upright looking around in confusion ishtars blood he must have fallen asleep a leader should never show such weakness in front of his men esk kar tried to get up but maldar pushed him back down and held on to his good arm rest easy captain you passed out for a while youve lost a lot of blood esk kar recognized honest affection in his voice and we got some good news as well captain zantars alive they found him under a pile of bodies knocked senseless the barbarians were stripping his body when he awoke scared the piss out of him they did maldar laughed at the thought and one boy is still alive that rat of a pickpocket he added referring to the petty thief whod begged and pleaded his way on the mission his arms smashed up pretty bad but he may live he wont cut any more purses though esk kar tried to think theyd lost only three men if zantar survived two veterans and one of the newer recruits not a bad trade to finish off a war party of this size he wondered what the other tribes losses had been glancing around they looked to have scarcely more men standing than those surrounding esk kar sisuthros returned slumping on the ground next to esk kar four dead counting the boy and we lost three horses not counting yours which one of the barbarians seems intent on keeping for himself the rest of us are in pretty fair shape only minor cuts and bruises we should go back to the stream and get cleaned up or at least send for more water no one knew why wounds washed with clean water healed faster than unwashed ones yes if they can ride send them back to the stream bring water back for the others ill take care of it sisuthros maldar pushed himself to his feet you stay and keep an eye on these barbarians in a few moments maldar had collected all the intact water bags he could find and he and two others rode off sisuthros leaned close to his captain and kept his voice low i told the men to keep their weapons close in case they try anything just make sure we dont start any trouble esk kar wanted their help not another fight captain the barbarians are stripping all the dead of their valuables some of our men tried to do the same but the barbarians put their hands on their swords so they backed off dont worry about the loot esk kar said with a tired laugh after a battle all the captured weapons and trophies belong to the chief he divides it up according to how well each man fought or whos in most need tell the men theyll get their share a voice called out from the direction of the barbarians and esk kar twisted his head toward the battlefield the chief of the strange band moved toward him assisted by the same warrior whod stood over him during the last of the fight here comes their leader esk kar tried to get up but his leg failed him and he couldnt seem to manage with his one arm help me up sisuthros sisuthros put his arm under esk kars shoulder and started to lift but the younger warrior now only a few steps away called out in the trade language telling him to leave esk kar on the ground a few moments later the commander of the barbarians sat down gingerly opposite esk kar the young warrior stood directly behind his chief a grim look on his face greetings chief of the strangers i am mesilim leader of the ur nammu this is my son subutai he twisted his head slowly as if in pain to nod toward the warrior behind him mesilim had a great bruise on his forehead and cuts on both his arms bound up with rags already soaked in blood he spoke the language of the steppes people he paused then glanced at esk kars men sitting nearby esk kar realized his mistake when clan leaders spoke only the chief s family or his subcommanders could be present all others must be out of earshot lest they heard words not fit for their ears sisuthros move the men away sisuthros looked apprehensive but led the men about twenty paces away barely out of earshot esk kar waited until sisuthros returned sisuthros followed the example of the warrior and stood behind him my name is esk kar war leader of the village of orak and i give honor to the great clan leader mesilim who has killed many warriors this day esk kar looked up at the son and to his strong son who slew all alur meriki who dared to face him better too much praise than risk offending anyones honor your men fought bravely chief esk kar mesilim said but i would know why you joined the fight you ride and dress as people of the farms and theyve little love for any steppes people a delicate way to put it people of the farms was about the politest way a tribesman could say dirt digger still mesilim had made an effort my people fight the alur meriki is not the enemy of my enemy my friend we were on a scouting party when we saw your warriors attacked who would not join such brave fighters the hint of a smile crossed mesilims face esk kar wondered whether hed overdone the praise nevertheless mesilim and his men would have all been dead by now without esk kars help though of course the chief couldnt ever admit that out of respect and politeness esk kar couldnt mention it either its as you say chief esk kar the enemy of my enemy is my friend you saved many lives today including my own but can you tell me why you fight the alur meriki they are a clan of many many warriors and the people of the farms cannot stand against them it is not our wish to go to war against any of the steppes people chief mesilim but the alur meriki march toward our village with all their strength and weve chosen to fight rather than run esk kar saw disbelief cross mesilims face and guessed what mesilim was thinkingthat no farmers stood a chance against such a great force of warriors my village has many people almost as many as in the alur meriki tribe weve built a great stone wall around our village and we will fight the alur meriki from the wall not from horseback mesilim looked down at the ground too polite to show either his doubts or disgust with such an un warrior like strategy instead he explained his own clan my people first fought the alur meriki more than two years ago we fought bravely and killed many of them but they overwhelmed us with their greater numbers now the ur nammu are almost gone most of our warriors have been killed only we are left to carry on the fight almost all our women and children dead or taken by the alur meriki his voice couldnt conceal the sadness of his heart we fight on because ive sworn the shan kar against them though it might have been better if id fallen in battle today esk kar glanced up at subutai with even more respect many a son would put a knife in a fathers back some dark night rather than continue a death fight for thats what the shan kar proclaimed a fight to the death and mesilim had condemned his followers to that fate since they had no chance of victory the son must have great loyalty as well as great strength to protect such a father great chief theres much i would ask you regarding the alur meriki you have knowledge of my enemy and it would aid my people to learn these things from you if youd be willing to share your knowledge with me mesilim nodded yes weve much to talk about but first let us take care of the wounded bury the dead and divide the spoils itll be dark soon he offered up his hand to his son who reached down and helped him to his feet then escorted him back to the ur nammu his men rushed back as mesilim moved away their questions coming fast when they gathered around esk kar explained their position for now were considered to be friends to the ur nammu since we fought beside them theyll collect all the valuables from the dead and it will be divided later amongst all who fought by custom chief mesilim will make the division since he has the most warriors on the field we must bury our dead and tend to the wounded he saw doubt in some eyes and decided to explain further dont worry they could kill us easily if they chose to the ur nammu had about twenty five warriors still fit to fight these people have much knowledge about our enemy more than that they could help in our own fight so make sure you give no offense to any of them theyre all thats left of a proud people fighting a war to the death against our own foes now help me up sisuthros and maldar pulled him to his feet and watched as he tested his leg the swelling on his thigh looked enormous now but he took a few steps with their help and realized gratefully the bone hadnt broken or the leg would not have stood his weight nevertheless whenever he tried to put weight on it sharp pain lanced through him esk kar asked for a crutch of some kind maldar picked up a broken lance and gave it to him despite his injuries esk kar insisted on examining each of his men most of the wounds didnt appear too severe mainly cuts and slashes zantar knocked unconscious during the fight remained stretched out on the ground his eyes unfocused still woozy and barely coherent only mitrac had escaped without a scratch the surviving horse boy tammuz by name had the worst wound standing over him esk kar saw the boys left arm was badly broken probably in more than one place the slightest touch or movement brought a moan of agony to tammuzs lips well tammuz i see you disobeyed my orders next time maybe youll know better aside from the arm the rest of his cuts and bruises seemed minor enough i wanted to fight captain tammuz answered his voice thin as he fought back the tears even the effort to speak made him wince i killed one of them i did with the bow mitrac saw it im sure he did eskkar had brought two riding bows with the expedition but theyd been left behind with the other horses the foolish boys had strung them and followed behind the men when they could im sure you did tammuz rest now the broken arm was beyond esk kars ability to bandage and the boy would likely be dead in a day or two he turned to maldar give tammuz water then wine lots of it to ease his pain using his crutch esk kar turned and looked toward the ur nammu mesilim and his son nearly finished caring for their wounded had begun the burial process as esk kar watched several riders dashed off on some unknown errands while others started clearing a burial space against one of the canyon walls he hobbled toward mesilim leaning heavily on the crutch until he reached a knot of warriors around mesilim they eyed him curiously but parted to let him through mesilim looked up honorable chief esk kar began i have a wounded boy his arm is badly broken and is beyond our skills to set perhaps you have someone who can tend to him mesilim considered the request a boy must be tended last after the warriors we have a healer though he has his own wounds ill send him to you after our warriors are tended mesilim looked toward those men clearing the burial site well bury our dead there as soon as possible do you wish to put your dead with them yes we would gladly bury our men with yours thank you for the honor would it be allowed for my men to help digging the burial mound a mass grave would have to be dug out of the hilly earth deep enough to keep wild animals out it would take many mens efforts to get it done we have one digging tool with us that might make the work easier eskkar added i must consult my men about that mesilim replied any handling of the dead must be done with great care and the proper rituals to make sure their spirits rested in peace for all time mesilim began speaking to his son and two warriors each had something to say but they all seemed to agree he turned back to esk kar your men may help us and we are grateful your dead will honor our own esk kar bowed in thanks and walked to his men leaning heavily on the stick and clenching his teeth against the pain mesilim will send a healer to help with the tammuz you didnt call anyone whod killed an enemy in battle a boy gather our dead and prepare them for burial then all who can dig will help mesilims men prepare the grave we bury our dead with theirs and they honor our own by the offer what are they doing now sisuthros asked a dozen or so warriors had mounted horses and ridden off half of them leading spare animals theyll gather the bodies from the other battleground after everyone is buried the corpses of the alur meriki will be left to rot on top of the grave and to feed the carrion so all will know how many died here then i think well all get out of this damned canyon leaving all this behind sounded better and better every moment flies buzzed everywhere and vultures and crows circled above waiting their chance attracted by the blood and death esk kar tried to ignore the coppery blood smell that wanted to make him retch he saw mitrac swat at a fly mitrac have you recovered your arrows yet the guilty look on the boys face answered the question go find your shafts we may need them again and while youre doing that count the number of your kills it would give the young man something to do sisuthros leave one man to watch zantar and the tammuz the rest of you get the shovel and start digging digging turned out to be too much for esk kar who found he couldnt put any extra strain on his leg but five of his men began digging alongside the ur nammu and the small bronze shovel theyd brought with them proved a big help in all twenty men were soon digging as hard as they could though esk kar knew darkness would fall long before they finished mesilim planned for that as well two men returned carrying firewood they started a fire then rigged up some branches to serve as torches strips of fat torn from the dead horses would keep them burning esk kars men dug as hard as the tribesmen to prove themselves as strong and tough as their newfound friends despite their help it took twenty five men nearly four hours to dig a pit long and deep enough to hold almost fifty bodies that included the ur nammu killed in the earlier fi ghting those bodies were brought to the gravesite tied two to a mount almost two thirds of mesilims people had died today theyd fought bravely and if their numbers had been more evenly matched they might have defeated the alur meriki by themselves now only about twenty five ur nammu warriors many of them wounded remained to carry on their leaders sworn vengeance darkness fell and men built up the fire and lit more torches an hour later the moon rose and helped illuminate their work nevertheless the effort exhausted every man who finally staggered from the pit by the gods captain sisuthros appeared ready to fall down so much dirt covered him that his eyes gleamed white in the torchlight i dont think ive ever worked as hard he looked around at the other equally tired orak men and grinned but we showed them that we could keep up get yourself some water then bring our dead here one of the ur nammu began chanting a death song to consecrate the ground and prepare it to receive the bodies esk kar and his men stood and watched silently in the firelight until the brief ceremony ended mesilim walked stiffly but on his own over to esk kar you may put your men at this end of the pit to signify the direction from which you came well cover your dead with ours to protect them in the afterlife we thank you for honoring our dead esk kar replied formally then nodded to sisuthros who began moving the bodies into the ground the ur nammu bodies followed each corpse handled as gently as possible legs straightened out and arms crossed over their chest at last all the dead rested at the bottom of the pit esk kar approached the end of the grave where his men lay completely covered by the other bodies in a loud voice he spoke the words that gave honor to the dead calling out each mans name and his deeds so that the goddess ishtar and great god marduk would know to receive and honor true warriors when esk kar stepped back mesilim strode to the other end and did the same though his words lasted longer and included more details of the bravest at last all the gods demons and shades were appeased the men began refilling the hole a process that took almost as long as the digging because of the need to tamp down the earth as tightly as possible when theyd filled in the grave the warriors walked their horses back and forth across the dirt to pack it even harder by the time they fi nished midnight approached making it much too dangerous to try to leave the canyon esk kars men found a clear space as far away from the killing ground as possible everyone fell to the earth wrapped in their horse blankets and slept the sleep of the completely exhausted all of them too tired to eat or worry about anyone slitting their throats in the middle of the night the morning sun woke esk kar he sat up with a start then flinched in pain lifting his hand he shaded his eyes and looked around the camp his men were moving about except zantar and tammuz who remained in their blankets mesilims healer had done his best for the boys arm but his screams had echoed through the camp despite the wine poured into him hed fainted twice during the ordeal now the boy slept but feverishly nothing more could be done tammuz would recover or die assuming riding a horse didnt fi nish him off someone left a water skin at hand and esk kar emptied it before he got to his feet fighting the pain in his leg he hobbled back and forth a few times his teeth gritted until the stiffness in his limbs lessened and he felt confident the leg wouldnt give out at least he didnt need the crutch esk kar checked the bandage on his arm no fresh blood stained the crude dressing though pain accompanied any sudden movement in daylight he saw blood dirt and even worse covered his body the rank smell turned his stomach morning captain maldar walked over the barbarians brought in some more firewood well have fresh horsemeat soon bile rose in esk kars throat at the thought of food and he had to swallow before he could speak i want to wash in the river bring me my horse good idea captain the rest of us have already cleaned up the men had gone to the river and returned while he slept esk kar swore at his weakness maldar returned leading the horse then held it while esk kar mounted cautiously he rode slowly out of the valley ignoring the throbbing in his thigh and the dizzy feeling in his head at the bank of the stream he dismounted wincing as his leg took the sudden weight he let himself fall into the slow moving water where he washed his body and his clothes at the same time the effort exhausted him so he lay back in the cold water until the last of the stink and dried blood faded away when esk kar could stand the cold no longer he pulled himself out and rested next to the stream letting the suns rays warm him as they dried his garments he thought about what the day would bring when he returned to the canyon he found his men standing about waiting the horses had been fed and watered weapons cleaned and the wounded tended the ur nammu had completed the burial pit a single lance buried in the earth blade thrusting skyward marked the site a long yellow streamer bearing the sign of the ur nammu fl uttered from the tip more prayers had been chanted to appease the gods and sanctify the ground the bodies of the alur meriki lay in a tangled heap around the lance theyd be left to the carrion eaters so all would know theyd been conquered in death as well as in life when the alur meriki discovered this place they would leave the bodies untouched and unburied the dead would suffer in the afterlife for their defeat one of mesilims warriors greeted him with a slice of well roasted horseflesh the meat burned almost black and nearly too hot to hold eskkar wolfed it down surprised at his hunger it took a second strip to satisfy him mesilim walked over chief esk kar were ready to leave this place well camp on the other side of the stream ill send scouts out in case another war party arrives if one does well all be dead it took time to load the men and animals with the captured weapons food and loot at last they walked their horses from the canyon their pace dictated by the wounded men and animals as eskkar left the canyon he glanced back at the place where so many had died already a flock of vultures and other birds fought over the dead flesh the steppes people had lived and died this way for generations it might be as good a way to die as any other though he hoped his bones would find peace under a patch of earth someday instead of above they camped at the small stream where esk kar had bathed earlier everyone felt glad to be out of the maze of canyons and back on the sparse grasses where the air didnt smell of blood a dead tree provided firewood and more horsemeat soon sizzled on the flames esk kar talked with zantar hed recovered his senses and could speak coherently zantar had an enormous bruise on his forehead strangely the man remembered nothing of the fight or even the hours leading up to it and had to be told in detail what happened as for tammuz he remained fretful they had no more wine to give him theyd supported the boy on his horse during the brief ride to the stream but he fainted again when they lifted him down mesilims healer examined his patient and rebound the injured arm tightly to the boys side to prevent further damage now tammuz slept on the soft grass his head pillowed by a horse blanket he tossed and murmured in his sleep three ur nammu scouts rode off while other lookouts took up posts on the surrounding hills finally all the animals had been fed and watered the men had eaten a second time and the time for talk had arrived mesilim and his son came to esk kar he kept sisuthros with him even though sisuthros did not understand the language the four men found a quiet place on a grassy knoll a hundred paces from the stream where they could speak privately esk kar shared what information he had about the alur meriki then listened to what mesilim had to say esk kar asked many questions about the numbers and movements of the alur meriki as they spoke the leaders sketched a map in the dirt between them using twigs stones and knives to represent various landmarks now i understand why they march as they did mesilim remarked we wondered what they searched for in their movements and why they didnt ride to the west it will not bode well for you and your village when they do mesilim i truly believe we can resist them esk kar said ill have many bowmen to man the wall or swing a sword esk kar didnt wait for their polite concurrence but id like to have your clans assistance in my fight if you help us i believe you can satisfy your shan kar without sacrificing the rest of your men the shan kar is to the death subutai answered firmly weve all sworn the oath and theres no turning aside esk kar nodded gravely of course im a stranger to your clan subutai and ignorant of your ways but cannot a shan kar be satisfied by a great defeat of the enemy in battle at least thats what ive heard they knew esk kar came from the steppes probably from the alur meriki clan theyd just fought but diplomacy prevailed neither mesilim nor his son wanted to ask any questions whose answers might offend them thats true mesilim responded but were not numerous enough to create a great battle the days of our clan are numbered and we will not recover our strength before were overwhelmed in a few days another ten or twelve warriors and a handful of women will join us and that is all of the ur nammu esk kar hadnt known any more of them survived but took that as good news orak is strong enough to create a great battle we have almost as many people as in the tribe and more come every day it will take all of the might of the alur meriki to capture our village if you join with us then you could share in the great battle if we win your shan kar would be satisfied and if you fight with us i can help your people with weapons horses and supplies mesilim and subutai exchanged glances a shan kar sworn in the heat of defeat two years ago condemned them all to death we must satisfy our honor esk kar mesilim said his head held high but if there be such a way esk kar breathed a silent sigh of relief then reached to the ground and rearranged the twigs and stones heres the tigris to the north three small twigs bent at angles to show the big curve of the river and heres orak a small stone set next to the twig the main body of the alur meriki are here he placed a larger stone near the river the two raiding parties he put two pebbles at the lower end of the tigris will sweep everything in their path toward orak and in six or seven weeks the entire clan will be camped before oraks walls mesilim nodded except for one other war party esk kar picked up a stone and set it across the tigris opposite orak this party will cut off those who try to flee and then round up the cattle and horses weve sent across the river this will be a smaller party probably seventy or eighty warriors just enough to hold the river and scour the countryside with your help i will ambush this party and kill all of them esk kars knife traced a groove northward along the tigris after they are slain your people can ride north cross the river well upstream then turn south and strike their main camp from behind at the height of the battle there should be few watching their rear because they know theyve killed everyone in their path the camp should be lightly defended you can ride in and capture as many women and horses as you need to rebuild your tribe his knife traced another line going northeast then you can return to these mountains far to the north and rebuild your clan if you remain north of the isogi river you can help guard oraks borders well establish trade with your people and even give you protection should you need it esk kar planted the blade firmly in the earth how will this satisfy shan kar subutais curiosity got the better of him even if were victorious the alur meriki will still be undefeated careful this has to be said properly esk kar took a deep breath the alur meriki have planned this attack on orak for many months all their marches and raids have been done only to put their full might against our village they know were fortifying orak and building a wall but they think we cannot stop them if they fail to capture orak if they are forced to move south without taking the village then they will have failed in their plan by fighting alongside us youll help defeat the alur meriki in a great battle that should satisfy the shan kar whether it did might be open to debate but it offered a way to save face and would look a lot better than fighting to the death without any hope of survival and another battle would satisfy honor esk kar put his hands on his knees and leaned back hed made the offer as best he could now mesilim would have to decide the ur nammu leader pondered esk kars words for a long time the alur meriki will return in another ten or fifteen years he said finally even if you drive them away now you may be defeated later esk kar and trella had talked about that possibility often enough times are changing mesilim i believe that when the alur meriki return all of the countryside around orak will be defended and the walls of orak will be higher and stronger than they are now with many more trained defenders ive seen what can be done to prepare for the onslaught and weve learned much the future is always shrouded in mystery but i believe orak will survive and it will be the alur meriki who are again driven off how would we get across the river subutais subtle question left no doubt as to where the younger man stood his words would send the same message to his father when youre ready esk kar went on in a few weeks cross the lines again and come to orak we have a ferry to move your men and horses across the river well watch for your coming and escort you in lest anyone attack you by mistake why do you do all this esk kar mesilim countered and why are you so concerned about warriors across the great river if i cannot destroy all the barb alur meriki on the west bank those who escape will warn the main camp if even a few survive it could be disastrous for orak a dozen men could set the land ablaze weve no provision for war parties on that side of the tigris and we dont have enough men to guard our livestock the villagers would lose heart to find their herds destroyed or scattered we need that livestock to rebuild the herds once the alur meriki have gone esk kar stared into the eyes of the chief i need to tell my people i can destroy those alur meriki on the west bank and get back to orak in time to man the walls i must destroy them completely and i cannot do so on open ground i dont have enough horses or men who know how to ride them so i need your help to make sure theyre driven into some trap where i can kill them with my archers and use your warriors to make sure none escape i will speak of this with subutai and the other leaders mesilim said well give you an answer by nightfall he stood up then extended his hand to help esk kar to his feet you are you were born on the steppes now youve cast your lot with farmers and herders of goats and sheep and they will never accept you fully do you not wish sometimes to return to the life of a warrior it was not a casual question mesilim offered him a choiceesk kar could ride with them if he chose the offer tempted him but the thought of trella banished the idea many times mesilim many times ive wished to return to the warriors life on the plains and steppes but ive lived too long with the villagers and im more used to their ways than those of our fathers and i have a woman a gifted one who calls me back to her side but if fate is not kind to me then i will remember your words even if you win can you be sure of how youll be treated afterward mesilims concern showed he understood much about villager ways its true there is much treachery among the village leaders but ive learned much in the last few months and my power grows each day also my woman gives me good advice in these matters barbarians thought one woman much like another they also believed any warrior who listened too carefully to his woman showed weakness nevertheless esk kar had referred to trella as a gifted one and perhaps mesilim understood the power and strength of a woman who occasionally showed such wisdom and strength of character as to be accepted at the council fires mesilim nodded in understanding weve fought together and we can never break the bond of thanks the ur nammu owe you now we must decide our own future he turned and his son followed esk kars men waited curiosity whetted by watching the four men speak for almost two hours he stopped in front of them mesilim has told us everything he knows about the barbarians ive asked him to join us in our fight if he accepts i think he can help us if he chooses another path then ours will be much harder esk kar turned toward the sudden activity that had broken out in the camp in a moment esk kar understood the commotion enough for now its time to divide the spoils that task took the rest of the morning and lasted into the afternoon at a maddeningly slow pace esk kar forced himself to smile and remain patient the spoils were divided equitably with esk kars men getting a little more than what he would have considered their due so no one complained esk kars share filled a sack trella would find good use for the gold and jewels the kills had to be counted as well another involved task that required much sifting of evidence as to who killed whom how it was done and who witnessed it esk kar received credit for eight kills though he doubted the number was that high he certainly hadnt killed the last warrior himself though both he and subutai received equal credit for that body the highest number of kills went to mitrac whose arrows were found in fourteen bodies plus more than a half dozen horses esk kar thanked whatever gods protected archers that no arrow had struck any ur nammu mesilim personally presented mitrac with a gold and copper ring of great value in addition to the double handful of jewels and gold nuggets the boy had earned as his share afterward many ur nammu touched mitrac and his bow for luck and all wanted to know whether the rest of the villagers had weapons such as his everyone spent the rest of the day eating and resting esk kar agreed that his men could use the time to heal their wounds subutai persuaded mitrac to demonstrate his archery skills and some warriors matched him shot for shot until the distance grew too great for their smaller bows the force of his weapon impressed all the warriors even a hit that might not be fatal would send a man to the ground unable to fight any further the feasting extended into the evening with still no decision from mesilim esk kar found himself a little withdrawn from the circle of his men finally he got up and walked over to the stream to relieve himself sisuthros came over to join him when they finished esk kar started back but sisuthros held his arm keeping him out of earshot of the men sitting around the fire captain i would speak with you theres something i have to say turning to face his commander esk kar heard the strain in his voice what is it sisuthros unhappy with the spoils even in the moonlight esk kar saw confusion on the mans face captain i there is he stopped and fumbled for a moment with his belt then brought out a small pouch he handed to esk kar this is gold twenty pieces that i was given before we left orak it was understood that another ten would be mine if you didnt return esk kar felt his face flush with anger for a moment he wanted to strike sisuthros down kill him for what hed been planning but the rage passed if it hadnt been sisuthros it would have been someone else a man always had enemies and as esk kar grew more powerful the number of enemies would increase besides he needed a fighter like sisuthros both now and probably even more in the future esk kar hefted the pouch in his hand thirty gold pieces thats a great amount of gold he handed the pouch back there wasnt much light but he detected surprise on the mans face dont you want to know who gave this gold to me or why i already know sisuthros even before we left orak thats why i selected you to come with me caldor isnt very careful with his words nicars whelp should keep his mouth shut sisuthross eyes widened in astonishment esk kar remembered trellas wordsalways act as if you know more than youre saying who else of the nobles approached you nestor i was in the tavern one night and they bought wine then we went for a walk they said you were no longer needed that others could take over now that the preparation was well begun they worry you will have too much power and will turn on them once the barbarians are gone that is nestor fears that caldor hates you for some other reason his anger is strong esk kar its because of trella hes insulted that shes quicker in her wits than he and that shes listened to by the families he wanted her when she was in nicars house now he wants me dead to have her for himself he cares nothing about the future of orak and hes too stupid to see he might be destroying someone who could save his life trella befriended my wife and watched over my child sisuthross voice hardened as he caught the drift of esk kars words i didnt know he lusted after her youre right he is a fool the young man stood there for a moment and im a fool as well you saved my life in the battle esk kar if you knew of this why did you do so you could have let the barbarian kill me i saved your life because youre a good man with sharp wits and because i need you to help defend orak but youve much to learn they would never let you live even if i were killed no matter what they promised youre too young to command so many men and i doubt you would have seen any more gold the nobles want no strong captain of the guard who might have opinions of his own why do you think they put up with ariamus all these years because he was greedy and they knew they could control him through his greed nestors just an old fool who doesnt realize the barbarians will return even stronger than they are now esk kar laughed or maybe i saved your life because i didnt have time to think about it i wouldve done the same for any of my men as would you im not sure what i would have done in your place i took the gold and what were you going to do esk kars voice hardened kill me in front of the men challenge me to a fight or murder me in my sleep you had plenty of chances and its still a long way to orak i dont know what i wanted i didnt want to do anything i wish id never taken the gold but i did perhaps i am not the man you think i am he heard the anguish in sisuthross words then become the man you should be esk kar gripped sisuthross shoulder forget the gold look at these barbarians theyll slit each others throats over a woman or an insult but in battle they die for their comrades because thats the code of the warrior you are a warrior sisuthros but if you deal with merchants and shopkeepers on their terms then that is what you will become sisuthros stared at the ground im not worthy to be under your command his voice choked with emotion youve treated me fairly promoted me and i nearly betrayed you even these strange barbarians respect you and what do you want now do you want me to hate you no i think ill give you more responsibility because youve earned it earned it by what you did yesterday when you followed me into the canyon though i saw in your eyes you thought we rode to our death but you will earn more honors by what you do from now on and when this is over theres even more that will be asked of you and greater rewards to be had you would reward me after what ive done done you havent done anything except listen to a young fool and an old fool in a tavern youre not a murderer sisuthros he moved closer listen to me when this is over well have to rebuild the countryside youll be a ruler in a village of your own and well fight the next wave of barbarians together forget about caldor and nestor they dont understand whats at stake here ill kill caldor and nestor then sisuthross voice was hard again ill throw the gold in their faces and kill them nestor is nothing but killing caldor would give me great pleasure but not yet because we a call from the campfire interrupted him and esk kar turned toward the firelight to see mesilim coming toward them well talk more of this later sisuthros but remember you showed great courage yesterday and we fought together against great odds thats more important than gold esk kar stepped back to his mens fire circle to receive the ur nammu chieftain chief esk kar mesilim began formally his voice loud and clear in the night ive met with the elders of the clan weve agreed to join you in your fight and help you defeat the alur meriki tomorrow we will begin our preparations mesilim extended his arm and esk kar clasped his hand around the chieftains forearm they had sealed the bargain publicly and according to custom now their fates intertwined at least for the next battle i must go and tell the rest of my warriors mesilim turned away and returned to his own campfire shouts of joy mixed with battle cries greeted the news as mesilims men learned they had both a chance to live and an opportunity to regain some of what theyd lost the shan kar will be satisfied esk kar thought later as he settled in for sleep wishing he had some wine to numb the pain that throbbed in his thigh ive gained an ally not only for the battle across the river but perhaps for the future should i need to keep the villagers in check and sisuthros will be loyal at least for now trella will be pleased he thought and he drifted off to sleep with her face in his dreams ten days later just before sunset esk kar and his weary band of riders topped the last hill and saw the village of orak after spending three days resting with the ur nammu they had all ridden hard in a northerly circle to throw any pursuers off their trail then the two groups had split up with the ur nammu turning toward the mountains the well rested ur nammu clan would travel quickly and leave a plain trail like men who had enough of hard fighting and only wanted to escape they would ride far to the east wait a week or ten days then return to monitor the progress of the alur meriki with luck theyd slip back through the lines before the barbarians closed them tight around orak meanwhile esk kar and his band headed back to the west riding as hard as they dared but always favoring the horses during the journey esk kar spoke often with sisuthros they would ride side by side letting the others stay ahead after a few such conversations esk kar felt his subcommander had acquired a new respect for his captain and the difficulties they all faced even from afar esk kar saw the wall had grown the eastern side the one that would bear the brunt of the attack had been completed as had the great wooden gate already blackened by fire to harden it and make it resistant to flames on each side of the gate towers rose up even higher to protect the entrance as esk kar and his men drew closer someone recognized them even at that distance esk kar could hear the roar of welcome that steadily increased in volume men and women began pouring out of the gate some running toward them a few claiming vantage spots on the roadway while others stood shoulder to shoulder atop the new wall at the outskirts of the village he turned to his men mitrac you go first then ill follow and try to look like fighting men instead of tired old women for a change the men laughed as he knew they would he could call them anything now during their time with the ur nammu esk kar had thought about what else he could do to strengthen their bond to him and an idea had occurred to him he would form a new clan not a clan of men related by blood but a clan of arms he had spoken of it while they rested with the ur nammu and all the men had eagerly accepted the idea most had no kin or close friends and this new clan would give them a brotherhood to make up for what they lacked theyd have something greater than themselves to belong to and theyd share a bond of allegiance to their new brothers so they had sworn a great oath of loyalty first to each other and then to esk kar afterward zantar took needle and black thread and stitched a crude outline of a hawk on each of their tunics the hawk represented both strength and fierceness esk kars hawk clan was born resurrecting the symbol of his fathers clan in the alur meriki now they returned as true warriors proven in battle and united in a clan of honor each man sat a little straighter on his mount ignoring his wounds and aches mitrac carried his bow upright a thin strip of leather with fourteen thumb bones hanging from its tip esk kar had eight bones dangling from his sword belt and the rest carried their bones in a similar fashion they walked the horses the last hundred paces unable to move any faster because of the crowd riding at the rear was tammuz the boy had surprised them all by surviving his wounds though he still grimaced in pain from his arm he sat proudly on his mount though maldar held the halter tammuz carried the small bow in his good hand displaying his single trophy esk kars eyes searched the crowd until he spotted trella waiting just outside the gate a smile on her normally reserved features her guard stood behind her and nobody in the crowd dared to push in front of her seeing her brought a grin to his face and as he rode through the gate he reached down and pulled her up to sit sideways in front of him the crowd laughed and cheered even louder as her arm went around his neck well girl ive returned and ive much to tell she could scarcely hear him over the noise the villagers continued to call his name and the skittish horses began to flatten their ears at the growing crowd the men dismounted and walked the horses to esk kars house the crowd followed behind still shouting with as much enthusiasm as if the barbarians had already been defeated arriving home esk kar ordered that tammuz be carried inside annok sur sent one of the women to fetch a healer esk kar went to the well and took advantage of his first opportunity to clean himself properly in over three weeks a servant brought clean clothes but esk kar only donned them after hed scrubbed as much of the horse scent from his body as he could maldar remained at esk kars house the men chose maldar as custodian for their loot to be stored in esk kars chambers until they called for it none of them ever had so much of value before and they didnt know what to do with it no one felt comfortable carrying all that gold on their persons they approached esk kar and asked him to guard it for them the idea of holding gold for others made him uncomfortable but he agreed his house was a safer place for their money than leaving it in the barracks they decided maldar and one other of the hawk clan would inspect the valuables once a week to make sure they remained safe each man took only what he needed for a few days of wine women and gambling alone in their rooms esk kar took trella in his arms and squeezed her tightly he stroked her hair and felt happy just to hold her the feel of her body aroused him and he would have taken her but the summons had already come from nicar reluctantly he let her go later esk kar trella and sisuthros sat down at nicars crowded table with all the families and their important followers present a feast had been declared for all villagers shouted and sang in the streets gladdened by esk kars return and a chance to celebrate nicar served his finest wine but esk kar took only a single cup when hed drunk half of it he refilled it with water wine no longer tempted him esk kar didnt want his wits dulled by wine he did eat enjoying the fresh bread and chicken nicars servants provided when he described the battle not a sound could be heard and he had to repeat the story adding more details sisuthros told part of the tale filling in the fight as hed seen it and telling of esk kars exploits their faces registered shock at what hed done that esk kar would risk his life to help another tribe of barbarians seemed incredible nevertheless they rejoiced to hear that together theyd wiped out seventy alur meriki the ur nammu will be of great use to us esk kar said ignoring the skeptical looks well meet them again and theyll keep track of the main force for us more questions kept coming and esk kar encouraged sisuthros to answer several while he studied the faces of caldor and nestor the old man just smiled revealing no emotion but young caldor did not repress an occasional flash of anger though he kept silent no doubt he wondered what his gold had purchased you will be dead soon caldor like drigos whelp and this time it will give me much more pleasure finally esk kar had a question of his own corio i see the east wall is complete how goes the rest of the work the new walls were not laid out strictly according to the compass the east side where the wall stood highest and where the main attack would come actually faced southeast toward the crossroad where the two main roads met to form a single track that led to the gate youve been gone three weeks corio said in that time weve made good progress and are ahead of schedule mostly due to the numbers of new men willing to bend their backs to avoid the barbarians the entire wall will be finished in less than three weeks and the river sluices and canals have been widened and are ready for release we can let loose the water and begin to flood the plains in less than one hour esk kar turned toward gatus and jalen and the men how goes their training sixty men finish training this week and another seventy will start gatus had a big grin on his face the training goes faster now that we have so many veterans by the time the barbarians arrive well have over four hundred and twenty well drilled men ready to defend the walls then theres much to give thanks for esk kar said and you are satisfied with our progress nicar esk kar im more than satisfied up to now ive been hopeful we could fend off the barbarians when we first spoke you promised me no better than an even chance now im sure that we have at least that especially now that you have returned the whole village worried while you were gone heads around the table nodded in agreement but now that you are back the people will have confidence again permit us to give thanks to the gods and to honor your return with a celebration tomorrow esk kar felt surprised by the warmth in nicars words but the sight of caldor clenching his jaw reminded him of what was to come im grateful to return nicar honored nobles but now i would like to return home and get some rest that ended the dinner everyone seemed excited by the prospect of a celebration the village hadnt relaxed for months and the people could do with a reason to cheer in the street outside nicars a few idlers lingered to shout greetings to esk kar and to his surprise trella as well they walked back to the house trellas hand in his he closed the door to their private chambers slid the wooden bolt into the hole with a sigh of satisfaction dont you want to eat more supper esk kar you hardly ate anything at nicars and we have much to talk about her smile looked the same as he remembered it yes trella im still hungry he took her into his arms and ran his hands over her body esk kar kissed her hungrily and she returned his passion rising up on her toes as she put her arms around his neck when they finally paused for breath she lifted up her arms and he drew her garment up over her head then let it drop he took her hands in his and stepped back to look at her letting his eyes feast on the sight of her naked body in the lamps flickering light before picking her up and carrying her to the bed two hours later trella arose and called down to the servants for food sitting at esk kars work table they ate another meal of bread and cold lamb washed down with watered wine for dessert trella peeled an apple while esk kar savored a handful of fresh dates she listened attentively as he described the trip and what hed learned when he finished she shook her head you leave too much out she put her hand on his i want to know everything about the battle what you thought what you saw why you did what you did even how your men reacted i know nothing about such things and if im to help you i need to know what and how men think in such situations unlike most fighting men esk kar found it difficult to talk about battle it was too personal too intense he knew hed dodged death too often to boast about his own skill all too aware that luck or chance was as important as ones prowess the terror of it all the horses screaming the stink of fear in the air and on mens bodies the knots in your chest when a sword slashed at you the trembling in your bowels the weakness of limb and mind afterward esk kar began again this time taking her as best he could through the entire episode starting from the hilltop when he first saw that the ur nammu would be trapped he tried to explain to her what thoughts rushed into his head and why he decided to help them he recalled the fear he saw in mitracs face as esk kar pushed him into the battle the tenseness and doubts of sisuthros who had never been involved in such a close fought battle and even the struggles of those esk kar fought and killed words and emotions he didnt know he possessed helped him describe something almost beyond description when he finished she took his hand and led him back to their bed and this time she made love to him with such tenderness that she left him weak and trembling afterward she bathed him again they relaxed in each others arms the light from the lamp almost gone the wick already smoldering but trella had more questions tell me more about mesilim and his son that led to the conversation with sisuthros the division of the spoils the formation of the hawk clan and eventually their return to orak eskkar even repeated conversations with tammuz and maldar surprised he could recall so many details by the time he finished the moon had risen high in the night you have done well husband better than well my father said that few men have the ability to command large numbers of fighting men youre such a man esk kar you saw your opportunity and you took your chance luck is the favor of the gods and its sometimes better to be lucky than skillful all your decisions were sound and youve prepared for the future by turning sisuthros back to your side and by establishing the hawk clan that will bind many fighting men to you youve established a family clan overnight seven men and a boy are not a large number he pointed out though pleased at her words but youre right we were lucky yes you were lucky you werent killed that you didnt lose all your men that the ur nammu didnt turn on you after the battle and kill you but tell me who else in orak would those men have followed into battle against seventy barbarians i can think of no man and youve proven yourself and your men in combat and now a thousand will follow wherever you lead as easily as did ten he thought about that for a few moments the men wouldnt have followed any one else into that canyon certainly no one in orak the more he thought about it it seemed unbelievable they had followed him at all but perhaps what she said might be possible perhaps he could command five hundred men or maybe even a thousand she interrupted his thoughts but you must not risk your life again never take such a chance youve proven your bravery you say you plan to take the soldiers against the barbarians on the other side of the river go if you must but do not fight in the front lines you cannot risk your life so carelessly youll be needed to defend orak and for what will come afterward a fi ghting man needs to fi ght trella or the men lose respect for him the battle across the river will be easier but i must be there to make sure its successful after that i will stay in the rear he let his fingers drift across her breasts his hands still delighted by her body and now perhaps you will reward me one more time she leaned down in the darkness and kissed him then dug her elbow sharply into his side making him gasp with surprise just like a man to think only of himself dont you want to hear what ive been doing while you were gone or do you think nothing happens without you he felt glad the darkness hid the guilty look that crossed his face indeed he hadnt thought much about her or her plans couldnt we talk of that tomorrow he ventured unable to keep the plaintive tone out of his voice no we cannot wait until tomorrow there is much that you need to know and youve had enough lovemaking for one night now would it not please you to know that the villagers panicked completely when they thought you were dead dead what made them think i was dead i spread the rumor youd been killed that is annok sur and i spread it the whole of orak had it in less than an hour and there was panic in the marketplace the villagers were afraid and people were getting ready to flee the village people shouted that we were lost without you to protect us and those people more friends of annok sur trellas voice held a satisfi ed tone nicar had to speak to the crowd and tell them it was merely a rumor that no news had as yet returned he spoke just in time and even i was brought to the marketplace to agree with him in a few more hours half the village would have been on the move many had already begun to pack their belongings and you did this to to make sure that nicar and the other families know how much they need you and to make sure the villagers understand that as well remember when the battle is over well need many friends to make sure youre accepted into the families now everyone knows youre favored by the gods so she had been busy he didnt bother to ask what she would have done if hed gotten himself killed she would have considered that possibility as well what else did you do while i was gone another hour passed as he listened to all she had to say the weariness gone from his eyes at last the talking ended and she curled up in his arms and held his hands against her body until they fell asleep esk kar was up before dawn the next morning the days activities started at the breakfast table with his subcommanders afterward he and sisuthros spent several hours with corio inspecting the wall by now both the soldiers and the laborers understood their roles and the work proceeded steadily corio needed only thirty soldiers to keep everyone at their tasks esk kar spent more hours inspecting the soldiers still in training that necessitated one more retelling of the battle in the hills he didnt mind these men needed to know as much about the enemy as possible and the more confidence they had in their leaders the better esk kar answered many questions regarding alur meriki fighting techniques the sun had passed its high point when trella rejoined him wearing a scarf to shield her head from the sun they walked through the village greeting the people and talking to them reassuring the villagers by their presence but esk kar had to grit his teeth and force a smile to his face when they visited the temple of ishtar and knelt in the shadows before the gloomy image of the goddess trella at his side esk kar gave thanks in a loud voice to ishtar for his victory repeating the words trella had suggested that morning he had never been in ishtars temple or any temple in orak for that matter since his familys death eskkar had no use for priests and their outstretched palms he stood there stoically hiding his impatience while the priest offered his interminable prayers to the deity for esk kars safe return at last the ceremonies ended when esk kar returned to the sunlight he felt as if he had escaped the demons dark underworld his smile returned as he took trellas hand and turned toward their home master have you forgotten our visit with rebba this afternoon she asked were already late and there may be much to see before the sun goes down esk kars feeling of contentment vanished he had forgotten about the meeting with rebba that was natural enough because he really didnt want to spend three or four hours with the noble responsible for the farms surrounding orak listening to him explain how to grow wheat or herd goats esk kar thought about postponing the meeting but hed done that several times before he departed on his scouting mission he knew trella considered it important important enough to arrange the visit as soon as possible on his return with no convenient excuse he forced another smile and changed his direction together they walked to the river gate then turned north two guards accompanying them once outside the village they increased their pace and esk kars muscles soon found the walk a good challenge after the weeks of hard riding the sun shone brightly and the air off the river smelled clean and fresh within orak a background smell of people and animals living too close together permeated the air after a few days you didnt notice it as much but esk kar had been breathing fresh air for several weeks finally they crossed the last of the innumerable irrigation ditches and entered the grounds of rebbas farm esk kar had never gone there before and unlike most of the farms hed seen this one had nearly a dozen huts scattered about rebbas dwelling didnt look much larger than any of the others grain storage places built higher than the average hut and recognizable by their high entrances reached only by ladders accounted for several of the structures attached to almost every building were corrals that held goats sheep or cattle esk kar and trella passed a few pigs that wandered by picking at anything on the ground and fighting with dozens of chickens for anything that crawled beneath them close to the main house several willow trees provided shade esk kar noted four good sized dogs taking their naps under the trees tame enough by day at night the dogs would guard the property from petty thieves the smell of animals hung in the air and trella wrinkled her nose as they passed the corrals though to esk kar the odor seemed more pleasant than the village air rebba greeted them at the door at home he didnt bother with the fine clothes he wore when business called him into orak today he wore a tunic as well worn as that of any field hand welcome to my home esk kar rebba offered his hand to esk kar as they arrived a spring day like this is too pleasant to spend indoors they sat on benches beneath a willow tree at a table whose surface was gouged and pitted no doubt from numberless days of chopping and cutting vegetables a young girl of nine or ten seasons one of rebbas grandchildren brought cool water for them to drink rebba waited until they drank before speaking i offer my congratulations again on your victory captain trella tells me that you wish to learn more about farming where would you begin esk kar knew nothing about farming and wished to know even less farmers were the least important people in orak in fact those that actually farmed the land rarely visited the village except for those few mostly wives that came each morning to sell their goods in the market or the men who visited the smiths to have some tool repaired nevertheless trella had insisted he learn something about farming so he put another smile on his face noble rebba i know little about farming i know that farmers provide much of the food for orak but i grew up among the barbarians and they dont think highly of farming they consider us dirt diggers do they not rebba answered with a laugh i suppose thats true enough but they do enough farming on their own despite what they think of us he saw the look of puzzlement on esk kars face ah i see that you are not aware of how important farming is even to the alur meriki he stroked his beard perhaps thats as good a place to begin as any he turned to trella sitting at esk kars side i understand you grew up in a village to the south did you learn the ways of the farmers there no noble rebba trella answered i know very little about the mysteries of the farmer and the herder then ill try to explain a little to you both a farm is not only a place to grow the wheat and barley but a place to hold herds of goats sheep and other food animals the barbarians herd their own flocks even as we do only they take them with them as they wander but they dont plant crops esk kar countered theyre never in one place long enough for crops to grow ah but they do harvest esk kar but they do it in a different way rebba smiled the alur meriki harvest crops as they travel looking for stands of barley emmer wheat even peas and other vegetables these crops they encounter along the way are as important to them as they are to us and there are many wild crops throughout the land such as wheat beans and flax they gather those as well esk kar accepted the correction well yes i know the women gather anything they find on the march exactly even warriors cannot live on meat alone they need milk and cheese from the goats and cows wool from the sheep as well as vegetables and fruits from the lands they pass through and of course they seize much grain and other crops from the farmers of the lands they occupy im sure you know a horse grows stronger and more powerful if fed a mixture of grains besides what it gathers grazing so farming is as important to them as it is to us yes horses need grain esk kar replied whenever possible horses are fed a mixture of grains before being ridden hard he began to think along the lines rebba had suggested and extra grain is carried to feed the horses when they raid while the women bake bread for the warriors to carry with them bread was light enough to carry on horseback as well as nourishing and would last longer without spoiling than meat esk kars men had done exactly the same when they rode out on their own scouting party hed forgotten these little details of steppes life and now he realized they might be more important than hed thought yes bread is very important to us all rebba agreed it is bread that feeds your soldiers more than that bread pays the wages of your soldiers without bread there would be no builders smiths taverns or weavers bread makes possible the trade on the river that brings you the lumber and ores from the north for your wall without bread there would be no gold no silver no horses no weapons without the farmer there would be no great village of orak despite himself esk kar had become interested im ashamed to admit i do not understand these things rebba but im willing to learn you learn very quickly esk kar as all of us have noticed rebba smiled at that and his eyes took in trella as well but thats all to the good if youre to defend the village you should understand these things and dont be embarrassed by your lack of knowledge few even in orak understand these things its like the mystery of counting that is a mystery i see you understand esk kar had never considered counting to be mysterious difficult to be sure and many men never grasped anything beyond the basic concept of ten fingers but as a soldier esk kar had been forced to learn to count many things like everyone he started with his fingers and some pebbles you used your fingers to count to ten then you moved a pebble from one hand to the other and started over again when you were finished you counted your pebbles knowing that each represented ten of whatever it was you were counting in this way you counted how many men you had exactly as you counted how many were with your adversary you counted your arrows your horses your weapons and even how many handfuls of grain you could feed to your horse i didnt know counting was a mystery rebba he said though i admit that i have difficulty when the sum is much over a hundred it is a very great mystery and one i believe was discovered as men learned to farm we learned to store grain in bushels baskets and sacks and then count the sacks for storage or trade farmers had to learn how to divide grain among themselves and they had to learn how many loaves of bread come from each bushel a special part of that counting was learning how to divide up the land so that each farmer could have the same amount of earth to sow now farmers know how to count into the thousands and weve learned to mark these numbers in clay as a permanent record rebba sipped from his cup before he went on did you know it was something you said months ago that made me support you and your plan to fight off the barbarians it was when you said that the barbarians would be back in another five or ten years youre right about their migrations its that cycle of migration we must break and thats why i decided to stay and resist we may fail but it must be tried we can no longer rebuild everything we create every ten years at the whim of every passing band of marauders the crops are too precious to lose even for a single growing season whats so valuable about the crops esk kar asked his curiosity aroused crops have been burned many times in the past they can always be replanted ah now were back to the mysteries rebba answered smiling again he stood up come lets take a walk down to the fields they walked to the rear of the house then went down a narrow dirt track that curved between the canals here rough planks that could be easily moved bridged the water channels each barely wide enough to get a small cart across in moments they were surrounded by cropslarge fields of waist high wheat and barley smaller fields containing peas lentils beets and even some melons another field grew flax which even eskkar knew was grown not for food but for its stem fibers that could be spun into linen there were other plants that esk kar didnt recognize the smell of animals had vanished and now the air held strangely pleasant odors given off by the growing plants all of them at various stages of growth the occasional fruit tree and jasmine added their scents to the air and the mix of all these growing things combined to create a kind of perfume hard to describe but somehow satisfying rebba led them down a narrow path and soon they were surrounded by wheat most of it still growing but already above the farmers knees this is emmer wheat he said indicating the field on his left and this is einkorn wheat these two are the most important crops on this farm from them we harvest the seeds that we grind into flour to make bread its the wheat that gives us the most food for each hectare rebba moved in among the growing plants looking closely at some glancing quickly at others finally he selected a handful of wheat from one plant then a few moments later another handful from a different plant then he rejoined his two students here esk kar look at these clusters of wheat rebba held one in each hand extending them to esk kar now tell me which of these you would plant next year and which you would make into flour esk kar stared down at the clusters looking from one to the other i see no difference between them rebba he answered they look the same rebba offered his hands to trella and you which would you choose trella examined them more closely than esk kar she took first one than the other into her own hands and brought them within inches of her eyes looking at them from all sides they seem the same to me also noble rebba though perhaps the grains in one are slightly larger than the other you have good eyes mistress trella rebba said yes this plant is producing slightly larger seeds than the other he let the smaller cluster drop to the ground and held up the other this plant and others like it will be used as seed for the next crop when we are ready to harvest the field my farmers will look at every plant selecting first those that produce the largest clusters and the biggest seeds until theyve gathered enough for the next years planting rebba lifted the cluster up to his nose then took one of the seeds into his mouth for a moment of course we must taste each one to make sure the flour we grind is not too harsh or bitter it wouldnt do to harvest a crop next season that made poor or bitter bread if we did no one would eat it and wed get less for what we sell on the river esk kar shook his head the seeds had seemed the same size to him so the largest seeds will go back into the earth to start the next crop why does that matter do you know how much wheat a hectare of land produces esk kar esk kar shook his head i am not even sure what a hectare is ah ive rushed ahead rebba apologized a hectare is a square plot of earth exactly one hundred long paces on each side he waited until esk kar nodded in understanding each hectare of wheat yields about thirty three bushels of seeds each bushel after it is ground into flour will make over seventy loaves of bread on this farm there are thirty hectares planted with wheat so we will harvest almost a thousand bushels some will be saved for the next planting a few go to feed the farmers and their families and some are lost to rodents or rot during storage or transport say three hundred bushels in all the remaining seven hundred bushels are available to be stored or sold with what we sell we can pay the smiths for our tools the carpenters for our plows the builders for our houses and the traders for what few luxuries we need and do not forget the herderswhose animals we use or sell for their meat rebba smiled at esk kar with all the excess food produced on this farm and others like it those of us who own the land around orak can even afford the most expensive luxury of allsupporting soldiers and their insatiable demands for weapons and horses a thousand bushels of wheat esk kar was astonished and that was just from this farm there were dozens of farms around orak though not many larger than rebbas i didnt know so much could be harvested rebba orak is very fortunate in that the soil is very rich and water plentiful a few miles away from the river the farms produce much less the farther you go from the tigris the smaller the harvest eventually a farm will produce only enough to feed those who labor on it go beyond that and the lands are too dry to support even the poorest and most desperate farmer that is why we choose to risk our lives staying here and fighting the barbarians rebba shook his head at the follies of men before continuing so you see each cycle of growth and harvest is important and thats the answer to your question esk kar the largest seeds go into the earth and from the next harvest we will select once again the largest seeds in this manner over tens of years we increase slightly the amount of wheat grown from each hectare so each season there is a tiny bit more food produced because we select and plant with care he turned back to trella that is the mystery the cycle goes on each seasonsow grow harvest select and sow and with each cycle we can feed more people or buy more weapons and thats why esk kar rebba continued we dont want to lose even a single crop to the barbarians once the crops are destroyed or the land damaged the work of ten or twenty years is undone and the next harvest will yield less food instead of a rich harvest we may not have enough to feed our own people weve planted early this season because of the news of the barbarians we will harvest earlier so this seasons crop will already be smaller and this seasons seed crop will be stored in orak hidden in underground chambers so that even if the village falls our families across the river may yet find them for the next planting esk kar will not let the village fall noble rebba trella said rebba looked from one to the other when nicar declared his intent to stay and fight i had grave doubts about our chances nevertheless i remained here even though i know my fields will be burned or flooded he shook his head sadly at the thought lets return to the house theres still much to show you rebba looked up at the sun and saw that nearly an hour had passed you will never be a farmer esk kar but by sundown you will at least know the value of a farm for the rest of the afternoon rebba talked about each crop explaining the differences between the various types of wheat how linen was made from flax and how the animals were bred and raised the last hour they studied the irrigation ditches the channels that carried water not only to all parts of the farm but continued on to the next farm one owned by another wealthy villager rebba and his family knew all about moving water explaining how the ditches grew narrower and narrower as they carried precisely the right amount of water to the fields the water must move with the right amount of force if there is too much force we cannot control the water flow the amount of water used to irrigate the plants is important alsotoo much water and the plants drown or are sickly too little and they die from the heat too much force and the channels themselves collapse too little and the water dries up before it reaches its destination esk kar had known that fact though in a casual way and without really understanding how critical the transport of water through the irrigation ditches was water was another one of the mysteriesa key to another part of the puzzle between the wells and the river there was plenty of water for everyone including the farms and all the herds of animals and it was good water no one got ill from drinking the water in and around orak though esk kar had gotten sick enough times in other lands drinking bad water and hed seen men die from drinking tainted water he knew that in the dry lands away from the river wells often produced a bitter tasting water that could make even a strong man sick to his stomach now esk kar understood that the water in the river by itself didnt help the farmers what made the farms successful were the irrigation ditches that delivered the water where it was needed the river merely provided the force to move the water while rebba and his people channeled it he hadnt realized how critical the hundreds of ditches that criss crossed the land were or how complicated their design and construction by the time esk kar and trella left rebbas house it was quite dark and one of the guards carried a torch to light the way the cook had saved their dinner and esk kar and trella decided to eat alone in the upper room esk kar said little during the meal he kept thinking about rebbas words when he finished eating he found himself staring at the crust of bread that remained uneaten on his plate youre quiet tonight esk kar trella commented as she finished her bread and vegetables did rebba tell you more than you wanted to know about farming esk kar looked at trella across the table until today i had always thought farming was for those too weak to fight or too unskilled to learn a trade now i learn that farming is the most difficult of trades and the one most important to the village what is important is that you now understand how the village works you know how the farmers grow their crops and deal with the traders how the artisans make tools and the builders create homes you know how the smiths make bronze and how the boatmen ply their trade from now on when the nobles speak youll understand not only what they say but how they think esk kar didnt answer after a moment trella arose and gathered up the empty plates and carried them out of the room he scarcely noticed her going he sat there thinking not only about rebbas words but trellas as well esk kar had lived in and about villages for half his life and had never given them a second thought a village was only an opportunity to get food or wine buy or repair weapons trade horses or even spend the night in relative safety they provided places to visit pass through or stay for a while some were large others small but always they were surrounded by farms and herds so commonplace as to be unremarkable but now he understood that everything started with the farms the farms held the real wealth for all of his life esk kar had sought gold with gold one could buy food weapons horses even men since hed left the alur meriki gold or the lack of it had always been the most important element in his life driving him from place to place from fight to fight now he learned gold was less than nothing the farmers on their land created the gold by producing grain and other food stocks they started the chain of events that lifted gold from the earth the farms were the foundation for all of oraks activities without the farms there could be no village without the village there could be no artisans or smiths no nobles or soldiers without the farms there would be no need for a wall to defend the village suddenly he had an insight about the alur meriki their leaders must understand these same mysteries why else were they always burning and destroying the farms as they passed through the land it wasnt enough to simply take the crops but the farmers must be killed and the land made barren as often as possible the steppes people too understood the need to keep the crop production down lest there be too many farmers producing too much food that might lead to too many men opposing them someday exactly what had happened here in orak if the farm production in orak could be increased further then even more men would be available to fight that led esk kar to another insight the other villages up and down the river had their own ways their own petty nobles but if those villages could be brought under oraks control then their surplus would add to the wealth and strength of orak by explaining how the crops were sown and harvested rebba had indeed revealed one of the mysteries of life now esk kar had learned another one that trella nicar and the nobles already knew the villagers might all rely on each others skills to survive but they all depended on the farms to create the wealth that allowed orak to grow and prosper and that allowed the gold to flow throughout the land the thought of gold made him smile esk kar remembered his feelings when nicar had sent his first months pay his delight at the twenty gold coins now seemed childish the real wealth grew in the fields the golden coins that passed from hand to hand were only another way of storing grain in the last few months hed come to value gold less and less he now understood that it was just a means to an end something he needed right now to pay for the wall and the soldiers but just a tool nevertheless trella had understood that from the start a sound made him look up from the table he saw trella leaning against the door have you been there long he shifted in the chair and held out his hand to her you seemed lost in thought and i didnt want to disturb you are you still thinking about rebba and his farm she crossed the room and took his hand he put his arms around her waist and held her for a moment his face against the softness of her breasts then pulled her down onto his lap no i was thinking about you do you know that you are very wise for someone so young she put her arms around his neck and let herself lean against him im not so young anymore esk kar some girls my age have birthed two children now im just a woman your woman yes woman he answered looking into her eyes how much gold do you think you are worth to me the odd question surprised her and for a moment doubt appeared in her eyes do you wish to sell me then he ran his fingers through her hair enjoying the feel of it today rebba explained many things to me but today trella i learned what the true value of gold is he kissed her gently now i know why youre worth more than all the gold in the land again he kissed her harder this time and let his hand trace the outline of her body i think it is time to go to bed yes master she answered as she put her arms around him but her smile and her eyes promised much much more part i sargons wall thutmose sin led the way along the winding trail his horse avoiding the loose stones and debris the hooves of many horses marked their passage in the rocky soil his men trailed behind him none of them spoke no one laughed not since they reached the place where the first clash occurred a mile behind them a dozen alur meriki bodies fl esh already picked from their scattered bones showed where they had engaged the ur nammu the absence of ur nammu bodies confirmed what thutmose sin already knew a force of warriors had defeated his men so completely that their conquerors had time to gather and bury their dead the trail led deeper into the foothills winding its way between cliff walls and alluvial flows thutmose sin knew immediately when he reached the canyon where the slaughter had taken place even eight days had not settled the signs of earth churned to clods by a hundred horses urgo waited for him there just outside the canyons entrance with a handful of men thutmose sin stopped beside him trying to visualize what had happened the alur meriki had pursued the ur nammu to this place either that or they had been lured there whatever the reason his men had ridden in and none had survived issogu markad thutmose sin called out to his subcommanders riding just behind send trackers along the canyon walls look for tracks anything left behind he turned to his remaining subcommander behzad bring ten men on foot and follow me search the ground as you go the rest of you stay here he touched his heels to the horse the animal lifted its head and stepped forward urgo guided his horse alongside the trail twisted along the rock wall almost immediately and as soon as thutmose sin entered the curve the smells and sight of the dead reached him at the far end of the canyon carrion eaters birds animals and insects thronged about the alur meriki carcasses even animals that normally fought each other for food feasted together so plentiful was the human flesh as thutmose sin drew closer they moved grudgingly away annoyed at the interruption of their repast scurrying up the slopes or flapping wings until they lurched noisily into the sky a single lance protruded from the pile of broken bones and rotting fl esh a dirty yellow streamer spotted with bird droppings hanging limply in the still air twisting about he studied the death scene examining the steep ramparts surrounding him the nearly sheer walls held no easy place to position men let alone hide them thutmose sin saw only a few places where a man might cling to his footing long enough to work a bow beneath him battle debris littered the ground shattered swords broken lances and bloodstained rags lay amidst the animal and human bones arrows most of them snapped off still protruded from some of the bodies thutmose sins eyes searched the ground but he stayed on his horse the animal had to be firmly urged to guide it close to the pile of the dead sarrum look at this a warrior holding an arrow in his hand ran up to thutmose sin a glance told thutmose sin why the man had noticed it the arrows barb was missing and the shaft broken off just behind the binding even so the shaft stretched longer than any arrows his men used and when he took the arrow in his hand he felt the extra thickness he handed the unusual shaft to urgo who studied it for a moment ah ive seen these before a few years ago when we raided to the far north there was a clan that used such long shafts good bowmen he scratched his beard for a moment but they were not horse people they lived high on the steppes in thick forests look for more of these thutmose sin ordered taking the shaft from urgo and handing it back to the warrior show it to the others as well his men found three more such shafts all broken or damaged their presence convinced him that others beside ur nammu had fought his men thutmose sin turned to the old clan leader bring twenty men in have them clear the bodies from the burial place then have them dig up the grave urgos mouth hung open for a moment but thutmose sin the dead his voice trailed off at the look on his leaders face yes sarrum ill get the men he wheeled his horse about and rode back shouting orders issogu returned jogging to his leaders side no tracks or any stones disturbed on the canyon walls sarrum he said pointing to the eastern side nothing thutmose sin turned to the western side where markad had paused to kneel on a rock outcropping studying the earth help him he ordered urgo returned leading twenty gloomy men behind him one look at their leader convinced them not to complain they began clearing away the bones using their lances and knives as much as possible to avoid touching the decaying flesh they muttered incantations to ward off the spirits soon the rotting bodies were being dragged and pushed away the flesh sometimes falling from the skeletons of thutmose sins former warriors clouds of flies rose up in the air as the men sweated at their tasks markad walked over his face wrinkling in disgust at the stench sarrum there was little to see but a few men might have followed the rocks on that side i found one of our arrows up there the tip broken against the wall where a man might stand archers might have been there firing arrows down into our men how many at most a handful sarrum even less markad said shaking his head more would have left tracks scratches on the rocks there was nothing just the one arrow then it wasnt an ambush despite the strange arrows good markad keep searching for any other sign he sat there enduring the grave stink and the flies in silence until his men finally cleared the dead and began digging into the rocky soil he knew they cursed and swore at him beneath their breath but no one dared refuse the earth had been tamped down to keep the carrion eaters at bay and at first the ground resisted his mens efforts at last one of the diggers gave a shout a few moments later his warriors dragged the first ur nammu body from the grave thutmose sin ordered another twenty men to join the work using them to clear the ground and lift the bodies from the grave the heat added to the miasma of death that now flowed around them like a mist body after body came forth more than forty of them and still they kept lifting ur nammu from the earth one of his men cried out in surprise and thutmose sin moved toward the man theyd dragged out another body but this man looked different the bodys clothing remnants showed the tunic of a dirt eater the mans face had the broad flat look often found in those who worked the earth two more bodies came up with the same look about them one looked to be a boy barely old enough to ride after that nothing theyd exposed the entire grave the sweating men stood about covered in filth and dirt waiting while thutmose sin considered what hed seen the ur nammu had buried dirteaters with their own warriors hed never heard of such a thing before to dishonor fighting men by burying them alongside farmers the ur nammu like the alur meriki had no use for dirteaters they were to be hunted and killed but not these men these men their bodies buried properly he thought about the strange arrows looking down at the one still in his hand his warriors werent fools they hadnt been ambushed and theyd killed plenty of ur nammu and wounded many more as the bloody rags scattered about attested but then the tide of battle turned and they all died killed by not enough arrows not enough to account for so many dead so riders had joined in the fight helped by a few archers along the cliff wall these strangers had turned the battle probably striking the alur meriki from behind a sudden attack from the rear even by a handful of determined men must have changed the battles outcome instead of wiping out the last of the ur nammu his men had found themselves trapped between two forcestrapped and annihilated the shaft of the arrow snapped between his hands his warriors had diedvengeance cried out for the blood of those responsible the ur nammu must be destroyed along with those who helped them thutmose sin looked up his men stared at him waiting for his orders the silence broken only by the flies buzzing about the dead what all this meant he wasnt sure but he knew a way to find out urgo rebury the dead ur nammu he ignored the shock on his mens faces bury them properly then walk the horses over the ground have the prayer givers offer up sacrifices to the spirits to atone for disturbing the dead without looking back he rode out of the canyon at the entrance he called out to markad and issogu follow the trail wherever it leads find out where they went and look to see if a band breaks off and rides to the west take as many men as you need two hours later he gave the order to camp for the night at the same place where the ur nammu had halted and rested from their wounds the camps fire rings showed that men had used it for several days urgo found another of the large arrows from the north broken off in a tree obviously used for target practice so the northern archers and the ur nammu had become friendly enough to shoot together no doubt after celebrating the destruction of his men a broad trail led north made by perhaps thirty or forty riders in the next few days markad and issogu would track the ur nammu but thutmose sin could guess what they would find the surviving ur nammu would flee to the east and another trail would head west back toward orak a band of riders from orak had either tracked the ur nammu or more likely his own alur meriki raiders the dirt eaters then joined with the ur nammu or just attacked the alur meriki from the rear whatever their method oraks riders turned the battle losing only a few men in the process then the two bands of hereditary enemies had camped together for several days recovering from their wounds and taking time to sharpen their archery skills that much time together that meant whatever the ur nammu had learned oraks dirt eaters now knew also even worse it told thutmose sin that orak had a leader someone who knew the ways of war that meant that the dirt eaters would fight this time not run theyd beaten his men and such a victory would give them strength his own losses mattered little at least the alur meriki had effectively finished off the ur nammu ending that conflict at last the loss of his own men didnt trouble him he had too many warriors as it was but his men would look at each other and wonder an alur meriki force had suffered defeat annihilation something that hadnt happened in nearly a generation and that would make his men begin to doubt they would look at their clan leaders differently if warriors could be defeated once then why not again thutmose sin went over this with urgo who sat across from him in silence unable to challenge his sarrums conclusions your plan urgo are you still certain we can trap the dirteaters urgo chewed on a blade of grass taking his time the loss concerned him too since any reduction in warrior numbers limited the number of fighting men available were driving everyone toward the village unless there are so many that they can resist us well take the village thutmose sin stared at his kinsman and the wall you say they are building a wall without fighting men is useless sarrum he met his leaders eyes are their fighters now equal to our warriors after one small skirmish an ambush on favorable ground and with archers on the walls they have a leader now someone who knows how to fight when to fight someone who can defeat our men perhaps sarrum but even a few such men however strong cannot defeat all the alur meriki nevertheless i want to know more about the war chief who led this force find out who he is if this orak has a new leader someone skilled in the ways of war then we should learn what we can about him for the next ten days esk kar spent the mornings with his commanders preparing for the different kinds of battles they might face then he trained with the soldiers primarily to encourage the men the hawk clan helped build morale by retelling the story of how esk kar destroyed the alur meriki raiders the embellishments grew with each repetition and the soldiers trust in their leader soared with the wall nearly finished their self assurance increased even more esk kar wanted the men to feel confident in their skills and commanders theyd need that certainty when the fighting started the soldiers practiced with sword spear and axe the proud hawk clan took the lead playing the role of attackers making spirited assaults on the wall the master archers paced off distances from the wall and half buried stones in the earth painted different colors to mark the distance the markers allowed the bowmen to gauge the range to their enemy the old targets were torn down bowmen practiced shooting only from the wall to make sure they had the feel for every shot under totomess guidance they learned to fire volleys at specific distances weapons and food continued to pour into orak the refugee traffic on the roads had diminished as the alur meriki drew closer but men continued to arrive many eager to work or fight asking only that orak protect their families river trade increased and the ferry plied its path back and forth countless times each day every vessel brought some much needed cargo stockpiles grew and everyone complained they had no space to sit or stand when esk kar walked about the villagers cheered him calling out his name or wishing him luck in the coming fight trella was just as popular especially with the women the poor the children and the elderly she visited many of these people daily assisting and organizing them and making sure the women knew their roles in the coming fight gatus finally had enough soldiers to train the women and old men his men showed them how to fight fires and to use short stabbing sticks from the wall men and women alike practiced using forked sticks to push ladders back hundreds of rocks and stones were carried to the parapet and thrown down by villagers when one group finished they recovered the stones for the next group a labor that went on all day until everyones muscles ached with pain and the rough stones had rubbed their hands raw thousands more stones stood in great piles beneath the parapet the training for soldier and villager continued until they mastered each technique tool and weapon women coated every exposed wooden surface inside orak with a layer of mud leaving no combustible targets for fire arrows or torches hurled over the wall the village prepared for the siege but esk kar saw as much optimism as fear on everyones face esk kar shook his head in amazement at it all he clapped gatus on the back and praised him publicly for his labors at the end of a long but satisfying day esk kar returned home just before sunset he went first to the well at the back of the house the luxury of the private well still pleased him he enjoyed the chance to wash the sweat and dust from his body as he fi nished he heard the gate to the courtyard bang open a ragged youth slipped under the surprised guards arm though the man was stationed there to prevent just such an intrusion the boy rushed toward the house his voice a high pitched shrill captain captain come quick lady trellas been stabbed the boy dodged past a servant coming from the house bantor appeared in the doorway and grabbed the lad holding him fast esk kar ran up went down on a knee and faced the boy here lad here i am what happened to trella where is she esk kar felt dread growing in his stomach lady trella was returning here when a man came up behind her and drew a knife the boys high pitched voice rushed the words together i called out to warn her but i was too late and he stabbed her then he turned to run but i grabbed his leg and held him until her guard reached him the guard sent me here to find you where boy where is she in the street of the butchers near the carpenters shop keep him here esk kar pushed the boy into annok surs hands as she approached esk kar ran back through the courtyard and out the gate headed for the street of the butchers before hed gone more than a dozen steps a crowd approached led by a burly soldier carrying trella in his arms one arm dangled limply her dress covered in blood and cut open down the side dragged on the ground trellas eyes rolled in her head and esk kar couldnt tell if she was still alive he recognized the guard klexor assigned to guard trella that day klexor pushed right by esk kar as if he didnt recognize him three soldiers of the watch all white faced and with drawn swords followed close behind is she alive esk kar forced the words out of his throat his voice hoarse the guard carried trella through the courtyard and into the house someone had cleared the big table and he placed her down gently annok sur pushed him away and pulled open trellas dress someone had cut a strip of cloth from the garment and used it to bandage her wound the fabric wrapped completely around her body just under her breast esk kar reached the foot of the table he saw trellas breast rise and fall so she still lived but her face was pale and blood oozed from her left side send for a healer annok sur shouted the words over her shoulder as she placed a folded blanket under trellas head klexor stood dumbly where annok sur had pushed him esk kar strode to his side and grabbed his arm what happened who did this the man turned and stared at esk kar for a moment yes captain shes still alive the bodyguard replied as if recalling esk kars earlier question a man stabbed her in the lane but a healer was passing by and came when he heard the shouts he bound her wound then said i should bring her here the guard glanced around he said hed follow ah there he is an elderly man his bald pate ringed with wisps of white hair came puffing through the door he carried a large leather pouch slung over his shoulder that contained his instruments esk kar recognized ventor a healer often used by the soldiers too common for the upper classes ventor was better at binding war wounds than treating headaches or queasy stomachs dont just stand there ventor ordered as he headed directly to the table bring fresh water and clean cloths and lamps and candles as many as you can annok sur moved aside for the healer ventor opened his bag and used a knife to cut off the crude bandage esk kar stood there in shock pushed aside by the women he watched helplessly as bantors wife and another servant wiped the blood from trellas body while the healer poured water over the wound at first esk kar thought shed been stabbed in the chest but as the blood washed away he saw the blow had taken her from the left side starting a little below the armpit and slicing down towards the hip the long jagged cut still bled but ventor ignored the blood as he washed the wound pouring water from the pitcher up and down the length of the opening the bloody water spilled to the floor bring another pitcher ventor demanded he took a candle and slowly scanned the length of the wound holding the flame close to her body the examination went on for a long time before he straightened up and put down the candle nothing in the wound taking a needle and thread from his pouch he threaded the needle carefully then quickly bound the end of the thread with a large knot ventor rinsed the wound one more time then assisted by the women who held the flesh together he began sewing the wound closed it was nothing esk kar hadnt seen before hed suffered the same treatment even watched while it was done but this time he had to turn away his hands shook and he forced himself to stop clenching both hands into fists bantors wife joined esk kar and her husband i think shell live esk kar annok sur whispered the wound is long but not deep and the blade glanced along her ribs though ive no doubt she wouldve bled to death if the healer wasnt close by to staunch the bleeding my thanks to you annok sur please stay with her esk kar stared at ventor bent low across the table as he finished closing the wound at last the healer began to bandage his patient using clean linen brought by the servants when the healer is finished keep him here to watch over her esk kar faced bantor now lets find out who dies tonight he stepped out into the courtyard he found it full of armed men a few torches provided light against the deepening darkness when they saw the grimness on esk kars face a groan went up bantor called out quickly no no she lives the healer is with her a ragged cheer went up echoed from beyond the wall and esk kar realized the street outside must be crowded with people all concerned about trella two members of the watch pushed their way through the soldiers dragging a ragged man already covered with bruises his hands tied tightly behind him and a gag in his mouth the prisoner shook so hard he would have fallen if the men hadnt held him upright this is the one who attacked her captain the guard gave the prisoner a jab in the ribs klexor caught him before he could escape cries of kill him kill him now went up from the soldiers but eskkar raised his hand for silence he turned to bantor watch him and keep him alive esk kar fought the urge to strike the man but that could wait think first then act trella always told him he started thinking coherently for the first time since theyd brought her in he looked around the garden and spotted klexor sitting alone on the ground disconsolate his head in his hands klexor come here esk kar called out then said to bantor clear out the courtyard but keep twenty men here close the gates and send the rest of the men to the walls i dont want anyone to escape by slipping over in the darkness kill anyone that tries then come back here gatus sisuthros come with me klexor stood up shaking and nearly fell esk kar took the mans arm and guided him into the house ignoring the crowd around trella he led the man upstairs and sat the bodyguard on a chair in front of the table esk kar poured two cups of wine a small one for himself and a large one for klexor here take this esk kar waited until the soldier had drained half the cup then pulled it away from his lips easy now tell me what happened take your time and tell me everything esk kar went to the other side of the table and sat he looked carefully at the guard a seasoned veteran and a bull of a man klexor stood a few inches shorter than esk kar but broader and wider with hands like hammers he wasnt one of the original soldiers but esk kar knew him well enough and the man had guarded trella before klexor wiped the back of his hand across his mouth captain it wasnt my fault i i just want to hear what happened klexor it wasnt you that struck her tell me exactly what happened leave out nothing klexor took another sip of wine then glanced at sisuthros and gatus who leaned against the wall i was assigned to guard lady trella today and we walked all over the village back and forth visiting people training with the women finally we started back here but some women wanted to talk to her so she stopped and spent time with them his voice cracked and he took another mouthful of wine by then dusk was approaching we were in the street of the butchers the lanes narrow there and i walked in front making a way through the crowd he stopped and ran his fingers shakily through his hair get on with it man esk kar wanted to shout we were only a few steps from the carpenters shop you know the big one where they make wheels and esk kar nodded his head thats where we were when there was a shout some street boy screamed out knife hes got a knife i turned and there was this man his blade striking down trella screamed and fell klexor emptied the cup and set it clumsily on the table i stood there captain for a moment i couldnt move but the boy the one who shouted he grabbed the assassin by the leg as he tried to run off and tripped him good thing he did or he wouldve been killed himself i saw the knife fl ash by the boys head by then id recovered my wits and ran at the man just as he got up i hit him he went down i hit him a few more times the man stopped thinking i heard lady trella say alive keep him alive before she fainted that man ventor i think his name is came up and pushed me away he bound up the wound and told me to send the boy ahead to you then ordered me to carry trella here and the one who stabbed her do you know him esk kar asked no i never saw him before klexor answered though wait i did see him earlier in the afternoon he couldve been with the crowd at the wall when the women went there to practice im sure i saw him there the women may remember him klexor started to shake again aware he could be put to death for failing in his duty you said he tried to stab the boy did he still have the knife when you struck him the guard concentrated on what had taken place then answered yes captain he still had the knife but he was trying to get away not use the knife so you hit him why didnt you use your sword lady trella said to keep him alive no that was later i dont know i just wanted to get to him i dont remember what i was thinking i forgot to draw my sword esk kar tried to visualize what the man had seen and done my thanks to you klexor im sure no man could have done better you did well to keep the assassin alive now go to the kitchen and get some more wine but only one cup you need to stay sober others will want to hear your words later the man got up his relief evident captain im sorry about what shes shes a good woman his voice choked and he couldnt get the words out i know go now and send up the boy who brought us the news he turned to gatus and sisuthros then paused as bantor returned squeezing past klexor on the landing it sounds as if the man was following trella and that klexor did his duty the men have complained that its impossible for one man to guard either of you gatus said you know that with all these crowds but lady trella didnt want another guard assigned klexor performed as well as any man nobody takes good advice gatus she said the same thing to me i should have the door opened again and annok sur escorted the boy into the room a crust of buttered bread in his hand with crumbs and grease on his chin he looked frightened esk kar stood and guided the boy to the seat just vacated by klexor but this time esk kar pulled a stool around and sat down next to him he judged the lad had about nine or ten seasons dont be afraid boy whats your name the urchins eyes went wide as he looked around no doubt hed never seen a room this big in his life nor one as finely furnished esk kar prompted him enki noble one im called enki the name of the water god who dwelt in the river a fine name enki youve done a great deed today and im in your debt without you lady trellas attacker would have escaped now i want you to tell me everything you did today where you went when you fi rst saw trella everything do you think you can do that start from where you first saw trella today it was at the training ground noble i went there to watch the women train sometimes they slip and fall or their dresses come loose when lady trella came many of us ran over to her last week i carried a message for her and she gave me a copper coin he looked crestfallen as he remembered but then some older boys took it away i can fix that esk kar stood up and went back to his table opened the drawer and extracted two copper coins he presented them to enki who took them with his free hand the other still firmly clutching his bread eskkar sat down again then what happened lady trella watched the women practice then she began to train too shes very strong for a girl you know and she can handle the short spear by herself or the forked stick many were cheering and laughing when they fi nished for the day the women washed themselves at the well i like to watch that many of the women would take off their shifts and pour water over themselves esk kar smiled briefly hed watched such things himself yes thats always fun to watch now enki while you were there did you remember seeing the man who attacked trella was he there enki frowned as he tried to remember no not there i didnt see him there but later when we began walking he walked by me and trella i was following along hoping she might need another message delivered or something the man pushed past her and moved ahead then he came back and walked behind us again he kept looking around i remember that good enki what happened next lady trella stopped to talk to someone some of the boys crowded around her and the guard pushed them back she and the women talked for a long time whispering to each other then lady trella smiled and gave one of them a coin before she started walking again the guard had to push people out of the way so they could get through the boy looked around the room and saw everyone watching him probably no one had ever paid any attention to him before and now four grown men listened carefully to his every word dont be afraid esk kar reassured the boy go on i got left behind and was trying to catch up when the man pushed past me again i almost fell and i cursed at him then i saw him pull the knife from under his tunic he walked very fast and headed for lady trella i yelled and she started to turn around then she saw the knife and she raised her arm but he stabbed her anyway i kept yelling he turned and ran away ran right past me so i grabbed his leg and held on until we both fell down he got up but the guard caught him and started hitting him do you remember what you yelled enki the exact words esk kar wanted all the details i remember i yelled lady trella hes got a knife lady trella then i saw the blood on the knife as the man ran past me how loud did you yell enki can you show me without hesitating the boy screamed out the words showering esk kars face with bread crumbs the high pitched voice piercing in the closed room it was loud all right loud enough to make anyone stop and turn around if trella hadnt turned she would have taken the blade in her back esk kar made the boy go over the story again when nothing new emerged esk kar glanced up at the three subcommanders standing quietly against the wall anything you want to ask gatus and bantor shook their heads but sisuthros stepped over and bent down to examine the back of the boys head pushing the unruly hair back and forth until enki jumped in pain sisuthros withdrew his fingers some dried blood stuck on them i thought i saw blood the blade didnt miss by much though i doubt it wouldve killed him enkis eyes grew wide at the sight of his own blood sisuthros rubbed the boys head just a scratch nothing for a brave man to worry about thank you again enki esk kar said as he stood who is your family i have none noble i had an older brother but he disappeared i sleep in the stables or near the river the brother had probably been picked up off the streets and sold to a slaver then youll stay here from now on esk kar turned to his men now its time to talk to the assassin taking the boys hand esk kar led the way downstairs where he turned enki over to bantors wife before checking on trella the healer sat quietly beside her his work for the moment finished ventor stood as esk kar approached esk kar stared at her pale face her body covered with a soft blanket and another folded under her head theyd combed her hair her eyes were closed but she was breathing regularly how is she ventor will she live esk kar couldnt stop his voice from breaking yes captain i believe she will recover ventor said unless the wound fills with pus the blow struck her ribs and glanced downward her attacker should have directed his blade upward toward the heart the ribs open to a thrust from below but a downward stroke glances from rib to rib not a very expert assassin ventor lifted the blanket and looked at trellas wound shes young and strong and should heal quickly i gave her some wine and ordered that she be fed soup as soon as shes able to take some esk kar breathed a sigh of relief thank you ventor id like you to stay the night then come at least twice a day to look in on her youll be well paid for your good work tonight the nobles use their own healers captain yes but im just a soldier and youre more familiar with battle wounds besides ill not have a dozen healers standing around arguing about what potions to give her or gods to pray to tend to her wound as you would for any soldier esk kar walked out into the courtyard a cheer went up from the men despite his order more than twenty soldiers still crammed themselves into the courtyard which now blazed with torchlight he held up one hand trella is being cared for by the healer now weve work to do here and youll be needed later so clear the courtyard the hawk clan and the house guards remain get the rest of them out of here gatus bantor bring the assassin to the back of the house esk kar followed the guards as they dragged the man into the cul de sac behind the house the small garden contained only one bench and two small trees scarcely taller than a man he stepped in front of the attacker two men held the prisoner by his arms the man knelt in the dirt arms bent up backward behind him the gag still stuffed in his mouth esk kar went down on one knee his face close to the prisoners his eyes bulged wide with terror and the stink of urine hung over him esk kar pulled the gag from the mans mouth heard the quick gasp of air as the man filled his lungs he started to speak silence esk kar ordered savagely if he speaks or cries out give him some pain both men tightened their grips on the mans wrists twisted high behind him until he yelped with pain and saliva ran from his open mouth esk kar studied the man carefully but didnt recognize him that didnt mean anything he could have been in orak for months or days though he was more likely to be a newcomer anyone know this man no one said anything what is your name the man said nothing and esk kar nodded at the men holding him they jerked the mans arms up a little and the fresh pain loosened his tongue natram zar my name is natram zar noble he spoke in a hoarse voice with a trace of an accent esk kar guessed the man came from the south probably sumeria why did you attack my woman natram zar i meant to rob her noble one im just a thief i only wanted to steal her purse he was pleading now fear showing in his eyes as they darted back and forth then youre a very poor thief natram zar her purse was still around her neck esk kar stood up did he have anything on him bantor stepped forward holding a small leather pouch much worn and repaired that contained five copper coins as well as other odds and ends and the mans knife as well esk kar took it tightening his lips at the sight of trellas blood a good weapon the copper blade fit perfectly into a carved and curved wooden handle small and well made it wasnt a soldiers weapon but perfect to hide under a tunic for a quiet murder much too good a weapon for a common thief of course he could have stolen it from some wealthy victim nothing else nothing captain only this purse and the knife stand him up then cut off his clothes the man started to complain but the guards lifted him up ignoring his protests that quickly turned into moans of pain in moments theyd stripped him bare and his clothes lay in a heap around him including the dirty and reeking undergarment where the man had pissed himself in fear using the mans knife esk kar poked through the clothes he almost missed a small pocket sewn closed that ran lengthwise along the bottom hem of the tunic esk kar sliced open the threads and heard the faint clink of coins each coin had been wrapped in a bit of cloth to muffle the sound esk kar counted ten gold coins all flickering bright in the torchlight he looked at each disc but they were all well handled and worn with the different marks of various merchants and nobles he checked the rest of the clothes but found nothing the gold told its own storya murder for hire standing he faced natram zar youve lied to me once dont make that mistake again if you want to avoid the fire youll speak the truth esk kar heard gatus call his name what is it many of the nobles are in the street nicar and the others wish to enter but ive kept everyone out as you ordered also the men guarding the walls heard something in the darkness when they went to search they found a horse tethered to a rock three hundred paces from the wall whoever was with the animal disappeared in the darkness its a fine beast loaded with food and a water skin i should have anticipated that the murderer would need to escape quickly after his deed now the nobles waited outside esk kar wasnt sure whether he wanted them here or not especially when it could have been nestor who paid the man nevertheless if he didnt have them present when the man confessed they might not believe esk kars witnesses damn the gods bantor find out who knows the horse who owns it where it came from i doubt if this fi lth kept a good horse stabled in the village for days but if so somebody will know him esk kar looked toward gatus still waiting allow in only the heads of the families no one else if they dont want to come in dont make them esk kar turned back to the prisoner ready to speak natram zar the time for lies is past noble one im just a thief his voice sounded hoarse from dryness and pain tie him between the trees and spread his legs well apart bring fire from the house and plenty of wood natram zar cried out as the men holding his arms started to drag him away one of the guards dropped his arm for a moment stepped in front of the prisoner and punched him savagely in the stomach the force of the blow doubling the prisoner over keep silent dog or you get another they secured the prisoner between the two small trees spreading his arms wide apart and tying them to the largest branches then they tied the mans ankles spread eagling his legs and fastening them to the base of each tree they pulled each rope tight when they finished natram zar hung there helplessly unable to do more than twitch while this went on the heads of the families came in looking unnerved the sight of the naked man reinforcing their apprehension just in time nobles esk kar began this man tried to kill trella and only a boy with quick wits and a loud tongue saved her life the dog was captured in the act his name is natram zar he had those ten gold coins lying at his feet sewn in his tunic and a horse waiting for him outside the walls any of you know this man the sight of the coins gleaming in the torchlight changed everything no thief could have such an amount and only the nobles and a few of the wealthier merchants could afford such a sum for a hired killing and no thief carrying that much gold would risk his life for a slave girls meager purse not even if the slave were trella esk kar watched nestor but the old man seemed as shocked as the rest nicar decca rebba and corio all looked blankly at esk kar nicar found his voice first who paid him to do this why would anyone want to hurt trella you will all wait over there and say nothing esk kar ordered his voice hard not a word he glanced at gatus who had little love for any of the nobles gatus escort the nobles to the side of the house where they can see and hear everything make sure they say nothing from there the prisoner could not see them by now natram zar had gotten his breath back and he lifted his head a wide clay bowl packed full of wood and a few chunks of coal was placed on the ground before him another man came from the house carrying three burning coals on a clay shard he dumped them into the bowl and began building the fire moving chunks of wood atop the coals in moments a small fire burned steadily esk kar reached down and held his hand over the low flames the heat rose to his hand and he withdrew it warm him up a little maldar knelt down and pushed the fire between natram zars legs with his legs spread apart the top of the flames reached within a foot of his testicles natram zar screamed as soon as the first warmth reached his genitals long before the heat could have affected him he struggled to move his body aside but the men on either side of him used their knees to push his body back keeping him centered over the flames maldar tossed more wood chips on the fire the flames reached even higher esk kar waited patiently watching the fires glow watching the man as he jerked his body back and forth in a frenzy trying to move his groin out of the path of the heat building up beneath him trying to pull his genitals up into his body but natram zars frantic exertions quickly tired him he had to slump against the ropes which once again positioned him directly over the low flames in a moment the pain made him stretch upright twitching and jerking once again until exhaustion brought him back to the flames and the process repeated itself esk kar let it go on for a while while maldar made sure the flames didnt lessen the screams came without ceasing now and esk kar knew the sound would be heard many streets away from out in the lane came the sound of cheers as the crowd guessed what was happening when the smell of burning flesh started to rise esk kar nodded to maldar who pulled the bowl forward removing most of the heat the prisoner slumped limply from the ropes the hair scorched away from his thighs his genitals a deep red from the heat esk kar stepped forward who hired you to kill trella talk now or go back into the flames the man moaned as pain continued to shoot through his body blood flowed from his mouth where he had bitten his lip mercy noble mercy im just a thief back into the fire esk kar stepped away and maldar returned the bowl underneath the prisoner bringing the flames back into position before tossing more wood chunks on the fi re the top of the fl ames rose up to nearly touch the mans body the assassins screams split the night air loud enough to be heard throughout orak jerking about his cries for mercy echoed off the walls that surrounded him natram zar must have known he was going to die but that didnt matter anymore only that the pain stop esk kar gave the signal to stop give him water then well hear what he says a soldier brought a ladle of water from the well and held it to the mans lips now talk and if you lie you go back into the flames and speak up so all can hear your words natram zar sucked in gulps of air before he could speak then his voice croaked with pain and fear it was caldor caldor paid me caldor son of nicar i was only doing what the nobles wanted his voice trailed off and tears streamed down his cheeks a murmur of disbelief ran through the men in the courtyard while nicar cried from the wall no it cant be true even esk kar felt surprise he expected the man to name nestor as the one who hired him that was foolish of course nestor wouldnt want trella killed he might want esk kar out of the way but he had no grudge against trella hed been more than kind to her at all their meetings but caldor could he be that stupid a wave of anger went through esk kar this was his fault he should have taken care of caldor sooner who else natram zar who else esk kar grabbed the man by the shoulder and shook him speak or ill put you back in the fire the words poured from natram zar now he would do anything to avoid the flames nobody else only caldor and his servant loki they approached me in the tavern asked what i would do for gold a lot of gold he offered me ten gold coins to kill her i told him id need a horse to escape so he gave me twelve silver coins for that as well where did you buy the horse who sold it to you the wretched man mumbled the name of zanar a liveryman send someone for him gatus hold him in the street outside and have him describe the man who bought the horse when he bought it and how much he paid esk kar turned back to the would be assassin who trembled uncontrollably the smell of natram zars burning flesh hung in the air if the liverymans story differs from yours ill put every part of your body in the flames piece by piece now tell me why did caldor want trella killed he said it was for the good of orak i dont know why natram zar saw the black look on esk kars face and screamed again i dont know i asked but thats all he would tell me i swear it the man began to sob esk kar had no doubt that he spoke the truth when did all this happen he had to shake the man hard to stop the sobbing tell me the day and the hour three days ago noble in the tavern of dadaius i swear it he gave me the gold and told me never speak to him again only loki when he brought the silver for the horse esk kar asked a few more questions the man had lived in orak for less than two months avoiding the work gangs and living off his wits and his knife leaving natram zar hanging there esk kar walked over to the nobles they looked ashen faced after watching the torture their fear plainly visible their guards remained in the street outside the nobles were at eskkars mercy he could kill all of them and no man would protest not pleasant to watch is it nobles a man tortured for information its easy to sit in a tavern and pay someone to murder but not to watch death take a man and it takes a special coward to pay for the murder of a woman they flinched at his words but he no longer cared what they thought of him he stepped in front of nicar where is caldor nicar nicar appeared incapable of speech just shaking his head esk kar turned to sisuthros find caldor if hes not in the street outside hes probably at home and the servant loki make sure you search nicars house thoroughly there may be hiding places within the walls or floors tear it down if you have to but find him nicar tried to protest stepping toward esk kar but gatus shoved him back so hard that he bounced off the side of the house stay where you are noble unless you wish to join your friend over there esk kar knew how fond gatus was of trella the old soldier would be more than willing to kill anyone whod tried to hurt her bantor make sure nobody leaves the village and keep the extra guards on the walls all night i want a horse patrol to ride out first thing in the morning to run down whoever held the horse well get his name from natram zar i want him caught have the trackers ride out at first light well nobles esk kar faced them again is there anyone else who knows anything about this among you he stood directly in front of corio answer me captain i swear i know nothing about this i like trella you know that i would never try to hurt her esk kar repeated the question before the others getting the same answer until he came to nestor well noble nestor what of you do you know anything about this nestor shook his head captain i know nothing about this nothing i swear it by all the gods i would never harm trella staring into nestors eyes and trying to read his thoughts esk kar felt tempted to believe him the man hadnt said anything to deny that he might bribe a man to kill the captain of the guard but trella was a different story disgusted with them all esk kar stepped away he wanted to think and it would take a while before they found caldor he turned to his men keep them here gatus come with me esk kar left the nobles standing there while he went into the house gatus following inside he stopped and gripped the old soldiers arm watch them gatus i dont want any of them speaking to each other or sending messages to anyone have your men with them at all times gatus nodded and returned to watch over the nobles inside the house esk kar found the big dining table cleared the servants had finished washing it down and now they scrubbed the blood from the floor they looked up as esk kar entered but his grim face turned their eyes quickly back to their work esk kar ran up the stairs to the bedroom ventor and annok sur sat perched on stools on either side of the bed to his surprise trella had regained consciousness her eyes turned to him her guardians rose and left the room leaving him alone with trella esk kar took ventors place on the stool and picked up trellas hand trying to keep his from shaking are you in much pain he leaned down and kissed her cheek she smiled her voice sounded weak but steady its not so bad husband now i know what a warrior feels from his wounds your hand shakes esk kar is something else wrong nothing is wrong trella we caught the man who did this just a common thief hired to do murder caldor paid him ten gold coins plus a fine horse to kill you i should have killed both him and nestor as soon as i returned to orak he shook his head in disgust at his failure were searching for caldor and well find him soon no man will risk hiding him and the village is sealed her eyes closed for a moment and her next words surprised him poor nicar to endure this he knew nothing of this im sure dont hurt nicar esk kar you need him esk kar shook his head this will cause a blood feud between us caldor dies tonight and nicar will never forgive his death better that he and his family go the way of drigo no one in orak cares none will deny me my revenge we need men like nicar and his son lesu theyre good men and must not die over caldors foolishness find some way to avoid killing caldor her eyes closed before he could protest but esk kar knew she was thinking so he waited holding her hand she opened her eyes and began to speak he had to lean closer to hear her words when she finished he looked at her it may not work but ill try a knock on the door made him look up ventor stood in the doorway let her sleep captain she needs to rest now trella tried to speak but esk kar leaned down and kissed her lips gently rest as the healer commands youre safe now and ill be with you soon he left the chamber and went downstairs turning into the kitchen and asking the cook for wine and something to eat esk kar sat on a stool at the small cutting table for a long time ignoring the wine and the cheese placed before him everyone in the house feared to speak to him he remained there unmoving until cries from the courtyard announced sisuthros had returned rising he found maldar and bantor waiting outside the kitchen standing silently in the main room did they find him was all esk kar asked as they went out in the torchlight he saw nicar on a stool someone had given him his head slumped forward in his hands corio looked up saw esk kar in the doorway and shook his head in disbelief the soldiers dragged two men toward him their hands boundcaldor and loki nicars younger son had blood on his face and a cut above his eye lokis face showed fear a mere servant he had no powerful father to protect him the crowds hate would frighten anyone one of the soldiers grabbed caldor and threw him to the ground while another kicked the legs out from under loki both twisted about in the dirt trying to get back to their knees sisuthros stepped forward a grin on his face here they are captain caldor was hiding in a secret room in the cellar loki tried to get away over the back wall nicars guards tried to stop us from entering and i had to kill one fresh blood stained sisuthross arm and tunic esk kar moved closer and looked down at the two men his face expressionless caldor saw his father held back by guards father help me dont let them do this bantor take caldor into the house said esk kar keep him quiet if he makes a sound break something bantors men grinned as they scooped caldor up and dragged him into the house one of them clapping a hand over his mouth to keep him silent esk kar turned his attention to loki a man of thirty seasons whod probably been caldors servant from his youth bring him around back soldiers dragged the terrified servant to the back of the house where natram zar still dangled from the tree unconscious blood oozing from his mouth one of the soldiers had probably knocked the man out to stop the screaming loki saw the mans genitals burnt black and caught the smell of burning flesh that lingered in the air bring the nobles closer esk kar waited until the five men approached each escorted by one of gatuss men esk kar grabbed loki by his hair and twisted it savagely so the servant stared directly at natram zar look closely loki this is what awaits you if you dont speak the truth we know what happened natram zar told us everything now youll tell us everything you know about the attack on trella one hesitation one lie and well put you in natram zars place and youll suffer an even worse fate he pushed the man hard and loki fell to the ground look at me loki and remember one lie one hesitation now start at the beginning and tell me everything lokis breath came fast the shallow breathing of a man in great fear who can no longer control his emotions he looked beseechingly at nicar noble nicar please help me i didnt do anything i just strip him and tie him to the tree bring more wood for the fi re eskkar wasnt going to waste time with the servant not with caldor waiting inside but loki twisted free as the men tried to lift him and threw himself at esk kars feet no please noble ill tell you everything everything im sorry im sorry esk kar ignored his cries as the men cut lokis clothes off others untied natram zar then fastened loki in his place loki screamed when a soldier brought more fuel dumping fresh coals on the fire the soldier fanned the embers with the shard until the flames rose up again then he picked up the bowl and moved it under lokis legs another man tossed more wood chips into the fire as guards took position on either side of the helpless prisoner loki cried out then began to urinate uncontrollably as his body twitched from side to side the flames hissed from the mans piss but kept burning lokis eyes were wide with terror and his voice shrill with panic as he begged for mercy add more wood esk kar ordered make it burn hotter caldor made me do it noble lokis voice sounded frantic it was caldor he paid natram zar ten gold pieces to kill her he wanted her dead he wanted her dead the soldier looked up at esk kar wait in a broken voice lokis story came out with scarcely any prompting the amount of gold the silver for the horse the meetings with natram zar in the tavern loki knew it all the details matched the assassins story none could doubt it now caldor was guilty and every man in the courtyard knew it when loki finished he sagged against the ropes tears running down his cheeks gag him then bring out caldor esk kar ordered its time we heard his story when bantor dragged caldor from the house the soldiers let out a roar of curses as they demanded his death the sound echoed against the walls carrying to those crowding the street they dragged caldor before esk kar and again shoved him to his knees his hands still tied behind him silence esk kar roared then waited until everyone quieted down it became as quiet as death and his words carried throughout the courtyard caldor weve spoken with natram zar and with loki they told us everything about the gold the horse the plan its all out in the open now its your turn to speak or youll replace loki on the tree tell me why you wanted to kill trella caldor looked at his father held upright by two guards more to keep him from falling than to restrain him father this its all lies i did nothing nothing tell them father caldors voice sounded high and shrill like a childs as he realized for the fi rst time in his life that even his father might not save him esk kar turned toward nicar who stood ashen faced at the horror facing him the mob and soldiers would demand his sons death and now nicar must fear the same fate for himself and his house tell them my son nicar forced each word from his lips tell them the truth and save yourself from the torture i didnt do anything father it must have been loki who did it he wanted trella from when she was in our house loki it was loki strangled sounds came from the gagged loki as he heard his young master blame him loki twisted and struggled but the men and ropes held him fast esk kars anger flared and he grasped caldor by the hair where did loki get ten gold coins caldor and twelve for the horse did loki have that much gold and would he spend it simply to see a woman die do you pay your servant that much a sound of satisfaction went through the courtyard as the soldiers saw how easily their commander had caught caldor in his lies please esk kar please spare my son nicar begged as his son knelt in the dirt trying to find words to answer well give you gold leave orak do anything you want please spare his life noble esk kar nicar had never used the honorific toward him before but esk kar ignored the words should i spare his life so he can try again to kill trella or give more money to sisuthros to betray me a gasp went through the soldiers all eyes turning to sisuthros yes its true esk kar went on caldor gave another bag of gold to sisuthros and promised more for my death but sisuthros came to me and told me about it i should have killed caldor but i thought the young fool would learn his lesson and behave himself while esk kar spoke sisuthros reached into his belt and drew out the small pouch that contained caldors gold opening it he flung the coins in the dirt at caldors feet caldors terror was complete now father please shes only a slave give him silver no gold to satisfy him nicars son knew the customs of the village if a man injured another mans slave or even killed him the usual penalty was ten silver coins he can buy ten women better than her i cant die over a slave please father please his voice trailed off you fool caldor nicar his face red with anger as he twisted helplessly in the guards arms shouted the words at his son shes not a slave esk kar freed her before he left the village witnessed in secret before myself and corio they were married by the priest in ishtars temple shes his wife everyone looked at esk kar in astonishment let him go esk kar said to the guards holding nicars arms nicar stood there swaying on his feet then he stepped forward and struck his son across the face a hard blow that knocked him backward off his knees you foolish child youve tried to kill a free woman not a slave nicar struggled to catch his breath he looked ready to collapse nicar esk kar stepped toward him the soldiers waited for the order that would slay caldor and his father nicar youve shown nothing but respect for me and trella i gave you my word to defend orak because i saw how much the village means to you so ill spare your life even the life of your foolish son esk kar glanced around at the soldiers who listened in shock to his words instead ill leave orak if the families want to get rid of me so badly ill save them the trouble as soon as trella can ride were leaving orak you can defeat the barbarians yourself or not it will mean nothing to me if any wish to follow me they are welcome he turned toward bantor release nicars child he said scornfully then turned again to face nicar now go take your gold and hope by all the gods that i never see your son again bantor didnt move no one moved no one said anything as the moments passed by even nicar stood frozen until caldors voice broke the spell yes father yes take me home let the barbarian go let him go gatus slapped his hand on his sword by marduk ill go with you ill not fight for cowards who would stab a woman in the back but first ill take care of this little shit he pulled the weapon from its sheath and stepped toward caldor esk kar blocked gatus no put your sword away bantor spoke i too will go with you he stepped past esk kar and used his foot to push caldor back down and any of the men who want to fight sisuthros joined in and his voice rose up over all the others well all go we dont need orak we can build our own village to the west with esk kar as our leader better to build and battle for our own than to fight for cowards and murderers a roar of assent went up echoing off the courtyard walls into the night sky swords flashed in the torchlight the men called out esk kar or trellas name others shouted death to caldor outside the courtyard men took up the cry dozens had listened from the edge of the garden hanging over the top of the wall to see and hear what went on but others joined in repeating the shouts from the courtyard without fully understanding what had happened esk kar stood there he could scarcely believe what he heard never had he seen such emotion such loyalty no leader no war chief no village noble had ever been cheered like this right now these men would follow him anywhere do anything he said he could lead a migration of his own with nearly four hundred fighting men they could go where they pleased and take what they wanted this was powersuddenly he understoodreal power not the kind that one buys with gold and he realized something elsethat he ruled in orak now the soldiers and the villagers had given him the power another voice had risen up trying to be heard over the din corio pushed away from his guard and the master builder raised his arms high asking to speak esk kar bellowed over the shouting demanding silence it took time before it was quiet enough for corios words to be heard soldiers villagers listen i beg you esk kar must not go you must not go you need not go the customs of orak condemn caldor not the hand of esk kar his evil deed sentences him to death for attempting to kill a free woman is that not so nobles corio turned sharply toward the heads of the other families still clustered together dread visible on their faces is that not so corio shouted the question at the top of his lungs his anger and fear putting force into his words answer me rebba stepped forward his eyes darting nervously around the courtyard death to caldor the phrase was repeated by decca then nestor death to caldor only nicar remained staring down at his son until corios hand gripped nicars shoulder and shook him hard forcing him to lift his eyes he stared dully at corio as if he didnt even recognize him death to caldor nicars words could barely be heard the courtyard erupted swords flashed in the torchlight and everyone screamed the words death to caldor over and over again corio held up his hands for silence all have agreed take him to the market and stone him to death take all of them walk them through the streets and proclaim their guilt to everyone let lady trella be avenged let the women stone them a deafening roar burst from the crowd wait let me speak esk kars words stopped the soldiers before they rushed off do you want me to stay and fight the barbarians another roar went up repeated from the street stay stay stay they repeated the words without ceasing the soldiers went wild now their bloodlust had spread to the crowd in the street nothing would stop them esk kar turned and jerked caldor to his feet he had to shout to make himself heard his face close to the boys blanching face youll die slowly caldor as you deserve and when youre dead ill place your head at trellas feet right here in this garden you should have listened to your father two hawk clan soldiers pulled caldor out of esk kars hands other soldiers cut natram zar down from the tree and dragged a screaming loki toward the gate gatus make sure its done right then bring me his head i promised it to trella no mercy father help me gatus shoved caldor into the hands of his men the action unleashing another roar to the heavens half pushed half dragged they led caldor through the courtyard many took the opportunity to strike at his head or shoulders another roar went up as they reached the street the crowd screamed for his death in moments the courtyard had emptied itself esk kar heard the crowds progress as it began the journey down the streets of orak the victims would be shown to all looking around esk kar found himself alone no one had stayed behind all wanted to see the men die esk kar trod back into the house and found that empty too even the servants had joined the mob screaming for blood and wanting to see the execution he thought about going up to see how trella was doing but decided to wait awhile emotionally drained he went into the kitchen and sank tiredly back onto the stool he felt weak the wine and cheese remained on the table untouched draining the wine esk kar refilled the cup he forced himself to take a bite of the goat cheese which he could hardly taste and barely swallow he managed as best he could caldor would die though not as slowly or painfully as esk kar wanted there might be a chance to make peace with nicar esk kar had learned a hard lesson one he would never forget from now on anyone who plotted against him would die quickly hed never give any man such an opportunity again like a fool hed thought the danger to himself gone when he returned to orak with the barbarians only weeks away instead caldor had struck at trella esk kar thought of his woman lying upstairs now everyone knew shed been freed that hed taken her for his wife despite her objections hed insisted on freeing her and marrying her before he left she would act the slave no longer he was glad of that esk kar found trella dressed sitting on her stool and combing her hair only seven days since the stabbing she was ignoring the advice of ventor and everyone else in the household he stood in their bedroom doorway her face lacked color either from the injury or confinement indoors and she had to move slowly so as not to disturb the bandages but other than that she looked remarkably well the young heal quickly she had just passed into her fifteenth season he enjoyed watching her comb her hair perhaps because the long tresses were her most beautiful feature or because she obviously enjoyed the task she saw his reflection in her tiny silver mirror and smiled but the determined look stayed in her eyes she would not return to bed when she tried to change hands esk kar saw a moment of pain on her face he moved to her side and took the comb let me help you you dont want to open up your wound it gave him pleasure to run the comb awkwardly through her hair using his other hand to guide and straighten the wavy strands hed never combed another womans hair thinking it unfit for a man now he no longer cared what anyone else might think you dont make a good handmaiden esk kar she said smiling to show her appreciation ill have annok sur finish it my hands are clumsy he agreed putting down the comb you should not be out of bed yet the healer said i know what ventor said i was here when he said it but the wound has closed and theres no need for me to stay in bed like an old woman besides i have a gift for you a gift presents were rare among the villagers but even rarer among barbarians what kind of gift he couldnt keep the interest out of his voice one youll like i was going to have it on the table when you came home this evening but now youll have to get it yourself its under the bed puzzled he stooped beside the bed at first he didnt see it the shadows blending with the dark material as soon as he touched it he knew what it was and he brought it out from under the bed then unwrapped it a magnificent bronze sword glinted against the black cloth he held it up to the light turning it this way and that amazed by its feel and how it seemed to merge with his hand esk kar had never seen such a blade forged so fine that it seemed a single edge from tip to pommel the bronze metal looked darker than usual except at the edge where the sharpeners wheel gave it a brighter glint that reflected the sunlight the hilt encased in hardwood and criss crossed by tough leather strips to improve the grip was longer and wider than usual to better balance the long blades weight the pommel a simple large ball of bronze looked hard enough to crush a skull his eyes returned to the blade though wider and thicker than his old sword the weight was less with a shallow groove down the center for a blood channel the guard differed too with a strip of slightly angled metal designed to protect the hand but flat enough to allow the weapon to be carried comfortably across the back by the gods trella what a weapon ive never seen such workmanship before where did it come from what did it cost esk kar swung the blade through the air a true horsemans weapon meant more for slashing than thrusting she smiled at him like a mother watching a child play with a new toy master asmar made it right here in orak do you remember our meeting with him esk kar remembered it all too well theyd called on master swordmaker asmar to inquire about weapons for orak to his embarrassment esk kar discovered he knew even less about metal smithing than he did about bows he hadnt known bronze weapons were a new improvement a method of working with metals less than a hundred years old asmar had sighed then explained that with the discovery of bronze the sword became the warriors preferred weapon replacing club or axe before that swords had been made of copper but copper weapons were soft didnt hold an edge and tended to shatter so fighting men continued to rely on more dependable weapons bronze changed all that a far harder metal bronze kept its sharp edge and a bronze blade could cut right through a copper one daggers and knives weapons not intended for use against metal were still made of copper but copper swords were rare now how the ores were discovered mined and turned into metal how that metal was forged beaten and shaped the entire swordmaking art proved a mystery to esk kar he hadnt known bronze could only be made by combining specific amounts of copper and tin and that these elements required the work of many slaves to dig the veins of metal from the earth the two ores each soft and flexible alone could then be heated and combined the resulting molten metal was poured into a mold where it cooled into the desired shape hardening in the process into a metal far stronger than either of its original parts yes i remember asmar i remember i had to spend the whole day listening to him and watching him work his magic so the next time someone spoke of swordmaking id understand what they were saying after that esk kar promised himself to never again take any craftsmans trade for granted hed learned more than just the mystery of bronze this sword seems cast for my own hand when did asmar find time to make such a master blade asmar and his family labored all day and long into the night often working by the light of their forges to produce all the swords lance tips arrowheads and battle axes orak needed every day smoke from asmars fires rose into the sky as he and his helpers created weapons his battle axes easier and cheaper to make remained a favorite of many with its simple bronze blade attached to a wooden handle it would be very useful in defending the wall while a sword took months to master a villager could be trained to swing an axe in a few days i told him to make you a new sword trella answered one befi tting the man who would save orak asmar said hed already begun working on a master weapon but it would take many months and be very expensive we haggled over the price but he finally lowered his demands leave it to trella to bargain down the cost esk kar hefted the sword again and itched to test it against the training posts he remembered his manners in time this gift its the most valuable thing ive ever owned and i have no words to express my thanks her smile vanished the cost is nothing if it saves your life take it with you when you ride across the river thats why i gave it to you today so you can test its strength but remember the sword is nothing and another can always be made dont do anything foolish because you have it its only a lump of metal if the sword helps you return safely it will have achieved its only purpose he nodded remembering those hed seen die because theyd grown too attached to one weapon or another ill use it well trella esk kar tossed the weapon on the bed and took her in his arms now how can i thank you perhaps you could return to your bed as the healer ordered and i could show you how much i appreciate your gift i dont think i would get much rest and there is much to do besides i thought you would be glad to see me up and around she turned back to her table and sat down i like you better in bed he said moving his hand to the back of her neck and rubbing the muscles there with both hands you give me much less talk and much more pleasure though you moan and cry out loud enough to wake the dead she leaned back against him her head resting on his hip if you like i will return to bed husband and try to be quiet standing over her he saw her left breast inside the loose dress uplifted by the bandage that passed under it and the sight still excited him it was the hour of noon and everyone was taking their meal but he didnt want to do anything that might slow her healing perhaps later after youve changed the dressing he kissed the top of her head and you need not worry about being quiet i will try to wait until tonight she straightened up and turned back to her mirror now what took you away from your training jalen has returned from across the river esk kar had sent the man out to find a suitable place to ambush the barbarians he was surprised to hear what happened jalen offers prayers for your speedy recovery he joins us tonight for dinner did he find a suitable place jalens mission interested trella far more than his prayers he thinks so well talk about that tonight esk kar sat down on the edge of the bed do you think the barbarians will come soon she might have been asking about the weather the main host is moving faster theyll be here in less than a month must you go across the river now she sounded like a soldiers wife fretting about her husband worrying that he must risk his life in some minor skirmish when hed be needed for the great battle before the walls theyd had this discussion before yes from what jalen tells me he hesitated ill wait a few more days in case mesilim can get through he worried more about that than he admitted mesilim should have sent word by now if he were coming the noose had started closing around orak and fewer people came asking for shelter or transport across the river in another week it would be too late for mesilim to come at all eskkars men had begun burning the fields and crops riding as close to the barbarians as they dared then falling back torching everything behind them the alur meriki would find little to sustain man or beast when they arrived and the villagers lives would depend on the grain and livestock sent across the river at least until the next harvest what else troubles you husband she could tell when something bothered him nicar wishes to speak to me to us he sent a messenger asking if he could meet with us today i havent yet sent a reply esk kar hadnt seen or spoken to nicar since caldors death the father had stood there hands over his eyes as they stoned his son to death gatus had to protect nicar from the wrath of the crowd that cried out for his blood it must be a terrible thing to watch your child die for a moment trella seemed lost in thought what should we say to him hed come to ask her that very question but he sat there and thought about what would be best for orak for himself and for nicar after trellas attack hed considered banishing nicar and his family despite trellas advice but now he knew that would be a mistake orak needed men like nicar open minded fair men who could deal honestly with people we must find a way to make peace between us trella but how we can accomplish that with blood shed on both sides a blood feud can only be settled with blood there must be no more blood shed especially from the noble families besides we owe so much to nicar he raised you up to captain of the guard stood by you when drigo was killed and convinced the other families to give you the gold you needed and to submit to your orders he gave me to you so that i could help you i think he was protecting me even then from caldor perhaps he was afraid you would slip a knife in caldors ribs while he slept esk kar made a face he couldnt contemplate the thought of trella in nicars or anyone elses bed youre right theres much we owe him but how do we make peace what thoughts must be in nicars mind now what will concern him the most lesu he will be worrying about his son esk kar said weeks before theyd put lesu in charge of all the cattle grain and livestock taken across the river along with thirty five soldiers and forty armed villagers to herd and care for the animals theyd established a camp in the hill country at least a hundred miles away nicar dispatched a rider across the river six days ago no doubt to carry the news about his brother perhaps nicar comes to plead for his sons life yes thats likely but you mustnt let him plead or beg for anything that would destroy his dignity you must treat him with respect and we must assure him that he and his son will come to no harm she reached over and took his hand lets talk about what we will say the long summer sun still blazed in the afternoon sky when nicar arrived esk kar had spoken to the household and everyone greeted nicar respectfully before escorting him upstairs esk kar and trella were standing when nicar entered esk kar bowed formally and offered nicar one of three chairs arranged around the small table platters of fruits and dates rested on the table along with a pitcher of wine esk kar studied nicar and saw a man who had aged greatly until now esk kars hatred of caldor had overshadowed any sympathy toward nicar but seeing him like this esk kar felt a pang of sorrow for the man the man whod been the most powerful in orak now knew that all his wealth couldnt bring back his influence caldors deed had weakened his fathers authority and the barbarian invasion would change the foundations of village life the new orak would be very different from the old nicar sat awkwardly for a moment until trella spoke noble nicar the loss of your son must pain you greatly if theres anything we can do please tell us we need your help in the coming days nicar stared at her for a moment then looked at esk kar trella lady trella you seem much recovered i am glad i came to beg your forgiveness for what my son did his head went down for a moment it was a weak and shameful act the deed of a foolish child spoiled by his father the fault was mine i did not restrain him didnt teach him to respect others trella reached out and touched his arm nicar theres no need to say such things we understand without you esk kar and i wouldnt be here today we owe you more than we can ever repay but now we must think of the future if we survive the battle there are years of work ahead of us and we need your help that night the crowd wanted to kill me nicar turned to esk kar why did you have your men protect me it would have been easier for you with me dead my house broken each day since ive waited for your revenge let there be no talk of revenge nicar esk kar answered seeing things clearly now youve been nothing but honest with me i put no blood feud between us i know you had nothing to do with it caldor paid the price for his deed and that can be the end of it true enough and nicar hadnt known anything about it if he had the attempt would never have been madeor it would have been better planned and executed nevertheless esk kar couldnt stop from saying what he felt if trella had been killed it might have been different if shed died he would have taken every drop of blood from nicar and his family then left their bodies to rot in the sun nicar looked at both of them almost as if seeing them for the first time youve changed much esk kar since we first met youve become a great leader and trella has become a noble woman wise beyond her seasons i failed to see what the rest of the villagers saw months ago when they first called her a great lady and now i find mercy from you both he shook his head as if all this were beyond his understanding do not talk of mercy nicar only of friendship trella replied we need your wisdom the village has changed greatly in the last few months if the barbarians are driven off we can never return to the old ways orak will become a great city larger than any of us can imagine and every mans hand will stretch out to take it as a prize all will hear of orak and come here for protection such a city must be governed by a strong ruler and this ruler will need a wise council to advise him nicar smiled wanly im sure as long as esk kar has you at his side lady trella hell need few others to advise him there are many people in orak nicar esk kar said and more will come in the years ahead you told me once that you built orak and you wanted it to last because of your will i stayed to fight but many hands will be needed in the future to make your dream come true and the customs and laws of the village must be more than the whims of the five families esk kar took a breath i ask for your help nicar help to make orak into a great city for all the people who will dwell here including your own family i give my help gladly and that of my son lesu hes a good man and grows in wisdom each day there will be no blood feud between our families i swear it nicar paused for a moment what is my future trella had prepared esk kar for this question tomorrow the three of us will walk the streets of orak together that way all can see that there is no anger between us and that you remain an important voice in oraks defense once the barbarians are upon us the people will have other things to think about and afterward trella added theyll remember only your good works in their behalf nicar seemed much moved by their words he stood up and bowed youre right esk kar id forgotten about orak and its future that is more important than anything else and now captain lady trella i thank all the gods that youre both here in orak after nicar had gone esk kar left word that they were not to be disturbed then bolted the door to the outer room so i am to be the strong ruler of orak when did you decide that wife as he said the words he picked her up in his arms and carried her into the bedroom i did not want your head to swell too greatly she answered with a smile as he helped her remove her dress nicar had to be told what his place will be hell be grateful now and give you his support she breathed a sigh of pleasure as esk kar began to run his hands over her body carefully avoiding the bandaged areas and with nestor terrified of his own plots he too will support you along with corio who rises in importance every day and owes everything he has to you there should be no problems from the families for a while at least then be quiet girl and lets begin working on the sixth family under the noonday sun sweat covered esk kars half naked body calluses had formed on his hand to match the grip of his new sword and in five days hed shattered half a dozen posts the fine blade kept a sharp edge and its weight now felt natural to him his muscles rippled under his tanned skin nothing remained of the soft village life hed never been as strong and fit in his life jalen stood breathing hard on the other side of the training post each man countered the others moves but instead of striking at each other the thick wooden beam took the brunt of the parries thrusts and hacks any barbarian who made the mistake of thinking them easy victims would not live long enough to regret his error a horse galloping toward them made them look up no one ran a horse in the crowded streets unless on urgent matters as the rider dismounted in a swirl of dust esk kar saw the hawk clan emblem on his chest captain ive word from sisuthros hes met the ur nammu and asks that you come at once esk kar muttered thanks to the gods time was running out and he had to take a force across the river in a few days with or without the ur nammu but if they could help well done ugarde find yourself another horse well leave at once he turned to jalen get ten men ready to ride they needed the extra men barbarian patrols might be encountered anywhere esk kar checked his new sword making sure the edge was still keen then wiped it down with a rag so far no tarnish spots had developed eventually tarnish would cover the blade completely though asmar claimed the metal would only become stronger as a result at the well esk kar washed himself down before drinking deeply he dressed in his leather vest and cap despite the heat then he dispatched a messenger to inform gatus and trella where he was going they rode out of orak at a gallop riding the last horses remaining in the village four hours of steady riding across the countryside found them many miles from orak riding slower now to conserve the horses their eyes constantly searched hilltops and horizons looking for dust clouds that might indicate either a friendly patrol or a hostile war party instead they found another hawk clan rider coming toward them at an easy canter he told them that sisuthros followed only a dozen miles behind they kept riding and soon saw four riders approaching them they met near a stand of rock that rose above the tall grass one rider proved to be an ur nammu warrior the man appeared near exhaustion and every rib showed on his chest he rode a thin pony that looked more spent than its master esk kar dismounted and extended his hand in greeting he remembered the tribesman from the camp but hadnt spoken with him and didnt recall his name greetings esk kar war leader of orak the man began formally im fashod sent by mesilim to learn if you still seek our aid i welcome a warrior brother as i welcome the ur nammu weve food and drink for you but first tell me of mesilim hes well yes but all are weary and the horses grow weaker each day as soon as it grows dark the ur nammu will slip past the last of the alur meriki patrols he paused to spit on the ground at the mention of the name to join you in your fight ive shown war leader sisuthros where they will cross now i must inform mesilim that you await his arrival your news is good fashod but first you must rest weve food and water sisuthros esk kar and fashod sat together on the sand apart from the rest of the men most of whom had never seen a barbarian this close jalen stayed with the soldiers and kept reminding them not to stare fashod drank thirstily from one of the water skins then devoured two days worth of the bread esk kars men carried that horse doesnt look strong enough to make it back sisuthros commented its been pushed for a long time esk kar nodded a few weeks of hard riding could finish most horses hed noticed the animal too and it started him thinking fashod take one of our horses in exchange you may need a strong beast tonight fashod looked at each man in turn until now hed been polite but aloof doing his duty as his clan leader ordered it and nothing more the offer of a horse even for a temporary exchange was a signifi cant gesture he put down his food and wiped his mouth with the back of his arm chief esk kar i thank you my mount is a good one and needs only a few days rest and grass to recover finish your food and drink esk kar said as he climbed to his feet thinking the animal would need at least a week to recover ill go and see to the horse returning to where jalen waited he told him about the horse swap pick someone small who can walk and ride fashods horse back to orak get him started at once otherwise hell get left behind if we have to run esk kar glanced back at fashod jalen i want you to return at once to orak if all the ur nammu are as bad off as this man theyre going to need weapons food and fresh horses if theyre to fight at all tell trella and gatus what they need jalen nodded and went off to choose a horse for the exchange esk kar returned to fashod a horse will be ready soon along with extra food tell mesilim we await him here to escort him to orak mesilim will be pleased fashod said jalen came over leading a horse stripped down to the halter fashod gathered his weapons and the food and galloped off to the east a few moments later jalen cantered in the opposite direction quickly passing one of his men whod started walking fashods horse on the same path mesilim and his men may be finished sisuthros remarked he wouldve sent one of his best men to find us they may not be of much use to us after all esk kar had the same grim thought maybe well see what mesilim has learned besides it can only help to have thirty or so horsemen protecting our rear and tired or not theyll kill at least that many before theyre finished the ur nammu didnt arrive until long after midnight and even in the moonlight they looked played out esk kar bade mesilim rest while oraks riders kept guard at dawn they started moving west though at a slow pace some ur nammu horses were going lame and their riders spent as much time leading them as riding everyone kept looking behind wondering when a horde of alur meriki would appear esk kar took stock of mesilims band esk kar counted thirty eight men five women and seven children of various ages riding forty four horses there were no infants or small children those would have been left behind to die or killed by their parents both men and beasts looked ready to drop the exhausted children eyes wide with hunger looked as pitiful as the warriors all would reach orak none too soon esk kar walked his horse between mesilim and subutai from a captured alur meriki scout mesilim had learned much and theyd watched the alur meriki raiding parties traveling south for men trapped within an ever shrinking circle around orak any information was welcome by nightfall theyd journeyed far enough away from danger and close enough to orak that esk kar began to relax they made camp and the ur nammu fell asleep as soon as they fi nished eating the last of the soldiers food in the morning esk kar gave half his men to sisuthros and told him to return to his patrols the extra men would help the subcommander begin the final burning the alur meriki would reach orak soon esk kar was determined that they find nothing of value in their path crops burned in every field houses corrals anything that would burn would be put to the torch only the wells remained untouched with so many small streams and irrigation canals nearby it would have done little good to contaminate wells by dumping dead animals into them he hoped the alur meriki would leave them as clean when they moved on they topped the last hill ringing the plains around orak at midafternoon everyone breathed a sigh of relief at the sight of the villages walls during the day esk kar had twice been challenged by patrols from the village bantors men would take no chances on a barbarian band slipping through their midst the men and women riding behind esk kar began to talk at the sight of orak its wall rising out of the earth even at this distance they saw the gangs of men laboring before the wall digging out the final stretch of the ditch none of the ur nammu had ever seen a village so large nor a wall so strong and tall to the north the flooding of the fields had begun the south side would be flooded as soon as the ur nammu departed rest tonight mesilim tomorrow you can give me your advice as to how you would attack orak mesilim and his son stared at the village impressed as much by its size as its wall with all the people driven here by the alur meriki esk kar commented there are nearly three thousand people in orak more have crossed the river until now mesilim began i didnt believe you could resist the alur meriki now i see that you may have a chance more than just a chance esk kar smiled with satisfaction theres much to show you they rode slowly toward the gate and as they neared the walls the laborers paused to stare at the unusual group soon curious villagers crowded the walls a few began cheering when they recognized esk kar riding at the head of the small band of allies esk kar led them away from the main gate and guided mesilims people along the ditch that ran parallel to the south wall then on until they reached the river as they paced their horses along people kept shouting from the wall and waving their hands in greeting the ur nammu seemed astonished at the sight and esk kar realized that they hadnt given any thought about how they might be received by the villagers when the little band reached the river they turned once again theyd camp alongside the wall at the rivers edge out of sight of anyone on the hilltops to the east an open space awaited them with two water barrels hay and grain for the horses a great stack of firewood and two bullocks on spits already butchered and ready for roasting a pile of blankets lay stacked beside the water barrels a small rope corral would hold their horses with fodder placed inside the animals had sorely lacked grain in recent months esk kar signaled their journeys end by dismounting camp here mesilim if theres anything you need it will be provided if you bathe in the river be careful the current is strong except along the waters edge it can pull down a horse and rider even at this time of year ill return in a few hours he led his horse through the river gate and found trella waiting for him two soldiers now guarded her at all times he took her hand and they walked back to the house inside the courtyard trella went to fetch him clean clothes while he headed to the well to wash the dirt and horse smell from his body by the time hed finished trella rejoined him a clean tunic and undergarment in her hands i watched from the wall she said as soon as you left they rushed for the food and water they must be nearly starving theyre in bad shape they were lucky to get past the alur merikis lines but theyve already paid their way with information they captured an alur meriki messenger and tortured him until he told them all he knew the messenger revealed that they plan to send a force across the river in four or five days time that means well have to meet them across the river soon by then warriors will be on the hills surrounding orak a few days later theyll be ready to attack youll be back before then i hope her tone implied that he would be in more trouble with her than with the barbarian raiding party if he werent yes even if the ambush fails ill come straight back ill leave in three days it will be a slow march north to the ambush site and we may need time to prepare did you make the preparations i requested we met with the craftsmen and everything should be ready by noon tomorrow but you didnt tell me they had women and children there were so few of them i didnt think it was important she looked at him but esk kar held up his hand i know everything is important but truly they didnt mention them except in passing do they really matter perhaps but now there are more things i must do come inside supper is on the table yes wife he answered dutifully village women could prove a trial for their men there were advantages to being a barbarian after all especially when it came to dealing with women two hours later esk kar returned to the ur nammu camp dressed in his best tunic but wearing his short sword and accompanied by jalen and gatus whom he introduced to mesilim and subutai much had happened in the last hours the horses had been fed then led to the river to be washed and groomed the men and women had taken their own baths probably the first in many weeks their clothing had been soaked and scrubbed and now was drying on their bodies the children had been fed then wrapped in blankets the littlest ones slept their stomachs full for the first time in weeks for the adults food was now the main order of business they gathered around the fires eagerly slicing off chunks of roasting meat four wineskins had been provided enough to give everyone a good drink but not enough to get anyone drunk i have some gifts mesilim esk kar began as he and his men sat down a little away from the fires facing mesilim and subutai esk kar motioned to gatus who placed a blanket on the ground between them and unwrapped it inside was a slim lance tipped with bronze an arrow a bowstring and a sword esk kar saw the confusion on mesilims face your men have lost much equipment so tomorrow you will have sixty lances such as this also for each man fifty arrows and five extra bowstrings and as many swords and knives as you need bowstrings always seemed to be breaking as important as the bow itself they proved even harder to come by in the field subutai leaned over and picked up the arrow eyeing it to make sure it was the proper size for their curved bows your arrows are longer and heavier where did you get so many shafts this size we made them subutai that is theyll be finished by tomorrow evening the fletchers started as soon as i sent word the same with the lance these are weapons for those who fight from horseback and though we dont use such weapons ourselves we can make them quickly now that impressed them it would have taken them weeks to make so many arrows whatever else you esk kars voice died away as mesilims eyes shifted from him turning esk kar saw a group of seven women approach the camp two of them carrying torches now that dusk had fallen each woman carried a bundle or basket of various size and shape trella walked in their midst wearing her finest dress and escorted by her guards annok sur beside her carrying one of the torches the torchlight procession had a strange effect on the tribesmen they could see that a woman of importance was coming trellas fine dress and the guards conveyed that fact as much as the obvious respect shown by the accompanying women conversation and eating ceased throughout the camp everyone rose to their feet in respect an unusual gesture for such men the leading women stopped when they reached esk kars group and trella passed through them to move to esk kars side once there she bowed to the visitors then turned to esk kar he felt her effect as much as did the others in the flickering torchlight she looked like one touched by the gods only the hissing and snapping of the torches broke the silence esk kar found his voice and made the introductions she bowed low again then straightened erect and proud i welcome you to orak clan leader mesilim and your brave son subutai esk kar translated her words then nodded to her to continue we honor your fight against our common enemy my husband did not tell me you had women and children so we had not prepared for them now we bring them gifts and clothing trellas voice sounded serene and regal mesilim might not understand her words but he clearly recognized her presence he looked at her as much at a loss for words as esk kar had been a moment ago subutai stared at her with his mouth open honored wife trella mesilim began you honor us by your presence and your gifts we welcome you to our campfire esk kar told us you were a gifted one but we did not expect you to visit us trella glanced at esk kar as he translated and he read the question in her glance gifted one she would say tonight followed no doubt by the everything is important speech she bowed again to mesilim your visit honors us as does your offer to help in our fight how could i do less now i must leave you to your talk while we tend to your women if i have your leave when she left they sat back down no one spoke for a moment esk kar saw gatus struggling to keep a grin off his face trella did look and act as if she had the power to command both men and spirits perhaps it wasnt just superstition maybe she did have the gift and maybe a group of barbarians could see it more clearly than esk kar could they watched as she went to the women but found herself surrounded by mesilims men the ur nammu women had to push the men aside fashod stood at trellas side translating for her then helped with the distribution of clothing and other gifts the commotion went on for some time until the women led trella and her companions away from the men they sat a short distance from the fire to talk about things that concerned women only even fashod stayed away leaving one of the women to do the translating trella asked her guards to move back as well after watching for a while the tribesmen returned to the fire and their food but their eyes often returned to trella and the women lighted now only by the flickering torches that began to burn low mesilim shook his head and turned back to esk kar and his men never have i seen the women act like that to take a stranger into their midst and pay honor to her she truly has the gift to move my people so easily shes wise beyond her seasons esk kar added her wisdom guides me and gives me strength gatus spoke unexpectedly her wisdom guides all of us mesilim my wife who has more than twice her seasons stands at her side and heeds her every word esk kar translated gatuss words with another smile chief esk kar why do those men guard her subutai inquired surely no one would harm one with the gift esk kar shook his head in disgust i have not been war leader in orak for long subutai two weeks ago one of my enemies tried to kill her he was angered at her wisdom and thought to attack me by killing her she was wounded but survived and now i make sure that it doesnt happen again the clan responsible was killed mesilim made it more of a statement than a question all those involved died slain by the people esk kar said carefully i dont think it will happen again no sense trying to explain local politics to tribesmen who tended to see everything as white or black depending on the offense barbarians might hold an entire clan responsible for the misdeed of one of its members nor will it gatus added firmly after esk kar explained subutais question everyone has been warned guard her well esk kar subutai suggested if the alur meriki knew you had one such as her theyd tear the walls down to take her esk kar looked at him reading beneath the mans words echoes of what subutai himself might like to do esk kar felt surprised at his intuition but where trella was concerned his eyes had become quick to see and his wits and words just as swift subutai such a gift cannot be taken by force it must be given freely an enemy cannot capture it and a friend would never try may her wisdom guide you esk kar mesilim said bringing the conversation back to the matter at hand youll need her help in the coming fight now lets talk about weapons they discussed the weapons and reviewed the plans for the next few days they were almost finished when laughter coming from the women made all heads turn toward them again trella stood now holding hands with some of the tribeswomen as all of them sought to touch her finally they released their clasp trella bowed to them and walked toward the leaders passing through most of the warriors who seemed to pay more attention to her than to their leaders mesilim and subutai again rose to their feet as did esk kar and his men a moment later trella stepped between mesilim and his son and stopped with them close on either side esk kar some of the children are too weak to travel ive offered to care for them here until the battle is over she looked at mesilim that is if clan leader mesilim will allow it my women suggested this mesilim questioned in surprise as soon as esk kar finished translating esk kar felt as astonished as mesilim hed never heard of such a thing to leave children with not only strangers but hereditary enemies trella theres danger here as well they may not understand what they are asking before trella could reply one of the women approached the group calling out as she did so and slowing down until subutai waved her forward the woman spoke softly but rapidly to subutai and esk kar couldnt keep up with her words so fast did she speak whatever she said it took a long time and when she finished she didnt move away though custom decreed it subutai turned toward esk kar it is as honored trella says my woman wants to leave the five youngest here saying they will surely die if we have to travel hard once again my daughter is among those subutai looked at his father well have to speak of this mesilim nodded thoughtfully then turned to trella well consider your offer with great care but our thanks are yours already then i will leave you men to your work she touched esk kar on the arm and wished him goodnight as she started to leave one of the tribesmen called something out to mesilim then added several sentences and trella hearing her name stopped and waited esk kar heard what the man said but it made no sense something about touching the gifted one mesilim turned toward esk kar my men request a great favor though youve already done so much for us but if it is permitted they would like to touch trella to give them strength and a blessing from the gods mesilim sounded a little uncomfortable with the request but did not withdraw it trella came back to esk kars side and looked inquiringly at him they want to touch you for luck or something he said it may be a custom i dont remember or something ive never seen before mesilim seems embarrassed by it but probably thinks its a good idea what should i do how should i touch them esk kar thought for a moment touch each man on his upper right arm to give him strength in battle trella handed her empty basket to annok sur at her side as always and approached mesilim she put out her hand but not to his arm instead she placed the palm of her hand on his forehead may you have the wisdom to lead your people through the coming fight she said then touched his right arm as esk kar suggested turning to subutai and placing her hand on his forehead may you have the wisdom to guide your people in the days ahead when many things will change and all will be sorely tested by the time she finished a line had formed behind subutai some of the men pushing each other to gain a higher place she went down the line touching each man on his battle arm offering them strength for the coming battle fashod followed alongside her translating her words the women had gone to the end of the line and with each of them she clasped hands when she finished she retrieved her basket and left without a word her guards and the women falling in behind her they stood there watching in silence until she passed through the gate and out of sight then esk kar turned to mesilim rest tonight mesilim my men will close the gate to keep the curious away and theyll keep watch from the walls i dont think any will approach you here but you may want to post your own guard no man from the village will be outside the walls tonight tomorrow ill return and well talk further when they had walked out of earshot jalen made a comment that was the strangest thing ive ever seen they looked and acted as if trella were a goddess nothing strange about that gatus answered is there esk kar nothing at all gatus esk kar said with a laugh nothing at all two nights later and three hours after sunset esk kar led a hundred men through the river gate it took half the night to ferry them and their equipment across the river by dawn the soldiers had marched well inland out of sight of any watchers they traveled slowly each man carried seventy pounds of equipment a wooden shield a bow two quivers of arrows plus a sword food and water gatus informed esk kar that men on foot could carry no more than sixty pounds at a steady pace so the fi rst days march would be the hardest the weight would decrease each day esk kar walked with the men hed brought only four horses for the scouts plus two donkeys to carry food and water they didnt expect to be gone more than a week if they were theyd have to live off the land on this side of the tigris nothing had been put to the torch and herds of goats and sheep still grazed in the hills gatus insisted on coming hed trained the soldiers to fight together and wanted to see his work put into practice sisuthros stayed behind to oversee oraks defenses the following night jalen would cross with mesilim and the ur nammu then guide them to esk kars soldiers at the appointed place during the march esk kar thought about his talks with mesilim and subutai the day after the ur nammus arrival esk kar and his commanders had taken mesilim and his son around the walls esk kar went over his battle plan putting mesilim in the role of the alur meriki war chief back and forth theyd ridden looking at the wall from every angle searching for weaknesses afterward he took mesilim inside and showed him the great stores of arms and the preparations for defense mesilims eyes widened in surprise at the vast quantity of arrows and stones in the end he found no flaw in esk kars defenses but you must not let them over the wall once inside they will overwhelm your men esk kar and gatus had looked at each other in satisfaction theyd drilled that same message into the men since the fi rst day the barbarians must be stopped beneath the wall time was running out for both esk kar and the alur meriki the great battle would be fought soon enough and he needed to protect his back by destroying the barbarians sent against them from the west the men cattle and supplies sent across the river must not be lost or orak would starve even if its people drove off the attackers esk kar wanted to take more men with him confident that he could return before the alur meriki arrived but the looks of panic among the families convinced him not to take too many soldiers away from orak at this late stage mesilim and his men would depart the following night to give them an extra days rest in the four days since they arrived at orak theyd had plenty of food and sleep and restored much of their strength mounted on refreshed horses theyd easily catch up with esk kar and his slow moving soldiers counting mesilim thirty seven warriors and two boys remained one warrior had been judged too weak to ride and left behind hed been told to guard the women and children staying in orak esk kar pushed the pace as hard as he could for two days walking beside the men and carrying his own equipment he could have ridden but the horses were better used by the scouts and this let him stay close to the men theyd just made camp at the end of the second day when mesilim and his men rode up esk kar studied them as they arrived four days rest showed in their faces the new clothing each man wore replaced their old garments many of their weapons were gifts from orak every lance carried a yellow strip of cloth another gift from trella and each bow dangled a smaller yellow ribbon each warrior wore a yellow sash around his waist the colors were more than simple decorationin a close up battle they helped identify friend from foe something needed even more by his soldiers the ur nammus mounts looked stronger as well and those that hadnt fully recovered were replaced by the last of oraks horses mesilims warriors looked confi dent and strong a far cry from what they had been only days before mesilim swung down from his horse and saluted esk kar while subutai led the riders to their campsite a few hundred paces away from esk kars his men had little enough experience with barbarians without getting into some argument or fight with the ur nammu over an unexpected or careless insult better to keep them apart until the time for battle when no man would turn down an ally neither leader wanted any incidents your men look fi t mesilim esk kar extended his hand in the sign of friendship on the war trail formality disappeared any trouble following our path no we rested the horses often else we would have caught up with you hours ago after everyone had eaten the two leaders stayed by the fire and discussed what the next few days would bring much would depend on the ambush site itself and they wouldnt know about that until tomorrow after mesilim left esk kar spread his blanket on the hard ground and fell asleep in moments in the morning esk kar mounted a horse for the first time with jalen and gatus he joined mesilim and subutai riding ahead of the men until they reached the site chosen for the ambush a few miles away from the river and well into the rough hill country clumps of pale green grass still showed on the land though the hills would turn brown soon enough from the merciless sun the small valley chosen for the ambush ran roughly north south and was surrounded by steeper hills at the southern entrance some farmers had built a half dozen mud houses penned some sheep goats and chickens and tried to farm the land but as jalen reported they were too few for such a task less than a dozen men and none used to living by their swords theyd have made easy victims for the first band of rogues who came by they should have welcomed esk kar and his men but they acted sullen and angry at having their land taken over even temporarily they calmed down when esk kar told them a large barbarian force was heading their way and would undoubtedly slit their throats the settlers included several women esk kar wanted no women hanging around his men women led to rape and fights he gave the settlers a dozen silver coins to pay for the loss of their houses and corrals and ordered them to head south immediately when they complained he offered to take back the coins and turn them into slaves if they preferred that got them moving loading their possessions onto three carts and shepherding their flocks before them the narrow valley ran fairly straight rising slightly from south to north at the south end where the settlers established their homes the opening was ninety paces wide once past the entrance the vale widened quickly to more than twice that the far end lay more than a mile distant and that entrance spread about two hundred and twenty paces across about five hundred paces before the north opening however the cliff walls closed in narrowing the valley at that point to approximately one hundred and twenty paces esk kar approved of the valley walls steep and rocky they offered few places where a horse and rider might with great care scramble to the top inside the basin the land was open and flat with no places for concealment or defense nevertheless neither esk kar nor mesilim looked satisfied with the location jalen saw the frowns captain this was the best location i could find you wanted something close to the river where they could be closed in and its nearly on the line of march to orak im sure its the best we could find esk kar said but its going to be difficult to spring a trap here well have to split the men and that means the alur meriki will outnumber each half and the length of the valley means a long run for the men to close up the canyon is wide here mesilim added our lines will be thin and our enemy can concentrate their forces at any point he turned to eskkar remember you say we need to kill them all not just defeat them if they see the size of our force theyll simply turn away and ride south by another route jalen looked doubtful without a fight they wont fight unless they expect to win they see no dishonor in running away or shooting arrows at us from a distance for hours or even days esk kar shook his head well have to think of something first to lure them in and then to stop their escaping the group of commanders rode slowly to the north end and inspected the ground there the entrance proved as wide as esk kar had feared though the walls did pinch in before the opening esk kar decided he had no choice this place would have to do the alur meriki might be here any day and he didnt have time to search for someplace better esk kar gatus jalen mesilim and subutai rode back to the center of the valley close to the east side dismounted and sat on the ground in a circle for two hours the fi ve of them went over their options taking into consideration the capabilities of the bowmen the ur nammu warriors the ground and what they thought the enemy would do once they had made their decisions they spent even longer improving the plan until each knew where and how they would fight while this went on soldiers and tribesmen rested and watched while their leaders scratched lines in the dirt and argued over their fates when the leaders finished planning no one felt completely satisfied but nobody could offer any further improvements esk kar and his men returned to the south end where the soldiers waited tense waiting to learn their future esk kar looked at them then raised his voice you men wanted to fight didnt you well youll get a fight to remember i promise you that this will be a fight like no other youll obey orders or wish you were never born and work like slaves if you want to live through this one remember that if you want to live with that the camp burst into activity subutai gathered what supplies he needed and took fifteen of the fittest and best mounted warriors he had the most dangerous assignmentthe bait for the trap they rode south back the way they came planning to swing completely around the entire valley so as not to leave a trail they would eventually ride north and fi nd the alur meriki let themselves be seen and lure the enemy into the valley gatus took a work crew of thirty and some digging tools from the farmhouse they walked along the steep east side to avoid making tracks down the center of the vale meanwhile mesilim posted men as lookouts on the valleys heights to make sure no one surprised them another work party took the donkeys and marched out through the south entrance to gather as much wood as they could find for the rest of that day and the next esk kars men labored and practiced their movements their archery and their signals the lead bowmen marked distances up and down the valley so the archers would always know the range the steep sides would negate any wind finally everything was ready now all depended on subutai not only did he have to find the alur meriki but he had to entice them into the valley close enough behind him for the plan to work but not too close for them to discover the trap so much could go wrong that esk kar refused to think about it instead he complained about everything the men did cursing them even as he urged them to work harder as they sweated everyone kept an eye on the horizons and hilltops keeping their weapons close at hand when all the preparations had been made they finally rested and tended to their weapons the waiting began mesilim looked tense as well shouting at his men over every little annoyance the ur nammu leader worried about his son jalen kept pacing back and forth certain his choice of the valley would be blamed if anything went wrong only gatus seemed above it all calmly making sure the men did their tasks properly saw to their arms and trained in every spare minute at midmorning the next day one of the sentries on the north rim gave a shout moments later a rider came into view galloping an obviously weary mount into the valley every eye followed the lone horseman sweat covered his mounts sides as he rode straight down the center of the valley until he reached the huts at the south end where esk kar and mesilim waited it was fashod sent by subutai with the news dismounting fashod spoke so quickly to mesilim that esk kar had trouble understanding finally mesilim turned to the waiting commanders subutai found a small scouting party of the alur meriki yesterday and ambushed them letting a few escape then he rode west pretending to hide his trail before turning south the main force of the alur meriki is following him and hes riding slowly as if his horses are tiring fashod thinks there are about seventy men in the war party subutai will be here in an hour with the alur meriki right behind him if all goes well esk kar felt the sweat start on his hands but didnt wipe them on his tunic a gesture every man would see and understand anything could go wrong the barbarians could catch up with subutai earlier than expected they could stop for some unknown reason or simply turn away and head back toward the river but now was not the moment to show fear or doubt then its time gatus take command here esk kar looked at mesilim may the gods smile on us today ill be at your side when the battle begins mesilim answered he turned to fashod stay here with gatus and make sure when subutai arrives he knows where we are and what we do with that mesilim went to his men and in a few moments all twenty two remaining ur nammu rode south out of the valley leaving only fashod with gatus and fifty soldiers at the south end mesilim had an hours ride through the hills to circle the valley and appear at the north end esk kar turned to jalen start the men moving and by the gods theyd better not leave anything behind or forget what theyve been told esk kar jalen and fifty bowmen moved north in single file hugging the east side of the valley and treading carefully so as not to leave any trace of their passing for the last two days everyone avoided trampling the grass in the center of the valley when the alur meriki rode in they must not see any sign of esk kars men near the north end of the valley where the walls pinched sharply eskkar and each of his men paused long enough to leave their weapons in the deep pit they had carefully created and cunningly concealed then they continued moving still in single file exiting the valleys north entrance and turning to the northeast the last two men used pieces of brush and took care to remove any trace or scent of their passage three hundred paces from the valley entrance esk kar jalen and fifty men packed themselves into a tiny cul de sac sat on the ground shoulder to shoulder and waited one man with good eyes and who could count was assigned as lookout crouching in some rocks a few paces from their hiding place esk kar squatted down in the dirt with his men the battle smell that familiar combination of sweat urine and feces soon filled the tiny space as fifty unarmed men were wedged together in a space little bigger than esk kars workroom weaponless except for a few knives a child with a sword could probably kill all of them esk kar knew this would be the most dangerous part of the trap hed decided to stay with the men most exposed to danger to keep them steady by sharing the risk riders coming the sentry called out softly esk kar pictured subutais men riding into the valley from the north theyd be moving slowly letting the alur meriki catch up he strained to hear them but there was too much hillside in the way and esk kar felt no vibration in the earth the men looked edgy their breathing rapid waiting the release of energy esk kar fought the urge to join the sentry but there wasnt much cover and one man could see as well as ten the waiting played tricks with his senses one moment esk kar could hear nothing then he fancied he could hear the roar of flames and subutais war cries the barbarians are in sight theyre moving theyve stopped keep silent the sentry hissed the last words the man would be hugging the ground the men jammed behind eskkar ceased all movement no one spoke or made a sound no stone kicked loose and each man watched his neighbor closely for a cough or a sneeze that could ruin everything the barbarian riders would be little more than three hundred paces from esk kars hiding place would the alur meriki sense a trap would they see the mens hiding place or spy the sentry perhaps their horses would catch their rank smell he tried to put himself in the mind of their war chief the alur meriki would see the ur nammu had ridden into a tiny valley one with a small settlement at the far end a settlement already sending fire and smoke into the sky the war chief would hear men screaming others sounding war cries and would think the ur nammu too busy looting and killing to notice that riders had gradually overtaken them from behind take the bait esk kar pleaded you can have your enemy and the loot too just ride in and take it he heard the sound of horses the much larger band of alur meriki warriors made more noise than subutais smaller party then the sounds began to fade and esk kar knew the enemy had entered the valley he saw the excitement in jalens eyes the last hoofbeat disappeared esk kar remained immobile until the sound of scraping earth announced the sentry at the opening they entered the valley captain like you said they would the mans grin looked like it would split his face in two all of them esk kar asked how many were there i counted seventy three the man whispered and they all entered esk kar leapt to his feet lets go men keep silent and run as youve never run before with that he began racing toward the entrance of the valley the sentry passing him in a flash and leading the way esk kar ran hard and reached the opening of the gorge just in time to see the alur meriki already more than halfway down the valley burst into their charge as they launched themselves at what they thought were the unsuspecting ur nammu at the far end flames and black smoke rose high into the sky as the buildings and corrals burned stoked by heaps of wood and dried grasses carefully placed under or inside them in a moment gatus and his men would rise from their hiding places and launch the first flight of arrows though they would wait until the last moment to give esk kar as much time as possible he ran as hard as he could head down feet pounding they had to cover more than a quarter of a mile to reach the weapons cache and arm themselves and all this must be done before the alur meriki spotted them in practice their best runners had covered the distance in the time a man could count to seventy eight this time they ran for their lives and their weapons and esk kars men kept passing him jalen already far ahead as the younger and faster men easily outpaced their leader esk kar cursed himself for being so old and slow though for his men hed chosen those who could run the fastest they had to reach the weapons arm themselves and form a battle line across the narrowest part of the valley before the barbarians recognized the snare and escaped back the way they came if the plan worked the trap would be considerably smaller than the valleys full length maybe small enough to allow esk kars men to support each other when the barbarians hurled all their force at one contingent or the other in an effort to escape esk kar reached the weapons pit at last and found his great sword out and leaning against a rock even with his head start all the men had passed him the line had already started to form the men struggling with their equipment as they extended toward the middle of the valley a gold coin had been promised to the first man to reach that station the men moved slower now each had to carry a sword bow and quivers the wooden shield and a thick staff to support it snatching up his sword he didnt bother to buckle it on he ran toward the valleys center he saw the fi rst soldier reach the midpoint of the valley plant his shield and notch an arrow the trap was nearly complete a few moments later esk kar reached the center as mesilim and his band rode slowly in to complete the line of battle the ur nammu formed into two ranks the riders a few feet apart bows in hand lances slung across their backs had determined looks on their faces prepared to pay back their hated enemy for the killing theyd endured esk kars fifty men stretched across two thirds of the gap mesilim and his twenty two warriors filled the remaining portion gasping for breath esk kar stopped a few steps from mesilims horse as the ur nammu chief took his place esk kar took his first good look down the valley the alur meriki milled around trying to understand what happened one moment theyd been charging toward a dozen dismounted ur nammu raiders then a line of men had risen as if by magic from the earth and launched a flight of arrows toward them in the same instant the looting and burning ur nammu had leaped to their horses and launched their own arrows the alur meriki taken by surprise had wheeled their horses and galloped back out of range esk kar knew theyd already lost their best chance to escape if theyd continued with their charge they would have taken heavy losses but at least some would have broken through gatus and subutais men esk kar picked out their leader surrounded by his men as he tried to figure out why the strangers didnt pursue the attack why they stood there shouting and cursing and waving their bows while the ur nammu rode back and forth esk kar counted thirteen riderless horses scattered among them attesting to the damage done by the arrows from gatuss men those arrows had flown at the alur meriki until they stopped and turned then ceased abruptly the subutais warriors remained behind gatuss bowmen those archers protected from foot to midchest by the heavy shields propped upright by a stake waited for the next charge as esk kar watched one alur meriki warrior shouting and waving his bow finally reached the side of his chief and pointed toward the north the chief looked back the way they had entered and saw a line of men stretching across the narrowest part of the gorge more ur nammu at their side the alur meriki had ridden into a trap and now their leader knew it esk kar glanced back down the line and saw that it had fully formed up each man stood two paces from his neighbor behind the shield that gave him partial shelter from alur meriki arrows each man had one quiver on his waist the other resting on the shield arrows splayed out for easy grasping every mans sword was thrust into the earth ready for instant use should the alur meriki survive the arrow storm jalen commanded the men closest to the walls standing behind the line sword in hand while hamati one of gatuss subcommanders took his position at the center of the bowmen hamati would direct the archers fire everyone was in place everything had gone as planned now esk kar and his men waited only one more piece of the plan was needed to make the trap complete hamati calmly chewing on a blade of grass and with a big smile on his face walked up to esk kar three water skins had been stored in the hole and hamati had just handed off the last of them to the soldiers every man would have his fill of water before the fight well captain theyve got their water now they can piss all they like he squinted down the valley i think theyre still in arrow range of gatuss men and dont know it theyre confused all right esk kar agreed this isnt how theyre used to fighting but theyll make a new plan soon enough are the men ready a stupid question and esk kar regretted the words as soon as he uttered them the veteran hamati had heard a hundred such questions from senior leaders theyre ready and ive told them again to aim at the horses he smiled at his captains worries theyve got confidence now too knowing that gatus stopped them dont worry well hold them there was movement in the alur meriki ranks and their horses began to turn toward esk kar a ragged line forming their leader had evidently decided to take no more chances with what might lie before him hed try to escape the way he came gatus saw the same movement and knew what it meant esk kar couldnt hear the order but suddenly arrows winged their way toward the barbarians just within range of the soldiers long bows mitrac with his longer and more powerful bow would be able to reach them easily esk kar had left mitrac with gatus thinking the youth would be safer there the deadly rain fell on the alur meriki again wounding man and beast throwing the unformed mass into more confusion one horse went wild with pain kicking and biting until someone killed it the alur meriki trotted out of range but gatus reacted almost as promptly moving his men forward fifty paces before they stopped to reform the line of shields the ur nammu warriors paced their horses right behind time to get to work hamati esk kar said grimly theyve figured it out now he walked back to mesilim what will they do next your side or mine your side mesilim answered without turning his eyes away from the enemy sitting tall on his saddle blanket trying to see as much as possible theyll try to ride right through the center of your men as far from ours as possible now they only seek to break out and they dont think your bowmen can stop them if your men can hold well break them something in mesilims voice gave esk kar a chill hed heard that tone before the battle fury that made men berserk with rage at their enemies but he had no time for such thoughts the alur meriki began to move toward the east side of the valley driving their horses to a gallop as they rode up the slight incline bows up full range hamati shouted using the same words as he had done in a thousand training sessions as he gauged the distance for the first shot aim for the horses if any get through use your swords on the horses legs the bows were drawn and the shafts held angled up for long range shooting ready hamatis voice carried up and down the line loose at will fifty arrows leapt from the bowstrings their fall timed to arrive at a distant spot of earth at the same moment the barbarians reached it the shafts whistled as they burst into the air the second wave launched less than three seconds later then another the volley becoming more jagged as the faster men got off shots a bit quicker than the others men and horses went down but not many and the barbarians kept coming esk kar saw the soldiers bows were at level now the men firing as fast as they could the alur meriki war cries mixed with the thunder of the horses hooves and the earth shook from their impact the alur meriki had to cover more than half a mile to reach esk kars men which should take them about the time a man might count to seventy and theyd be in bowshot for almost half that distance automatically esk kar counted the volleys one two three each volley equaled fifty arrows all aimed at about sixty warriors four five six arrows flew both ways a bowman went down then another even as an arrow whistled by esk kars ear seven eight nine but the soldiers heavy shafts kept finding their marks as the range decreased ten eleven horses and riders spilled to the earth slowing the riders behind them oraks archers had turned the rapid fi re tactics of the steppes people against them with even greater efficiency and accuracy esk kar heard mesilim shout an order and saw the first rank of ur nammu riders begin to move twelve with a shout mesilim led ten men in a sweep curving his line to the left and aiming to strike the alur meriki from the flank just before they closed with the bowmen mesilims men launched arrows as they rode at the same time the second line of ur nammu wheeled their horses behind esk kars men to back up the line should any of the alur meriki break through when the alur meriki leader saw the ur nammu moving up behind the archers he knew the line wouldnt break thirteen fourteen then less than seventy paces from the soldiers the alur meriki warriors started pulling their mounts up unable to continue in the face of the withering fi re esk kar saw their leader shouting trying to swing his men to his left to crash through the open space where the ur nammu had been instead he found mesilim and his ten riders smashing into them in a fighting melee the remaining ur nammu were supposed to wait behind to cut off any that tried to escape but seeing their brethren in action before them they ignored their orders and spurred through the bowmen knocking soldiers down in their eagerness to reach their enemy their actions forced oraks archers to stop shooting as friend and foe mixed together mesilims men and horses were rested and prepared their first wave of arrows cut down their foes before they could bring their superior numbers to bear then lances and swords were swept up esk kar saw mesilim bring down a horse with his first arrow then kill a warrior with the second before the ur nammu leader crashed his horse into the alur meriki leaders beast esk kar saw mesilim drop his bow and swing up his lance before he disappeared from sight in the swarm of horses men and dust cursing at every god he could think of esk kar broke into a run determined to stop as many as possible from escaping into the now open gap to his right three alur meriki did get through but hamati had seen the danger and pulled men off the line turning them to stop this new threat they launched their arrows and brought down the men multiple shafts protruding from horse and rider before the alur meriki could get away the surviving attackers had broken off in defeat turning their horses and heading back to the center of the valley esk kar saw mesilim again the ur nammu chief clung to his horses neck unable to recall his men blood covered both horse and rider when esk kar arrived at a run to grasp the halter just as mesilim started to fall esk kar caught the wounded man and lowered him to the ground mesilims horse had taken a slash across the neck as well its eyes wide and stumbling in its gait many riderless animals milled about and some of esk kars men began wasting time trying to catch them the ur nammu jumped down from their horses surrounding their leader and pushing esk kar aside in their haste but in moments they returned to their horses one of them turned to esk kar mesilim is dying but he orders us to obey you until subutai says otherwise check every horse no one must escape clinging to a horses belly send five men to guard the north entrance and tell them to stay there no matter what and make sure every alur meriki is dead thrust a lance into every body turning his attention back toward the center of the valley esk kar saw the retreating barbarians had gotten another surprise gatus had moved his men forward at a dead run as soon as the charge began and now his men formed up two hundred paces closer in the barbarians found themselves under long range fire from both sides as hamati ordered his men fifty paces forward they could go no farther any greater advance would put them into the widest part of the valley and spread the line too thin nevertheless arrows began to fly from both ends of the valley the shafts flashed high into the sky before arcing down upon the enemy esk kar caught a glimpse of the alur meriki chief hed survived mesilims attack but looked wounded esk kar took a quick count only about twenty barbarians remained alive gatus moved again advancing another fifty paces before setting up the new line alur meriki men and horses hit at long range by lethal bronze tipped arrows continued to fall their chief didnt have enough men left to break through either side now he gave another command and his men began racing toward the west wall they began to climb scrambling up the steep sides the alur meriki had to dismount to lead and drive the horses up the slope the moment theyd started toward the cliff ur nammu from both sides charged ignoring the soldiers arrows still arching over their heads and striking at the fl eeing men esk kar saw horses slip and fall screaming in pain men and beasts dying as shafts found their marks but the alur meriki kept climbing fighting up the rocky slope as they strove to escape the valley but as the first man reached the top four ur nammu strode to the edge of the cliff and began firing arrows down into the struggling mass these were subutais men plus the two boys who had ridden with their elders hed sent three men and a boy to the west side and two men and the other boy to the east side in case any alur meriki tried to climb out it had taken these men this long to get into position but theyd arrived just in time to partake in the killing the few surviving alur meriki left alive were helpless if they let go of the horses the animals would immediately turn and try to descend and they couldnt shoot a bow with one hand in moments they were all dead or dying either from the carefully aimed arrows fi red at close range by the men above or the storm of missiles from subutai and his men below the ur nammu had joined together at the base of the hillside to finish the slaughter some of them jeering at their victims as they handled their bows one of esk kars men captured a horse and brought it to his captain esk kar swung onto the back of the wild eyed animal once he had control of the excited brute he rode deeper into the valley and reached the ur nammu as the last body came crashing down the hillside pushed down by the men descending from the top subutai blood on his lip and a look of triumph on his face looked otherwise unharmed his jubilant men shouted their war cries he saw eskkar then his eyes went wide as he realized his father was not with him your father is dying subutai esk kar knew no way to soften the news subutai gave a gasp of anger and frustration but said nothing esk kar couldnt wait subutai we must check all the bodies make sure that none are playing dead or hiding in the rocks we have to count the dead you understand subutai took a long time before replying his face betraying the anger he tried to hold in check take me to him nevertheless he shouted orders at his men before turning his horse away from the hillside the two rode back to where ur nammu warriors attended their chief mesilim lay still either dead or unconscious so esk kar left the tribesmen to their grieving and rode off to make sure jalen and hamati sealed the valley and counted the dead then he turned and galloped back to gatus who followed orders and retreated back to the south end of the valley gatus guard the entrance and keep men at watch along the walls of the canyon gatus would take care of the details so esk kar wheeled the horse around and headed back to the warriors now bunched around mesilims body dismounting esk kar found he was still carrying his sword never having thought to belt the scabbard to his waist and hed done nothing with the heavy blade but carry it from place to place this time he saw mesilim had died esk kar stood beside the body and offered the warrior prayer to the gods when he finished he nodded to subutai then withdrew to leave the ur nammu to their death rituals eskkar had work enough to do he started with the alur meriki dead and it took some time before esk kar felt satisfied and then only after hed counted the bodies personally he ignored the numbers of jalen and gatus and demanded all the bodies be gathered at one site to make sure seventy three dead alur meriki lay on the earth darkness began to fall coming earlier in the hill shaded valley and the men built a fire when esk kar sat down near the fl ames he felt exhausted as if hed been fi ghting all day though he hadnt raised his sword once someone brought him a wineskin stolen from the farmhouse and eskkar drank it gratefully for once not caring there was only enough for himself and the men would have to do without gatus had lost only three men with two more wounded the men with esk kar had taken more losses five dead and four wounded but with only one or two likely to die the heavy shields the men had complained about carrying for days had undoubtedly saved lives and prevented wounds the ur nammu had lost four men and two wounded all occurring when mesilim led his men at the barbarians it was an amazing victory seventy three enemy killed while losing only twelve of their own esk kar had never heard of such a battle before in which a large and powerful force could be defeated so easily and with so few losses normally when men fought the side with the greater number won unless the other side proved tougher better armed or more rested here the battle had first been considered weeks before then the details of the trap carefully plotted esk kar decided more such victories could be achieved with the same forethought like the way they planned the defense of orak hed think more about it later when esk kar dropped the empty wineskin to the ground the soldiers had gathered around the fi re those closest to the blaze sat while the rest stood behind almost ninety men waited patiently wanting to hear what he would say a few whispered to one another but most remained silent everyone stared at him and esk kar saw admiration in their eyes it took a moment before he understood trellas words came back to him the men first eskkar build on their loyalty remember how much you need them he must say something to them he stood up instantly all conversation ceased and every eye rested on him taking a deep breath esk kar raised his voice today we defeated the barbarians in battle but this was no common clash in the hills we had to kill all of them well today you men killed seventy three barbarians and we lost only twelve men to win you had to follow your orders exactly and fight bravely you needed to work together to save each others lives you did that well and at the same time you proved that the enemy could be beaten with the bow now theyll have no force behind us when they come to orak and well beat them there just as we did here today the glory was yours today i did nothing but run so slowly that all of my men passed me by they laughed at that a few calling out comments about esk kar getting old he raised his arm and pointed toward the other fire fifty paces away where the ur nammu sat silently watching esk kar speak to his men but never forget that we would not have been so lucky without their help some of them died today including their leader to help us for that we must honor them and join them as brothers esk kar glanced around the ring of men he could see some eyes glistening with moisture tonight well take many new men into the hawk clan gatus hamati jalen we all observed many men who fought bravely but each of you stood at your companions side and each of you can speak up about his courage first i call out the name of phrandar the fleetest runner and the first to reach the battle line earning a gold coin for his speed he held the end of the battle line i ask you is he hawk clan a roar of approval answered his choice men shouted out other names then someone began to chant the name esk kar esk kar esk kar others took up the cry until the walls of the valley echoed from the din it went on for so long he thought their lungs would burst when they quieted down the men sat there looking at him esk kar had never seen such honor given before though hed done little the soldiers gave him credit for their victory the men believed in him more than that they trusted him to keep them alive trella had been right he no longer needed to fight himself to prove his valor to keep their respect they accepted his leadership as they trusted him to lead them to future victories hed won their loyalty now he needed to build on it soldiers of orak he began the hawk clan awaits the bravest of the brave give me their names another roar went up into the night again they shouted out names until gatus stood up and restored order when they finished eighteen more men would be entitled to wear the hawk symbol and they all swore theyd follow esk kar into the demons pits if he led them esk kar finally slipped away and walked over to subutai and his men they silently mourned their leader as they watched the soldiers celebrate subutai esk kar began ive come to offer my thanks to you and your men without your help we would not have achieved this victory i also offer my sorrow for mesilim he was a great fighter a brave man who led his people well you honor my father and that is good he died as he wantedin battle subutai kept his voice strong and clear for all to hear the voice of a chief but you too are a great leader and youve led us to a great victory because of this i have declared the shan kar of my father satisfied he gave us the shan kar and this victory but now both are finished well return to the north from whence we came the moment subutai had declared the shan kar over esk kar knew the ur nammu would fight no more mesilim had made the arrangement to fight with esk kar not subutai and his son wasnt bound by oath or duty to abide it in his heart esk kar could not argue with the decision too few now to do much damage the ur nammu would be lucky to stay alive im glad your shan kar is ended but the friendship between our people will not end we owe you much and well remember our debt esk kar described his plan to begin the march back to orak in the morning theyd both bury their dead at first light subutai would return with esk kar to gather the women and children left behind hours passed before everyone finally settled down to sleep esk kar felt dog tired more from worrying than fi ghting at last the sentries were posted and the watch established he was about to wrap himself in his blanket when he heard his name turning he saw subutai walking through the crowd of soldiers toward him he started to get up but subutai sat down close beside him their faces close together esk kar i would speak with you a moment subutai kept his voice low and he spoke in his native tongue though the nearest man was ten paces away i know what my father promised you and id help you if i can my men are weary and need time to rest and we must regain our lands before another takes them but i dont want to leave you as a friend in the morning and find ourselves enemies by night esk kar understood subutais problem theres no dishonor in your course you must do whats best for your people when you cross the river to the north the land there is yours none from orak have ever claimed it and few have even seen it it doesnt grow wheat or vegetables so it is of little use to us as long as you do not war across the river we wont be enemies it will be long before were strong enough to ride across the river even then there will be no need when all this fighting ends well need help to watch our borders and warn us of new attacks and new enemies we could establish trade for what you need set up a trading camp your people would benefit perhaps it can be as you say subutai said trade instead of war but first i must gather my people and return to the mountains still some of my warriors favor the idea of raiding the alur meriki as you and my father discussed well see what the next few weeks will bring he reached out and grasped esk kars shoulder we part as friends as my father would have done esk kar returned the grip as friends we will part but there may yet be some things i can do for you before you go ill think about it and send word to trella when the ur nammu chief departed esk kar sank back down on the grass thinking about subutais words the next few weeks the new ur nammu leader had just said esk kar and the village would have to withstand the alur merikis attacks for at least that long no matter what eskkar grimaced as he rolled up in his blanket trella had seen how these people could help orak now and in the future more important shed looked at them with kindness seeing past the warrior trappings even as shed overlooked the barbarian in the man to whom shed been given barrack crawled to the top of the ridge ignoring the insects that welcomed his presence as they nibbled on his flesh peering through a clump of tall grass he watched the approach to the valley he couldnt see much the entrance lay more than three hundred paces away but what he saw kept him hugging the ground two riders sat their horses near the valleys mouth both carried lances tipped with yellow streamers and bows slung across their backs their relaxed posture made barrack grit his teeth in anger his clan brothers had ridden into that valley only hours ago he could still see the broad trail of hoof prints that stretched from just below him all the way to the passageway that led into what must be a good sized valley another rider appeared along the crest of the valley wall this one waved his bow toward the riders below him they waved back but didnt move after a long moment studying the land beneath him the third rider turned away vanishing from sight barrack swore at the flies and fleas biting at him then cursed his clan brothers for leaving him behind though now he began to think the gods had saved his life his horse had stepped into a hole breaking its leg and throwing its rider to the earth too dazed even to cling behind another rider theyd left him behind in their eagerness to close with the ur nammu hed slipped into unconsciousness and when he awoke he found himself alone angry at being left behind barrack started walking an activity that normally consisted of moving from his tent to his horse it had taken him the better part of two hours following the twisting trail left by his clansmen to reach this place fortunately the riders hadnt spotted him when he approached another hour passed as he watched but nothing happened the crest rider had reappeared twice in that time his movements telling barrack that the ur nammu patrolled the valleys heights as well as its access his alur meriki brothers hadnt returned the way they entered so either theyd ridden out the far end of the valley assuming that it had one or theyd all been killed how that might be possible he had no idea but hed heard the story of the warriors trapped and killed by the ur nammu a few weeks ago in his worst dreams barrack couldnt believe such a thing could happen to his clansmen a handful of riders appeared at the valleys mouth and for a moment barrack thought his clansmen had returned but these new riders showed no colors didnt even carry lances or bows dirteaters he decided from the way they handled their horses except for their leader a tall warrior with the look of a horseman he spoke as an equal to the two ur nammu guarding the exit the way they answered showing respect and deference surprised barrack he watched as the tall rider acknowledged their response then he wheeled his horse and rode back into the valley his men following behind barrack had seen enough he put his face on the ground and tried to think dirt eaters had banded together with the filth ur nammu theyd either wiped out all the alur meriki warriors or driven them to the south in either case barrack would be on his own his duty to his clan was clearhe had to get back across the tigris and warn the alur meriki clan leaders a moment of fear swept through him if the ur nammu rode back this way they might see his footprints overlaying the horse trail theyd hunt him down track him wherever he went until they caught him barrack looked up at the sun only a few hours of daylight remained he didnt dare start moving until dark hed have to travel all night put as much distance as possible between him and the ur nammu who would surely send out patrols at dawn getting away finding and stealing a horse somewhere then getting back to thutmose sin thats what he needed to do barrack rolled over on his back and covered his eyes with his arm he still had his water skin and his bow hed rest until dusk then start moving with luck he could travel far enough to escape the ur nammu patrols beneath his arm barrack found his eyes watering his younger brother had ridden into that valley now barrack would have to tell their mother of his death he let the tears come something he couldnt do in the presence of warriors but when the tears dried he swore vengeance to the gods in the name of his brother against both the ur nammu and the miserable dirt eaters the gods heard his oath and he knew they would honor it the dirt eaters and ur nammu would pay for his brothers death at first light esk kar dispatched a rider to orak to deliver word of the victory he also wanted trella aware of mesilims death and its effect on subutai the men spent the morning burying the dead and caring for the wounded the sun had climbed high before they began their journey back to orak but the long summer days promised them extra hours of daylight the injured who could cling to a horse had been given mounts while parties of men took turns carrying the three wounded men unable to ride thirty two horses had been captured esk kar gave thirty of them to the ur nammu the rest of the alur meriki mounts had been killed in the fi ghting every man had their fill of horsemeat while what was left of the farmhouse had provided fuel for the cooking fires they camped as soon as darkness fell and the next morning esk kar had them on the march almost as soon as the sun rose by early afternoon theyd covered nearly three quarters of the distance home and esk kar expected to reach orak just after dark he didnt push the pace and the men walked lighter now that they didnt have to carry the awkward and heavy shields they carried no food either the last of it had gone with this mornings breakfast it wouldnt hurt the men to miss one dinner the sun had started to set when a rider appeared over the hilltop and lashed an obviously tired beast toward the column of soldiers subutai rode alongside esk kar though only ten of his warriors accompanied him the others had stayed behind in the valley guarding the horses and resting esk kar watched the rider as he approached the horse covered with sweat and finished for the day halting the column esk kar dismounted and sat on the ground motioning to the rider to join him the rest of his men eager to hear the latest news crowded around them all discipline lost in a moment captain i come from lady trella she says to tell you the barbarians have been sighted the man paused to catch his breath a large column rode up from the south two days ago we saw more than a hundred riders now they keep a watch on the village did any of them attempt to cross the river the water ran a bit lower now and a strong swimmer might make it across no captain theres plenty of water at the farms so they dont need the river nor did they want to call anyones attention to it just yet esk kar thought is there anything else yes captain lady trella will join you in a few hours she crossed the river with me along with the barbar the women and children that the warriors left behind she said she wanted to get them out of orak before the enemy prevented them from leaving trella on her way here well a small group of men and women crossing the river should arouse no suspicions it didnt matter he wouldnt take any chances on this side of the river gatus start the men moving and pick up the pace ill not have trella walking through the countryside with a group of women we keep moving until we find her captain she has four soldiers with her the messenger said hastily sisuthros wanted to send more but she said it would attract too much attention four or forty made no difference esk kar wouldnt rest until he saw her safely back in orak climbing back on his horse he led the way moving at a quick trot that drew grumbling from the men as they struggled to get moving and keep up once again subutai rode beside him perhaps i should ride ahead eskkar to see to trellas safety esk kar appeared to think it over for a moment no its better that you stay at my side the men guarding trella might be surprised if they saw warriors riding toward them i would be willing to take such a chance we could call out to them tell them who we are our women would recognize us no i will not risk it stay here with me well meet up with them in another hour or two at most and if my horse suddenly broke into a run what would you do for the first time esk kar turned to look carefully at the man at his side he regarded the new chief of the ur nammu closely for a few moments and chose his words before replying in the village subutai many men now cast their eyes at trella and im sure some of them would slit my throat if they thought that would help them get her but that could never happen in orak the entire village would rise up and punish anyone who tried to take her by force his voice hardened but out here any man with a horse can take a captive and i remember the saying of my clan trust no man with your woman especially your brother or your friend now the warrior in me sees danger everywhere and ill take no chances with her safety subutai digested esk kars words put your fears at rest ill ride with you until we meet up with them after a moment he added though i think you have learned much wisdom from your woman she has many sayings so many that sometimes my head turns one of them is to always try to put yourself in another mans place to understand him from within sometimes its not an easy thing to do but often it helps to understand a man he turned toward the ur nammu chief again youre now the leader of your people but whether youll be a great ruler only time will tell but it might be a wise saying for you as well they rode in silence for a hundred paces before subutai spoke i did think about it esk kar for a moment it was a great temptation but i knew i would have to kill you first after all youve done for my people im content to seek her wisdom but remember your instincts always keep a close watch on her thats one lesson ive already learned now let us talk about the future the moon had not yet risen when they crested a small hill and saw two torches twinkling in the distance a few moments later trellas party spotted them and waved their torches the men groaned in relief when they saw trellas group they hadnt stopped moving for the last three hours orak was close now little more than another two or three hours at an easy pace trella had not traveled very far burdened with the ur nammu women and children in addition to a great amount of supplies esk kar galloped ahead as soon as he saw the torches he jumped down from his horse and took her in his arms until she gasped for breath you should not have left orak this was dangerous you couldve been attacked on the road you havent even recovered from your wound she looked at him in the flickering torchlight orak is only a few miles behind us but the ford may be blocked at any moment i didnt want to be alone on the other side of the river away from you we will talk of this later now we must deal with subutai i hope youve more influence with him and his women than i he told her about the battle in the valley of mesilims death and subutais plans while they talked gatus and the men arrived the soldiers built a small fire and a ring of soldiers formed around esk kar and trella the men drank the last of their water and rested esk kar told trella what he thought about the new situation then listened carefully to her replies they sent for subutai hed been with his wife and daughter listening to what the clans women had to say examining the supplies and gifts trella had given them the supplies would make a great difference in how the ur nammu lived in the months ahead esk kar moved back his guards so his men formed a wide circle leaving himself and trella in the center now subutai and his men entered the circlet bringing with them their women though esk kar knew this was not their custom but these were highly unusual circumstances with only five women for thirty men these wives would command a greater say in their fates esk kar watched subutai as he regarded trella who sat on part of a fallen tree one of the soldiers had dragged up for her how she managed it esk kar didnt know but she appeared both regal and desirable even in her rough travel dress maybe it was the combination of the firelight on her face while two torches burned behind her she had an indisputable presence one shed become well aware of and worked hard to enhance when the ur nammu were seated the women behind the men esk kar began our two peoples have fought together against their common enemy not once but twice and weve defeated them both times now subutai will take his people back to their homelands north of the river enratus when the alur meriki are defeated and driven from orak our people will stay to the south in that way our two peoples can live in peace esk kar gestured toward trella trella and i have offered to help chief subutai in any way we can he turned to subutai who had to speak next lady trella subutai began adopting the phrase esk kar used we thank you for your help with our women and children youve given us many gifts of food and clothing as well as tools and healing medicines were embarrassed we have nothing to give you in return now we are too few to fight against the alur meriki yet we know you are wise and so my people ask you for your wisdom esk kar guessed that subutai doubted she had any wisdom for him but trella had planted the seeds with the womenfolk even before they left the village and no doubt that had been part of the quiet discussions between subutai and his people moments ago it is we who are in your debt chief subutai trellas soft voice floated on the night air like music from a lute and not a sound was heard around the circle except for the crackling of the fires and the whispers of the translators as everyone strained to catch her words without your help there would have been no victory two days ago and the alur meriki would now have a strong force behind orak but a great challenge stands before youthe need to return to your homelands and rebuild your people it is something that you must do quickly else you fall victim to some larger clan youll need more wives for your men to give you many children and youll need tools and food before you can stand on your own again it may be that esk kar and i can help you with these things esk kar smiled inwardly at the box trella had placed subutai in she offered him a way to rebuild his people but hed have to ask for it and that would place him in her debt if he turned it down some of his men would begin to doubt his leadership especially if her ideas had merit subutai worked it out quickly enough he had to ask then examine her suggestions seriously lady trella if you have any thoughts that can help my people we ask for them nothing is certain chief subutai trella answered we face a great battle against your own enemy and it may be that we will not survive but if we do and if the alur meriki are driven off then the lands that they have passed through will be filled with chaos and confusion there will be many masterless and landless men wholl kill and destroy whatever little has survived the alur meriki even among your kind there will be many steppes clans wandering these lands theyll fight each other as well as the soldiers orak will send out into the countryside to protect our farmers and herders even now several small bands of steppes people are on the west bank of the tigris moving north avoiding the alur meriki while they take whatever they can esk kar watched subutai as he listened to trellas words so far shed said nothing unexpected if you wish trella continued we can speak to these small bands or you can ride south and seek them yourself gather them together into a new clan within your own land with a truce between your people and the men of the villages and farms with supplies and trade goods from orak life in the northern lands could be easier orak would give you gold and you would need only to watch the mountains and send us word of any dangers you could trade for anything else you needed all we would ask is that you raid no lands south of the enratus esk kar saw subutai thinking it over the same way esk kar had when trella proposed it the havoc caused by the alur meriki had created many bands of homeless men by absorbing them one band at a time perhaps a new tribe could be built in months rather than in years we would still need women as wives for our men lady trella these will not be so easy to find and without them the true ur nammu will diminish my husband has told you of a way to obtain many women by taking them from the alur meriki at the height of their attack on us theyll be distracted and you can capture as many as you like even if the alur meriki are defeated before your walls theyll give chase to anyone who raids their women subutai spoke confidently doubtless hed given much thought to such a raid his father might have been willing to chance it to bring death and shame to the alur meriki but not subutai if we were burdened with captives lady trella they would quickly catch up with us and we would be destroyed esk kar spoke up subutai much can be accomplished if the plan is good weve seen how easily the alur meriki can be beaten when everything is thought out in advance now you have many horses more than you will need maybe even more than you can easily drive back to the mountains the raiding party could capture the women and throw them on horses if the raid were planned carefully you would have thongs ready to bind the women to the horses and torches prepared to burn as much of their camp as possible if your men did not waste any time or strength in fighting you could be gone in a few moments then the horses could be run until they were exhausted change to a relay of new mounts kill or scatter the old ones and the alur meriki would be chasing you on tired animals kill a second string of horses and theyd be left far behind in danger of being cut off from the main body of the tribe they would have to turn back any few that went on could be easily trapped and killed some men would never give up the chase those whose wives or daughters were important to them but most would turn back when they saw no quick opportunity of either revenge or loot there would be plenty of widows in the main camp after the battle at orak those would be easier to obtain than chasing a small band of determined ur nammu far into the distant north a raid planned so carefully would have little risk and much chance of success trella offered and a wise leader would treat these new women as wives not slaves if they were treated better than they were with the alur meriki theyd soon dry their tears and look with admiration on their new husbands she turned to the women for your clan to survive you would have to accept these new captives as equals not captured concubines and treat them with friendship not the whip in this way their children and your own would grow up to be brothers the fire had burned down no one bothered to add more fuel so eskkar gathered some wood himself dumping it on the flames then arranging the new sticks others joined in and for a few moments everyone focused on rebuilding the fire giving subutai time to think when esk kar sat down the circle went silent again both of you have given me much to think about subutai said cautiously and in return for your help you only ask us to raid the alur meriki at the height of the battle yes esk kar answered a little too quickly so he checked his pace it may be that your help isnt needed to defeat them or it may be that we are fallen but at the height of the main attack your diversion might turn the battle subutai took a deep breath and his lips came together for a moment id hoped we were finished with fighting for a time now we must decide if there is yet one more battle to risk chief subutai we too have one more battle to fight esk kar answered but there is always one more battle to wage each season brings some new threat whats important to remember is to fight only those fights that make your people grow not those that gain nothing except lasting hatred esk kar spoke the words but the idea and thoughts were trellas theyd spoken many times about the future after the alur meriki were defeated subutai stood up and bowed his people rising to their feet with him you would have me change the ways of my people and that is not an easy thing to do but well consider your words he left the circle and moved back to where his people had gathered before his warriors and their women following in a few moments they had started a small fire and sat down around it do you think hell do it esk kar asked trella in a whisper as he slipped his arm around her oh yes he will have no choice the women will see to it they know that if the tribe does not grow theyll all be dead or captured soon enough and they want the goods orak can provide to make life easier for them trella rested her head on his shoulder i was angry when i heard you had left orak esk kar murmured but now im glad that you came i tried to convince subutai myself but i couldnt think of a way but i did manage to change his mind about riding ahead and making you his captive he smiled at the look of confusion that crossed her face never mind ill tell you all about it when we return to orak now rest we march for orak and our own great battle in an hour two hours after midnight esk kar and trella stepped off the ferry and onto the east bank of the tigris theyd scarcely left the flat bottomed craft before the gang of ferrymen and soldiers began heaving on the ropes sending the unwieldy craft slowly back across the river their grunts of effort seeming to boom across the river which amplified the slightest sound they couldnt do anything about the noise and it would take another four trips to move everyone including the horses back to orak so the men would be at risk for another few hours sisuthros waited anxiously for them at dockside his face filled with relief at their safe return once inside the village esk kar trella and sisuthros walked quickly back to their house they went directly to esk kars workroom where corio and nicar awaited them cold food water and wine were on the table while two lamps provided light by ishtar were glad to see you back sisuthros began excitedly the villagers were nearly in a panic with you both gone another day and half of them would be trying to get across the river to join up with you the barbarians are here esk kar asked as he picked up a cold chicken leg and took a bite yes the big band thats been pillaging to the south arrived two days ago our scouts had to run for the gate now theyre camped about two miles away at the farm belonging to old gudea and his sons he and his family are as mad as hornets that their house was chosen by the barbarians we could see about a hundred men from the walls but there are probably at least twice that number and the main party any news nothing in the last few days but they cant be too far away now were locked in here now and there have been no patrols to the north since you left its likely the main force will be making camp a few miles away from here in two or three days the tension sounded in his voice your own battle went well very well we lost only eight men during the battle though one of the wounded died on the return trip but all seventy three barbarians were killed and their horses those that survived were given to the ur nammu it will be at least a week probably longer before the alur meriki begin to wonder what happened to those they sent across the tigris esk kar smiled grimly at that thought at any rate we now have ninety more veterans to put on the wall men who know the barbarians can be beaten and the ur nammu corio asked will they help us in our fight esk kar shrugged im not sure their chief was killed in the battle and his son now decides for the tribe but trella did her best to persuade him they may yet give us some small help we didnt want lady trella to go nicar said looking at trella as he spoke we knew you would be angry but she insisted and there was nothing we could say to prevent her it matters little now that youre both safely back corio remarked it is time to get ready for the first attack when do you think they will attack just as soon as their ruler arrives esk kar answered hell want to see the first attack and he will probably bring his own warriors ahead of the main party but he may not want to leave the main camp unguarded and too far to the rear so tomorrow or the next day should bring the fi rst assault nicar stood we should let them get some sleep theyre tired and need their rest the others nodded said their goodnights and departed for their own beds and a few hours sleep esk kar escorted them downstairs when they were gone he returned to the workroom to find trella seated at the table she had extinguished one of the lamps to save oil youre not tired trella he sat down next to her is there something you want to talk about everything is starting now her voice was low and her eyes stared at the table i mean all the planning and building and training everything is finished now the battle begins it took him a moment to understand her words yes this is the way of war all the preliminaries are over and luck or the gods decide your fate weve prepared as best we could now swords and arrows will determine if we live or die all our decisions and choices will be held up to the light for all to see she turned toward him you dont fear tomorrow why am i suddenly filled with fear i wasnt afraid until now all men are afraid of their first battle trella when we waited for the alur meriki up in the valley the mens fear was so thick i was sure the alur meriki could smell it three hundred paces away mens teeth were chattering their bowels loosening and their hands shaking but once the battle starts theres no time for fear this is your first battle dont be concerned about these thoughts the night before battle every man had to face his fear some men of sword thrusts others of arrows or lances and most worried about their own bravery he realized a woman could be as afraid anyway we have nowhere to run and death we could both be dead by tomorrow night that was more likely than she realized he pulled her from her chair onto his lap holding her close as her arms went around his neck and she squeezed him with all her strength all men fear death but ive been fi ghting all my life and should have been dead many times now i only fear losing you he kissed her hair and neck then turned her head toward him when you sat at the fire across from subutai you looked and spoke like a goddess come down from the heavens every man in camp envied me when you lay down beside me to rest and im sure many wished themselves in my place with their hands upon you he kissed her again and this time she kissed him back though the tears were starting now and her body shook with the effort to hold them back im just a frightened girl pretending to be all wise because thats what the people need now all i want is for you to take me away someplace where five thousand barbarians wont be trying to kill us he smiled no its too late now once perhaps i could have done that but thats not enough for me any longer you are wise and you care about many people and you deserve something better than a hard life as a soldiers wife here you are will be a queen in orak and all men will know your wisdom and beauty she wriggled on his lap as she tried to hold him closer and suddenly he felt excited by her touch or the heat from her body or maybe by the threat of dying on the morrow lifting her in his arms he carried her into the dark bedroom now i need you to love me to give me strength for the days ahead he sat her down on the bed and helped her remove her dress as she seemed too weak to do it by herself then pushed her back gently when he slid under the blanket she moved into his arms and buried her face in his neck and he barely heard her words give me your strength esk kar and ill be strong for you forever esk kar awoke with a start alone in bed with the morning sun making bright patterns of light on the blanket and the floor sitting up he realized the soft bed had let him sleep at least an hour past sunrise hed told trella to waken him an hour before dawn two hours wasted the house seemed strangely quiet as he hurriedly dressed the outer workroom was empty and the door that led downstairs closed when he opened it subdued voices and the smell of crisping meat floated up from the kitchen he went down the stairs two at a time at the bottom he found gatus emerging from the kitchen dressed for battle a piece of chicken in his hand good morning captain i was about to wake you before esk kar could reply he continued we decided to let you sleep a little longer all the men are posted at the wall and there are only a few barbarians watching us from the hilltops he wrinkled his nose you might want to wash up before you eat you still smell like a horse wheres trella why hadnt she awakened him the barbarians might have attacked at dawn where shes supposed to be out with the women gatus took another bite from his chicken leg this is good i think it was supposed to be your breakfast esk kar swore at the grinning soldier then strode past him into the kitchen bantors wife stood there tending the kitchen fi re ready with his breakfast halfway to the table he decided gatus was right hold the food annok sur he went outside to the well stripping off his tunic and using it to scrub himself down a servant came and drew bucket after bucket of water for him until esk kar felt as clean as he could be without a swim in the river wrapping his wet tunic around his waist he returned to the bedroom and dressed again this time for battle he took his time binding his undergarment tightly around his loins then donning a clean linen tunic he strapped on the sandals that trella had purchased for him that first day making sure the wide leather straps were tightly knotted around his calves the servant entered the bedroom with a knock holding a thick leather vest he laced a leather protector onto esk kars lower right arm then a smaller one onto his upper arm esk kar belted the great sword around his waist and thrust his knife almost as long as the mens short fighting sword into his belt last the servant offered the bronze casque the helmet that would protect his head but esk kar shook his head leave it its too hot he nodded his thanks to the servant and returned to the kitchen he wolfed down the remains of the chicken ripping it apart with his fingers and washing it down with water and handfuls of bread salt annok sur she handed him a bowl containing the rough crystals men fighting or working in the heat did better with extra salt though no one knew why esk kar swallowed a bitter mouthful of the gritty stuff then washed it down with the last of the water good fortune to you today captain annok sur offered when he finished wiping her hands clean on a rag and following him to the door she would have duties of her own today good fortune to you and bantor esk kar turned and stopped so suddenly that she bumped into him and thank you both for what youve done for trella bantor is a lucky man to have such a good wife but dont tell him i said that she laughed and touched his shoulder there are many things i dont tell bantor captain esk kar wondered about what things trella didnt choose to tell him as he stepped outside into the bright sunlight his men had converted the courtyard into a command post gatus sat at the main table along with jalen and a handful of soldiers a dozen messenger boys were packed into a corner of the yard all wearing distinctive red bindings around their arms so the soldiers would recognize them and let them through clerks mixed with subcommanders who would coordinate the defenses nicar and the other members of the families sat at a second table each with his own duties and his respective attendants the spacious courtyard barely accommodated those responsible for oraks defense esk kar walked over to the main table reminding himself to take his rest wherever and whenever possible today all the men are in position captain gatus spoke formally bantor and sisuthros are at the gate along with corio and his eldest jalen has inspected the rear gate maldar will command the men on the riverside and ill command the north wall hamati and alexar direct the east and west walls all the men have been fed and the water buckets are full each man has been given his instructions for the hundredth time though im sure theyll forget them as soon as the first barbarian starts for the wall in a few words gatus had given esk kar all the information he needed and at the same time had communicated that all was as it should be so i should have stayed in bed longer maybe you wouldve called me after the fighting was over theyre not going to attack for hours even days gatus offered reasonably first theyll try to frighten us with their presence he looked squarely at his leader now its time to inspect the men and give them some words meaning id better get to work then lets begin with jalen and maldar in tow they walked out to the street where more messengers leaned against the wall they cheered at the sight of esk kar and he smiled at them yet another surprise waited for him four of the hawk clan including two of its newest members stood waiting this is your personal bodyguard from now on gatus explained these four rogues are the least valuable of the hawk clan so theyve been assigned as your guard if they stay sober they may be of some use each stood taller than average two of them with less than twenty seasons but all with hard muscles stretched tight across their chests they looked as if they could chew stones for breakfast though they all smiled at gatuss backhanded words of praise each wore as much leather armor as he could carry and every one bore the hawk clan emblem on his chest esk kar started to protest but gatus cut him off save your breath they have their orders which are to keep you alive so dont bother trying to order them away and dont try to take any foolish risks they wont allow it he started walking not waiting for an argument esk kar shook his head and strode after him esk kar saw few people in the normally crowded lanes most of whom called out nervous greetings at the main gate the last of the dwellings behind the structure had been torn down leaving a clear space roughly fifty paces in length that opening narrowed as it followed the wall in each direction but there were always at least twenty paces from the wall to the nearest building so men and equipment could move easily from point to point he stared up at the gate four great timbers braced it two to each side resting in holes dug deep into the earth and reinforced with rock across the top small wooden troughs ran the length of the opening already filled with water a catwalk extended underneath the troughs so men could tip the contents over the top of the gate to put out fires this top platform could also hold a dozen archers whod be able to shoot through slits carved into the gate another platform wider and stouter hung just below it with more slits for the defenders the structures outer surface hardened by fire would be slow to reignite but esk kar knew there was nothing wooden that couldnt be made to burn a gang of women waited nearby ready to replenish the troughs with buckets of water as needed throughout the day on each side rose a square tower ugly in its unfinished rock and mud bricks but rising above both wall and gate allowing the archers to fire down at anyone directly below corios oldest son alcinor saw esk kars party approach and waved that triggered a massive shout as the villagers and soldiers recognized him esk kar decided his venture across the river must have worried oraks inhabitants his return added to the reports of another victory gave the crowd something to rejoice about it felt strange to be cheered simply because he was seen he still didnt know what to do about it captain its good to see you back in orak alcinor said with a smile and a bow and congratulations we hear you killed all the barbarians with great ease esk kar grimaced at the soldiers who couldnt keep from bragging of their victory now everyone would expect an easy defeat of the barbarians greetings alcinor he kept his voice cold and hard and dont speak of easy conquests there will be none from the alur meriki alcinors smiled vanished at esk kars tone and the young mans eyes widened in fear im sorry i meant no disrespect i enough alcinor i know what you meant is everything here as you planned curse the gods he hadnt meant to frighten the man out of his wits alcinor tried to recover from his embarrassment umm yes of course weve prepared everything as sisuthros ordered we have youve done well then esk kar interrupted trying to undo the effect of his harsh words your gate will be one of the main points of attack so you must help the soldiers keep the gate secure if you need anything sisuthros called to them from atop the left tower captain theres movement on the hillside esk kar and his guards filed quickly into the tower treading carefully on the dark narrow steps that followed the walls as they ascended to the top bantor came over from the other tower to join them the soldiers stationed there stepped back so their leaders could see better the sight made esk kar grunt in annoyance the barbarians surveyed the village and its defenses from the same hilltop where months before hed fi rst considered defending orak from there they could see much of the village and the surrounding lands now flooded except for the main approach there were only ten or twelve horsemen there until a few moments ago sisuthros informed him now i see standards there esk kar counted as quickly as he could using his fingers to keep track his lips moving slightly at least forty now and with three clan chiefs the extra long lances that bore the alur meriki symbols also carried each clan leaders emblem the distance was too great to distinguish details but the standards stood out clear enough another raiding party has joined with the two war parties from the south he commented then cursed himself for stating the obvious from the main camp gatus asked or just another raiding party probably the main camp esk kar guessed but the great chief s standard isnt here not yet youll recognize that when you see it the third chief and his men probably formed an advance party from the main force sent ahead to meet with the others and begin planning the attack it might mean the war chief had arrived or it might mean something else curse my eyes esk kar swore i cant make out any detail can you see anything on the banners sisuthros he was younger and presumably had better eyes no nothing sisuthros said theyll move closer soon enough wheres mitrac esk kar asked that boy has better eyes than anyone in orak send for him gatus dispatched a messenger to find the archer it took some time before mitrac arrived carrying his bow and breathing hard ah mitrac esk kar grasped the boy by the shoulders and led him to the towers edge see those three banners out there those are the standards of a war chief i want you to remember those three banners because one of them is probably the fighting chief wholl be responsible for the attack thats the one i want you keep looking for if you get a shot at him take it but only if you think youve got a good chance to hit him the boy nodded his hand over his eyes as he stared at the hillside esk kar tried to think about what the enemy might be thinking put yourself in the other mans place what would i see what would i do ignoring the chatter of the men he set himself to the task after a moment he turned to his men from where they are they cant see the open areas directly behind the wall they may think the northeast section is the farthest from the center of the village and that it will be the most difficult for our men to reach in an attack if i were them id strike at the gate where we expect them but push the real thrust at that corner esk kar looked at his men and waited but no one offered any argument against it he shrugged well plan for it sisuthros bantor stay here with mitrac and keep watch theyll come closer soon enough and mitrac should be able to figure out whos in charge gatus lets check on the rest of the wall esk kar descended from the tower and began walking quickly toward the northeast corner halfway there a large group of villagers began to block his way asking frightened questions that had no answer gatus keep this area clear of villagers esk kar ordered loudly send those who dont have duties here packing he stopped about fifty paces short of the northeast corner and climbed the steps to the parapet a cheer went up this time from the soldiers as well as villagers damn the gods hed have to say something he turned and faced the crowd beneath him fear and doubt showed plainly on every uplifted face soldiers villagers in a few hours the barbarians may launch their first attack they will try to rush the gate but i think theyll attack this part of the wall as well so ready yourselves he turned to gatus i think sisuthros and bantor can handle the gate you and i will command here esk kar looked up and down the parapet he was about sixty paces from the corner this is the spot where they will hurl their attack here and at the corner i think everything else will be a ruse get the men ready make sure the men with the least experience are up front gatus looked surprised and he showed no inclination to move i want as many as possible to get experience gatus this first attack should be the easiest to beat off keep some veterans in reserve at the base of the wall ready to come up if needed i dont want them to know how good we are yet i want them to keep thinking they can take the wall if they just send enough men bring maldar and half of his reserve up here as well that would take men from the rear gate but esk kar didnt think it likely the alur meriki would attack there gatus nodded and hurried off dispatching messengers as he did so esk kar turned to his bodyguards you heard the plan if i fall you continue it now help me pick the men everyone began moving and the activity lasted for some time when esk kar thought everything was in place he stopped for a drink of water from one of the water barrels as totomes and narquil his older son arrived with mitrac jalen accompanied them and they moved to the walls edge to assess the situation esk kar smiled at the three archers good to see you again totomes narquil did you learn anything at the tower yes another standard has joined the first three totomes answered theyre starting to move toward us esk kar looked out toward the east four alur meriki chieftains and about thirty warriors were riding slowly toward the village at an angle in a few minutes they would be in front of the gate about half a mile distant still out of bowshot a mutter of excitement raced along the wall keep quiet men he snapped remember theyve never seen a wall like this before and theyre only looking keep your heads down and dont show yourselves the alur meriki probably lacked information about the number of people in orak esk kar wanted them to think he had fewer fighting men than were actually available jalen pointed toward the hills to the north esk kar saw men and horses the hilltops dotted with curious warriors no doubt they disobeyed their own orders to stay below the hill crests meanwhile the chieftains halted a little past the gate and resumed their discussions behind him esk kar could hear the leaders of each file of ten cursing their men who kept peeking over the wall esk kar didnt even bother swearing at them the instant you gave an order some fool would disobey it soldiers never changed the alur meriki resumed their inspection riding leisurely until they passed opposite esk kars position on the wall and continuing until they reached the flooded lands villagers crowded against each other despite orders to keep the wall clear everyone wanted to see what the barbarians looked like esk kar watched some warriors splash their horses into the newly formed swamp the animals kicked up spray as they struggled to move through the thick mud covered with at least a foot of water he smiled when the horses slowed to a crawl the barbarians tested the wetlands in several places but always with the same result finally they gave up and returned to dry ground where they sat on their horses staring down the length of the wall toward the river the dry land between the ditch and the flooded basin was only about thirty paces wide about the same as the width of the ditch those two distances taken together would give them more than enough room to operate esk kar knew that they were thinking it shouldnt be too difficult to surround the village and attack from many points at the same time gatus strolled up to where esk kar stared at the alur meriki well captain what do you think should we have flooded the ditch or not he said it seriously without any hint of second guessing his leader its too late now gatus if im wrong youll probably not get a chance to tell me so if the enemy came in full strength against many parts of the wall the village might fall esk kar swore again worried that he had guessed wrong about the first attack looks like a little disagreement out there gatus commented shading his eyes maybe theyre already arguing over the spoils one chief did look a little angry his horse moving restlessly as its master gesticulated at one point slapping his breast to emphasize some point esk kar wondered what they could be quarrelling about even before the first attack put yourself in their place his mind went over the possibilities one situation seemed likelythat the fourth standard belonged to the war chief and that he wanted to wait before attacking the more excited warrior probably wanted to attack at once esk kar couldnt be sure but if you decide something be firm about it mistakes can be overcome but never moments of indecision wheres mitrac mitrac come here esk kar shouted in a moment the young man approached having followed his captains travels along the wall esk kar pointed to the chiefs you see that chief thats arguing out there can you see who hes arguing with thats the war leader and hes the chief youll go after when the time is right always look for him but not in the first fight dont try to kill him yet mitrac studied the distant horsemen yes captain i think youre right from the tower we saw each of the three speak to him in turn he says little just seems to listen its the others who talk the most his horse is that bay the one with the white spot on the shoulder esk kar cursed his eyesight again he couldnt distinguish any markings on the horse but the chief appeared to be wearing something white around his neck good good now you see the one doing all the arguing i dont want him killed either mitrac turned to stare into esk kars eyes but why i mean why not shoot at either of them because the loud one is probably the war chief wholl lead the first attack and he wants all the glory for taking the village by himself i think the other chief is the one in charge hes probably the smartest one they have while the other is the most reckless and ambitious for the first attack we want the reckless one in charge not dead by some lucky arrow fired at long range after the attack fails then you can kill him and after today you try and kill the other man every chance you get understand why yes yes i understand i think i understand mitrac eyes had gone wide in awe of esk kars reasoning ill go tell my father he added anticipating esk kars next command good and make sure he understands why off you go when the boy trotted off gatus came over shaking his head but smiling at the same time well old man what are you laughing at by sundown the story will be all over orak how esk kar picked out the war chiefs and figured out their plans he smiled again and lowered his voice if i didnt know you better id almost believe you know what youre doing if i knew what i was doing i wouldnt be standing here with you behind this puny wall but its better to be lucky than smart so lets hope our luck holds out voices rippled along the wall and esk kar turned back to watch the riders theyd started to move not returning the way they came but moving toward the north he watched them ride graceful on their wiry horses so much at home as they rode across the burnt out stubble of what had been until a few days ago a grassy plain he glanced up at the sun and saw noon approached theyd watched the horsemen for almost two hours gatus do whatever else you need to strengthen this corner of the wall make sure that the whole length from here down to the river is ready no matter what that eager war chief decides there will be some attacks down this side well be ready now you go and talk to trella shes waiting down there for you esk kar looked down into the village he picked her out at once surrounded by half a dozen women and her two bodyguards esk kar recognized the burly klexor standing behind her walking along the wall until he could descend esk kar strode across the open space toward the house that shaded trella and her party he greeted everyone as they moved aside good morning husband ive some food and water for you trella carried a small basket under her arm she looked serene and confident not a trace of last nights frightened girl she wore her poorest shift the one she had on that fi rst night today she carried the dagger esk kar had taken from drigos dead hand he felt glad that shed been trained in its use they sat on the ground their backs against the wall while the others moved away to give them some privacy you seem much better today wife did you sleep well esk kar ignored the smiles that appeared on some of the nearby faces he wondered whether they knew everything that went on in his bedchamber including how often and how well he made love to his woman yes i slept very well now eat and drink you may not get a chance later she handed him a piece of bread will they attack today in a few hours theyre waiting for the great chief and more men just in case the first attack is successful he told her what hed seen from the wall and his thoughts on what the barbarians would do you know how they think esk kar more important the rest of the villagers feel secure when you act confidently she put the basket between them finish your food while you can her agreement made him feel surer of himself and he took pleasure in that he fell to work on the slices of bread and chicken the meat still warm though hed eaten breakfast only a few hours ago he found himself hungry again and the heat of the day had already given him a thirst esk kar almost drained the water skin before he remembered to offer her some she finished the water give the rest of the chicken to gatus i must return to my duties the old men grow nervous and quarrelsome if im not there to reassure them be careful he warned her dont stand where a stray arrow can fi nd you and dont she stood and smiled at him yes master i will obey and you dont need to repeat yourself a dozen times he must have looked crestfallen for she leaned down and kissed his cheek good fortune to you today husband and she walked off her followers trailing behind some of the women looking back at him and giggling he hadnt adjusted yet to that new experience the constant stares and giggles from the women who acted as if they knew all the intimate details of his personal life before trella no woman had dared to laugh at him barbarian customs had much to recommend them he decided once again he walked back to the wall carrying the basket he found gatus underneath the parapet swearing at two of his men for some infraction trella sends you some chicken for lunch so i suppose youll have to eat it he pushed the basket into his hands get some rest when the man started to protest esk kar held up his hand you wont have time later he turned to one of the ever present hawk clan bodyguard bring water for gatus and make sure you men get something to eat and drink as well esk kar spent the next hour pacing the wall making sure everyone stayed alert and that the archers knew their roles places and orders he had to be careful where he steppedthe top of the parapet creaked under the weight of stones piled upon it any more and there would be no room for his archers satisfied with the preparations he reviewed the signals that would allow him and his men to communicate through the chaos of battle he even found time to talk with some of the villagers those who stood ready to use short spears axes and forked sticks three hours past midday shouts went up from those manning the wall esk kar ran lightly up the steps to the position he had selected to defend about fifty paces from the northeast corner he looked to his left and saw gatus standing at the corner esk kar had to push men aside to get to the wall but one look told him the attack had begun the hills were covered with mounted men riding slowly toward orak most of them still more than two miles away their numbers seemed endless and he felt the doubt rise up inside him mitrac he shouted and this time the young man reached his side in a moment get a count of their warriors some of the barbarians carried ladders or climbing poles sticks with crosspieces tied or nailed to the upright they didnt seem to have very many of those he noted while mitrac counted esk kar scanned the riders looking for standards as the men walked their horses slowly toward the village three four five six seven thats all he could see and nowhere in sight was the giant standard of the sarrum riders continued to come over the crest of the distant hills but fewer now though he did see one new standard they rode slowly or walked their horses coming toward the village mostly silent strong men on fine horses ready to do battle all of them eager for glory and loot gatus walked over to his side as jalen came up the steps behind him by all the demons is there any end to them jalen asked ishtar theyre still coming i think well see about two thirds of them today esk kar said theyll wait for the clan chief before they attack so he can witness their bravery the leading riders had stopped now waiting as their leaders held up lances or bows horizontally to mark out a rough line less than half a mile from the wall how long before the big chief shows up gatus inquired he wont keep them waiting long will he less than an hour esk kar answered staring at the warriors enough time for us to become weak with fear then he can come right now as far as im concerned gatus said maybe we should have stayed across the river jalen looked shocked but esk kar laughed you shouldve thought of that yesterday he turned back to mitrac well how many lad the boys lips moved wordlessly as he checked his fingers captain i count about eleven hundred maybe a few more esk kar had done his calculation the easy way figuring a hundred men to each standard with extra men for the chief who would lead the first attack the answer made him feel a little better if the first attack were a full assault with every warrior participating thered be even more men facing him war cries rose up from the barbarians shouts that quickly swelled into a thunderous roar that went on and on as the warriors lifted their swords and lances and shook them against the sky over the crest of the hill appeared the grand standard of the alur meriki clan chief the tall banner carried by a giant of a man on a massive horse swayed in the breeze the cross shaped emblem draped with many ox tails and streamers signified all the battles won and clans absorbed into the tribe the leader rode in front of the standard bearer undistinguished by any trappings visible at this distance looking quite ordinary he carried neither lance nor bow around him raced twenty or thirty warriors galloping their horses back and forth while raising war cries another thirty or forty rode more sedately behind him everyone villager and barbarian alike followed his progress and eskkar could see the great chief turn his head from side to side as he surveyed the burnt grasses and empty landscape by the gods ive never seen so many horses gatus shook his head how many do they have more than you see gatus every warrior has at least two mounts many will have four or five when a warrior dies his horses are given to the rest of his clan lets hope there are many horses to divide up tonight gatus responded esk kar put thoughts of horses out of his head and turned to jalen tell the men to get ready then go to your position i think theyll be coming soon jalen would defend the section between esk kar and the gate jalen nodded then clasped esk kars arm in salute good fortune to all of us captain well he said he wanted to fight barbarians gatus commented as jalen raced off the old soldier placed his leather cap on his head and fastened the strap and ive brought this for you make sure you wear it he handed esk kar a copper helmet the metal glinting in the bright sunlight trella had it made for you for some reason she doesnt want your head taken off esk kar looked at the helmet as he hefted it in his hand it weighed much less than the bronze one he refused to wear complaining that it was too hot and heavy he hated having anything on his head this helmet had a simpler design hardly more than a cap it came down low across the forehead yet covered the back almost to the base of the neck with two short strips of copper extending down to cover the temples inside a thin layer of leather acted as a lining he tried it on it fit almost perfectly only a little too tight over his temples pulling it off he bent the soft metal flanges slightly then replaced it on his head trella said to give it to you right before the battle so that you wouldnt have any excuse to lose it gatus turned to the bodyguards if he takes it off carry him off the wall no matter what he says understand they muttered their agreement and gatus turned back to esk kar wear it for her sake esk kar youll need it with all these arrows flying around good luck to you one of the bodyguards helped esk kar with the straps as he fastened the helmet under his chin copper wasnt as good as bronze at stopping a sword stroke but it would probably turn aside a barbarian arrow even at close range moving his head tentatively from side to side he tested the helmets feel it rested lightly enough on his head so he had no cause to complain he turned back to the wall the leader of all the alur meriki had nearly reached the front of his men riding up a slight incline that permitted a better view the other chiefs already waited there esk kar watch them exchange greetings before they began to speak the discussion went on for a long time everyone appeared calm no angry words or gestures that he could see as the chiefs presented their plans for battle the talk ended abruptly the war chief rode back to his men on the front lines while two other chiefs returned to their own clans probably three hundred in the attack with an equal number ready to join in if the attack succeeded or looked close to success the other chiefs remained with their sarrum to watch the battle with him and point out any mistakes made by their counterparts those chiefs seem pretty calm gatus said is that good i think so if the attack chief hadnt gotten approval he would have argued with the clan chief so well have our attack which is good because they dont have enough ladders to climb the wall theyre expecting us to collapse in fear and abandon the wall and gate esk kar watched as the alur meriki gathered themselves every tenth man raising lance or bow to show his readiness then id better get moving gatus left walking slowly to his own position as unconcerned as if this were just another training exercise esk kar took a deep breath and raised his voice archers dont fire until they cross the second mark not the fi rst the second ill flog any man who launches an arrow before i give the word his voice carried down the wall and he heard his words repeated by others even farther down by the gate and beyond are you ready men this time his voice thundered and a roar of approval went up everyone had grown tired of waiting and even those who felt fearful were past that now just wanting to get it over with on the plain the barbarian chief in charge of the attack rode slowly down the line of warriors speaking to men as he moved his standard bearer and guards following him he reached the end then rode back toward the center he stopped almost directly opposite esk kars position the fool had pinpointed the focus of the attack theyd start any moment now esk kar swallowed to moisten his suddenly dry mouth remember the second mark he shouted again and this time he heard laughter from his men at his need to repeat his order the first marker indicated the maximum range of their arrows eskkar wanted the barbarians to reach the second marker one hundred paces closer before they began firing the third marker stood one hundred and twenty paces from the wall and the bows would need almost no arc at that range the time for orders and questions had passed and every soldier on the wall kept silent while the war cries and challenges from the warriors mixed with the neighing of the excited horses esk kar saw the war chief s standard rise up as its bearer raised it aloft then it dipped and the line of men and horses burst into a gallop the riders shouts suddenly muted by the thudding hooves totomes in charge of the bowmen took command his orders echoed along the wall draw your bows the same words and cadence used in a thousand practice sessions aim the riders were past the first mark no one had loosed an arrow that esk kar could see hours of relentless practice ruled out any time for thoughts or worries fly and two hundred and fifty arrows were launched at the rapidly approaching horsemen draw aim fly the chant repeated again and again esk kar watched the oncoming riders saw some go down as the first flight arrived but not as many as he had expected the next flight did better the third flight looked a bit ragged as the more proficient men worked their bows a little quicker but it was fired with the bows almost level and its effect was devastating horses and men went down all along the line though the alur meriki ranks had opened up somewhat the fourth wave of arrows struck fifty paces before the riders reached the ditch now arrows flew both ways esk kar saw an archer go down struck in the forehead even as he heard something hiss over his own head but most of the alur merikis shafts struck the wall making a dull snapping sound as they struck the hard surface the barbarians had only a small target to aim at the upper bodies of the men on the wall and they had to find that target while aiming and loosing their shafts from horseback at a dead run then the enemy reached the ditch some riders showed their skill by jumping their horses off the ten foot drop most of the horses however balked at the descent stiffening their legs as they stopped at the very edge in a spray of sand and dirt esk kar saw three riders tossed forward one going headfirst into the ditch the others clinging to their horses necks arrows rained down on the warriors as every soldier worked his bow as fast as he could they didnt need a cadence now the alur meriki plied their own bows some from horseback others dismounted by force or choice kneeling on the ground and loosing their shafts at the defenders at least a hundred warriors jumped from their horses leaped into the ditch and raced to the wall esk kar heard the thud of the first ladder as it slammed against the wall saw the tip of it a few steps from where he stood and walked over to it drawing his sword as he did so he had already started to swing the blade with all his strength when a head appeared the heavy weapon cut through the mans arm and into his head with ease twisting the blade loose esk kar dug the tip into the wooden ladder and pushed with all his strength sending the ladder as well as the next warrior sailing backward into the ditch looking out over the plain esk kar saw another alur meriki standard on the move toward him the men moving quickly to support the first wave totomess voice rose up over the din taking control again the archers stepped back from the wall and notched their shafts to the string draw aim fly the chant began again as the bowmens shafts sought out those across the ditch volley followed volley and the alur meriki reinforcements erupted into a confused tangle of men and horses crowding against one another the alur meriki bowmen got caught by the confusion and for a moment few arrows flew toward the wall villagers did their work using the forked sticks to push away the ladders and swinging axes at any head that appeared totomess commands kept sounding flight followed flight fi red together and on command the shafts sent into the crowded mass of men and horses with practically every arrow hitting something man or beast the men began to cheer esk kar saw the barbarian bowmen were finished broken by that deadly fire their reinforcements driven back in confusion his archers kept up the pace as the alur meriki wheeled their horses and rode back to safety arrows whistled overhead but fewer now as the barbarians continued their retreat leaving those in the ditch the difficult task of climbing back out none had made it over the wall those mounted barbarians in the ditch found it much more difficult to get a horse to climb up a ten foot embankment than to jump into it and all who tried soon had arrows in their backs those on foot found themselves trapped they were targeted and shot as archers returned to the walls edge and risked exposure by leaning over selecting a target and loosing their arrows in less than a minute all movement in the ditch had stopped except for the riderless horses that trotted back and forth eyes wide and whinnying in fear searching for a way out of the ditch and away from the scent of blood captain should i take a shot at the chief hes still within range he turned to find mitrac at his side esk kar eyes followed where the boy was pointing the two chiefs who had been involved in the attack were talking no shouting at each other no doubt each accusing the other of some failing esk kars eyes hunted for the marker stones and he saw that the two chiefs had halted between the first and second marker arrows kept landing near them and they would move out of range in a moment yes take the shot before hed finished speaking the lads feet were braced and he drew back the shaft taking one last check of the wind a fraction of a second to aim and then the great bow twanged mitrac immediately drew another shaft aimed it and let it fly a third was in the air before the first one landed the chief whod led the attack pitched forward as the long shaft slammed into his back three seconds later the next arrow arrived aimed at the other chief but the mans horse moved and the arrow took the beast in the neck mitracs next three arrows missed as the wounded beast reared and lashed out in pain tossing its rider onto the earth esk kar swore at the bad luck that caused the horse to move he saw the dismounted chief stunned for a moment scrambling to his feet then falling back an arrow in his leg mitrac kept shooting but by this time warriors had surrounded the two chiefs and carried them off though mitrac did get one more rider before the warriors galloped out of range fine shooting esk kar shouted clapping the grinning lad on his shoulder esk kar turned back to the wall leaning over the edge to see what had happened below then turned his eyes south toward the gate the barbarians there had already retreated the hundred or so warriors far too few to force the gate esk kar and gatus had faced more than three hundred men plus part of another group and they had still routed their foes every voice on the wall erupted into cheers shouting and waving fi sts or bows at the retreating barbarians gatus appeared walking carefully along the wall alertly dodging the excited soldiers not wanting to get knocked off the back of the parapet it had happened often enough in training well gatus you survived another fight gatus smiled yes captain and you can put away your sword better clean it first though how did it strike esk kar still held his bloodied sword in his hand smoothly any problems at your end none to speak of most of the attack was here shall we go check at the gate that was good advice but first esk kar raised his voice silence it took three times before the men realized whod given the order and the celebrations died down you men did well that brought another cheer and this time esk kar raised his hand for quiet but this was only a little test just a push to see what were made of the next attack will be worse much worse so stop all this noise and get to work where are the ditch men everyone looked around but no one answered get them moving you know what to do the ditch men mostly young men and older boys would climb down ropes into the ditch to recover arrows and weapons and loot the dead in a few moments thirty men and boys began sliding into the ditch armed only with long knives to fi nish off the wounded each carried an empty quiver or sack to recover anything usable each shaft was precious most arrows would be broken damaged beyond use or simply lost as every person whod ever drawn a bow knew nothing could disappear right before your eyes as completely as an arrow falling to earth you could mark its fall and yet the shaft would burrow itself under the grass or earth never to be found but every arrow point was forged of precious bronze and mustnt be wasted esk kar and gatus strode quickly to the gate where they found a smiling bantor and sisuthros waiting for them sisuthros had a small cut on his cheek that still trailed blood its only a scratch captain but we held them off here easily enough most of the attack was at your end you both did well bantor sisuthros how many did you kill how many did you lose the two men exchanged glances before bantor said sheepishly uhm i dont know captain we havent counted them yet esk kars orders had been plain enough immediately after the attack send the ditch men out to retrieve weapons and count the enemy dead get to it then he said quietly managing to get more emphasis in his tone than his words use the shaduf to get the dead horses inside we can use the fresh meat the shaduf was a long pole mounted to a beam buried in the earth used to lift heavy objects or water from the river one end of the pole was weighted with stones so that the laborers could add their weight to the stones and use the pole as a lever to raise heavy objects builders used the shaduf when building houses as did traders at the wharf to lift heavy cargoes onto or off the ships he turned to gatus lets climb the tower and see whats happening the tower had become the tallest structure in orak from its top eskkar could clearly see the alur meriki leaders about three quarters of a mile away talking things over theyd dismounted as they argued their cases ill bet some of them are for trying again theyd better change their tactics then gatus answered lets hope they dont esk kar shaded his eyes with his hand as he looked out over the plain the alur meriki had attacked orak as though the wall wasnt there using their usual tactics of launching a hailstorm of arrows followed up by lance and sword they must have expected the villagers to break and run but the wall deflected their arrows and the defenders had stood the first test of fire meanwhile the barbarians had no cover at all they have no more ladders his second in command offered theyd be fools to try without more ladders esk kar leaned out over the tower wall where men had already begun the gathering you men down there first pick up all the ladders and climbing poles and throw them up over the wall pass the word he turned to gatus youre right they never had enough ladders and now theyll have to make more many more so were probably through for the day maybe tomorrow as well there isnt much wood in the countryside either gatus noted theyll have to ride quite a few miles to gather new supplies every stick of wood the barbarians could use had been taken down no houses no carts no corrals nothing even the barbarians horses would need to travel for fodder the alur meriki knew how to live off the land but the countryside around orak was going to give them very little well gatus when they come again theyll have plenty of ladders ropes ramps and anything else they can think of gatus scratched his chin rasping his beard in the process theyll not try to match arrows with us from horseback either no they wont try that again esk kar agreed theyll look for an easy way and theyll wait a few days expecting the war party to arrive from across the river if i were them i would try to burn the gate next timereally go at it with fire and axes or maybe theyll try at night it was the old soldiers primary worry though esk kar didnt think it very likely night fighting didnt stand high on the list of warrior skills you couldnt use your bow very well the horses would have to be left behind and even more important no one could see your bravery which meant quite a bit to their way of thinking thats why youre in charge at night esk kar said cheerfully because i know youll keep the men alert and watchful but i think theyll try the gate first they know how to use fire so i expect well see plenty of fire arrows next time they come shouts made them look north where a small party of alur meriki had ridden back angered by the sight of village men scampering around their dead but a few flights of arrows from the nearest defenders drove them off leaving another body lying on the blackened grass esk kar and gatus left the tower and descended to the ground where they found bantor coming to meet them captain there are sixty nine bodies that we can see plus at least that many horses we had eight killed and seventeen wounded but only two badly hurt the barbarians probably had another fifty or sixty wounded men a third of whom could be expected to die as well as many injured horses so it had been a good exchange eight for more than seventy as for the wounded soldiers if you took an arrow in the face or neck you were either dead or dying wounds to the arms would be much less dangerous and the leather vests and caps worn by the men might stop an arrow except one striking head on or at close range but now wasnt the time for the men to be patting themselves on the back only seventy barbarians gatus did you see how many arrows missed in the first few flights hardly any warriors were brought down at all tell the men that theyd better start aiming better or ill toss them over the wall bantor and gatus looked at each other but said nothing we just killed off their weakest and most foolish warriors esk kar explained raising his voice so that as many as possible could hear his words the next lot will be tougher and stronger and will know what to expect so tell the men to stop bragging and get ready and gatus as soon as the ditch men are back inside the walls tell corio to start pumping make sure the wells and water wheels are fully manned until the ditch is turned into mud corio estimated that it would take at least two days to soften the earth properly in the entire ditch longer for the area in front of the gate where the trench was twice its normal width i want that ditch turned into a swamp by tomorrow that would give the men something to do besides cheer and pound their own chests eskkar decided he walked off well satisfied with the days results in spite of his harsh words to his men two hours later esk kar met with his commanders at the courtyard table the late afternoon shadows had lengthened providing a little relief to the partly shaded table the wells are being worked to bring water up for the ditch as are the water wheels gatus reported when they were all seated weve brought in thirteen dead horses and theyre roasting on fires made from barbarian ladders he laughed at the irony lets hope we have more wood and meat after the next attack eskkar said with a smile well have plenty of fire next time theyll bring branches and grasses soaked in oil theyll charge the walls at the same time and every section will be under attack many of them will be dismounted to provide cover for those who rush the walls and gate and this time theyll send all of their warriors not just a part of them he turned to corio now is your time master builder theyll heap firewood at the gate try to burn it or pull it down while they try to shoot our men off the walls and towers corio shifted uneasily on the bench the gate will stand captain and it will not burn easily if the men stand at the walls the gate will hold eyes turned toward sisuthros then to bantor the two men had worked closely in the last two months building and guarding the walls and gate training their men captain well hold the gate bantor said many will die but we can hold it esk kar considered that for a moment well add half of the hawk clan to the towers and the gate except for a few to scatter along the rest of the wall keep the experienced men in reserve for reinforcements he turned toward nicar well need the best villagers as well and well need water stones weapons arrows and the men to help repel any who scale the wall this is what weve trained for captain nicar answered calmly we understand the risks looking around the table there didnt seem to be anything else to say months of preparation resolved many decisions now what else do we need to talk about darkness had fallen hours ago before a weary esk kar decided to get some sleep hed taken one last turn around the walls making sure the men were fed food would be in short supply for the next few months and had to be carefully guarded and rationed now he slipped past the soldiers and villagers who continued to labor under torchlight in the courtyard stopping by the well he washed the dirt of the day from his face and chest from today until the barbarians departed the walls would be heavily manned day and night with extra vigilance after dark fires would burn each night with torches nearby ready to be raised over the walls while men with bows in their hands watched ceaselessly gatus would sleep little this night as he planned to inspect the men throughout the darkness ten lashes awaited any man found not fully awake upstairs he found trella waiting sitting at the big table in the outer room when she looked up she seemed different it took him a moment to realize that she looked tired almost exhausted a look he hadnt seen on her before a wan smile crossed her face as she saw him he went over to her and bent down to give her a kiss have you eaten no not since this morning i was going to but then the attack started and everyone was rushing around she looked up at him i saw you on the wall and suddenly i was afraid that you would die he sat beside her annok sur called out from the door though it stood open then entered without waiting for acknowledgment she carried a tray holding strips of roasted horsemeat bread and warm oil she put the tray on the big table then went to the smaller side table and filled two cups with wine you should be tending to your husband annok sur esk kar commented as he gratefully took one of the cups from her hand the smell of the roasted meat reminded him that he hadnt eaten since before the attack i already have annok sur answered he returned an hour ago and is already asleep she looked at him sternly you should be more concerned with your wife she worked twice as hard today as anyone make sure she eats and drinks some wine shell need her strength her hand rested on trellas shoulder for a moment before she left the room trella smiled again a little brighter this time annok sur is like the older sister i never had she worries about me all the time but ill eat a little no youll eat your share and drink some wine as well esk kar said as he reached for a strip of meat as i will before annok sur returns and takes a stick to us both they ate in silence esk kar finished his portion and took a deep draft of the wine sitting back in the chair he watched trella until she finished now whats troubling you trella drank more of her wine though she usually limited herself to only a few sips when the attack started i was watching from the roofs across the street i saw you standing there saw arrows flying past your head so many flew over the wall she looked away i thought i might see you die right before my eyes if not today then tomorrow or the day after her eyes met his what would happen to me if you die esk kar what would become of me the question took him by surprise if the village falls trella no thats not what i mean what happens to me if you die and the barbarians are driven off his mouth opened in dismay so now this frightened her not the thought that she might die but that she might live he hadnt bothered to think about the consequences of his death hed risked his life too many times to be much concerned about it in battle you either lived or died and those who spent too much time worrying about their fate often ended up dead if the village fell trella would become a slave in some barbarians tent beaten at will traded regularly among the male warriors who enjoyed new slaves the property of anyone her new master might offer her to and abused by her masters regular wives and children many women killed themselves rather than endure such a hard brutal existence tonight that fate didnt hold her thoughts she would probably be one of those who killed themselves rather than endure captivity for trella no torture could be worse than not being able to think to use her mind and to have no control over her fate he raised the wine cup and drained it the wine jug tempted him but he refilled his cup with water instead using the time to think trella waited patiently as she always did never prodding or rushing him knowing that he needed more time to work things out than she did if i die you have the house and the gold gatus and bantor would protect you until his voice ran down the soldiers could be killed as easily as he and they had their own wives to consider trella had no relatives to turn to with some property would come the pressure to remarry and the families might select a new husband for her their duty for any widow with no family a new husband would be found for you or you might be able to select one for yourself since so many know you and respect you youre young and there are many sons from the families so i would be sold once again she answered harshly this time for my gold and my reputation to be put on display until my new husband gets tired of me or grows angry with my words esk kar tried to think about what he could say suddenly wanting more wine and wishing that shed brought this up some other time i cant say what the future brings lets talk about this tomorrow when were both rested she said nothing just sat there eyes downcast when the silence dragged on he stood and went into the bedroom he stripped off his tunic and threw himself down on the bed longing for sleep but his mind thinking about trella what made it worse was knowing that she couldnt find any good solution to her problem otherwise she would have suggested it already he tried to think but his body weary as only those who have fought in a battle could be betrayed him and he fell into a deep sleep nor did he awaken when trella after a long wait put out the lamps and slipped under the blanket with him put her arm across his shoulder and silently cried herself to sleep four days passed with little sleep or time to talk as all attention turned to the spectacle beyond oraks walls the main body of alur meriki arrived late in the afternoon on the second day after the attack they spent the rest of that day and the next establishing a semipermanent camp hundreds of women and children soon filled the hilltops staring at orak and its wall the villagers equally curious stared back at their counterparts and esk kar had to set aside a section of wall so gawkers could see the barbarian encampment without disturbing the soldiers even esk kar felt impressed as he watched the traveling village re create itself as it did almost every day most of the encampment remained hidden behind the low hills about two miles from orak but he knew a broad open expanse would divide the camp into two parts the warriors would pitch their tents forges corrals and anything else needed for the battle on the side closest to orak while the families their carts herds and animals settled in on the other side at the extreme limits of his vision esk kar saw herders tending the flocks of cattle and goats that provided milk cheese meat and hides the horses grazed close by the river more than two thousand of them in three separate herds nicar had scribes try to estimate the numbers of alur meriki it took most of the day accompanied by much squabbling and arguing before they agreed upon an estimate of more than fifty seven hundred nicar shook his head in despair at the total while esk kar swore under his breath on the fourth day esk kar invited trella to the tower they sat there for most of the day while he explained alur meriki ways and how everything functioned for the good of the clan smoke from hundreds of fires trailed up into the sky and they caught the smell of burning dung mixed with wood chips whenever the wind changed direction they watched as slave crews working under the whip built ladders and climbing poles another group constructed a battering ram using a tree trunk dragged up by a team of horses carts arrived and departed carrying lumber that would be used to form shields for their archers theyre a great number of people esk kar but most are women children and slaves trella said and the horses there must be more than a thousand of them what will they eat how long can they stay before the grass is all gone more than two thousand horses he corrected and the warriors they can eat the cattle and if need be the horses as well a warrior can go for many days without food if they eat too many animals trella said theyll have none left to breed any they expected to find here are across the river out of reach and they have no easy way to cross over theyve already stripped the land behind them they must attack the village quickly overcome it and move on even the land in front of them is burned to the earth that matched esk kars assessment of the situation the farther away the food source whether grain or animal the more difficult to bring it back to camp riders would use up as much food as they could carry back in a few days ride so there was little benefit in trying to move supplies on horseback the cumbersome wagons traveled slowly and broke down often a team of oxen could generally cover two miles an hour and no amount of beating would make them move faster even herd animals couldnt be driven too hard lest they die so the main camp remained on the move and always moving in the direction of fresh food and grazing the alur meriki lost about sixty men in the first battle with the ur nammu then another seventy across the river and another seventy here plus their wounded he mused out loud that is about two hundred men trella finished the sum they seem to be waiting for the band across the river the day after the battle the alur meriki built a signal fire on the highest ground next to the river and green wood smoke rose into the air each day since by now theyd be wondering what delayed their raiders but eskkar doubted theyd think the entire party wiped out at least not yet in a few more days when no word came theyd suspect the truth that would make them wonder how strong a force opposed them across the river and whether they dared risk another sizable force in a second crossing when do you think they will come everyone asked the same question tomorrow i think esk kar said they are almost ready can you hold them off esk kar gazed into her serious brown eyes i dont know trella he answered his voice low so nobody else could overhear his words i just dont know i do know theyll pay a heavy price more than they ever imagined well have to see he kissed the top of her head dont be afraid for either of us she straightened up in control of her emotions and her expression make sure you come home early tonight well have much to talk about but when they found themselves alone in bed that night there wasnt much to say though he held her close and felt a tear on her cheek enough of my tears she sat up in the bed her voice firm once more you will hold the village esk kar i believe in you and i will not be afraid of the future you dont need to worry about me just take no unnecessary risks he couldnt see her in the darkness but he ran his fi ngers up her arm then touched the softness of her breast ill take care trella esk kar ignored the whisper in his mind that suggested that tomorrow might be the day of his death holding each other they drifted off into an uneasy sleep the next morning esk kar stood on the wall and watched the sun rise over the hills to the east the barbarian camp already alive with activity one look confirmed his fears the attack would be today probably between midmorning and noon his men looked ready and every face showed determination theyd be fighting for their families as well as their lives some sought revenge for blood spilled whatever the reason each would put strength in a mans arm by noon today gatus commented lifting his leather cap and wiping the sweat from his brow yes or sooner esk kar answered shading his eyes as he tried to estimate what forces would be placed where but we have a surprise for them i think after the first attack the water wheels had fed water into wooden troughs that led through the wall the troughs could be pushed out to varying lengths into the ditch two such devices had been built on each side of the main gate in addition villagers lifted water from oraks wells and fed a constant stream into the ditch backbreaking labor that exhausted the laborers after just a few hours even now leaning over the edge esk kar could see water trickling out into the ditch and turning the earth into mud three or four inches deep hed tested it himself last night lowered from a rope to the base of the wall where hed tried to walk around instead he had slipped and fallen flat on his face to the muffled laughter of those above after more sinking and stumbling they pulled him back up his feet encased in mud now he sat on a tall stool halfway between the gate and the northeast tower that had borne the brunt of the last attack once again esk kar expected this site to receive the main thrust he felt self conscious about sitting and resting while everyone else stood but gatus who used one himself urged him to take his rest whenever possible out on the plain the barbarians began their maneuvers the war leaders shouted and waved their bows as they moved huge numbers of men and horses into position ordinarily the alur meriki found it a simple task to position a warrior at a certain place but today the war chiefs had much more to do they had to assign men to attack certain parts of the village this group of fifty to the rear gate that group to follow them to the north wall and so on and this time each group had to carry ladders ropes and fire arrows items not usually handled by warriors many would be complaining or resisting the assignment esk kar smiled when he saw ladders passed from one warrior to another accompanied by much shouting and shoving warriors want to fight not carry ladders he said to gatus the strongest hand the ladders to the weakest but there are a great many men and today they have plenty of ladders gatus stepped away to ask one of the clerks assigned to counting the enemy whether he had finished his task grunted then returned to esk kars side it looks like about fourteen hundred men out there at this rate it will be noon before theyre ready gatus said look theyre bringing a battering ram esk kar squinted into the sun and saw that a huge tree trunk rested atop a cart pushed along by a group of slaves a task that wouldnt please those assigned to it about twenty horsemen escorted them to make sure they kept to their work the slaves carrying firepots wouldnt be any happier the pots needed to be replenished with fresh fuel which apparently no one had remembered to bring resolving these issues took time and more hours passed before all the men and their burdens reached their assigned places other carts lumbered up behind the warriors and the horsemen moved forward a hundred paces to allow the carts to come closer at the first stirrings of the horsemen a ripple of sound had run up and down the wall the soldiers thought the attack had begun when the horsemen halted waiting for the carts to close up esk kar and gatus turned to each other with smiles on their faces the leading edge of the riders stood just within long range of the bowmen the leading warriors sat on their animals while they waited for the final arrangements believing themselves out of range when in truth they stood about thirty paces past the first mark esk kar turned to totomes whod taken his station behind the commanders his face showed that he looked forward to sending arrows into the unsuspecting riders master bowman i think its time to show these invaders what theyre in for a villager readied his drum and waited for the order hed relay totomess commands totomes leaned back and waved his bow to signal the other lead archers he took but a few moments to assure himself that everyone stood ready and then he gave the order three quick beats sounded repeated a few seconds later as another drummer relayed the signal down the length of the wall two hundred and sixty archers in two ranks on the wall readied their weapons drawing their bows to the fullest and aiming up into the sky totomes gave the command and a single drumbeat echoed along the wall a storm of arrows burst upward into the sky followed by another and another leaders of ten called the cadence out exactly as they had during the months of training esk kars eyes stayed fixed on the distant horsemen even as he heard the rasp of wood on wood followed by the grunts of the men as they let the shafts fly the first flight landed many falling short but enough striking the leading ranks as they sat there many looking up at the wave of arrows that approached more surprised than worried about any danger at that range that didnt last long as the second cloud descended animals reared up in pain and wounded men cried out or slipped from their horses though nearly spent at such long range the heavy bronze tipped shafts could still kill the leading warriors tried to move back but the riders behind blocked their path and no chief gave any orders to retreat or move forward the carts continued their journey and added to the confusion as sweating slaves under the lash and their masters kept directing men and animals forward the alur meriki milled about in confusion while eight hailstorms of arrows fell upon them a few rode forward trying to move under the cloud of missiles while others forced their animals to the rear those who rode forward became targets for the lead archers allowed to pick their own shots and soon shafts flew at those who had moved toward orak esk kar saw one such rider knocked clean off his horse another warrior clutched his stomach and hunched over his mount suddenly the whole mass of men surged rearward any semblance of order gone warriors might charge fearlessly through arrows in a wild dash for glory but none wanted to stand in one place and be a target laughter and jeers rang from the walls as the horsemen galloped back out of range leaving their dead and wounded behind that would delay them for at least another hour esk kar decided sitting back down on the stool totomes walked over smiling well captain that was a good lesson for them theyll not stand that close again good shooting totomes esk kar said approvingly how many did we strike that required some closer observation totomes stepped to the wall his lips moving as he watched the activity on the hillside others were counting as well but totomes apparently had faith in his own eyes id say that we killed another twenty or twenty five men and horses and wounded as many more better than i thought these men could do with such small bows esk kar felt quite pleased half a hundred barbarians would be out of todays attack at no cost to his men i still say its good shooting totomes not everyone can have your eye and your arm totomes snorted good shooting indeed to hit only half a hundred two hundred and fifty archers shot at least eight arrows each at a standing target thats he paused a moment eyes closed and lips moving as he did the sum a feat far beyond esk kars ability thats over two thousand arrows or about one hit in forty not very good results at all at five hundred paces totomes ill take any kills they can make weve plenty of arrows and weve delayed their attack for at least another hour meanwhile theyve been standing in the hot sun for most of the morning standing without water gatus added coming over and joining in on the last part of the conversation both the horses and men will be thirsty esk kar glanced up at the sky for once grateful of the heat that burned down from the heavens the defenders had plenty of food salt and water as evidenced by a steady stream of men using the latrines the alur meriki took more than an hour to regroup esk kar could see the frustration as they readied themselves one clan leader struck a man with a sword knocking him from his horse and farther down the line a fight broke out in the ranks with a dozen men involved finally everything was in place and an alur meriki drum began to pound with shouts of relief the horde began to move walking their horses up to the line of arrows that protruded from the earth and marked plainly the true range of the villagers shafts as they neared it esk kar heard totomes ready the men they nocked their arrows and drew their bows the waiting is over esk kar decided one way or another five months of work would be decided in the next hour along the wall totomes forno and the other lead archers calculated the range perfectly at the same moment the alur meriki began to gallop their horses the first flight of arrows flew free rushing to meet the approaching horsemen esk kar stood up gathered the stool and slipped to the back edge of the rampart he dropped the stool down to one of the villagers below then esk kar stood beside totomes and watched as the northerner directed the archers the barbarians rode quickly through the hail of arrows esk kar watched the bows lowered slightly for each shot until the archers held them level and fired directly the height of the wall giving them another small advantage in range the first arrows from the alur meriki arrived with a clatter most of them hitting the wall some flying overhead and only a few striking the men at that extreme range many of the spent shafts bounced off leather jerkins nevertheless cries of pain sounded as arrows pierced bare arms and shoulders esk kar saw one man struck in the eye and killed instantly but the creak of wood followed by the twang of the released bowstring went on steadily enemy horsemen were dropping even as they reached the ditch this time the horsemen pulled up not wanting to be caught in the ditch but a few jumped their beasts in while others split to each side of the eastern wall turning along the narrow path to ride down the north and south sides those who jumped into the ditch found more than they bargained for the horses sank into the mud and despite the din esk kar heard leg bones snapping as they pitched man and beast to the ground the high pitched screams of horses in pain rose above the cries of wounded warriors but many of the warriors remained on their horses trading arrows with their foes on the wall while others dismounted and leaped down into the ditch the soldiers kept firing their shafts into the mass of men and animals with barbarians so crowded together that almost every arrow struck something if this keeps up esk kar thought well break them right here totomess voice boomed over the men shouting orders that echoed along the wall the first rank of archers leaned over the wall and began killing those on foot below a few volleys and the attackers below began trying to scramble back out meanwhile the second rank of archers continued to fire into the enemy across the ditch even with only a single row firing they devastated the riders the bowmen could scarcely miss such a massed target at close range soon the far side of the ditch was littered with men and animals some writhing in pain many with multiple shafts protruding from their bodies a drum began to sound at the rear of the barbarian ranks and the riders broke off riding north and south to get away from the deadly arrow storm others dismounted to attack the walls on foot as carts finally reached the edge of the ditch pushed into position by slaves and warriors with the carts providing some shelter the barbarians began to shoot back at the men on the walls totomes directed all the archers to aim at the bowmen behind the carts arrows struck home there instantly turning the carts into a forest of arrows as dozens of shafts hit but the carts made a difference a mass of alur meriki moved forward and into the ditch while the defenders continued to exchange shafts with the warriors protected behind the carts at least three hundred fighters plied their bows so they more than matched the defenders however the alur meriki shot at longer range about ninety paces an easy distance for the practiced archers behind the wall under their fire the men standing next to the carts went down first and as more and more men crowded behind the wagons to fire their weapons even the smaller targets offered were being hit the men needed little guidance each man firing as quickly as possible esk kar turned away from the wall to look back down into the village the villagers men and women kept on doing their jobs fresh quivers of arrows continued to reach the bowmen and enough dead men lay behind the wall to provide replacement bows totomes bellowed orders that brought villagers armed with axes and forked sticks up the parapet the archers continued to ply their bows moving back just enough to allow these new defenders to take their positions directly behind the wall the rampart was only four long paces wide and three ranks of men could barely fit on it at one time ladders slapped against the wall some pushed away instantly by the villagers but others remaining as the attackers below used their weight to hold them in place esk kar looked out across the ditch the defenders deadly archery continued to take its toll the barbarian bowmen carts notwithstanding seemed to show little stomach to go toe to toe with oraks bowmen less than half of their original number remained standing many of these now huddled behind the carts themselves barely visible beneath the hundreds of arrows protruding from them esk kars archers kept firing grunting steadily with the effort to bend the stiff bows and launch the heavy shafts weeks of practice had toughened those muscles and he saw no one fail to pull the shaft to his ear before releasing a thrill of pride went through him that they could take such punishment and continue to fight so effectively in front of him esk kar saw a man and a woman struggling to push back a ladder he added his weight to the forked stick and the ladder moved slowly vertical then toppled backward as esk kar moved closer to the edge an arrow rattled off his copper helmet barbarian archers stood below waiting to shoot at any target that appeared on the walls he looked at the man and woman their eyes wide with fright and grinned at them rocks rocks all along the parapet the same command rang out the villagers dropped their axes and sticks and began tossing the hoard of stones over the wall the rounded river rocks about the size of a melon made a deadly missile they were heavy enough and with fifteen feet to fall dealt a blow that could snap an arm or crack a skull for those at the bottom of the ditch which gave the stones an extra ten feet the rocks would crush a skull even inside a helmet the rain of stones provided yet one more shock to the attackers struggling in the mud that hampered their movements and now trying to dodge the deadly rain from above of all the practice drills the villagers had conducted stone tossing had been the most physically demanding the men had trained to throw the stones in a random pattern but always to try and drop them close to the base of the wall it had been exhausting backbreaking work fi rst to place the stones on the wall toss them down then retrieve them and repeat the process now that effort proved its worth in the time a man could count to sixty more than a thousand stones rained down on the alur meriki this new tactic stopped any attempt to climb the wall meanwhile a cheer went up from totomes and the archers as the barbarians bowmen behind the carts began to move back unaccustomed to this kind of exchange and surprised at their losses totomess voice rang out ordering the villagers away from the wall he ordered the rear rank to continue firing at the departing archers and moved the first rank up to the walls edge so they could lean over and shoot at anything below a few archers were struck by arrows from the men below but the rocks had disrupted the attackers and forced the men carrying ladders away from the wall pushing them into the kneeling archers behind them now esk kars men delivered a volley of arrows ducked then fired another after the third volley they didnt bother to duck back down as the barbarians began to flee esk kar moved forward and took a quick look then immediately ducked his head as two arrows flew over him the copper helmet made him too conspicuous hed have it painted brown tonight but the quick glance had told him what he wanted to know the fight would continue but the attack against this part of the wall had failed he decided to check the gate slipping away from the wall he swung down from the back of the rampart and let himself drop to the earth his bodyguards following him his horse stood ready under the rampart a scared youth held the halter the rope wrapped so tightly around his wrist that it took a moment to loosen it esk kar thanked the lad as he mounted and cantered toward the gate the short distance made it hardly worth the trouble to mount and ride but it looked better to arrive by horseback rather than appear out of breath by running from one place to another at the gate he found confusion everywhere fire arrows still struck the mud covered houses behind the gate some shafts still burning harmlessly esk kar needed only a glance to see the fighting there had been brutal with bodies of the dead lying beneath the rampart most with arrows in their faces or throats smoke and the smell of burning wood floated in the air a few men far less than he expected struggled with buckets of water or bundles of arrows carrying their loads to those in the towers or standing on the gate itself a boy ran up and took the halter from esk kar as he dismounted moments later the twenty men of the reserve arrived breathing hard from the quick run he divided the reserve force and sent half to each tower but he climbed the steps that led to the top of the gate only a few men stood atop the upper rampart and these were busy pouring water over the top of the gate trying to keep the wood wet the lower rampart only ten feet off the ground held fewer than ten men firing arrows through tiny slits carved at the intersections of the vertical logs the supply of rocks on both ramparts had been exhausted and no one carried replacements he saw the other reserve force of soldiers had already been committed he turned to find nicar and bantor at his shoulder his subcommanders arm covered with blood where are the men bringing the stones he shouted before they could speak theyve run away nicar had to raise his voice to be heard over the din i sent for more men but they havent arrived yet get men from anywhere and have them bring stones as they come hurry he turned to bantor are you holding yes but barely the fires are beginning to grow we need more water as well as he spoke they heard a huge crash as something hammered against the gate if we drive them away from the base of the gate the fi res will go out by themselves the gate shuddered again esk kar sprinted up the ladder swinging himself onto the top rampart shouting down for his bodyguards to find bows and follow him archers get to the upper rampart esk kar and his guards plus the men still fighting now numbered a dozen he spaced them out along the rampart when they were ready esk kar commanded start from the back of the ditch dont try for the ones directly beneath well take them from back to front ready loose the archers rose over the wall instead of one or two bowmen being the targets of many warriors it was a line of archers who fired their arrows and ducked immediately back below the crest of the gate the effect of the volley fire might not be impressive but at least the archers firing together knew they would not be singled out that gave them courage and at esk kars command they launched another volley again the rain of arrows at such close range proved deadly to the attackers esk kar glanced at the walls on each side of him the men from the towers and the adjacent areas of the wall still exchanged shafts with the remaining barbarian archers across the ditch if the barbarian bowmen directly below the gate could be stopped then the men working the ram could quickly be killed so far it was working four volleys fi red and not a man lost breathless men began arriving below scooping stones from the piles forming a human chain and handing them up the wall the gate shuddered regularly now the rams blows starting to take effect soon cracks would appear the archers continued their deadly work but already two had been struck by enemy shafts one pitching off the rampart meanwhile from across the ditch the barbarians targeted the men atop the gate making exposure dangerous esk kar grabbed two stones as they began to arrive wait he shouted at the fresh men who now filled the rampart he moved to the center of the rampart and put down one stone he waited until a row of men was crouching beside him all on their knees beneath the line of archers the rampart creaked and groaned under its weight of stones and men when the archers fired their volley esk kar stood one stone held in both hands now glancing quickly over the top of the gate he saw at least thirty sweating barbarians handling the ram using ropes slung underneath the giant log to swing it back and forth he hurled the stone down and saw it strike the ram then bounce onto the shoulder of a man who screamed as his bones snapped in a flash esk kar gathered the second stone and sent it down as hard as he could this time not bothering to see what effect it had meanwhile his archers fired another volley a shaft from the attackers buzzed right past his ear archers the next volley is for the ram aim at those carrying the ram ready now they went over the top firing their arrows the archer next on esk kars right dropped his bow with a cry an arrow through his upper arm esk kar seized the weapon and took an arrow from the mans quiver hed spotted the warrior in charge of the ram a shield raised over his head to protect him this time esk kar aimed carefully before he fired ignoring the arrows that whizzed by his face hoping his helmet would protect him as he targeted the man directing the battering his arrow fl ashed low into the mans stomach just below the shield arrows and stones rained down on the men carrying the ram and the heavy log slipped sideways and fell too many bearers on one side had been killed or wounded that stopped the ramming the barbarians would need a sizable effort to upright the ram and get it into action again esk kar was amazed theyd managed to wield it even that long on such uncertain footing stones kept crashing down from the gate and now villagers dropped them carefully aiming them to fall directly at the base of the gate in a few moments the barbarians realized their cover had disappeared and they turned and ran staggering through the mud easy targets for the men in the tower and the nearby walls moments later the ditch held only the dead and dying esk kar saw a body of horsemen arrive across the ditch and realized that theyd been coming to reinforce the attackers if he and his men hadnt managed to stop the ram there would have been a hundred fresh men at the gate more than enough to drive its archers below the wall the warriors hesitated as they saw their comrades fleeing and soon arrows began to strike among them some went bravely forward to help the men on foot and a few paid the price for their courage the barbarians had started giving ground across the entire length of the wall as totomess archers fi nally swept the carts clear of enemy bowmen once again the alur meriki had to run the same gauntlet of arrows as they retreated cheers sounded everywhere across the wall even as leaders of ten cursed their men for using their mouths not their bows but the defenders had tired too so they watched gleefully as the barbarians ran back to their original position of that morning esk kar glanced up at the sun and saw that less than an hour had passed since the attack began looking out again at the ditch he found he could scarcely see the earth packed as it was with bodies of men and animals the barbarians began to regroup under individual standards even half a mile away defeat and disbelief showed in their postures the first attack a few days ago had been a probe nothing more but this had been a full scale effort and they werent used to being beaten in battle even worse theyd had to leave many of their clan brothers lying on the earth esk kar could see a group of chiefs their anger and frustration visible even at nearly half a mile they argued for some time surrounded by hundreds of dejected and weary men finally the standards were raised men turned their horses around and headed back toward the main camp the battle had ended for today esk kar leaned heavily against the gate breathing hard then looked down behind him into orak men and women from the village filled the space all eyes turned upward waiting in silence theyd come because the fighting had ceased and they knew the enemy was moving off now they waited to hear the outcome wiping the sweat from his eyes esk kar straightened up he knew he had to speak that this was one of those times when words were more important than swords taking a deep breath he raised his voice inwardly reviling himself as a hypocrite men of orak the barbarians have been driven off for today his last words were drowned out in an uproar that reached all the way to the barbarian camp esk kar shouted out the words again but the jubilant shouting went on until he raised his hands to silence them we have won a battle but the struggle is not over theyre driven off but they will be back and now theyre fi lled with anger and hate and theyll want revenge for those weve slain as long as theyre outside our walls the danger grows each day return to your duties there is still much to do that would have to satisfy them he scrambled down from the gate to find gatus and bantor waiting for him bantor had blood running down his arm and his eyes looked vacant as he swayed upon his feet where is maldar shouted esk kar we almost lost the gate because the villagers ran off in fear furious esk kars pent up energy and frustration of the last few days rushed to the surface the gate could have been stormed and the village captured for lack of a few stones and men to carry them neither gatus nor bantor spoke so esk kar continued shouting orders his anger apparent to all send men over the walls to gather up their ladders and weapons and woodcutters to break up that ram and bring it inside he saw corio pushing through the crowd corio get your men over the wall and check the gate i saw men trying to dig underneath it and the ram made cracks in the timbers make what repairs you can before dark and dont forget to recover the stones gatus nodded and moved away shouting orders to his men but bantor leaned heavily on one of the villagers and esk kar realized his subcommander was seriously wounded blood dripped steadily from his neck as well as from the ragged bandage wrapped around his upper left arm esk kar turned to his bodyguards carry bantor back to the house and find a healer for him a horseman pushed his way through the thinning crowd esk kar saw that it was jalen come from the rear gate captain do you need help here jalens voice showed his concern no not any longer any problems at the river a small party of barbarians rushed the gate but we drove them back without much trouble everything is secure there esk kar nodded still hot with emotion wheres sisuthros and maldar soldiers approached him nervously and the story came out in bits as each contributed what he knew sisuthros had been wounded early an arrow striking him in the mouth the missile had passed right through and come out in front of his ear taking out two of his teeth hed been bleeding badly when they took him away maldar had taken an arrow under his right arm and passed out from loss of blood just as his second in command had been slain with their commanders wounded the men had done the best they could in the tumult no one noticed when the villagers abandoned their duties and ran off esk kar stepped toward the last of his bodyguards so enraged that the man instinctively took a step backward find the men who left their posts get them and bring them to me every one of them i want them all the cowards had jeopardized everything though theyd faced little danger themselves they had seen men die and had run off to hide in their houses or under their beds as if that would save them he swore theyd pay for their cowardice he took a deep breath and tried to control himself jalen take command here make sure the defenses are ready for another attack clear out the bodies from in front of the gate as well get the men water and food then exchange some of them for fresh men from the other walls have the men change their bowstrings get more arrows and stones curse all the gods below you know what to do everyone burst into activity any thoughts of celebrating vanished by their captains rage and all glad of any opportunity to move away from him esk kar took the time to inspect the men in both towers keeping his anger suppressed and making sure they knew what to do and that help was on the way when he felt the gate secure he called out to jalen send word to gatus that im going back to the house his horse still waited the reins held by a boy of about twelve seasons esk kar swung onto the animals back took the reins then reached down and caught the boys arm pulling him up in front of him come with me lad youve earned a coin for doing your duty today and i have none with me he kicked the horse and they cantered through the narrow streets people scattering before him his grim face frightening most of them into silence at the house he swung down from the horse holding the boy in his arm as if he were a child stay with the horse lad but get him some water i may need him again pushing his way into the courtyard he saw much of the space taken up with wounded nicar stood there directing men and dispatching messengers esk kar walked into the house where he found trella and a dozen women working with the healers she gave him a brief smile but went on with her work four wounded members of the hawk clan lay there including an unconscious maldar bloody bandages covered his upper body and under his arm esk kar found sisuthros sitting on the floor his back against the wall and his chest covered with dried blood his mouth jaw and neck had all been wrapped tightly these bandages oozed only a trace of blood though and the mans eyes seemed alert enough sisuthros couldnt speak but he lifted his left hand a little when esk kar saw him walking over to him esk kar took sisuthross good arm gently in his hand you look like youve been wrapped for burial the man tried to shake his head but the movement brought pain to his eyes rest we drove them away and the battles fi nished for today and probably the next few days esk kar looked around have you seen bantor sisuthros raised his hand again pointing upstairs esk kar ran up the stairs to the workroom he found ventor there finishing his work assisted by annok sur her lips trembling even as she helped bandage her husband unconscious on the big table esk kar stood there a few moments until the healer stepped back and began putting his instruments into his pouch how is he they pulled an arrow out of his arm the healer replied slowly that must have been early in the battle then another arrow went through the side of his neck he looked at annok sur your husband is a lucky man the arrow missed the big blood carrier he turned back to esk kar ive washed the wound and bandaged it but hes lost much blood and his life now rests with the gods ventor started to walk away but esk kar put out his arm do everything you can for him he fought bravely today so did many others as i can see by their wounds he answered tiredly but i will come back when i can annok sur will call me if something happens ventor pushed past esk kar on his way down the stairs i should be helping the others annok surs voice trembled and her shoulders shook with the effort to hold back the tears there are wounded all over the village stay here esk kar ordered and watch him carefully send word if you need anything she stood there twisting a bandage in her hands hes strong annok sur the gods will surely help him to recover there was nothing more esk kar could do so he returned downstairs pausing halfway down to survey the aftermath trying to shut out the moans of the injured on the battlefield far from water or healers with any kind of a serious injury most men died here with many to care for them maybe half might live the women had prepared as best they could making bandages from clean rags setting up benches and tables for the injured and ensuring that water and wine were plentiful both for those wounded and those helping them esk kar went out into the courtyard striding over to the table where he found gatus corio nicar rebba and the other leaders gatus had emerged without a scratch though he had been exposed often enough as esk kar heard their reports he ground his teeth in anger the problem was the towers they drew arrows from every warrior he swore silently that next time the alur meriki came to orak they would find more and bigger towers so that the men defending them were not singled out and future towers would project out over the wall so that the defenders would not have to lean out over them to shoot at anyone at the base of the gate or the wall itself he swore at himself for not thinking of that in advance though nobody else had thought of it either gatus took one look at his captain poured some wine into a cup and handed it to esk kar how are they his head turned toward the wounded sisuthros is good just cant talk maldar is bad but may live if the rot does not set in bantor is has lost a lot of blood and the healer doesnt know or wont say if he does he held the wine cup to his lips and had to concentrate to keep his hand from shakingthough he wondered why he bothered plenty of brave men shook after a fight grateful to be alive and away from the stress of battle get the captain a bench gatus ordered and one of the hawk clan pushed a stool over to esk kar the scribes have finally finished counting our dead and wounded gatus squinted over the clay tablet fifty one archers dead sixty two wounded if they come again well have to strip the men from the rear and side walls esk kar struggled with the numbers for a moment a quarter of his fighting men were dead or out of action and most of the casualties came from the towers and the gate more than a hundred precious archers it had taken months to train now the defenses would be stretched thin they wont be back today im sure of that how many did we kill do you have the count no not yet the ditch men are still doing their work jalen will send word when theyve finished the counting the ladders have already been picked up and the ram will soon be chopped into firewood captain corio added it will take them time to fi nd wood and make new ladders the gate is in good condition the fi res didnt burn long enough to damage anything and the ram made only a few cracks were nailing new wood over the damaged places it should be completed before nightfall esk kar nodded in satisfaction good corio your gate did well a horse galloped up and a grinning clerk from nicars staff flung himself from the horses back outside the gate and then rushed over to the table captain i bring word from jalen weve counted the barbarian dead the messenger paused dramatically before imparting his news three hundred and thirty two dead captain that includes those killed in the morning he added then remembered the rest of his report jalen is collecting the weapons and arrows and he went over the wall to fire the carts they left behind ishtar gatus smacked his fist on the table the fool will get himself killed over a few wagons the clerk looked around nervously the archers are protecting them and thats enough boy esk kar said too late now to order jalen back inside by the time someone reached the gate hed either be finished with his burning or dead anything else when nothing new was offered eskkar thanked the clerk and sent him back to his duties well gatus the barbarians were fools to leave those carts behind it will be good to burn them nevertheless if we can count three hundred dead then there are probably another hundred wounded this is a terrible defeat for them theyve lost many men including some of their best archers what will come next nicar asked will they come again oh yes but not until they have a new plan theyve learned their lesson today and they wont try to match bows with us again not like that at any rate and today they learned we wont collapse in fear at the sight of them esk kar took a deep breath if they come at the gate again theyll be better prepared they might have taken the gate today if theyd been more organized they were slow bringing up their reinforcements even the mighty alur meriki could blunder in the heat of battle eskkar realized but they wouldnt make that mistake again his eyes met nicars again or maybe theyll come at night nicar looked uncomfortable and that reminded him did we find those men who left their posts esk kar looked at gatus where are they gatus and nicar exchanged a look before the old soldier replied there are thirty men outside in the street gatus said calmly four men were in charge of them three have been found and theyre outside as well were still searching for the fourth man gatus leaned back and looked at nicar captain they just did as their leaders did nicar said defensively most are good men and shouldnt be punished for their leaders failures a silence fell over the table though the moans of the injured and the voices of those tending them continued esk kar paused for a moment trying to get his temper under control those men were supposed to bring stones to the gate the reserve force was called up bantor maldar and sisuthros were wounded he looked around the table if the fight on the north wall had lasted any longer the gate would have been taken and the village lost and now one of those who ran is hiding from us esk kar closed his fist and tapped it gently on the table i should kill them all all thirty of them perhaps bantor and the others would not be lying wounded if these villagers had stayed at their posts no one met his gaze id kill every one of them if i might not need them tomorrow he let his fist open the four leaders are to die and their goods confiscated to be distributed with any other loot taken the others will be assigned duties of greater danger if they falter the soldiers are to kill them instantly what they did and why theyre being punished is to be explained to every man in orak so that everyone understands what will happen if they run again nicar swallowed nervously but kept silent the look on esk kars face was plain to all no entreaty would change his mind gatus turned to nicar its better than they deserve the villagers must see that their leaders are willing to fight for them he looked back at esk kar well find the fourth man soon enough how do you want them to die esk kar wanted them tortured over the fire but knew he couldnt order that just kill them gatus as soon as you find the last one just kill them and make sure everyone knows why do it in the marketplace with a sword thrust its a better fate than the barbarians would have given them nicar and rebba can handle the details he put all thoughts of those men out of his mind now lets get ready for the next attack two miles away a disgusted thutmose sin sat inside his tent still thinking about the failed attack he witnessed earlier the dirt eaters had not quailed at the sight of his warriors instead they fought bravely their cursed arrows wreaking havoc among his men their outcast leader had prepared his men well training the cowards to fight with the bow while hiding behind their wall and each time the alur meriki pressed the attack this esk kar had rallied his men now thutmose sin had to deliver even more bad news to the council barrack had ridden into the camp an hour earlier near exhaustion barracks clan leader insak heard the story first insak then gathered altanar the other clan leader whod provided warriors for the raid across the river and the three of them carried the evil tidings to thutmose sin barrack again related what had happened on the other side of the tigris thutmose sin sat stone faced as the tale unfolded the news didnt surprise him hed already assumed the riders were dead or scattered otherwise they would have signaled days ago it was one thing to be a day or two late in arriving but it would be a foolish leader who disobeyed his sarrums orders for more than a week when barrack finished thutmose sin told him to keep silent about the loss and dismissed him it must have been this esk kar thutmose sin said when they were alone he moves quickly across the river only a few days ago then back to orak to meet our attack how did he know about the warriors insak asked it would take time to gather men to prepare this ambush is there a spy within our camp someone who no i dont think so thutmose sin replied from the ur nammu he learned about our plans to encircle the village with that knowledge he guessed we would send a force across the river so he recruited the ur nammu to provide riders made his preparations and moved northward hes a demon then altanar said one of our own turned against us he must be killed flayed alive and burned over the fire on that we agree altanar thutmose sin said but first we have to capture him summon the rest of the council ill tell them the news the two clan leaders left and thutmose sin resumed his thoughts orak had turned into a disaster todays failure coupled with this latest news would turn the council into an angry mob outside his tent he could hear the clan leaders gathering some still quarreling about todays attack blaming each other for the failure to capture the village their voices rose in anger and the accusations and recriminations flowed freely all the clan leaders are waiting sarrum thutmose sin cleared his thoughts buckled the sword around his waist then stepped outside the full council of the alur meriki with every clan leader present turned toward him his presence stopped the bickering and they took their seats on the open ground before his tent only then did thutmose sin join them taking the last empty spot that completed the circle markad and issogu took their places behind him no other guards were permitted when the full council met thutmose sin nodded to insak one of my warriors has returned from across the river insak began he repeated barracks story taking his time and leaving nothing out the council sat there mouths open stunned into silence at hearing that another force of alur meriki warriors had ceased to exist these dirt eaters insak concluded must be swept from the earth my clan demands vengeance on these fi lth they are even worse than the ur nammu who shame their clan by joining forces with them they all started talking asking more questions at fi rst then beginning the argument that thutmose sin expected some wanted to hunt down the ur nammu some to raid the lands across the river others wanted to attack the village again as soon as possible a few thutmose sin noted wanted to move on he counted these relieved that only four clan leaders spoke openly of leaving orak at last thutmose sin raised his hand and the conversations trailed off my clan brothers he began we must destroy this village for us there is no other way he gazed at every clan leader as his eyes went around the circle we are committed weve driven the dirt eaters to this place and destroyed their farms and fields our men across the river were to prevent them from escaping but they are not trying to escape the few boats they might have are inside the walls unused this orak offers a challenge to us each day that it resists its people are prepared to die here and die they must we planned for this battle we traveled out of our path now we must finish it if we had food enough id stay here and starve them out but the lands are empty and we cannot remain here much longer but the loss of the raiding party do we not need them the raiding party was to keep the dirt eaters from crossing the river thutmose sin stood our men have watched the crossing and none of the villagers have tried to flee our warriors across the river would not be of any help to us even if they were alive and im sure insak and altanars men killed many dirt eaters before they died now it falls to us to avenge our kin no one spoke hed shamed them all into silence and now no one met his gaze so nothing has changed the dirt eaters held us off today only by luck next time will be different he let his voice grow hard the alur meriki have never been defeated remind your warriors of that tell them to prepare to attack the village again tell them that no matter what the cost the next attack will succeed or every alur meriki warrior will die in the attempt and this time my clan brothers we will hold nothing back and we will not fail esk kar returned to his bedroom well after midnight and closed the door bantor remained on the table outside resting under his wifes eye on a layer of linen blankets ventor didnt want to chance reopening bantors wounds by carrying him down to his bed instead the healer along with his apprentice took what sleep they could in bantors room downstairs he found trella waiting for him sitting cross legged on the bed a single small lamp shedding smoky light throughout the chamber he knew hed kept her from sleeping that she stayed up because he might need her you should have slept he chided her gently though grateful shed stayed awake trella stood and came into his arms its been a long day for you eskkar i thought you might need to talk she spoke softly reminding him that others slept in the outer room she held him close for a moment then stepped back and helped him remove the great sword from his waist i saw what you did with the men at the gate i was in the marketplace when they were killed most of the wounded received treatment at the marketplace and shed gone there after doing what she could at the house he held her for a moment then sat tiredly on the edge of the bed i was angry the gate couldve been taken and all of us killed they deserved to die i wanted to kill them myself put them to the torture trella filled a cup with a mixture of water and wine and handed it to him they said that nicar asked for mercy on their behalf he smiled at her then drained the cup so you were at the table after all she took the empty cup from his hand and put it on the floor then got on the bed behind him and began to rub his shoulders her fingers strong on the muscles of his neck you did the right thing killing only the leaders and doing it quickly before anyone could feel sorry for them but nicar also was right to ask you for mercy for the others you should thank him for it you know she kissed his neck he gave you good advice though you did not ask him for it esk kar started to relax the massage stopped for a moment and he heard the rustle of her dress as she removed it then her hands were reaching around to hold him and he could feel her breasts soft against his back her nipples hard you need to get some sleep esk kar before the morning is upon us let me help you sleep she blew out the lamp and pushed him down on the bed her mouth found his and she kissed him tenderly her hands moving over him her body twining against his suddenly esk kar wanted her his fatigue vanished and he felt the urgings rise up inside him hed survived another battle and now he wanted her as much to prove that he still lived as for any other reason he pulled her down beside him on the bed and moved atop her heard her moan softly as he entered her and felt her arms encircle him then he thought of nothing else the sun had climbed well over the horizon before he awoke the street sounds finally rousing him again trella had let him sleep but had risen early for her own work esk kar felt annoyed at himself the village lay surrounded by thousands of savage enemies and oraks leader slept in his soft bed until well past the dawn he shook the sleep from his eyes and dressed then went into the outer room stopping abruptly when he found others there to his further surprise bantor was awake propped up by blankets and being fed soup by his wife he looked pale and weak but his eyes seemed alert bantor im glad to see you awake esk kar looked at annok sur did the healer i mean is he ventor said he is doing better annok sur couldnt disguise the happiness in her voice he isnt allowed to speak and hes very weak and must not move or exert himself for several days the healer has already changed the bandages and says the blood flow has stopped well that is good news esk kar replied a smile lighting his face i must go before the whole village thinks i sleep the day away bantors eyes were full of questions but esk kar waved them away everything is taken care of so dont try to speak annok sur will tell you everything esk kar looked at her the women around here seem to know everything that goes on he checked in at the command table where he learned the barbarians were keeping out of sight and that nothing had happened during the night he went to the well washing and drinking deeply of the cool water before he poured it over himself returning to the house he entered the kitchen where he got bread figs and some fresh cooked strips of horseflesh placing everything on a wooden trencher along with a cup of water he carried it all outside to the command table by then a tired gatus had arrived his watch just finished esk kar remembered that his second in command was getting on in seasons i walked the walls at dawn gatus reported everything is as it should be work continues on the gate and theres a huge stockpile of stones there now jalen is on watch and hamati is making another circuit of the wall corio wants to know what he should do about all the bodies in the ditch the smell will be rank soon enough esk kar took a bite of the horsemeat and washed it down with a gulp of water then chewed on a piece of bread using the time to think trella had spoken several times about the need to keep the village as clean as possible during the siege when he hadnt shown much interest she took the responsibility on herself he didnt understand her reasons for wanting to take charge of the sanitation but it seemed harmless enough shed organized work gangs to cleanse the streets and make sure the villagers cleaned up after themselves carts now collected the human and animal waste each day and took it to the stables where a huge pit had been dug before the attack closed the gates the carts had simply dumped their contents into the river letting those downstream worry about the occasional floating gifts in their water but the dead bodies in the ditch would soon be stinking not that he cared about that but they might block the flow of water needed to keep the ditch muddy in a few days there might be dry patches that the barbarians could use for their attacks gatus i want the bodies dragged to the river and dumped in we cant let anything interfere with the water flow so lets use all the men who ran yesterday ill tell them they can redeem their honor by this task if they do it well well let them do the dirty work but well need soldiers and others to help maybe even horses and some carts if we prepare everything in advance we can probably clear the bodies in a few hours and maybe the barbarians wont try to interfere its a filthy job not even fit for slaves gatus replied with a laugh theyll think twice before they shirk their duties again ill get everything ready and go out with them esk kar thought it more likely that the sight of their leaders being executed yesterday might keep them better focused on their duties you prepare everything but ill watch them esk kar ordered you get some rest gatus opened his mouth to protest but esk kar held up his hand if i do it everyone will see how important it is and i can get a chance to stretch my legs ill promise a few coins for those who work the hardest he stood up and went to the well for more water carrying his empty water cup a servant was there bringing up water and a fresh bucket soon appeared cold from the depths men always forgot to drink enough water when they had the chance and then a long day in the heat would leave them weak from thirst a little after midmorning they opened the rear gate soldiers stood ready just in case a horde of barbarians had hidden at the rivers edge but nothing greeted them except the swirling sounds of the river in a steady stream nearly two hundred men and women slipped out leading a few horses and carrying ropes and planks everyone went quickly to their assigned locations and duties they didnt have far to go before they found the first corpses the hot sun and slippery mud made it hard work and the bodies of men and horses were already covered with flies that rose up in a cloud as they were disturbed many of the dead had loosed their bowels as they died adding the stink of human waste to the smells of blood and open flesh they saw marks on the bodies indicating that during the night many small animals had feasted well the men slogged through the mud dragging the bodies toward the far side of the ditch where other men tied ropes to the corpses feet then coaxed nervous and excitable horses to their dreary task as they shifted the bodies the smell of death rose fresh in the heated air the worst jobs went to those men whod fled their duty they had to wrestle the bodies from the mud to the edge of the embankment but yesterdays offenders werent enough to move all those dead by themselves soon almost everyone was in the mud all of them more fearful of being caught out in the open than worrying about the dirt and stench they started from the river gate working both sides of the walls it didnt take long to clear the rear and soon they began working on the sides but most of the dead lay in the front of the east wall and before long the barbarians saw the activity and sent horsemen to investigate they were a small party fewer then ten riders and they held their distance showing a newfound respect for the archers standing ready on the walls esk kar kept pace with the laborers shouting encouragement and laughing each time a man fell on his face or slipped backward on his ass he had led his horse down into the ditch walked it carefully across the muck then helped it scramble up at the other side now he could ride back and forth as needed keeping an eye on things and giving directions his four bodyguards followed on foot behind him no doubt cursing the heat and their captains idea of exercise mostly though he sat and watched letting the men know that he was there while nicar and others from the families directed the actual work esk kar heard his name called and looked up toward the wall trella waved at him surprised to find him on the far side of the ditch he waved back at her feeling like an apprentice on holiday before he rode slowly toward the front of the village at the southeast corner of the wall he stopped and watched his mens progress not that they looked much like men any longer rather they seemed to be made of mud themselves having fallen so many times esk kar looked east toward the barbarian party now less than a half mile away just out of long bowshot as he stared another twenty or so riders joined the first party they pointed their bows at him three of them rode toward him staying out of range and shouting challenges at him offering him a chance to fight them in single combat ignoring them esk kar turned his horse past the corner of the wall and rode toward the front gate his animal picking its way carefully around the bodies and the remains of the burnt carts the horse shied repeatedly at the corpses snorting and jerking its head as disturbed by the stink as any of the men esk kar kept his knees locked tight on the beasts ribs reaching the area in front of the main gate he surveyed the damage even though the gate was blackened by fire before the attack he could see where the flames of the alur meriki had done their mischief the cracks caused by the ram seemed large to him but if corio professed himself happy with the repairs then it must be satisfactory he had a big crew of men at work making sure that the ground beneath the gate stayed firm and cleared of obstacles a dozen ropes dangled from above should the men need to be pulled quickly back into the village the gate would not open until the alur meriki departed a shout from the wall made him turn and esk kar saw the barbarian party had swelled to more than sixty or seventy riders by now they realized he must be someone of importance probably by the way the villagers cheered and shouted as he passed them esk kar moved on walking the horse slowly toward the northeast corner inspecting the ditch and the wall trying to put himself in the mind of his enemies trying to guess their next point of attack when he reached the corner he saw that a dozen warriors had paralleled his course staying out of range but watching his movements his guards looked nervous fingering their swords and constantly watching the barbarians but the line of archers on the wall kept the enemy at bay esk kar knew the alur meriki must be sorely tempted to ride in close enough to launch a wave of arrows but they seemed unwilling to risk the danger especially since esk kar could easily ride away from them the villagers continued to clear the bodies and by noon they had worked their way around from both sides to reach the front by his order bodies not in the ditch would be left alone so plenty of stinking corpses would remain but esk kar wasnt willing to risk villagers or soldiers lives any further than the ditch turning the horse he came slowly down the north side splashing a little into the swamp letting himself feel the muds stickiness as the animal sank to its fetlocks in the man made marsh and had to struggle to free itself at the rear of the village the activity continued at full speed bodies arrived steadily and were untied from the animals men dragged the corpses down to the rivers edge where other laborers pushed them over the embankment then they used long poles to shove the dead out into the current in a few more moments the work would be done the river looked cool and inviting impulsively esk kar swung down from the horse and handed the halter to his guards im going to take a swim he announced as he unbuckled his sword and stripped off his tunic grinning at the nervousness in their eyes if anyone wants to join me come on in none of them moved and in a moment he dove in about fifty paces above where they were dumping the bodies here the water flowed fresh and clean and he soon felt refreshed and cooled he refused to think about those who would be drinking the water downstream for the next few days esk kar swam for only a minute or two just enough to feel clean before he climbed out after drying his body with his tunic he took the horse by the halter and guided the animal slowly down into the ditch and then through the mud until he and his guards had reached safety back across the ditch he stopped outside the gate and watched as the villagers shoved the last of the bodies into the river with the filthy job finished villagers and soldiers followed esk kars example jumping into the river laughing as they washed off the dirt and blood and splashing water on each other they looked cheerful their task done the last work crew continued their task almost completed as well more than eighty villagers mostly women and old men wielded rakes planks and shovels to rake the mud as level as possible wielding their implements they smoothed the mud and filled in any holes another backbreaking task but one that needed to be done properly to insure the even fl ow of water a boy came over to take his horse back to the stable but esk kar waited at the rear gate watching until everyone finished their work and the last man and woman passed back inside the guards pushed the gate closed then barred it as the men passed by esk kar spoke to them thanking them for their work that had been trellas idea to make sure the villagers knew theyd been forgiven and to let everyone know he appreciated their efforts those disgraced by their cowardice now felt absolved and he no longer saw any sullen or dejected looks on their faces though hed seen plenty of both this morning when he ordered them into the ditch he felt surprised though at the looks they gave him in return they had pride again and seemed glad he had noticed their work and thought it important enough to join them outside the wall walking back home he found trella upstairs helping annok sur change bantors bandages bantor looked even better than he had this morning though esk kar knew there was an even chance the man would die sometimes wounded men no matter how strong physically would suddenly take a turn for the worse and die even after they seemed to be recovering bantors eyes held many questions so esk kar sat down and described what had happened though his subcommander had probably already heard most of it from annok sur they dined that night outside in the courtyard at the same table where the mornings meetings occurred gatus jalen totomes corio nicar and trella sat at the big table joined by two of the hawk clan alexar would take over the duties of maldar and grond who had been recommended for promotion by gatus alexar a small man with a thin wiry body claimed to have been a thief before he joined the soldiers grond was his opposite tall just a shade under esk kars height but broader in the shoulders gronds back showed marks from the lash according to gatus grond had been a slave in the distant lands to the west but had escaped and found his way to orak both men served under gatus in the fight across the river after dinner everyone sipped their wine relaxing a little esk kar brought up the ideas hed considered during the day though we hurt them badly yesterday the barbarians will be back he began and this time theyll be better prepared theyve lost many men and cannot afford to do so again theyve attacked the wall twice now with no success so i think theyll hurl the next assault at the gate theyll use more fire and find ways to protect their men while they attack he paused to give anyone a chance to speak up but no one did that kind of attack will take them many days to prepare so they may try something else first maybe a night attack he paused but nobody spoke that silence had become more frequent after each victory his words were received with more and more importance now anything he said was taken almost as if coming from the gods and lately he had to prompt them for their ideas and opinions gatus keep the wall manned each night with men every twenty paces i want them awake and alert keep the watches short so they dont get sleepy and make sure they know the punishment for not being alert during the day ensure they get plenty of sleep and that they are not awake gambling or wasting time with their women at least he didnt have to worry much about them getting drunk wine and ale were in short supply and the price of what little remained had gone up sharply the meeting ended and everyone went their way in bed esk kar took trella in his arms and held her close the next few days will be hard ones trella i worry more now than i did before the first attacks then i felt certain we could surprise them but after two attacks they know how strong we are and theyll be wary and cunning and theyre angry filled with revenge for those we have killed perhaps theyll give up even if they could take the village they know that they will lose many more men thats what everyone would like to believe but warriors dont like to be beaten theyll fi ght harder if anything theyd be shamed in front of their women if they just slunk away then there is nothing we can do but defeat them when they come ten days slipped by each morning as dawn broke the men on the wall searched the plain before them saw nothing and breathed a sigh of relief today would not be the day bands of warriors occasionally rode about but little could be seen with most of the encampment behind the hills the less activity they showed the more eskkar worried almost every night brought some new threat for the barbarians the night gave them an easy opportunity to keep the villagers off guard using the cover of darkness men would slip up to the wall fire a few arrows at the sentries then disappear sentries covered themselves with leather but men still fell dead or wounded by the time soldiers hoisted torches over the wall the attackers were gone and seldom did the soldiers have a target besides the cost in men the antics kept everyone on edge and losing sleep tonight esk kar had little to say to trella hed held her until she fell asleep then rolled onto his back wide awake thinking about the besiegers if he had enough men at their rear even a hundred would do he could attack the enemy and disrupt the camp burn their wagons scatter the horses but he was not in their rear he was trapped inside orak with no way to get out meanwhile the barbarians continued with their preparations the thought made him uneasy so he got out of bed pulling a tunic over his body and slipping out of the bedroom moving silently he descended to the main floor then out into the courtyard a torch burned there at all times and the guards walked by alert even at the end of a long day esk kar nodded at those manning the command table but walked toward the rear of the house he sat on the bench facing the trees where natram zar had been tortured already that time seemed long in the past a mere trifle hardly worth considering one pleasant memory remained however a few feet from the base of the tree where it came closest to the wall caldors head had been buried deep in the earth both young drigo and caldor had insulted trella and both were dead a fact all in orak knew well caldor had even put his hands on trellas body but that would never happen again no man would ever touch her and live esk kar returned his thoughts to the alur meriki he stared into the darkness wondering what they would do next he needed a spy he decided someone who knew their councils if only he had a way to visit their camp spend a day or two there observing and listening but no one could get out of orak the attackers had sealed up the village too well a shadow moved on the ground he looked up and found trella in front of him a cloak wrapped around her body though the night air held little chill i thought you found it pleasant in our bed she said quietly or do you plan to sleep in the garden she sat down and leaned against him esk kar put his arm around her and inhaled the scent of her hair i couldnt sleep i started thinking about the barbarians wondering what theyre planning where theyll attack next you always seem to know what they think are their plans a mystery now yes theyve many clan leaders and right now theyre all thinking about the same thing they wonder about the best way to crack the nut orak has become how can they get past the ditch and the wall or through the gate so they can kill all of us and now they have a new problem how to do it without losing too many more warriors so they prepare themselves and when theyre ready theyll attack he sighed perhaps the gods will smile on us the gods have already smiled on us nobody can doubt that not even the priests why do you think theyve been so quiet these last few months they know youre touched by the gods the thought of the priests always brought a frown to his face in the past the quarreling priests and their demanding gods had caused trouble enough in orak though the danger from the alur meriki had quieted them down the less he had to do with them the better she rested her head on his shoulder the cloak coming loose she wore nothing beneath it he slipped his hand inside the garment and felt the heat from her body her breast felt soft and heavy in his hand esk kar settled back letting himself enjoy a moment of pleasure she relaxed under his touch closing her eyes then lifting her face to his its time for bed and this time ill make sure you go to sleep he smiled then pulled the cloak off her shoulders so he could gaze at her body in the faint light from the stars and the torches the longer he looked at her the stronger the urge became to take her right there in the garden the guards would hear the noise and come to investigate not that he cared about what they saw or thought then we should return to our chamber wife he pulled the cloak back around her and took her hand then walked her back into the house nodding at the guards whose smiles were tinged with envy at their fortunate commander wide awake now they returned to their bed esk kar forgot his worries and made love to his wife a task that took considerable time as each seemed to hunger for the other trella seemed on fire her own urges demanding satisfaction even after the passion overcame her it only whetted her appetite for him and it was a long time before they lay exhausted in each others arms sweat soaked the bedding a mess of twisted blankets neither of them knew or cared that the shaking and half muffled cries had awakened half the household and brought smiles to the guards who paced the courtyard below when theyd finished esk kar held her close before he fell into a deep sleep the alarm drum roused him instantly the rapid beating telling him an attack was in progress even before the soldiers shouts penetrated his consciousness esk kar jumped to his feet pulling on his undergarment and grabbing his sword before trella was fully awake he raced barefoot down the stairs following the reserve soldiers as they ran down the street to the north wall as he ran his fear increased since they headed toward the site that he had deemed most suitable for a night attack esk kar heard the clash of swords but by the time he reached the wall the fighting had ended down captain someone shouted even as an arrow hissed by his head cursing under his breath and bent double esk kar scuttled swiftly along the wall until he found jalen his subcommander had everything under control villagers shoved torches attached to poles out over the ditch giving the crouched archers some targets as usual the nighttime attack initially favored the enemy who could put their archers in place in the darkness while the defenders would be outlined against the wall and lighted from behind barbarian arrows had killed at least two men as eskkar saw by the bodies lying below the parapet but by this time the parapet held at least forty archers and volleys of arrows flew into the darkness gradually the shafts from the attackers came less frequently more torches added their light but little now remained to be seen jalen finally had time to report a guard heard them splashing in the ditch and gave the alarm their arrows drove us down and they tried to climb the wall stones soon put a stop to that and three who reached the top were killed he looked around for a moment this was a real assault not just a raid i saw at least a hundred men out there did they attack anywhere else i dont know gatus was at the command table and i heard only one alarm can you hold here yes weve plenty of stones and the men are wide awake now ill go check with gatus esk kar gripped his subcommanders shoulder for a moment then swung down from the parapet he dropped lightly to the ground below and raced back to the command house now lit more brightly than when he had left it he found gatus speaking to several soldiers all looking tense but displaying no signs of panic gatus answered his question before he could even ask it no other attacks captain only on the north wall does jalen have everything he needs so the reports had come in smoothly to the command table esk kar could have stayed here and learned just as much without his mad dash well next time hed know better and keep his head yes but keep the messengers busy gatus stared at him and esk kar realized hed given another unnecessary order maybe i should have stayed in bed he decided since gatus had everything under control ill take a horse and check the walls myself gatus at least that would give him something to do he found a horse and swung onto its back in his rush to the attack site esk kar had forgotten that by his own order a horse was always kept ready for his use instead he had followed the running men curses flowed steadily under his breath as he jerked the horses head harder than necessary and began to canter toward the rear gate someday he swore if he lived long enough he would learn to think before acting he made the circuit of the walls not once but twice taking his time and speaking to the men urging them to keep silent and to listen for the sounds of men on the move three hours later he returned home to try and get some sleep before dawn in their bedroom esk kar hung up his sword then sank onto the bed as reaction to the long night began to set in trella lay down next to him and took his hand at that moment a hard knocking came from the outer door lady trella captain please open the door they heard annok surs voice esk kar pushed himself up off the bed knowing something important had occurred or they wouldnt have troubled him trella reached the door first and unbolted it to find annok sur standing there jalen sends word for you to come a slave boy escaped from the enemy camp seated at the big table in his workroom esk kar waited for the strange boy to finish his meal simcar claimed to have twelve seasons but his stick thin body looked younger trella and annok sur had insisted on cleaning the boy up first when trella escorted him to the workroom esk kar gatus and sisuthros waited eager to learn what the boy could tell them but then trella had insisted the boy first eat his fill so the three tired soldiers who had no sleep that night watched simcar eat and drink eskkar had to admit the boy looked as if he hadnt enjoyed a real meal in months finally the eating slowed and at last stopped now simcar tell us who you are and what youve seen trella began encouragingly reaching over and wiping the boys mouth with a bit of rag then taking his hand and holding it take your time and tell us everything simcars eyes widened nervous under the gaze of the men at first he had trouble speaking his voice high and uncertain but under trellas smiles he gradually gained confidence three months ago the alur meriki raided my fathers farm we lived in the lands to the north they killed my older brother but they wanted us for slaves they beat all of us and we had to work very hard just to get something to eat did you learn their language simcar trella smiled at the boy oh yes we had to learn fast they beat us every time we didnt understand my mother helped me as long as she could what happened to your family they killed my father a few weeks ago he did something bad im not sure what my mother is a slave to one of their clan leaders i dont know what happened to my sister esk kar saw moisture in the boys eyes but pretended not to notice im sorry for your family trella patted his shoulder what made you run away from them my mother told me she said i had to try to escape to orak shed heard the stories about the fighting and said this was my best chance i didnt want to leave her but simcars voice choked and he stopped for a moment she told me to sneak across the plain if the night attack failed that they wouldnt be looking for anyone trying to get into orak youre safe now simcar trella said reassuringly your mother was right to send you here but we need to ask you some questions were trying to find out what attacks the alur meriki have planned can you help us esk kar and the others leaned closer each of them with a dozen questions but theyd agreed to let trella guide the boy through his story eskkar forced himself to smile to conceal his impatience you were very brave to slip through their lines simcar go on the boy brightened at the compliment and trella began her questions what were the other boys like were there many women in the camp was there enough food for all the boys how did the animals look well fed or lean was water in plentiful supply how about firewood what did you eat each day what did the other boys say about orak how did the warriors look were they angry or patient did you see any clan chiefs what were they like did you hear anyone speak about them in anger where were the horses how many were there were there many guards did the warriors quarrel among themselves over what with each question simcars replies grew longer and more detailed as if he were proud of the fact hed noticed all the things trella inquired about esk kar kept the smile fixed on his face and by now gatus and sisuthros had taken the hint and nodded encouragement to the boy as well masking their eagerness as best they could esk kar saw gatus biting his lip and sisuthross hand gripping the edge of the table but trella chatted away keeping her tone light and her questions short stopping once to ask if simcar wanted more food or water gradually the picture unfolded and esk kar realized he was seeing the alur meriki encampment through the boys eyes the large central camp fl anked by two smaller ones the herds of horses pastured up against the river another smaller herd kept to the south though the grass was poorer therethe lands closest to the river had already started to see some regrowth after the burning the wagons and carts moving to and fro changing owners as men died in the fighting and their wives and possessions were taken or traded to the remaining warriors the path the women and girls took to get water from the river from the boys story esk kar visualized the line of sentries hidden beyond the low hills that overlooked the approaches to and from the village a band of forty or fifty warriors waited behind the sentries in constant readiness to prevent anyone from trying to enter or leave the village or to repel any sorties from the gate esk kar could almost hear the women weeping late into the night and the sullen looks of the boys whose fathers had been killed as simcar went on esk kar pictured the warriors angry faces as they strode about the camp unable to attack the village yet with no other target for their rage within fifty miles fighting men forced to remain in idleness with too much time on their hands and not even the usual activity of the days march to occupy them naturally they would take to drinking and quarreling when the sun went down simcar had been talking for some time and trellas questions became more direct as she and the boy grew comfortable with each other so simcar did you hear of any plans the alur meriki have to attack orak the question seemed casual but esk kar found himself leaning forward a little more yes lady trella six nights ago their leader thutmose sin met with the council and i decided to go listen to them talk about the battle by now the words flowed easily from his lips i crept up to the campfires and found a place where i and some other boys could watch and listen we heard them plan how they would attack orak at night under the table esk kars hand knotted into a fist again and he had to force himself to relax it if the boy had heard their plans and no one chased you away trella poured more water into simcars cup simcar took several large swallows before replying no the guards didnt care and there were many others even closer so i went again last night after the battle the chiefs met again along with many of the warriors there was much shouting and pushing and thutmose sin raised his voice many times the guards didnt even notice us this time there were so many warriors there they wanted to listen too i could only hear them when they raised their voices but they did that a lot trella patted his shoulder tell us what you heard start from the beginning well thutmose sin began talking about why the night attack did not succeed he blamed one of the other chiefs for the failure simcar had to stop to think of the right word said it was something hed told them wouldnt work he was very angry that they had been defeated there was more shouting and cursing some raised their fists against thutmose sin others said the alur meriki should move on that there was little to gain here even if the fire attack is successful whats the fire attack simcar trella asked unconcernedly picking at some threads on her dress merely another in the long list of questions is that something special that they have planned oh yes they have loaded a great number of carts all piled high with wood and logs and anything that will burn enough to burn the whole village down my master says theyll place the carts against the gate and set fire to it until the gate is burned away theyve been collecting wood from the countryside for more than a week soaking it in the black oil or drying it in the sun what else did they say about the fire attack trellas voice remained soothing as if this topic were no more important than questions about the camps food well nothing more thutmose sin said the fire attack would succeed that the other attacks had just wasted time and men they argued about it for a long time and then everyone just left and went back to their tents so thutmose sin remained the great chief esk kar thought all these months and they hadnt even been sure who led the alur meriki but now thutmose sins time was running out the sarrum argued openly with his chiefs and nothing less than a quick victory would save him hed failed to capture orak so he would be doubly dangerous as desperation forced his hand do you know when they will come with the fire wagons or how trella went on once again she held simcars hand and smiled at him oh yes lady trella it will be soon i heard all about it from my friend all the camp knew of the plans theyll use great wooden shields to protect them from the archers then theyll heap the dry timber against the gate theyll fire the wood and keep adding more until the gate is destroyed then they will cross the ditch and attack through the gate trella questioned the boy for another few moments but eventually she sat back and looked at esk kar well simcar you were very brave now i think esk kar would like to ask you a few things do you need to rest first the boy shook his head by now esk kar had only two questions simcar he began keeping his voice calm where is this great pile of wood and carts and do you know if they keep a guard on it yes lord the wood is stored behind the rise to the south my mother and i tried to get close once but the guards there threw stones and chased us off they knew we wanted to steal firewood theres always a guard there otherwise women would take all the wood and use it for the campfires i think he paused to remember i think there were three or four men guarding it gatus and sisuthros had other questions but they learned little more after a while trella suggested they let simcar get some rest she escorted the boy to the door and turned him over to annok sur before returning to the table best to let him sleep for a few hours then we can go over his story again he may remember something else of importance trella leaned back in her chair and looked at the three men well we knew they were coming soon gatus said shifting in his seat and twisting his shoulders theyd scarcely moved for nearly an hour not wanting to disturb the boys tale sisuthros poured water for all of them and we know how and where esk kar finished this time there will be nothing held back thutmose sin must win or lose control too many men have died the other chiefs will try to kill him the moment the attack fails even his own clan wont be able to protect him we can strengthen the gate sisuthros suggested in a whisper his words still coming with difficulty aye we can do that well enough gatus agreed well need a lot more water at the gate for one thing but he didnt sound confident and all three men knew water alone wasnt going to stop the burning i thought if we knew their plans esk kar said we might do something raid the camp stampede the horses anything but all that isnt important now and wouldnt even delay their attack and we cant get to the store of wood its too far from the walls and wed have to get past both their sentries and the armed party by the time we fought our way through the whole camp would be roused it would take too long to start fires and burn the wood anyway gatus agreed and if you took enough men to do the task theyd hear you coming just as we heard them no one said anything trella stood and went to the cabinet she withdrew a map of orak and its surroundings a copy of the one corio had shown them months ago she unrolled it across the table and smoothed the surface with care can you show me where the wood is stored she asked as the men instinctively moved closer sisuthros sat on the tables edge and leaned over gatuss shoulder gatus picked up the wooden pointing stick rolled up inside the papyrus here if the boy is right this must be where the wood is being collected these hills are high enough to keep us from seeing whats behind them they couldve been moving anything there for days without our noticing esk kar stared at the map the site was too far from oraks walls a mile at least and well to the south even if a raiding party got there none would ever return alive even at night and where do they keep the horses trella continued i couldnt follow what simcar said about the river gatus moved the pointer here we can even see one herd from the walls esk kar took the pointer from gatuss hand if i were in charge with that many horses there would be at least three herds each a few hundred paces apart with rope corrals to keep them separate and hold them in against the river that makes sense gatus said the curve of the river and the rise of the ground would make that the easiest way to control big herds like that he looked at esk kar how many in each herd three or four hundred esk kar closed his eyes and tried to visualize the land hed seen it often enough even ridden along it once or twice during the last preparations for the siege opening his eyes and pointing to the land closest to orak id put the largest herd here probably close to four hundred horses then about three hundred each in the other two places he looked up at trella and saw that she continued to stare at the map it would be good to set fire to the wood theyve prepared isnt that right trella asked her eyes directly on esk kar if we could destroy it then they might not be able to attack yes that would set them back considerably maybe even stop the fire attack or at least weaken it theyve stripped the land bare for lumber and there cant be much more left out there even if they could find and bring it here but you cant raid the wood store because its too far she pointed to the place where they guessed the main herd was kept but you could raid the horses could you not i mean in the place closest to us what would you do there esk kar didnt answer because he caught the glimmer of her idea and began to think it through shifting in his chair he began to think aloud we could move a small party out at night either slip them by the sentries or kill them silently then we could stampede the horses and drive as many of them as we could into the river the current is swift there and many would drown while others would be swept downstream the whole camp would be in an uproar and every warrior would rush to the river to see to his horses then he moved the pointer back to the location of the wood during the confusion we could slip another party through the lines to this place and we could burn the wagons sisuthros let out a sound that could have been a laugh if his wound werent so painful and gatus swore softly before answering attacking their horses would draw every man to the river id bet my life on it we could slip in burn the carts and race back to the walls but it would take time to fire the wagons what about the men who attack the horses trella asked could they get back to orak no theyd be trapped there gatus answered soberly once the horses began to stampede the riders who guard the approaches to orak would cut them off silence followed his words still it would be worth it even if we lost the men as esk kar says if we burn the wood then we can weaken the attack even if we cant prevent it his eyes turned to eskkar as did trellas and sisuthross their captain remained lost in thought his eyes focused on the map nobody wanted to interrupt him he tapped on the location of the horses with his finger forgetting corios admonishment about touching the papyrus perhaps theres a way to get the men back after all he looked up and found them all staring at him the carts and wood must be destroyed esk kar said softly even if we have to chance losing men but i think it can be managed he turned to gatus get the other leaders here even bantor we have much to plan if were to attack tonight tonight by the gods weve hardly finished one battle and youre planning another tonight it must be tonight if we let another day go by they may launch their own attack he smiled at trella and took her hand as always you give us good ideas wife and i think well add simcar to our household from now on just in case the gods are slow in their duty to send us a son esk kar awoke to the smell and feel of trellas hair on his cheek and the brush of her lips against his for a moment he just lay there soothed by her touch as he awoke then he glanced at the window the full darkness of evening covered the sky he sat up in the bed words of anger coming to his lips be easy husband theres plenty of time gatus told me to make sure you got some rest before you go trella lowered her voice if you still insist you must go theyd argued about that most of the morning gatus and trella remonstrated against esk kars going no one wanted him dead out there in the countryside putting the village into panic esk kar insisted determined to lead the raid in truth he didnt trust anyone else sisuthros and bantor were wounded and gatus couldnt move fast enough at his age that left only jalen and his blood flowed too hot for such a mission esk kar spoke the language which might be critical in the end everyone had finally given way that decided he and his commanders spent the rest of the day planning the details they selected men to raid the horses choosing eight men for the task all experienced liverymen who knew how to handle horses and more important how to stampede them jalen would lead them a simple raid well suited to his abilities esk kar reviewed the preparations then turned the details over to jalen finding volunteers for the fire carts took less time when the soldiers learned esk kar would lead that party dozens offered to go despite the risk for this he needed only levelheaded men who could follow orders and strong enough to carry what theyd need he and gatus selected six men talking with them individually and making sure each had the right temperament and would follow orders esk kar finally took some rest just before sundown at trellas and gatuss insistence by then even esk kar felt tired enough that he agreed to rest for an hour instead trella let him sleep more than three hours by the time hed dressed and eaten only two hours remained before midnight the time set for both parties to depart actually there would be three parties the third consisted of a small team of archers all good hunters and trackers men who could move quietly through the darkness theyd slip out first and eliminate any enemy sentries in their path before esk kar left the house trella pressed herself against him with such force that he nearly lost his balance her words breathed against his cheek dont take any foolish chances come back to me esk kar at the river gate esk kar assembled his men wondering what the next few hours would bring the guards had removed most of the braces that secured the gate and now they eased open the heavy frame its hinges moistened earlier with oil and water to muffle any sound twenty six men slipped out in single file and moved as silently as possible across the ditch as soon as the last man passed the gate the sentries closed it behind them across the ditch the two raiding parties stopped and knelt in the darkness while they waited for the archers to remove the enemy sentries led by a hunter named myandro they disappeared into darkness their bows wrapped in cloth to lessen any noise all had hunted wild game in the hills and knew how to move with care nearly an hour passed before myandro returned slipping up to eskkars side so quietly that he jumped in surprise captain the sentries are dead myandro whispered there were only three as far as the first line of hills youll have a few hours before any come to relieve them but go quickly ill send jalen out as soon as you are gone esk kar grasped the mans shoulder good work myandro jalen and his men had a much shorter distance to travel and would move faster since they carried no heavy loads esk kar turned to grond his second in command for this mission and kept his voice low the way is clear come esk kar waited while grond passed the word down the line making sure every man understood the order then esk kar stood up slowly letting any stiffness in his muscles stretch their way loose he carefully picked up the two clay pots bound in thick cloth for protection and linked by a rope that he slung around his neck allowing him to carry a pot under each arm his sword already hung down his back leaving nothing that might bang against a pot and make a sound or worse break the container the burden was heavy and he heard the muffled breathing of the men as they shouldered their loads only grond seemed unaffected by the weight myandro took the lead in single file esk kar and his men followed traversing the north side of the village stepping with care to make sure they didnt trip over some obstacle fall into the ditch or splash into a pool of swamp water that caution slowed them down and it took some time before they passed the point where the wall turned to face the east grateful to be away from the ditch and the flooded lands they traveled now in the open exposed to any close scrutiny gradually they turned south and began the long walk across the face of the main wall moving farther away from orak with each step at first myandro stayed with them leading them at a steady pace then he vanished into the darkness ahead to make sure the way remained clear at last they reached the first of the low hills nearly opposite the main gate but more than a mile away myandro reappeared at esk kars side placing his hand on his captains chest to stop the column esk kar sank to his knees grateful for the chance to remove the millstone from his neck even for a moment between the weight of the pots and the coarse rope the flesh already felt raw his men welcomed the respite the need for complete silence and the effort to ensure that no misstep caused a stumble had stretched every muscle and esk kar felt the strain in his body they waited as myandro and two of his men slipped ahead through the darkness looking up at the stars esk kar guessed that not quite two hours had passed since they left orak it wouldve been shorter to leave by the main gate but that meant more sentries to get past as the alur meriki watched the main gate more closely myandro reappeared ghostlike putting his face directly to esk kars ear the barbarian troop is just over this hill and about a hundred paces away most are sleeping and they only posted a few guards a sentry is there supposedly watching the village though he spends more time looking at the campfires they suspect nothing but theyre between us and the wagons so we must wait here esk kar repeated the message to grond who would whisper it to each man esk kar turned back to myandro jalen should have attacked by now it grows late myandro checked the progress of the moon before answering wed have heard something if he were seen or captured ill go back on watch more can be seen and heard from the hilltop keep close against the side of the hill and make sure nobody makes a sound again he vanished leaving esk kar envious of his ability to move so quietly but the idea of the sentry made him nervous and esk kar moved down the line of men whispering to each and making sure every man hugged the hillside as much as possible more time passed as the moon seemed to race across the sky when the moment came they felt it in the ground before they heard the noise the rumble of hundreds of pounding hooves the horses over the hilltop heard it as well and a few began to whinny nervously the first sounds theyd made esk kar pictured the raid in his mind jalen would have gotten his men into position and built a tiny fire each man would light the thick oil soaked bundle of rags already fastened to the ends of the ropes whirling the ropes overhead would create a big flaming circle that would frighten any horse let alone a herd suddenly awakened to see eight circles of fire rushing toward them the horses would bolt from the sight and with luck directly into the river if jalen positioned his men properly other noises came to esk kar horses screaming the distant alarms of men and above everything the thunder of hooves in the night behind the hill men shouted and cursed warriors suddenly jerked awake fumbling for their swords scrambling for their horses damning the darkness and whatever unknown disaster had struck the herd each warrior probably had a mount or two in that band and all would be keen to learn what had happened myandro loomed up out of the darkness above them down and dont look up esk kar and his men froze into the earth hardly breathing all of them pressing against the hill he heard horses climbing the other side at first esk kar thought theyd been discovered but realized that someone likely the leader and a few others had ascended the hill to see whether orak showed any activity when the horses stopped moving esk kar glimpsed three or four horsemen not forty paces above their heads and as many to their left looking over the empty plain to the village walls if any of them looked down toward the base of the hill but the riders searched toward the village where nothing moved at the base of the hill deep shadows covered the motionless men esk kar heard the horses snort and one of them neighed the animals had probably picked up the scent of men beneath them the warriors however ignored those small signs certain the animals were spooked by the stampede at last the alur meriki leader shouted an order and the horses turned about and started back down the hillside as they did so the whole band burst into a gallop riding off toward the north esk kar remained rooted in place waiting while myandro climbed up the hill looking for any guards left behind if any remained theyd have to be killed time again dragged by before myandro called to them from above instantly esk kar and his men grabbed their pots and began climbing up the face of the hill cursing silently the clumsy weights around their necks that unbalanced them and made them slip and stumble at the crest they found myandro and one of his men hugging the ground so no silhouette would show against the faint moonlight esk kar could see the main encampment about half a mile away only a few scattered fi res glowed in the darkness but more were lit each moment as the camp roused itself to learn what had stampeded their horses there captain myandro gestured with his bow to the east see that small fire there thats where the carts are he pointed to a tiny fire about six hundred paces from where they stood shall we go with you esk kar hesitated a moment but realized a few more men wouldnt help no stay with the plan remain here and cover our retreat if you can if not save yourself the man nodded not bothering to tell esk kar that gatus had ordered him specifically not to return without the captain of the guard then hurry before they return and block the way and there may be guards of course there would be guards wide awake ones at that based on the sounds coming from the north moving as quietly as possible esk kars men descended the back side of the hill still moving south so they could approach the outpost from the rear hoping to find the guards focused on the confusion in the north they hadnt far to travel now and they moved at a faster pace helped by their brief rest when he reached his position esk kar gave the order to halt he dropped to one knee to let his burden slip carefully to the ground then pulled the rope over his head another movement freed the sword strapped to his back and he buckled it around his waist he carried no other weapon esk kar chose two men to come with him one carried a short bow and six arrows the standard weapon of the barbarians an item now in plentiful supply taken from dead warriors the other man carried two knives the three men walked openly toward the campfire the first cart loomed in his path and esk kar stumbled over the tongue hidden in the darkness at his feet up ahead just past the small fire he spotted two men facing north away from him esk kar turned to the man with the bow stay here in case there are more guards he whispered well take care of those two come tellar he ordered the other man and give me one of those knives tellar could handle a knife better than most one of the reasons for bringing him he handed esk kar one of his daggers and esk kar held it concealed against his arm he walked straight toward the guards making no effort to keep quiet nevertheless they closed within thirty paces and hadnt been noticed so esk kar pretended to slip and swore loudly the guards turned at the sound hands on their swords as they saw two men weaving toward them who are you the smaller of the two snapped out rest easy friend esk kar replied in the barbarian language slurring his words as if intoxicated he kept walking slowly forward grateful to the ur nammu for all the recent language practice we were drinking out in the plain when we heard the noise whats going on he let his words tail off and moved sideways a little as if he were fi nding it diffi cult to walk a straight line the taller guard spoke up apparently eager to talk something must have stampeded the horses maybe the dirt eaters no how could they do that esk kar stopped a few steps from the men and turned to his companion did you hear that someones after our horses when he turned back the knife flashed in his hand and he leapt at the smaller more alert guard shoving his dagger into the mans stomach before he could clear his sword at the same instant tellar fl ung himself on the other and dragged him down to the ground where they wrestled a moment before tellar arose bloody knife in one hand and the mans sword in the other esk kar wasted no time with the bodies he climbed up the nearest cart to look around but saw nothing no more guards not even horses just more torches and fires being lit in the main encampment tellar get grond and the men we dont have much time grond appeared out of the darkness almost instantly carrying eskkars burden as well as his own without apparent effort esk kar found time to grin at the mans strength push as many carts together as you can tellar unseal the jars the wrapped pots contained the heavy black oil that burned for hours the contents of one jar should be enough to turn any two carts into a pyre of flame within moments tellars sharp knives easily cut through the ropes and leather sealing the pots esk kar left his men to their task as he walked over to inspect a different pile of wood long planks had been nailed together perhaps to form shields for fi ve or ten men at a time the barbarians had planned for their fire attack well they could use these great shields to protect them from arrows and stones as they piled the wood and carts against oraks gate esk kar didnt know whether he could do anything about them as it would take at least four men to lift one and they had no tools to break them apart perhaps they could drag some of them against the burning carts two carts squealed loudly when the men pushed them together within moments six carts were practically touching already two men had climbed atop them and started pouring oil over the contents the men moved fast carrying the oil pouring it then moving to the next cart in moments theyd emptied the pots the guards campfire came in handy now as they tossed burning brands onto the carts the oil soaked wood caught fire at once and the flames began to grow grond help me with these shields men rushed over and four of them picked up the first shield and leaned it up against the nearest cart before running back for another by now at least twenty eight fires had been set emptying the fourteen jars theyd carried with such care the dark of night erupted into a wall of flames esk kar and grond ignored the waves of heat against their fl esh they carried the huge shields to their destruction placing them against whatever burning cart was closest ten twenty esk kar lost count of how many theyd dragged to the fires though his arms ached from the effort captain theyve seen the fires theyre coming tellar shouted to be heard over the crackling flames we have to go now the fire roar grew deafening as more dry wood burst into hot flames that shot up into the night sky esk kar glanced at grond who nodded help me with this last shield grond the other men joined them to heave one of the most massive shields into position get moving esk kar ordered gasping for breath against the heat of the fire his men already melting into the darkness eager to return to safety warriors near the main camp had spotted the flames men came on the run but so far none on horseback any warrior with a horse nearby would have headed straight for the river anxious to recover his mounts esk kar started back toward the village when three warriors burst into the firelight and charged at him he started to run saw theyd quickly overtake him and turned pulling his sword from its sheath as they fl ung themselves at him thutmose sin woke with a start feeling the ground trembling beneath him for a moment he thought it might be an earthshaker but he recognized the sound of many horses on the move the two wives hed chosen for that night called out in fear but he ignored their questions men shouted outside his tent and by the time the first guard pushed open the tent flap thutmose sin had arisen and buckled his sword around him sarrum the breathless warrior gasped out the horses have stampeded they all what caused it do you know anything might set horses moving a strange scent a strong breeze even a clumsy nightrider no sarrum not yet find out he ordered stepping outside his tent thutmose sin looked up at the stars still a few hours before sunrise all the fires had burned out except for a few scattered watch fires that still glowed on the outskirts of the camp around him warriors milled about in confusion everyone had horses in the herd those whod kept mounts nearby soon galloped off toward the river a young warrior approached leading thutmose sins horse he swung up onto the animal then rode off toward a nearby hilltop his guards scrambling along on foot behind him when he reached the small rise he looked first toward the village everything there seemed quiet so he turned his attention to the river he couldnt see the horses but a few torches danced about all moving toward the waters edge a rider galloped up calling out thutmose sins name in a moment the horseman had raced his horse up the hilltop sarrum the dirt eaters stampeded the horses the man had to pause for a moment they waved fire at them drove many into the tigris did you capture them no not yet sarrum the horses blocked the way but the patrol moved to cut them off so theyre trapped along the riverbank thutmose sin again looked toward the village still no sign of activity he shifted his gaze toward the south but saw nothing just the watch fires reassured he decided to ride toward the commotion then he noticed the fires farthest away where the carts and wood for the assault had been gathered the watch fi res there burned brighter too bright for a campfire he realized and there should only be one campfire not even as he stared he saw new fires come into existence their fl ickering fl ames rising ever higher get men back from the river send them to where were holding the carts the dirt eaters are raiding the carts bring men cut them off he looked about him only a dozen or so of his guards remained the rest had gone to the river to see to their horses follow me hurry before they burn everything they broke into a run down the hillside he followed more slowly letting the horse pick its way down the slope by the time he reached the bottom his men had outdistanced him stringing out in a ragged line and shouting for more men to join them thutmose sin put the horse to a canter as fast a pace as he could coax from the animal in the darkness he soon began to pass his men fire from the burning wagons now illuminated the night and he saw that more than a dozen wagons were covered in flames he urged the horse faster for a moment the animal responded then it shied away from the approaching flames stiffened its legs slid to a halt and refused to move swearing at the frightened beast thutmose sin leapt down and ran after his men darker shadows moved before the flames and he could see men shoving wood against the burning wagons stop them he shouted drawing his sword the sound of swords clashing told him men fought just ahead of him by now the fires had gown so bright he could see the dirt eaters working frantically trying to burn the carts and wood his warriors had so laboriously collected one of his men cried out then stumbled and fell clutching at the arrow in his arm damn these accursed village archers just ahead of him he saw another of his men cut down this time by a tall warrior with a long sword ignoring an arrow that hissed by his head thutmose sin raised his sword and rushed at the warrior esk kar met the first warrior with a savage sweep of his arm knocking the mans blade aside and thrusting into his attackers chest before he could recover the second warrior little more than a boy swung his blade at esk kars head expecting to catch him before he could free his sword from the first mans body but esk kar ducked and shoved his shoulder into the youth his sword coming free at the movement before the warrior could strike again esk kar swung the sword around with all the force he could muster the parry weak and off balance did little more than slow esk kars blade as it slashed into the base of the young mans neck the third warrior reached esk kar with a vicious overhand stroke and esk kar knew from the first contact he faced no gangling youth but a warrior in his prime with a powerful arm of his own esk kar parried a second blow and a third then a fourth but he had to give ground with each stroke the warrior kept pressing forward and esk kar couldnt mount a counterstroke as the vicious blows clanged against his weapon pushing him back into the firelight toward the heat of the flames esk kar saw an opening and thrust at the man the stroke stopping his adversarys advance and giving esk kar a chance to set his feet wielding the great sword he lunged and slashed at his opponent with half a dozen strokes before cutting deep into the mans sword arm the wounded man staggered back with a curse his sword slipping from his grasp eskkar swung his sword up for the killing blow but another half dozen alur meriki arrived shouting their war cries and he turned to face them before they could overwhelm esk kar tellar grond and two others reached their captains side forming a rough line to esk kars left esk kar barely had time to catch his breath before the first of these new warriors rushed in using his momentum to take a powerful cut at esk kars head he deflected the blow but felt the shock up his arm the impact slowed him down as the warriors momentum carried him into eskkars chest the two of them falling to the earth esk kar got his arm under the mans neck and heaved him away then scrambled to his feet fighting raged all around but for the moment no new alur meriki appeared the warrior esk kar had flung aside rolled twice and somehow regained his feet faster than esk kar thought possible and again the sword came at eskkars head shifted at the last moment and aimed at his shoulder esk kar blocked the blow and countered with a thrust that forced his opponent to twist his body to the side the movement swung the necklace the man wore and the firelight glowed against the polished copper medallion the medallion that proclaimed its bearer the alur merikis sarrum thutmose sin esk kar spat the words at the ruler of the clans then he had no time or breath for anything else the two leaders stood toe to toe neither man willing to back off too close to effectively use the long swords but each man making up for the lack of room by cutting and thrusting esk kars anger flared up this mans father had killed his family bloodlust overcame him and the sword slashed viciously at thutmose sins neck but the alur meriki ruler had honed his expertise since his youth with muscles hardened by hours on horseback and he blocked every stroke with skill that bespoke of years of practice stroke fell upon stroke and esk kars opponent moved effortlessly esk kars rage began to fade as he felt his arm growing weaker forcing himself to ignore the tiredness in his arm he lunged at his opponent the sarrum of the alur meriki pivoted as he brushed the point aside and countered with a stroke so fierce it drove esk kar back two steps the blows kept hammering at him giving him no time to counter esk kars arm began to tremble and he knew his opponent sensed it as well the man increased his efforts his mix of thrusts and cuts coming faster and faster never allowing esk kar time to recover esk kar felt fear rising up any moment now and a stroke would catch him off guard the heat raged at his back all enveloping now he retreated another step but a wagon wheel burned hot against his shoulder and he knew hed run out of room already esk kar had to use both hands to parry the endless blows that arrived with the force of a woodsman plying his axe grunting with confidence now thutmose sin swung his blade at eskkars head but at the last moment aimed at esk kars shoulder esk kars counter nearly came too late he barely managed to get his sword in front of his chest its tip bumping against the burning wagon the two blades met with a clang and a shower of sparks and then the unthinkable happened thutmose sins sword shattered against esk kars new blade the weapons failure caught the warrior by surprise for a single instant esk kar pushed forward ramming his hilt into thutmose sins head knocking him backward and off balance thutmose sins heel caught on a wood scrap and he fell flat on his back stunned his sword dropping from his hand gasping and with the last of his strength esk kar lowered his swords point and lurched toward his blood enemy ready to thrust the blade savagely into the fallen mans chest before he could avenge his family an explosion blew esk kar to the ground a wave of searing heat passing over him the wagon behind him pushed into the flames only moments earlier by esk kar and grond had contained more than just wood for shields unnoticed half a dozen jars of oil rested beneath the wood and the fire set by esk kars men had finally reached them the clay containing the oil had cracked from the heat adding a flood of fresh oil to the roaring inferno that turned the cart into something beyond his comprehension a blast of fire shot up into the night as burning pieces of the cart flew in every direction all fighting stopped in an instant the men knocked to their knees or flat on the ground forgetting their enemy to look in awe at the writhing flames climbing into the dark night sky no one had ever seen or heard anything like it before stunned by the blast esk kar felt grond helping him to his feet eskkar mouth sagging still clutched his sword a dozen paces away he saw thutmose sin being dragged to safety in the opposite direction the flames from the oil cart had collapsed from their height but the other fires raged on merging and growing ever hotter with the roar of the combustion increasing until esk kars thought his ears would burst tellar his sword gone and blood dripping from one arm flung his good arm around esk kars waist with grond carrying most of the burden they stumbled away from the firestorm another alur meriki appeared out of the darkness and raced at him his sword high esk kar still dazed and unable to react saw grond raise his weapon but suddenly the man tripped and fell nearly at esk kars feet an arrow protruded from the mans chest esk kar caught a glimpse of myandro notching another arrow at the far edge of the fire esk kar heard without comprehending the clash of other swords at the edge of the blaze his back felt scorched grond shouted something his blade reflecting fire and blood from the flames as the bodyguard pulled esk kar into a run at the same time two more of myandros archers arrived loosed their shafts then fell back with the rest of oraks men rushing into the darkness and leaving behind the angry shouts of the warriors esk kars head began to clear as he lurched along the cooler air away from the conflagration helped restore his strength he shoved tellar away as the weakness in his legs lessened but gronds grip stayed firm on his left arm esk kar staggered along trying to lengthen his steps they ran for their lives grond pulling esk kar along until his captain hit his stride moving as fast as they could over the uneven ground they had no breath for words as they reached the top of the hill esk kar pulled himself loose and stopped he took a quick glance behind him a fiery mass lit up the sky shouts from angry warriors mixed with the roar of flames that illuminated dozens of alur meriki who had reached the burning carts some tried to pull wagons and wood away from the inferno while others searched for the raiding party grond jerked hard on his captains arm and esk kar turned back to the darkness orak remained more than a mile away theyd covered barely half the distance when the fearful sound of hoofbeats gave their legs a fresh burst of energy the terrifying vision of what happened to men on foot caught from behind by mounted riders flashed into esk kars mind they raced on grond and esk kar slipping farther behind the others esk kars heart pounded in his chest and his legs trembled with exhaustion his breathing came raggedly two nights with little sleep and the hard fight took their toll grond moved behind him now his hand on his captains back urging him along oraks walls outlined against the moonlight were growing in size and the ditch couldnt be more than two hundred paces ahead when esk kar saw a line of men rising up in the darkness he slowed thinking the barbarians had gotten in front of them then he heard the welcome voice of gatus calling to them esk kar lowered his head and kept running ignoring the piercing pain in his chest at every breath they reached the line of soldiers passing between men who stood with bows drawn to the ear the moment they passed out of the line of fire gatus shouted loose twenty arrows whistled into the night esk kar stumbled and nearly fell but grond still at his side caught his arm the big man had remained behind him the whole time protecting his back when grond could easily have outrun him now he resumed his grip on esk kars arm and pulled his captain along behind them the archers sent two more flights of arrows into the approaching horsemen before they too turned and fled for the safety of oraks walls the rescuers soon caught up with esk kars weary party all reached the ditch together jumping down into the mud the loud slap of feet revealing their position a loud voice from the tower reminded the archers to shoot only at men on horseback the ditch became a horror in the dark and esk kar heard arrows whistling overhead men fell facedown in the muck cursing scrambling up only to pitch forward again as the treacherous footing and darkness slowed them down to little more than a crawl finally reaching the base of the wall esk kar leaned for a moment against it unable to see anything as the structure blocked out the feeble moonlight next to him grond swept his hands along the rough surface found a rope and wrapped it twice around his captain another instant to knot it and grond shouted to those on the rampart above esk kar ascended as if by magic his sword shoved tightly under his arm until hands seized his shoulders and pulled him into the safety of orak moments later grond arrived pulling himself up as soon as he saw his captain reach the top esk kar lay on the parapet trying to catch his breath arrows whistled overhead or plinked against the wall at least some of the barbarians had pursued them to the ditch oraks archers soon drove them back the flames from the burning carts rose over the low hill and provided enough light even at that distance to outline anyone on horseback by the time esk kar pulled himself to his feet and looked over the wall the last horsemen were riding back out of range heading toward the pyre of flaming carts the sight of the fire rising over the hill amazed esk kar in his whole life hed never seen such a burning flames thrust their way high into the night as if to set the heavens afire the enormous store of wood dried by the fierce sun and fired by the black oil produced a blaze impossible to put out or even approach the barbarians would probably save some carts and shields but at least half maybe more of their precious wood supply was being consumed the raid was worth it esk kar decided then caught himself better to see how many men had died before he started gloating a pretty sight isnt it captain gatuss words sounded calm enough gatus stood at his side mud covered from head to foot the comical sight made esk kar grinbefore he remembered to look at his own body gatus had been the last man pulled back up the wall grond stood there too as muddy as the others his teeth gleaming white in the moonlight all the men from the raid crowded around esk kar its a sight i owe to grond here he practically dragged me back to orak captain was tired from fighting three warriors by himself grond raised his voice so that all could hear he turned to attack them so the men could get away killed them all too the terror of the fight flashed into esk kars mind he couldnt stop a shudder from passing over him as he remembered thutmose sin whod driven him against the wagon wheel esk kar had faced danger often enough but never had the certainty of his death felt so close shaking off the chilling thought he heard the men telling of his deeds bragging about how strong their captain was if they only knew how fear had almost overpowered him how many men did we lose gatus and what about those who went for the horses gatus looked sheepish for a moment by the gods id forgotten about them he shouted for a body count but no one knew anything ill go and find out captain no stay here and keep watch until morning ill go see whats happened to jalen esk kar pushed men out of the way until he could descend the steps trella was waiting for him she clutched him fiercely for a moment but then he took her hand and they ran toward the rear of the village grond and the others followed all wanted to know what happened to the men who had provided the diversion anxious villagers crammed the streets wandering about wanting to know what had happened grond formed a wedge with a couple of men and simply pushed the crowd out of esk kars way it seemed to take forever before they reached the river gate the gate stood open archers stood ready bows in hand facing the opening now brightly lit from a line of torches that stretched to the rivers edge and even into the dark waters men lined the walls on each side of the gate esk kar heard shouting even a few cheers coming through the gates opening they pushed their way through the men and crossed the ditch grond seizing a torch to light their way as they reached the riverbank a soaking wet man staggered up to them and slipped to his knees exhausted from his battle with the river another appeared this one falling flat on the earth as he gasped for breath esk kar pushed past both of them and stopped at the jetty the flickering torches showed a line of men extending out into the tigris each clinging to the thick tow rope used to pull the ferry back and forth as esk kar watched they hauled more men from the river gasping and spitting until seven had been pulled in he saw no sign of jalen esk kar waited a few more moments watching the men standing against the current to make sure they stayed alert and looked with care for anything coming down the river the diversion had worked exactly as esk kar planned jalens men had driven the horses into the river then waited until the last possible moment before they jumped in themselves letting the current take them quickly around the curve of the bank and downstream to orak they should all have been carried to this spot but they should have gotten here long ago well before esk kar and his men returned to safety something must have gone wrong abruptly he turned his attention back to the first two men whod reached shore wheres jalen why did you wait so long before returning one man looked up blankly but the other shook his head then took a deep breath before speaking captain the horses blocked our path to the river they just raced back and forth along the rivers edge we couldnt get past had to hide until the way was clear the man struggled to his feet and esk kar extended his hand to lift him upright when the way was finally clear the barbarians spotted us they rushed us and jalen got wounded in the fighting he slew one man but he was bleeding badly when i saw him go into the water a shout went up from the men in the river and the words jalens dead echoed over the water the men began wading back to the shore carrying a body cursing under his breath esk kar went back and arrived as the men set the body onto the earth in the wavering torchlight esk kar had to stare for a moment before he recognized jalen a broken root clutched tightly in his hand and a gash in his side where hed been wounded he must have been too hurt to fight the current or maybe just got tangled in some vines esk kar could guess what had happened by the time jalen pushed free of the vines he didnt have the strength to keep his head above water either that or the loss of blood from the wound had finished him esk kar shook his head in frustration a brave man they could ill afford to lose by now jalens second in command had steadied enough to tell the story following orders hed made certain all of the men went into the water including jalen who was last to jump he assured esk kar that hed counted them as they went into the river nevertheless one other hadnt made it and must have been swept unnoticed downstream likely drowned by the currents his unnoticed corpse mixed in with dead horses that had fl oated by by the time the man finished everyone had climbed out of the river in a few moments they began moving back across the ditch last came the men carrying jalens body esk kar took trellas hand together they returned to the safety behind oraks walls sisuthros stood inside the gate his face reflecting the pain he felt esk kar put a hand on sisuthross shoulder for a moment get the whole story then tell gatus esk kar felt trellas hand pushing at his arm and realized he was gripping her hand so tightly that hed hurt her he loosened his grip and they walked back home in silence at the well trella helped him strip and she washed the mud from his body herself servants lifted water from the well and brought drying cloths and fresh clothing under the torchlight she bound up a nasty gash on his left arm after making sure it had been washed clean the hair had burned off his right arm when the wagon exploded on his back she found two burn marks and she washed those as well but left them uncovered the servants withdrew leaving only a single torch burning in the tiny garden trella and esk kar sat together on the bench at the rear of the house he drank his fill of fresh water followed by a cup of heated wine that he drained almost as easily trella examined his arm checking his bandage to see if he still bled she waited until he was ready to speak jalen was unlucky he began unlucky to be wounded unlucky in the river he should be alive and i should be dead he pointed at the great sword leaning up against the tree already wiped clean and oiled by the servants your sword saved my life trella i fought against thutmose sin he is a true swordsman and he had me beaten i knew i was about to die i felt helpless before him until his sword shattered on your blade and i knocked him down with the last of my strength one more stroke and id have died out there even then id have been killed or captured if grond hadnt practically carried me back to the village he looked at her ive never been so certain of my death not in all the fi ghts in all the years i felt fear the same fear ive seen in others eyes other men i have fought killed he shook his head as if disbelieving his words ashamed to admit his fear and weakness even to her when she spoke her voice was calm and matter of fact then the sword has served both of us well since i cant fight at your side the sword must take my place and so it must defend you you know husband its true the gods favor and watch over you they protected you even from the alur meriki leader no man can fight so many men without tiring especially after a long walk carrying a heavy burden but its even better that you admit your fear esk kar looked at her puzzled hed never confessed fear to a woman in his life nor had he ever heard of any warrior doing so he wouldnt have done it now except he felt exhausted and perhaps the hot wine had loosened his tongue the gods grow angry when men become too presumptuous too sure of their own strength and power she went on her hand stroking his arm remember this time and this feeling when youre tempted to think you are all powerful then remember jalen and his sacrifice he sat in silence esk kar knew what she hadnt said she hadnt reminded him who placed the sword in his hand who guided him all these many months whose strength supported him when he worried in the night tomorrow well give honor to jalen his funeral will be attended by all well give him praise for the success of the raid he put his arm around trella and held her close feeling her strength as she gripped him in return and you you will remind me if i grow too proud or if i ever forget the lesson of tonight you will not need to be reminded youre too wise to forget what you learn hed never considered himself wise and wondered if she might be saying that simply to ease his mind she looked up at him reading his thoughts you are a wise man eskkar wise enough to know your own strengths wise enough to learn from your mistakes and even wiser to learn from the mistakes of others she pulled free and stood up now come to bed husband you need to rest and there will be much to talk about in the morning esk kar glanced up at the sky morning would soon be upon them i wonder what happened to thutmose sin he said i struck him with the sword hilt and he went down he told her about how the cart had burst into a mountain of fl ame and heat about the strange noise that knocked them all off their feet his men dragged him away away from the fires and away from us he might even be dead i wanted to kill him to avenge my family that would have been worth dying for but he fought he was too strong no more talk about dying husband and well know soon enough about thutmose sin she answered but whether he lives or dies wont change what the next few days will bring i suppose not he looked at her recalling how hed felt during their first days together when hed started to learn just how special she was now she spoke just a few words and the unimportant disappeared she was right the battle would go on with or without thutmose sin he took her in his arms and held her tight for a moment forgetting the pain in his arm and back letting her strength wash over him they walked together back into the house ignoring the servants and soldiers who stared at them with respect and admiration falling across his bed he had time for one more thought before sleep claimed him wisdom he decided was becoming less a matter of what you knew and more a matter of admitting how much you did not know thutmose sin regained consciousness in his tent surrounded by his women the first rays of dawn shone through the opening telling him the night had passed at first his eyes wouldnt focus but his wives helped him up to a sitting position touching his head he flinched at the tenderness when his fingers still clumsy bumped against the swollen bruise just above his temple his head hurt when he moved it but he sat still for a moment and the waves of pain began to lessen the fight came back to him he remembered his sword breaking in battle anything could happen and hed seen enough swords shatter before though never one of his and never just as hed readied the killing blow one more stroke the weapons failure had unbalanced him and the tall warrior managed to strike him with his weapons pommel thutmose sin had twisted his head trying to avoid the blow and the bronze ball had glanced along his skull instead of hitting directly if it had i might be dead his first wife chioti lifted a water skin to his lips and he drank and drank letting the water spill down his chest when he finally pushed it away he looked at her what happened your guards carried you back here a few hours ago you were unconscious they said the dirt eaters burned the wagons we saw a great burning he shook his head then regretted the movement help me up chioti some of the wives murmured that he should rest but chioti knew his ways she placed his arm over her shoulder and helped get him to his feet fetch urgo she ordered keeping an arm around her husbands waist urgo wanted to know when you awoke chioti moved in front of him and looked into his eyes stay inside the tent until youre sure youre all right you dont want to stumble and fall or look weak in front of my men thutmosesin smiled at her i will take care chioti by the time urgo arrived thutmose sin felt strong enough to leave the tent his guards looked at him the relief on their faces mixed with fear theyd failed in their duty to remain at his side to protect him last night he looked at them coldly as they gathered around him he would deal with their dereliction later the morning sun had lifted well above the horizon his strength grew with each breath of fresh air though his head would likely hurt for days urgo arrived first carrying a bow in his hand rethnar altanar and two other clan leaders were on his heels they sat on the ground in a half circle facing thutmose sin the dirt eaters burned the fire wagons sarrum urgo said without any preamble we lost about half the wood and one wagonload of oil fortunately the other two carts carrying oil were spared thutmose sin restrained himself from shaking his head in disgust and the horses the dirt eaters that raided them the men got away jumping into the river urgo shrugged they may have drowned we lost about thirty horses the rest scattered all over the plain the men are still rounding them up and those that burned the wagons we found two bodies sarrum he saw the question on his leaders face we lost ten men that included the two guards the rest were killed in the fighting urgo handed the bow to thutmose sin one of the dead carried this the dirt eaters sent their archers to raid us that was no bowman i fought thutmose sin said examining the weapon with interest they hadnt recovered one before and it took but a glance to recognize a well made powerful bow he recognized me called out my name he might have been from our clan urgo shrugged a renegade warrior what does it matter you may have wounded him his men had to help him away and the wood do we have enough left ive already sent men out for more we have plenty of oil and well have enough wood in a day or so he knew how to fight urgo the gods may be saving him for us to capture later thutmose sin or the gods may be sending us another message sarrum altanar spoke for the first time one of the older clan leaders hed said little up to now about the campaign perhaps the gods are saying we should move on that there is little here worth the death of so many warriors you would run from dirt eaters rethnar spat the words across the circle are you afraid to fight cowards who hide behind a wall no rethnar im no more afraid of them than i am of you altanars hand went to his sword hilt but many more warriors are sure to die before we take this place will slaves make up for warriors lost the dirt eaters have no horses where will we find new horses even to replace those mounts lost last night he shrugged if rethnar wants to stay behind and capture the village so be it but i say there is nothing here for us you are a coward rethnar said leaping to his feet and drawing his sword altanar rose with him his own blade flashing from its sheath sit down thutmose sin shouted the words but the two clan chieftains if they even heard his command had gone too far to stop pandemonium broke out in the camp clansmen of rethnar and altanar rushed up thutmose sins guards extra alert after last nights failure scooped their leader up and pulled him away from the circle they formed a barrier between him and the melee that had exploded before their eyes a dozen men were fighting in a moment and more would be rushing to join them thutmose sin knew it needed to be stopped now guards he shouted in a voice loud enough to be heard over the fighting kill anyone who doesnt stop fighting now kill them his men surged forward they easily outnumbered the handful of fighters who saw the menace in their advance the two clan leaders broke off their duel and their clansmen followed reluctantly stand between them thutmose sin ordered his voice carrying to everyone now that the clash of weapons had ended kill anyone who doesnt put down his sword ill not have you killing each other because of the dirt eaters with an oath rethnar lowered his sword a moment later altanar did the same the two men glowered at each other thutmose sin stepped forward moving into the center of the space or would you rather fight me he looked around the circle chioti bring me my sword thutmose sin waited surrounded by angry men still clasping bronze in their hands until chioti pushed the guards aside and handed him a sword taking the blade he hefted it then swung it hard over his head the weapon hissing through the air do you want to challenge me altanar when the clan leader didnt respond thutmose sin turned to rethnar do you rethnar rethnar took his time answering and thutmose sin knew the clan chief was wondering how much the fight last night might slow thutmose sin down he walked over to rethnar the sword pointed at the ground are you challenging me thutmose sin spoke softly but everyone heard the menace in his words no sarrum its just that then you both of you sheath your swords send your men away and sit down ive something to say he waited until rethnar and altanar settled onto the ground altanar is right he began we will lose many more warriors in taking this village and its true there will be little of value inside orak to make up for those who die thutmose sin turned to rethnar but rethnar is right also if we dont defeat these miserable villagers every dirt digger in the land will begin moving to the nearest village they will band together and resist us once they know we can be driven off well be fighting over every farm and mud hut we encounter he moved in front of altanar would you change the path of our migration altanar if we fail to take this place we can never come back to these lands again if we do orak will be twice as strong with twice as many fighters within is that what you want your sons your clan to face thutmose sin walked around the circle his eyes challenging each clan chief and his subcommanders no my clansmen we are no longer fighting here for horses or loot not even for honor this orak must be destroyed or these lands will be forbidden to us were fighting to live the way our fathers before us lived he moved back to his place and sat down keeping his sword across his knees when he spoke he lowered his voice so that only those within the circle could hear this village must learn the price of war we must kill many more of them just as weve destroyed their crops and burned their houses this battle must be fought not because of what we might gain but because of what we will lose if we just ride away no one said anything then it is settled thutmose sin said we attack as soon as the wagons and wood have been replaced for this next attack nothing will be held back every man and boy that can fight will march on the village again he looked around the circle and when it is taken well put any survivors to the sword and tear down every wall and house until theres nothing left but the mud from the river eskkar got less than two hours sleep the pain in his back wakening him the window showed only the faintest light in the dark sky to indicate the approaching dawn despite the lack of sleep his thoughts seemed as alert as if hed slept the whole night but every muscle in his body protested as he began moving about the bandage on his arm had slipped a little he ran his fingers over it but felt no traces of fresh blood slipping quietly from the bed so as not to waken trella he dressed quickly he gathered his sword and entered the workroom where he unfastened the outer door as a yawning annok sur was about to knock and awaken her mistress esk kar held his finger to his lips good morning annok sur he whispered ill wake her can you bring breakfast up and send bantor and gatus to me when they arrive captain gatus just sent word he asks that you come to the gate he stared at her but she had nothing more to add bring breakfast for trella then make sure she eats before she goes out esk kar returned to the bedroom and sat down on the bed the movement made trella turn over but she remained asleep a bit more light came through the windows just enough to illuminate her she lay with a hand flung up over her head her dark tresses scattered across the pillow when she slept she seemed so young too young for the burden she carried her life and future hung on the same thread as his the thread hed created in his pride when he told nicar the barbarians could be beaten nothing must harm her esk kar decided the barbarians the nobles nothing and no one must hurt her again first he would defeat the barbarians then he would increase his power over the nobles he swore it by all the gods he didnt believe in esk kar wanted to kiss her but worried that his touch might awaken her better to let her have a few more moments of peace by the time he was downstairs hed put all thoughts of trella behind him he stopped in the kitchen where he drained a cup of water and picked up a round loaf of bread that he chewed as he went outside in the early morning sun esk kar nodded to his guards checked briefl y with those at the command table then mounted the ever present horse he rode slowly out of the courtyard his guards jogging after him the loaf of bread held firmly in his hand few villagers had risen early this morning many had stayed up late last night celebrating the victory over the alur meriki another victory like thieves in the night he and his men had crawled on their bellies into the barbarian camp stampeded some horses and burned a few wagons then theyd run for their lives today the whole village might pay the price for our victory esk kar kept these black thoughts to himself when he reached the gate he swung down from the horse tossing the halter to a half awake boy climbing to the top of the tower he found gatus sitting on a stool so tall that he could see more than if he were standing his second in command had traces of mud over his body and esk kar realized that gatus had remained on the wall all night the rising sun shone in esk kars eyes as he peered into the east well gatus i see youve missed another nights sleep what is it now he tore the remaining bread in half and handed it to gatus who took the still warm bread gratefully last night a few hours after you left we saw something gatus took a bite of the bread then chewed it thoughtfully before continuing another fire broke out in their camp not near where you burned the wagons but close to the center of the plain we watched it for a while and just as it disappeared we heard sounds of fighting that went on for a few moments then stopped then just before dawn we thought we heard fighting again putting the last of the bread into his mouth esk kar shaded his eyes as he scanned the horizon thin trails of smoke still rose from behind the low hill where hed burned the wagons but he saw no other sign of fi re many men on horseback moved about on the low hills and he could see dust trails from those out of sight as he watched a line of riders appeared on the top of the slope where esk kar had crouched last night about twenty in all clan leaders come to inspect the damage in daylight and plan their next move weve made them very angry i think esk kar kept his eyes on the riders as they moved slowly across the hilltop they lost horses and wagons last night as well as much of the wood theyve gathered in the last few weeks most of all theyve been humiliated raided by dirt eaters the warriors and chiefs are very angry at their leader or whoever they decided to blame for our attack they may have tried to kill thutmose sin if they succeeded well be facing a new chief one who may have entirely different ideas or thutmose sin may have blamed some of the other chiefs and attacked them gatus finished off his portion of the bread well the more they fight each other the better i like it or maybe theyve had enough and will move on i dont suppose anything will happen today do you think esk kar wasnt about to take any chances not today but ill stay here for a while send sisuthros to me then you get some sleep gatus opened his mouth to argue then thought better of it very well ill go to your house to sleep bantor is well enough to manage the command post for a few hours he waited a few moments but esk kar didnt say anything just stared across the plain shrugging gatus left the wall after first telling his men where he would be and when he should be called esk kar scarcely noticed his departure there seemed to be an unusual amount of activity in the barbarian camp without thinking he sat down upon the now vacant stool small clouds of dust hung everywhere signifying riders moving from place to place most of them out of eyesight he tried to put himself in thutmose sins place if i survived a challenge to my authority id have to attack the village for thutmose sin to abandon the siege now would be to admit failure and too many had died in too many clans to allow that tempers and hatreds would have exploded in fury last night and blood would have to spill to settle the score so if thutmose sin remained in control esk kar decided then we can expect an all out assault today or more probably tomorrow the alur meriki would first try to replace some of the lost wood and they might need more time to round up their horses esk kar felt certain about one thing if when the attack came it would be unrestrained the barbarians had more than enough men for one final assault every man would be flung at the walls and it would be victory or disaster for the alur meriki for if they failed their ranks would be so diminished that other large villages or clans would seize the opportunity to oppose them but if thutmose sin had been removed then maybe there might be a chance that the new leader would move on the new ruler whoever he might be could blame all the failures on his predecessor could say it was too late in the season to keep fighting could claim theyd be back in a few years to take their revenge anything the alur meriki had enough reasons to satisfy those ready to abandon the fight the clan would move on and the new leader would be busy for the next few years consolidating his power and there would be plenty of wives concubines and horses to distribute to his new supportersthe former property of those killed so oraks best hope was that thutmose sin was dead esk kar thought about that wishing for some way to kill the leader of the alur meriki hoping that some clansman had solved his problem with a knife in thutmose sins back esk kar stayed on the wall the rest of the day no attack came a fact he attributed completely to the raid at least no attack on the village late in the afternoon for a few moments some of those watching the plain claimed to hear more sounds of fighting in the enemys camp but nothing could be seen and esk kar heard nothing nevertheless even if there were no actual fighting plenty of sharp words and accusations would be exchanged by clan leaders unhappy with thutmose sins performance and warriors dont fight well when their leaders quarrel he knew both from his own experience and the old days under the command of ariamus the sun finally set the soldiers maintained their vigilance throughout the night taking no chances gatus again walked the walls much of the night still the pause gave esk kar time to catch up on his sleep though dawn found him on the wall again anxiously watching the hilltops but the morning sun brought nothing new and that day passed as well with no noticeable activity with the arrival of darkness however the men on the walls saw the lights from campfires reflecting up into the darkness and these seemed to burn brighter and longer into the night than usual the men watched and waited throughout the early evening finally esk kar turned to sisuthros and gatus i think our waiting is over tomorrow i think it will be tomorrow theyll come with the dawn then well be ready sisuthros answered grimly a small lamp in the workroom gave more smoke than light its oil nearly gone trella paused to add more enough to see by she opened the door to their bedroom and listened to esk kars breathing at least hed gotten a few hours of restless sleep she slipped into bed and put her arms around her husband letting her body wake him enough light reached the bed to see esk kars eyes open for a moment he sighed contentedly then he tried to sit up as he remembered what today would bring she kept her arms around him stay a moment its more than two hours before dawn she buried her face against his chest and held him with all her strength he kissed her gently then turned on his side keeping one arm around her i have to go trella heard men talking and moving about downstairs as they prepared for the battle she knew the sounds called to him and that she must let him go how long have i slept you said you almost three hours youve scarcely slept in three days gatus told me to let you sleep her arms couldnt prevent him from sitting up i must go trella the men need to see me before the battle i know husband just remember to take care theres no need for you to take chances let others earn the glory today she stood and watched as he laced up his sandals esk kar took his time knotting them securely then stood and buckled on his sword he hadnt undressed before lying down this is the last battle for five months weve prepared and now its upon us today we either win or fall trella shook her head there is never a last battle remember that and you wont act rashly she came into his arms and pressed against him then lifted her arms around his neck he tried to kiss her but she clung so tightly all he could do was brush his lips against her forehead trella i you have to let me go she said nothing but loosened her hold on him and stepped aside her head downcast take care for your own self and remember what ive told you if we fail he spoke the words calmly but their meaning brought pain to her heart she stood there as he turned and left the room trella heard his steps down the stairs may the gods go with you husband in all the places of danger that you will fi nd today she spoke the prayer aloud but more to herself than to the gods the tears came but briefly she had her own duties to attend to esk kar went first to the well quenching his thirst and washing his face in the flickering torchlight before returning to the kitchen a single lamp showed bantor alexar grond and a few others seated at the table esk kar joined them and they picked at the cold fowl and drank the weak ale the women set out no one spoke each in his thoughts occasionally glancing at the tiny window to see if the stars had begun to dim each as he finished eating took chunks of bread and stuffed them in his pouch before leaving there might not be another chance to eat the whole long day in the courtyard esk kar found sisuthros making sure each man knew his duty and station sisuthros hadnt slept during the night offering to let the others sleep while he patrolled the walls and prepared its defenders in the fl ickering light esk kar thanked him for the long nights work then clasped his arm in farewell orak slept little during the night as word spread the barbarians were mustering their forces and would attack at dawn the commanders and village leaders inspected their men and ordered everyone to be at their station before first light the cooking fires started early villagers and soldiers ate tasteless meals in silence and near darkness then drank again from the water jars in preparation for a long hard day parents husbands and lovers said their goodbyes their voices low faces grim their futures uncertain the whole village felt fear and tension by sundown their fate would be decided the water wheels had run steadily since yesterday filling the ditch with as much water as possible corio no longer worried about weakening the base of the wall senior men inspected weapons checked water stores and made sure each man knew his place archers strung fresh bowstrings on their bows then tested them by torchlight the rasp of sharpening stones grated endlessly as men honed swords and axes to fighting edges followed by his bodyguards esk kar strode to the main gate gatus and the other commanders had begun one last circuit of the village theyd make sure all the men stood ready and at their posts their weapons equipment and tools at hand esk kar found corio checking the ropes on the parapets that stretched across the gate alcinor at his side the upper smaller one sagged in the middle under its load of stones the lower wider and better supported held an even greater weight of men and stones corio looked ready to collapse from the strain fear showed on the faces of both father and son in the torchlight today the master builders wall and gate would face their greatest challenge as esk kar watched a line of villagers passed buckets of water up to the top of the gate where others gently upended them in a slow stream designed to soak its outer face that process would continue all day to keep the wood as wet as possible the night before a battle is always a long one corio esk kar said reassuringly were nearly ready captain corio answered his voice pitched higher than normal only a few more tasks youve plenty of time these men needed calming more than anything else try and rest or youll be useless when you are most needed once the battle begins youll be too busy to worry about anything before they could reply he walked past them to enter the north tower as he climbed the still dark steps he called out greetings letting the men know hed arrived sensing rather than seeing the relief on their faces when he reached the top the sentries cleared a place for him at the wall esk kar had spent much of yesterday at this same spot watching for any hint of the barbarians plans hed stared at the enemy camp until midnight when gatus demanded he get some rest esk kar left the wall but only when they promised to awaken him three hours before sunrise he didnt expect to sleep but his body surprised him and he fell asleep moments after lying down an arm thrown over his eyes as if to keep the dawn away as long as possible now the time for sleep had passed esk kar looked toward the eastern sky he thought he could detect a lighter shade of blackness lowering his eyes he saw the line of the hills etched sharply against the glow of alur meriki fires nothing moved atop those hills in front of the hills darkness still covered the plain leaning against the wall esk kar waited for the fi rst glimmer of dawn he closed his eyes and concentrated on his hearing though the hills lay more than a mile away he could hear faint sounds of activity and knew preparations would have continued throughout the night he recognized the rumble of wagons mixed with the occasional neighing of a skittish horse frightened as it moved through the darkness uncertain of its step or startled by torches that snapped and hissed there would be plenty of fire to light their preparations but only behind the hills giving the defenders no glimpse of what lay hidden behind him he heard the tread of feet on the steps men moved beside and behind him as the soldiers filled their positions on the wall the archers said little as if they feared words would hasten the dawn or disturb the enemy well captain of the guard it sounds like barbarians are on the move out there gatus had returned his loud voice breaking the spell theyll come early today i think weve been hearing movement from behind the hills all night esk kar turned to face his second in command in the torchlight he saw most of his subcommanders sisuthros maldar grond totomes even myandro and a few others bantor remained at the courtyard too weak to do much more than sit at a table and help coordinate the reserves along the wall everyone watched and waited each wanted to be first to learn what the day had in store for them the soldiers remained silent as the false dawn ebbed in the east but they pressed forward as the stars began to disappear the noise coming from the plain increased more horses moving about the faint clink of sword and lance the deeper groaning of cart wheels the hilltops seemed to move and waver in the dim glow the sky began to lighten with tiny fingers of red and gold reaching up into the darkness then a broad stream of sunlight flowed into the heavens as the first rays of true dawn swept into the sky the edge of the sun appeared over the hills and bathed the plain with soft reddish light that revealed the enemys movements at last esk kar saw wagons everywhere along the top of the hills all moving slowly but purposefully down toward the plain fi nding their positions and gathering themselves for the long journey toward oraks walls hundreds of men pulled and pushed at the carts assigned to make sure each wagon reached its destination warriors walked alongside the wagons many in the front ranks carried no weapons and esk kar realized that slaves and captives would be human shields to protect the warriors huge shields appeared everywhere each large enough to protect three or four men carried at each end by warriors or slaves not many rode their horses today and those on horseback moved toward the flanks of the village away from the main gate esk kar stared in wonder at the number of men coming toward them theyd killed hundreds of warriors and yet the enemy still had so many to send into battle and so it begins he said more to himself than to those standing beside him only gatus heard the odd remark and the old soldier turned toward him i care not how it begins only how it ends and well know that soon enough they fight on foot today sisuthros commented no more wild charges theyll be easy targets and our archers will cut them to shreds it looks like every wagon in their camp is coming our way gatus said they intend to bring them to the very edge of the ditch and fight from behind them and the sun will be in our eyes the whole time totomess accent still sounded strange after all these weeks a long morning for our archers theyre coming right toward the gate sisuthros shaded his eyes with his hands and smoke is coming from the wagons they carry fire esk kar watched the alur meriki as they deployed their men in a slow but orderly fashion no signs of confusion today no aimless galloping back and forth no loud boasting from the riders only a few warriors on horseback directing men who pulled or pushed their loads thutmose sin had prepared well theyd had enough weeks to get ready esk kar worried about the number of wagons and their wooden burdens hed burned an enormous amount of wood two nights ago yet it all appeared to have been replaced look at the size of those shields gatus marveled ive never seen anything like that before just crossing the distant hilltops ten or twelve men appeared carrying a huge wooden shield maybe six paces wide and twice as long they looked like those he and grond had burned esk kar studied them for a long moment i think theyre platforms to lay across the mud they plan to cross the ditch on those theres more of them on the wagons nobody spoke for a moment as each commander contemplated what these unusual implements would mean it seemed that today the attackers would be the ones with new tactics totomes esk kar said do your archers have any fire arrows no captain we didnt think theyd be necessary better start making them a lot of them yes captain totomes started down the towers steps good hunting today totomes if the man heard him he didnt bother to reply esk kar turned back to his men sisuthros get nicar and anyone else you can find have them gather torches and as much of the oil that burns if weve any left bring everything to the gate we may have to burn these wagons and platforms ourselves he looked intently at each man for any sign of panic or fear but saw only determination everyone get to your positions and tell your men whats coming the more they know what to expect the less likely theyll be to panic as gatus started down the steps he grabbed one of esk kars bodyguards make sure he puts on his helmet and wears as much leather as you can find or ill personally have your head esk kar smiled at the old mans worries it was a waste of time to argue with him turning back to the wall he studied the advancement before him shading his eyes horses men and wagons now covered the plain all moving slowly the leading edge already halfway to orak before long the foremost barbarians would be in range and today the arrows would start as soon as possible behind him men began shouting and moving about he heard totomes giving orders to his archers including those who would target only clan leaders his two sons would target little else well totomes this is your day for taking your revenge on the alur meriki by sunset no matter how it ended the master archer and his sons would slay more than enough of their foes to satisfy their blood feud esk kar scanned the plains two streams of riders backed by archers and men carrying ladders moved toward the north and south walls theyd try and draw soldiers away from the gate and towers the bulk of the alur meriki came straight at the gate they meant to bridge the ditch by pushing wagons and wooden platforms into place until they could attack the gate itself wagons and shields would provide protection for their archers looking at the hills he saw men still coming from the camp but fewer of them almost all those in the front ranks were weaponless slaves many of them women they pushed wagons or carried wood or pots of fire the alur meriki considered the slaves expendable since a new supply could be obtained once they captured the village so nothing would be held back todayevery slave that could walk and every man that could hold a weapon esk kar signaled to one of the messengers kneeling against the wall find one of the scribes and try to get a count of their fighting men how many men did thutmose sin have left at least a thousand eskkar guessed the horde in front of the village slowed stopping just out of bowshot as they found their stations and took up their shields preparing to face the arrows they knew awaited them only silence came from the enemy there would be little shouting or taunting no eager war cries theyd learned their lessons and knew they faced hardened soldiers who would not easily yield theyd miss the joy of battle esk kar decided no quick slaughter of men on foot no feats of horsemanship just moving forward into the rain of arrows esk kar understood why they didnt use the horses theyd lose too many more than they could replace he smiled at that thought thutmose sin must be worried about how big a price hed pay today even in victory the alur meriki leader must have a victory and it must be cheap enough to satisfy those who hoped for his failure we just have to give them a reason to turn back and some will take it calls for silence moved up and down the walls as totomes and his men finished testing their bows the master archer had no more instructions for his men and needed no orders from esk kar to tell him when and what to shoot huge stocks of arrows stood ready and the archers would begin loosing shafts as soon as they could for as long as they could bend a bow until every last arrow was gone esk kar nodded in approval hed done all he could and now the arms of his archers would determine whether orak stood or fell he felt a gentle tap on his arm and turned surprised to find one of the women standing there at first he didnt comprehend her words then he saw the water jug in her hand an elderly matron she had long gray hair that blew around her shoulders in the light breeze the jugs weight made her hands tremble shed carried her burden first to him bypassing others on her way esk kar took the jug and lifted it to his lips he didnt feel particularly thirsty yet but the sun already warmed the wall and the full heat of the day would be on them soon enough so he took a long drink and returned a much lighter vessel to the woman thank you elder he said not knowing her name as he wiped his mouth with his hand good fortune she answered soberly my sons fight with you this day so bring us victory she didnt wait to hear his reply moving down the wall with her water a task she would perform throughout the long day or until an arrow took her down behind her stepped grond newly promoted leader of the captains personal guard carrying esk kars copper helmet now painted brown to look similar to the leather ones he handed it to his captain as well as a leather vest and gauntlets for his arms esk kar fastened them on his body taking care to lace them properly letting grond help him the other bodyguard handed grond a thick leather collar ill not wear that esk kar shook his head it itches and i feel like im in a noose im sorry captain but gatus and lady trella insisted grond stared at him or well have to carry you from the wall the enemy will be targeting you and we dont want you to take an arrow in the throat esk kar could have browbeaten the bodyguards who looked nervous but so long as grond stood firm theyd obey orders to carry off their captain for a moment esk kars annoyance flashed but grond waited patiently meeting his eyes still offering up the collar esk kar felt tempted to take it and pitch it over the wall but that would be childish besides grond would probably climb down into the ditch to retrieve it esk kar ground his teeth and jerked the collar out of gronds hand then wrapped it around his neck immediately it began to chafe grond stepped around him to fasten the laces make it loose damn you i dont want to choke to death grond knew his business and the nearly three inches of stiff leather sat on the base of esk kars neck loose but capable of deflecting with luck an arrow that duty done grond nodded to the two bodyguards and they moved in front of esk kar bringing their wooden shields up to rest on the wall esk kar would be able to peer between and over them but the thick wood would shield most of his body more men moved into position including two special marksmen assigned by totomes these archers looked grim as they glanced at their captain their job was to kill anyone targeting esk kar a messenger arrived breathing hard eyes wide as he reported to eskkar captain corio says there are at least eleven hundred armed men coming toward us with about five hundred slaves send word to the command post esk kar spoke calmly though he swore to himself at the number he hadnt thought they had that many warriors left they must have recalled every outrider and pressed into service all the old men and young boys or perhaps another raiding party had joined them wherever they came from it would be a lot of men to stop already done captain the boy answered esk kar thanked the boy who moved aside wedging himself out of the way in an empty space near the back of the tower out on the plain a drum began to beat everyone turned toward the sound the orak bowmen looked nervous almost anxious to get on with the battle their day had come and theyd be put to the test in the next few hours the barbarian horsemen moved to the flanks staying just out of range theyd try to keep as much pressure on the other walls as possible theyd probe for any weak points and they had enough men to mount a rush but their primary task was to draw off as many defenders from the main gate as possible meanwhile the main force of alur meriki paused crowded together carts ready and wooden shields lifted on high suddenly the drum changed its rhythm with a few shouts the mass of slaves warriors horsemen and carts began to move esk kar glanced up at the sun well above the horizon an hour had passed since dawn the men on the wall fell silent all eyes focused ahead as they took their stances and put arrows to the string waiting for totomess order the tall archer took his time he waited until the thick block of men reached the range of even the weakest of his archers before giving the command that order echoed along the rest of the wall as the first flight of arrows told everyone the battle for orak had begun the main wall held just two hundred and twenty archers with the rest spread thinly along the other three walls they faced at least seven hundred warriors heading straight for the gate plus the mass of slaves used as shields and beasts of burden well over a thousand men arrows rattled up into the sky flight after flight his men were loosing between fifteen and eighteen arrows a minute out on the plain barbarians fell to the earth but the wagons kept coming slowed for a moment as one or two men went down but moving steadily forward so far no one fired back but that would soon change the enemy advanced stoically absorbing the losses war cries sounded on all sides now as warriors raced their animals along the north and south walls the drumbeat quickened the barbarians broke into a run driving their slaves in front of them by the flat of their swords before long the leading edge of alur meriki knelt in the dirt and planted their shields about fifty paces from the ditch as archers moved up behind the protection and began to return fire for their shorter bows it was still long range and the advantage lay with the defenders aided by their stronger bows and the height of the wall but already more than three hundred enemy warriors plied their bows and began to score hits even at that distance the wagons still advanced an arrow whistled past esk kars head totomes directed his men to target the men advancing the wagons men went down again and again but others took their places esk kar grimaced most of these were slaves not even warriors forced to labor until an arrow took them to turn away meant facing the swords and lances of warriors behind them at last the first of the wagons one piled high with planks nailed together and showing scorch marks on its high sides reached the edge of the ditch the attack would begin in earnest now an arrow glanced off esk kars copper helmet and a moment later another brushed his right arm gouging the stiff leather grond pulled him down behind the shield then ordered the archers to kill those who aimed at their captain esk kar saw a sudden flurry of activity behind the first wagon already sprouting a thicket of arrows as defenders shot at every barbarian around it about twenty leather clad warriors ran alongside the wagon and grasped the topmost planks they lifted a section and carried it forward into the ditch many went down with arrows but enough stayed on their feet and managed to get the bridging section to the ditch and fling it down before running back behind the wagons for shelter another group of men tried to repeat the effort but this time totomess archers stopped the second attempt with a wave of arrows that brought warriors screaming in pain to their knees before they reached the edge of the ditch it proved only a momentary setback more men rushed up to aid them and they managed to grasp and lift the heavy platform once again and rush it forward some leaping down into the mud others dropping onto the first piece of bridge in their haste they failed to place the second section properly for a moment no warrior would venture out to correct it instead they brought up more archers from the rear and a hailstorm of arrows drove the defenders beneath the wall for a few moments esk kar could only watch through the narrow gap between the two shields as two gangs of men rushed forward one to straighten the second section and another to lift and carry the third section by now all the barbarian archers were shooting from behind some sort of cover making it harder for oraks archers to hit them their enemies needed only to aim for the top of the wall to keep the defenders pinned down with the third bridging section in place the barbarians had reached more than halfway across the ditch even though the trench here stretched twice as wide esk kar turned to gatus get every archer you can fi nd up on the wall im going to the gate without waiting for a reply esk kar dashed away grond and the bodyguards following him esk kar ran down the tower steps pushing past a constant stream of men climbing up to reinforce or resupply those already there emerging into the sunlight he took only a few steps before he found corio directing a handful of villagers carrying three heavy clay pots good work corio esk kar shouted is this the oil all thats left the storehouse is empty the lands around orak held numerous pools of the oil that burns but no such pool existed inside orak the countless torches needed every night had drained the stores of oil faster than expected esk kars fire raid had taken the rest esk kar grimaced but there was nothing he could do about it well need more than that find more and send one jar up to the top of the gate captain be careful we might set fire esk kar left corio and climbed up the narrow wooden steps leading to the upper parapet several archers manning the slits had taken wounds but a few cheered at the sight of their captain he moved to the gates center then pushed an archer aside to glance through the firing slit the barbarians had placed another section into the ditch and looked ready to move up another that one would completely bridge the ditch a burly villager bumped into esk kars back breathing hard and carrying the largest of the pots of oil esk kar took the vessel and almost dropped it surprised by the weight fetch as many torches as you can he ordered the man nodded then swung over the edge of the platform and just dropped to the parapet directly below before jumping to the ground the last bridging section had the farthest to go and again totomess archers waited for the alur meriki effort a wave of arrows from the defenders cut the first attempt short hitting a half dozen warriors before they could even take up the burden another attempt failed as well until a horde of nearly fifty men rushed up and by sheer numbers carried the section down into the ditch and heaved it into position despite the heavy losses a shout of triumph accompanied their success esk kar turned to grond whod stayed right behind him well hurl this as far from the gate as we can understand at the count of three together they lifted the clay jar each holding it with one hand on the bottom and using the other hand to steady it esk kar took a deep breath and braced himself nodded at grond then gave the count one two three with a mighty heave they hurled the pot of oil over the top the jar landed at least twenty feet away from the gate bursting into a hundred pieces as it emptied its contents between the fourth and fifth sections without bothering to look esk kar seized the flaming torch that the laborer had brought and hurled it over the top by the time he reached a slit the torch had ignited the oil and a sheet of flames burned hotly wherever the oil had spread even the mud in the ditch caught fire two arrows hissed through the slit and esk kar felt his heart jump if hed stared an instant longer alur meriki archers below now waited for any target get another pot of oil grond that should slow them down men crowded the gate now its parapets sagging dangerously as ten more archers added their weight to the platforms another jar of oil arrived this one smaller and again esk kar and grond heaved it over the gate it landed closer to the mud this time but shattered well enough to cover the burning wood again a strange whooshing noise and a wave of heat accompanied flames that rushed into the air the few warriors who had ventured out onto the platform quickly retreated for a moment the conflagration rose even higher than the gate the last two sections of the bridge burned steadily and nothing would put them out until the fire reached the muddy underside of the wood the barbarians halted surprised to find their own tactic used against them the vicious exchange of arrows continued taking its toll on both sides grond readied the last pot but a quick glimpse told esk kar it wasnt needed yet he leaned over the edge of the platform and shouted down at corio corio we need more oil send women to gather every drop from every house yes captain well find some esk kar turned back to the parapet alcinor had his workers pouring water over the top nervous about the fire their leaders had ignited a fire behind the gate might be disastrous then a cry from the tower made eskkar take another quick glance through the slit the barbarians had lifted another bridging section from a wagon and were gathering for a new rush esk kar understood immediately what they planned placed on top of the burning ones the new section would smother the fires and be even firmer underfoot the warriors gave a shout as they braved the archers volleys to take up the platform on both sides and begin moving it toward the ditch esk kar picked up a bow from a wounded archer and strung a shaft himself find yourself a bow grond the big man returned in a moment as archers crowded around the slits esk kar looked at him theyre watching the slits well shoot from over the top try to bring down the first man on your side this was dangerous theyd have to expose more of their bodies but esk kar needed to stop the attackers now warriors stumbling under the weight of the new section but moving rapidly had reached the halfway point of the ditch now esk kar shouted in that instant both he and grond leaned over the top of the gate esk kar firing as the rest of the defenders did likewise ducking back not an instant too soon as a flock of arrows whistled into the space their heads had just occupied a peek through the slit told esk kar his shaft had hit the mark the stricken warrior had fallen onto the man behind him the whole section had crashed into the ditch the warriors tried to pick it up but arrows from each tower and the gate struck among them and drove the alur meriki back behind the wagons by now even the bridging sections were riddled with arrows the section the alur meriki had tried to bring forward sat half in the mud and half on the bridge it looked too far for esk kar to reach with another pot of oil or was it wait here grond he ordered he swung down to the lower parapet then dropped to the ground he shouted for messengers even as corio and alcinor raced to esk kars side find some small jars about this big he held his hands about six inches apart i want to throw oil further out on their bridge and get me more oil corio nodded to his son and alcinor raced away can we hold them captain the master artisan looked frightened a meaningless question only the gods know but theyre not inside yet just keep the gate wet and our own torches away from the oil only a few paces from where they stood villagers frantically pumped at the water wheel sending a steady stream out into the ditch esk kar mounted the steps ignoring the tiredness in his legs and returned to the top he knelt beside grond picked up a shield and used it to cover himself as he looked through the slit he saw warriors trading shafts with the defenders while others prepared for another rush alcinor arrived breathing hard and carrying two small clay jugs the kind used to hold wine in the alehouses he also carried several long pieces of cotton alcinor dipped the wine jug into the last remaining pot of oil and held it until it was almost filled he stuffed one of the rags in the mouth of the jar finally he took another rag and wiped the outside of the jug clean rubbing hard to remove every trace of oil alcinor saw the puzzled look on esk kars face the rag will act as a stopper like a wick in a lamp alcinor explained we light the rag before you throw it to demonstrate he called for a torch then touched the rag to its flame esk kar watched in fascination as fire blossomed from the rag it did burn like a wick in a candle without being instantly consumed esk kar took the flaming wine jug braced his feet and hurled it over the wall the pot almost went too far but landed on the new section of bridge shattered and burst into flames the fire didnt burn as intensely as before but would certainly slow the attackers for a few moments it did then a large group of warriors rushed down into the ditch where they used their hands to scoop up the damp mud and toss it on the burning planks that smothered the oil and flames at the same time arrows struck down many but others replaced those killed or wounded throwing more wet earth onto the platform wherever the mud landed the fire hissed and smoked then died out immediately damn them esk kar swore the archers fire from the walls wasnt enough to impede them we need more archers he shouted to grond stay here and throw as many jugs as you can esk kar dropped down from the parapet running back to the north side where he found gatus directing men and shouting orders gatus we need more archers theyll be at the gate in a few moments ive sent you every man i could find totomes says theyre driving the barbarian archers back its taking too long theyre almost ready to assail the gate strip every archer from the other walls send villagers to take their place just get more men to the towers leaving gatus esk kar raced back up the steps to gronds side whod prepared another oil filled wine jug an arrow whistled through the slit just as esk kar was about to look the shaft passing between the two mens faces they looked grimly at each other but he needed to see so he took a quick look he saw plenty of activity across the ditch but so far the alur meriki hadnt tried to push another section out they would at any moment captain this is the last of the oil grond said but i think i can throw this close to their wagon if you can cover me esk kar looked at gronds huge arms and shoulders this jug appeared smaller than the others if anyone could do it grond could nevertheless hed have to stand up brace himself and make the throw but if he could reach the wagon archers esk kar shouted ready yourself for a volley he picked up his shield the soldiers readied themselves grond held out the jar and alcinor touched the torch to the rag which flamed up for a moment before it began to burn steadily with a smoky haze esk kar glanced up and down the parapet the archers looked grim but ready with their bows now they rose up and released a hasty volley enough to distract the closest barbarian archers for a moment in that instant esk kar arose holding the shield to protect grond who grasped the top edge with his left hand and hurled the wine jug esk kar pulled grond back down with his free hand as arrows hissed above them esk kars shield had four arrows protruding from it glancing through the slit he saw that gronds throw had been true the jug landed just in front of the wagon and burst into flames splashes of oil reached and immediately began to burn the dry wood of the cart the warriors tried to quench the flames but oraks archers drove them back covering most of the slit with his shield esk kar watched as the warriors reacted at first they did little then an alur meriki war leader gathered warriors with shields and ordered them in front of the cart to protect those who would extinguish the flames this time the attackers not only extinguished the fire but draped two hides over the wagons front meanwhile warriors loosed arrows at a rapid pace as they prepared once again to place the final bridge section esk kar and his men had slowed their advance but not stopped it with a shout the barbarians swarmed around the wagon and took up another section of bridge they ignored the flickering flames that lingered in places underfoot as well as the arrows that flew into their ranks esk kar heard the heavy section drop into place beneath the gate this time a few of the attackers paused long enough to scoop mud and dirt from the ditch onto the new platform trying to wet the wood before the villagers could throw more burning oil fresh reserves of enemy fighters most with bows but many with axes rushed out from behind the wagons shouting war cries as they came they raced across the muddy and smoking bridge stepping on the bodies of their fallen whose dead and dying bodies littered the ditch now twice as many barbarians stood under the gate arrows nocked and ready to shoot at anything that moved esk kar felt the first axe thud into the gate stones he bellowed men dropped their bows and began heaving the river rocks over the gate a second and third axe began plying on the gate the sound ringing throughout the village their shields protected the alur meriki somewhat from falling stones stones arrows now esk kar yelled stones flew over the top until the melon sized rocks fell like rain alcinor his voice cracking shouted at the men reminding them to drop the stones straight down for the men below surely pressed themselves as close as possible to the wall to avoid the bone breaking missiles in a few moments of frenzied activity the defenders exhausted all the stones on the parapet alcinor screamed for more rocks and esk kar risked an arrow to take another look through the slit the first wagon side had been pushed into the ditch the alur meriki wanted to move the wagon as close to the gate as possible theyd tried to guide it directly onto the bridge but one side must have gone over faster than the other and now one of the wheels had caught in the mud still three of the wagons wheels rested on the bridge and another cart carrying a fresh supply of wood and oil had taken its place warriors crawled and stumbled in the ditch now ignoring the arrows that flew at them to free and move the first wagon forward esk kar heard them cursing the clumsy vehicle that clung to the mud and resisted their efforts until nearly twenty men lifted and pushed it free and completely onto the bridge meanwhile other barbarians seized tools and axes and rushed back to the gate ignoring the flames that still burned in places a fresh group of warriors weaponless but carrying large wooden shields came forward to protect the axe men hammering at the gate from the stones damn the gods there seemed to be no end to these barbarians esk kar turned back to grond ill try and find more fire jugs the first wagon is within reach now and theyre bringing up another the big man nodded and esk kar swung from the edge of the parapet to the ground for the third time there he nearly knocked over narquil totomess son had just descended from the right tower he staggered toward esk kar blood pouring down his right arm two arrows protruding from it esk kar grabbed the man and shouted for a messenger a boy eyes wide appeared from under the wall bring narquil to the women and have them stop the bleeding narquil his eyes wide with shock from pain and loss of blood grasped esk kars arm with his left hand captain look at the arrow he slurred the words and at fi rst esk kar thought narquil wanted him to look at the wound the arrow captain its one of ours theyre running out of arrows yes i see go with the boy now turning to the messenger esk kar ordered him to get moving then raced up the tower where hed started the morning emerging into the sunlight he found blood and bodies everywhere death had thinned their ranks but archers still worked their bows he found totomes the grim archer had held his place calmly aiming and firing shafts at his hated enemy using the towers vantage to kill as many clan leaders as possible totomes can your archers sweep the ditch of warriors he shouted almost in the mans ear theyre at the gate with axes totomes loosed the arrow on his bowstring before ducking below the wall pulling esk kar down with him not yet captain wed have to lean too far over the wall to get a shot at them were killing the bowmen behind the barricade their fire is slowing and theyre running out of arrows the men in the ditch will have to wait we may not have that much time left theyre weakening the gate and fire will be upon us soon ill do what i can captain but you must hold them off a little longer are my sons still alive narquil was wounded in the arm and i sent him to the women hell fight no more today i havent seen mitrac esk kar started to move away then turned back to the master archer narquil said the same thing that they were running out of arrows one of the arrows that wounded him was one of ours does that mean anything totomes grimaced at the news of his sons wounding our arrows are heavier than theirs and longer if they shoot them at us they risk breaking their bows or not shooting them full strength that means theyll fire more slowly as well now let me get back to my work ive killed two clan leaders already and there are more out there he strung another shaft to his bowstring while they spoke now he rose up aimed and loosed in one easy motion cursing the gods in frustration esk kar started back down the steps pushing past a woman carrying a sack of arrows up to the men at least his soldiers would have no shortage of missiles today out of the tower and back at the gate he heard axes ringing against the structure looking up he saw grond hurling stones over the top of the gate men scrambled up the steps carrying baskets of stones but the defenders dropped them over the top faster than they could be resupplied men passed baskets from hand to hand to make sure they covered the entire section of the gate esk kar started up the steps then stopped when he heard his name called he turned back to find gatus running toward him blood on his hand and a cut across his cheek esk kar the barbarians crossed the ditch on the south wall and nearly carried the wall bantor went there with the last of the villagers when there were no other soldiers to move up in support esk kar could do nothing about the other walls the villagers would have to keep the attackers at bay i need more men here gatus and now pointing up at the gate esk kar saw only a few men hurling rocks and firing arrows otherwise theyll be coming through soon enough the gates big timbers had begun to shake under the axe blows gatus coolly appraised the gate alcinors workers swarmed everywhere carrying heavy planks to reinforce its base the gate will last a little longer ill find you more men esk kar swore again and ran toward the steps pausing only to take a basket of stones away from a woman who could scarcely manage the load he grunted under the weight and ducked beneath the slits until he reached gronds side the big man picked up two stones one in each hand then positioned himself directly over the pounding before he flung the missiles over the edge esk kar stayed on his knees handing grond the three remaining stones one at a time when they were gone esk kar tossed the empty basket to the ground and shouted for more a bowman at the slit beside him gave a strangled gasp as an arrow pierced his throat esk kar grabbed the bow from the mans hands then pushed the dying man off the parapet notching a shaft he went to the slit as another arrow flew through it the attackers had grown bolder they had discovered that the safest place was directly under the wall and many had positioned themselves there shafts ready to fire at any target that showed peering through the slit at the sharpest angle he could manage esk kar saw an alur meriki archer in the ditch and let fly the arrow feathered itself in the mans chest esk kars action drew a flurry of arrows and another hissed through the slit narrowly missing him still he had the helmet and collar for protection and he needed to stop the barbarians now esk kar shoved the bow into the slit for a moment then ducked back letting another flight of arrows come at him then he moved up while they were notching their shafts and again sent an arrow into an alur meriki archer ducking back again he took a quick glance toward the ditch and saw that a third wagon had been pushed to the edge warriors now carried burning fagots and torches onto the platform they had their own jars of oil theyd stuff the burning wood into the holes the axe men had created douse everything with oil and try to fire the gate and the defenders had no more oil to oppose them grond reappeared with another basket of rocks two bodyguards came behind him carrying more the gate shuddered continually under the axes the sounds of splintering wood carrying over the frantic shouts of the defenders theres a group of bowmen right below us lets feed them some stones grond nodded and pulled the bodyguards into position on each side of him then the three men began tossing the rocks in unison over the edge as soon as they started esk kar moved to a slit and shot another arrow cursing as his intended target moved back the shaft disappearing harmlessly in the mud in the same instant he saw another warrior struck in the shoulder by a stone the man screamed in pain and dropped the shield hed held over his head nevertheless more barbarians moved into the ditch carrying bundles of wood and straw as well as pots that surely contained oil esk kar grond and the others fought like demons while the brutal fighting raged all around them stones provided the main weapon for the defenders now the gates archers almost useless now afraid to lean out or even use the arrow slits too many enemy archers bows drawn waited for any movement most of them protected by shields the barbarians still hacked away at the gate taking losses but maintaining their stubborn attack the continuous pounding shook the structure a shout behind him made esk kar turn around corio and alcinor had returned with a crowd of villagers carrying the last of the stones forming lines villagers passed the rocks to the top of the gate as fast as they could under the parapet carpenters continued to reinforce the base of the structure suddenly the ringing of the axes ceased esk kar risked a peek through the slit the axe men were racing away back to the safety of the wagons their task done for the moment others ran forward to replace them these warriors carried large bundles of dry grass they placed against the gate the barbarians had chopped and shattered much of the gates bottom and now stuffed bundles of oil soaked straw and wood into the openings esk kar saw a dozen men with torches race across the platform before hurling their torches the gate ignited in a whoosh of flames the defenders kept hurling rocks and water over the gate esk kar leaned back and looked across the ditch arrows coated all the carts and new shafts kept striking at the mass of men huddled behind them aimed at any warrior who exposed himself oraks archers were slowly stopping the bowmen behind the ditch totomes had been right they were winning the archery battle if only they had enough time esk kar looked down behind him at the base of the gate a thick plume of smoke already curled underneath carrying the stink of burning oil with it everyone screamed for water men and women alike passed buckets to the top of the gate every available villager even children had come there drawing water from the wells then passing the buckets hand to hand to the men on the walls others continued to carry stones and arrows to the walls defenders it had become a race between the fire at the gates base and the water that poured over its top others hurled water at the gates bottom at any place that looked likely to burn through esk kar glimpsed trella among them keeping the villagers in order and directing them where they would do the most good esk kar gazed along the parapet grond these men are exhausted ill send fresh men up and you move these men down or theyll be too tired to fight he swung down again to the ground someone shouted his name esk kar saw alexar running toward him with archers taken from the other walls ten men in all replace the men on the top of the gate theyll be needed soon to use the stones as well alexar nodded and moved off shouting orders and esk kar moved to the base of the gate esk kar laid his hand on the structure but felt nothing the fire roared louder now and he saw thick greasy smoke flowing over the top the shimmering flames leapt higher than the gate grond remained on the top making sure the men kept tossing stones while on the lower parapet men risked arrows to hurl water through the arrow slits nevertheless the oil soaked wood continued to burn and the alur meriki kept bringing up more and more bundles of dry grass to feed the burning gate esk kar watched as the flames steadily ate away at the gates beams but no villagers left their labors and more men and women kept coming carrying anything that could be used as a weapon despite the confusion everyone was doing their duty he saw a break in the line of men carrying water up to the parapet grasping a bucket esk kar carried it to the upper parapet then poured it over the side where grond pointed another voice shouted for esk kars attention he looked over to see sisuthros standing at the back of the south tower captain theyre massing their warriors sisuthros shouted cupping his hands to make sure his voice carried theyre bringing up a ram getting ready to attack esk kar wiped sweat from his brow and took a look keeping his head back far enough so that the bowmen below couldnt see him he studied the men moving into position something looked different esk kar moved his head a little higher then dropped down as an arrow snapped through the slit and glanced off his helmet grond i need to see this esk kar snatched up a shield and raised it over the gate holding it an inch or two above the top ignoring the arrows that thudded into it behind the shield he rose almost to his full height the barbarians were massing across the ditch forming a v shaped line of shields and wagons that curved slightly away from the ditch the alur meriki had concentrated their fighters here drawing most of their warriors away from the other walls and focusing their attention on the gate the attackers were betting all on breaking through here sisuthros joined him ive ordered every man i could from the rest of the walls he gasped and told maldar and the others to do the same esk kar noticed fresh soldiers arriving on the parapet each one carrying a basket of stones in addition to his bow keep the towers at full strength have them start killing the warriors at the base of the gate even if they have to lean out to do it weve got to drive them away from the gate raising his voice esk kar shouted to the defenders hold fast more soldiers are coming and the barbarians are weakening a few cheered but most just looked at him exhaustion and despair in their faces but no one stopped working and then as bowmen began arriving they appeared to take heart esk kar climbed down to the first parapet creaking and swaying even more ominously as the ropes continued to stretch a great shout came from outside the gate after a quick look esk kar ducked his head back for once no arrows flew in through the slit though he heard at least one strike the gate nearby oraks archers were taking their toll but a mass of barbarians at least sixty or seventy warriors had moved forward into the ditch carrying with them a great ram made from a huge tree trunk the ram swayed beneath a wooden frame suspended by a mass of ropes warriors carrying shields held high protected those who bore the burden and the ram reached the base of the gate without falling to the earth soon it would begin hammering the structure where the fire had done the most damage the fire weakened wood couldnt take too many blows from something that size a renewed storm of alur meriki arrows flew at any target that exposed itself as the attackers tried to protect the warriors carrying the ram the sound of hammering made him look down at least twenty villagers labored there men with mauls nailed a notched plank into position others struggling under the weight of a beam moved forward to angle the log into the notch carpenters immediately began hammering it home fastening the beam to the plank everyone ignored the thick black smoke curling around their feet though many began coughing choking on the stench of the burning oil suddenly the gate shook as if a mighty fist had struck it two men cried out as they lost their balance and toppled backward from the upper parapet esk kar might have followed but for gronds huge hand covered in blood that reached over and grasped him esk kar had barely recovered before another blow struck the gate risking another glance through the slit esk kar saw a near solid wall of shields protecting those manning the ram the attackers might be taking terrible losses but they fought on he hadnt killed enough to make them lose hope give up before they broke through the gate reeled again this time accompanied by the sound of splintering wood villagers screamed at each other to hurry do what you can here grond but dont stay too long be off the parapet before it falls the gates going to be forced im going down to get the men ready once again esk kar swung off the parapet holding for a moment until he could drop all the way to the ground he landed heavily enough to fall to his knees getting to his feet he stared at the base of the gate the ram was breaking through the heavy beam hammered in place on the left side of the gate only moments ago had already been knocked out of position and the rams head had crashed through part of the planking that supported it maldar ran up with another half dozen men bows in hand form a line here maldar esk kar ordered the gate shuddered again a section of the lower parapet gave way sending men scrambling to avoid its imminent collapse esk kar studied the gate watching it vibrate every few moments as the ram struck again and again in a powerful rhythm the leftmost portion looked weakest but the right side stood mostly intact its main brace firmly in position corio his eyes streaming from the smoke tripped over the fallen beam esk kar seized his arm and pulled him to his feet corio brace the upper parapet before it collapses too or well have no men manning the slits see if you can keep it in place even if they break through underneath hurry esk kar gave the man no time to reply just shoved him on his way another file of five soldiers arrived and esk kar called them to him shouting for shields grond came scrambling down from the upper parapet with two of esk kars original bodyguards wiping the sweat out of his eyes esk kar turned to his men give your bows to the villagers and find shields well need swords and spears for this work grond pointed the two guards toward weapons stored against the nearest house they returned in moments carrying four shields esk kar looked back at the gate the left side of the once solid gate had splintered badly the giant logs weakened by axe and fire trembled and shook from the rams mighty blows a glance at the towers and walls on each side showed them crowded with archers desperately trying to stop the rammers they would be too late the alur meriki were going to open a breach but it might not be a large opening and maybe it could be held as he watched the leftmost side of the lower parapet swung down with a screech of nails and snapping of ropes accompanied by the shouts of men who jumped or tumbled to the ground it collapsed slowly and dropped directly in front of the opening the same blow pitched two men off the upper platform as it swayed precariously from its ropes that platform still held though it shook and rattled under each blow of the ram the ram crashed against the gate once again and this time its fire hardened tip penetrated the wooden structure as the rams head withdrew some of the archers fired at the opening and esk kar heard a scream from the other side keep shooting he ordered moving well away from the gap as the archers loosed a volley a few shafts going through the narrow jagged opening then the ram repositioned slightly smashed into the next set of vertical logs four more times the ram struck before another log snapped in two the ramming stopped for a moment as warriors with axes pried at the weakened logs then the ram began its hammering again it took less than a dozen strokes before another pair of logs gave way the din increased as more axes hammered at the loosened logs widening the aperture a warrior tried to climb through the breach and was riddled with arrows that knocked him backward from sheer force of impact esk kar gripped his shield and drew his sword then turned to grond and the bodyguards we have to stop them here they cant be allowed past the gate he grabbed the nearest bodyguard and shouted in his ear make sure the archers hold their fire when we move to the breach go the man nodded and raced back to the line of archers who stayed in their rough line still loosening their arrows at the opening alur meriki shields appeared pushed through the breach protecting the attackers massing behind them esk kar and grond gave out mighty shouts and rushed toward the gap the attackers shoved their way through the narrow opening crouching low and using their shields to avoid the defenders arrows rushing forward esk kar had no time to worry about an arrow in his back from his own men raising his shield to his eyes he took four quick steps and crashed against the shield of the first alur meriki warrior caught off balance the man reacted slowly stumbling in the jumble of beams and splinters and esk kar took a half step back and swung the great sword down on the warriors head again esk kar lowered his shoulder behind his shield and shoved with all his might pushing the dead body into the man behind him battle fury took all of them as esk kar grond and four soldiers formed a half circle around the breach and defended it with a ferocity that surprised the attackers the defenders were fresher while the attackers had been working the ram or ducking arrows in the hot sun without water for nearly two hours the first wave of alur meriki fell back driven by the vicious blows of esk kar and his companions but as the defenders exulted a second horde of screaming attackers seeing victory within their grasp fought their way through the opening a gap that grew wider as the enemy outside kept hammering away with their axes these attackers wielded lances as well as swords they quickly widened the half circle of warriors who had pushed through the opening eskkar struck again and again using his shield to turn their swords and spears and striking at anything within reach of his great sword suddenly a loud voice behind them commanded down esk kar and his men responded by habit so well trained were they dropping to one knee and ducking their heads under their shields a wave of arrows flashed over their heads instantly esk kar and the others arose theyd practiced this tactic so often that now they did it without thinking the volley had stopped the invaders for a moment esk kar and his men behind their shields and thrusting with their swords attacked the wavering men before they could recover forcing the warriors back the besiegers gave ground for a moment but once again fresh warriors pushed their way through the ever widening breach into orak esk kar and his swordsmen anticipated the next command and when the shout of down came again they dropped letting another flight of arrows cross over them before they rose and again rushed the barbarians the alur meriki hesitated taken aback by this strange tactic not used to fighting swordsmen and archers at the same time before they could recover grond pushed his way nearly back to the breach carrying a dead man pinned to his shield and hurling the body into the opening swinging his sword over his head esk kar brought it crashing down with all his strength on a warriors shield slicing through it and into the mans arm more defenders surrounded him a spearman pushed in front of eskkar even as fresh swordsmen arrived twenty swords now blocked the opening but surprisingly no new attackers tried to force the breach so esk kar stepped back and looked up at the gate the upper parapet hung crookedly from its supports but men continued to hurl stones down on their attackers only now they shouted with glee and worked with renewed energy something strange was happening but he had no idea what esk kar turned to grond hold them here he needed to see what had happened in the ditch racing to the right side of the gate he dashed up the steps nearly knocking over two men carrying baskets of rocks up to the defenders and continued all the way to the parapet he felt it sway precariously under his weight and hoped it would hold a while longer this time esk kar didnt bother with a shield just looked over the top of the gate standing back to be out of sight of any archers beneath him what he saw stunned him warriors were turning back moving away from the ditch and running to the rear others backed away more slowly firing their bows as they retreated from the sides of the village horsemen galloped back toward the plain urging their horses hard and ignoring the fi ght at the gate to his surprise they didnt slow their mounts even when they passed out of range of oraks arrows they were racing back to their camp but he didnt understand why he squinted into the sun as he looked toward the highest hilltop ignoring the sweat that ran into his eyes that looked different too more than a dozen smoke trails rose into the cloudless sky from the alur meriki camp the fires themselves couldnt be seen but they burned near the northern portion of the alur meriki main camp he saw movement all over the hilltop more men came running down the hills toward orak to join the battle no by the gods they were women women running away from the camp and dozens of riderless horses galloped toward orak as well something had stampeded the animals another movement something different caught his eye and he strained to make out what it was on the crest of one of the highest hills a lone horseman stood wheeling his horse and waving his lance high attached to the lance hung a long streamer even at this distance esk kar could make out its yellow color as it rippled in the breeze the rider waved it for a few more moments ignoring the rapidly approaching horsemen before he leisurely turned away and galloped over the hilltop and out of sight what is it sisuthros stood at his side breathing hard his left arm covered in blood whats happening esk kar tried to laugh but his dry throat wouldnt permit more than a cackle a wheezing villager came behind him with a bucket of water destined for the fire below esk kar grabbed it and poured it over his face filling his mouth at the same time cant you see sisuthros he answered when hed slacked his thirst that was subutai and by the gods hes ridden clean through their camp theyll catch him for sure wont they sisuthross voice showed concern esk kar turned his gaze back to the vacant hilltop he laughed now his throat refreshed subutais not that foolish im sure he put his horse to a full gallop the instant he left the hilltop hell have a hard run to escape them but hell make it he must have raided the camp burned some tents stampeded the horses and made sure the alur meriki knew he was there thats what made them abandon the attack knowing that their women and children were at risk they dont know how few men attacked their camp they stood there in silence esk kar watched as the last of the alur meriki scrambled out of the ditch and began to run as fast as they could to the rear many dropped swords and weapons in their haste trying to outrace the angry arrows chasing them shafts struck down a few of them as the defenders showed no mercy and lost no opportunity to take their targets a broad trail of bodies arrows protruding from their backs marked the fl ight of the barbarians the sight saddened him and he felt strangely glad when the last escaped out of range many paused to shake their fists at orak and its defenders their anger and frustration all too evident others just knelt in the dust to catch their breath too tired from fighting and running even to call curses upon their enemies cheers echoed along the wall ragged and hoarse growing louder as those away from the gate grasped what happened esk kar watched the retreat and counted the lines of smoke climbing into the hot sky the smoke streams merged making it difficult but he guessed at least thirty fires had been set not a great number but enough to send a lot of smoke into the sky subutai wouldnt have many men but one horseman carrying a torch could do much in little time subutai must have prepared his men carefully hed learned well that lesson esk kar wondered how many more men subutai had lost and hoped the number was small even if the alur meriki had no force of warriors guarding the camp there would have been a few boys and old men who could draw a bow subutais men faced a long and hard ride to the north with at least a hundred warriors pursuing them could we have held them off without subutais attack blood dripped from sisuthross cheek the old wound had reopened probably from all the shouting well well never know for sure but i think we might have held them their bowmens fire was weakening still he realized the cheering had taken a different note the shouts of joy remained but now a new simple cry began to rise up esk kar esk kar esk kar the crowd roared and in a moment it sounded as if the whole village had but one voice he turned and looked down into the village it seemed like every man woman and child had come there jammed into the open spaces and the lanes with more coming and others appearing on the housetops or the wall the shouts went on and on he noticed movement in the mass of people crowded below a half dozen soldiers pushed their way through the throng trella in their midst they had to force their way through the solid mass until the villagers saw who they escorted and let them pass the chant changed and trellas name too echoed from the walls esk kar looked at sisuthros and saw his subcommander had joined in the cheering ive never seen such a thing before esk kars words went unheard vanishing in the swell of sound then trella reached the steps eager hands guided her up the parapet until she reached esk kar he took her in his arms and held her tightly to another outburst of cheers when he let her go she clung to his side and shouted into his ear speak to them tell them what they want to hear he looked at her face calm and serene her head held high shed planned even for this esk kar raised both his arms and called for silence at fi rst they ignored him and shouts of esk kar and trella kept rising eventually they quieted down helped by those who wanted to hear what esk kar would say he shouted before they could begin again villagers soldiers we have driven off the barbarians another roar went up into the sky everyone shouting with all their strength esk kar had to wait a long time before he could continue weve done what no village has ever done now they will have to move on you fought bravely today now we must tend to our wounded and bury our dead because many good men have fought and died today we must rebuild orak bigger and stronger than ever before dozens of villagers cried out lead us protect us you must rule orak in moments every person in the village demanded the same thing soldiers waved their swords or bows as they shouted while villagers uplifted their arms even trella stepped aside and turned toward him lifting up her arms and joining in the exhortation of the mob esk kar raised his hand again and after another long burst of cheering the noise finally abated when he spoke he used all the voice he could muster his words carrying to all those below if you wish me to guide and protect you i will do so do you choose me to rule in orak this time the noise sounded like thunder oraks inhabitants yelling themselves hoarse with excitement and joy as well as relief at being delivered from the barbarians esk kar let it go on for a moment then raised his hands and called for silence then i will lead you theres much work to do but now we can begin the crowd cheered again esk kar stood there keeping his right arm raised in acknowledgment it took a long time before the voices began to die down now back to your tasks he shouted and turned away from the crowd he led trella down the parapet at the base of the gate corio bantor and gatus waited esk kar gave instructions to secure the gate tend to the wounded and bury the dead there would be no rest yet for the villagers they had to rebuild the gate and secure it before nightfall esk kar told gatus to send archers back to the walls post sentries and keep the soldiers alert when esk kar finally finished giving these and a dozen other orders trella faced him now that everything is being done as you command we must walk through the village and speak to as many of the people as you can he took her hand smiling for the first time in days and what am i to say to the people thank each of them for their work today and in the past months tell them how much our success today depended on their efforts say that in as many different ways as you can a group of women approached carrying cloths soaked in water they washed the blood and dirt from esk kars body one of them kneeling to clean his feet and sandals then surrounded by the hawk clan he and trella walked through orak they went down every lane and stopped at nearly every house esk kar accepted thanks and praise while he repeated the same messagethat orak owed it all to them that they were the real victors and that he thanked the gods for their help while they walked messengers still came to him with questions or requests for orders he answered these but trella refused to let him abandon the walk this is more important she told him when he grew impatient now when the victory is fresh in their minds you must win them to your side once again theyll be your power in the coming months until were truly secure as oraks rulers theyll remember your words of praise and gratitude forever he sighed but kept smiling trella who planned for everything had foreseen and planned this moment as well so he felt prepared for his task as they moved through the lanes several of the women bantors wife among them preceded their way encouraging the people suggesting to them what to say and shouting blessings to them even at the moment of victory trella guided and directed the villagers moving the common people to her will he shook his head in wonderment but kept the smile on his face as he gave thanks to the people holding tight to trellas hand by sunset esk kar swore hed spoken with every man and woman inside oraks walls a task that exhausted him almost as much as the mornings fighting while he thanked the villagers his men worked or cared for the wounded later trella served a simple dinner with no thought of a celebration feast too many had died and angry warriors remained camped beyond the hills esk kar wanted to rest but despite the long and strenuous day he felt restless he decided to take one last look at the alur meriki camp taking trellas hand and accompanied by four guards they walked through the lanes ignoring the revelry by the time they reached the tower the crowd had disappeared they climbed the steps that still stank from all the blood shed from the top they looked out over the empty fields that reeked of death beneath them corios men worked on the gate in the fading light though fires made from alur meriki shields had already been lit craftsmen hammered steadily adding so much wood to the gate that it appeared twice as thick as before they used lumber left behind by the barbarians the thrifty master artisan had brought everything usable inside the village sisuthros had cleared the ditch of the enemy dead though on the far side bodies still lay where they had fallen that task had taken most of the afternoon they stripped the bodies of their valuables weapons and clothes before dumping them in the river the ditch had been swept smooth the ruts and holes filled and debris removed theyd recovered the arrows and stones as well the weapons had been inspected cleaned and readied for the next attack and the stones again stacked in readiness oraks dead lay in orderly rows near the river gate tomorrow the ferry would be dragged out of the village and its ropes reconnected the initial cargo would be oraks dead to be buried in mass graves on the west bank earlier esk kar had received the count of enemy deadtheyd killed more than three hundred and seventy warriors today many more alur meriki would be suffering from wounds the long summer sun dipped below the western horizon behind them but enough light remained to let them see across to the hills campfires outlined the hills against the coming darkness across those hilltops a line of mounted barbarians stood guard watching the village it seems strange trella esk kar said after pointing them out now its they who fear we may attack them not so strange husband in the last few months you killed nearly eight hundred of them and wounded many more theyve learned a bitter lesson half of their fighting men are dead even the alur meriki cannot ignore such losses youre sure they wont attack again everyone just assumes the battle is over he stood behind her and wrapped his arms around her waist no the siege is broken theyve lost too many men and too much equipment even their horses have been scattered again it would take them weeks to get ready for another attack and theyre already late in their journey south besides the warriors have no stomach for another assault without a new plan thutmose sin or whoever leads them dares not propose another assault unless he can guarantee victory they almost captured the gate didnt they might they just try that again she leaned her head back against his chest he felt her relax against him soft and warm in his arms and enjoyed the sensation no because we held them and they know in their hearts we could do it again they fear us now they wont underestimate us next time when they return in ten or fifteen years it will be different by then theyll have new plans and new warriors ready for a fresh challenge he thought about that for a moment in a way weve changed them as much as they have changed us theyll have to learn new ways of fighting knowledge of what weve done here will spread other villages will resist them her hands clasped his and again her strength surprised him yes other villages will try but they will fail theyll have no one with your strength and courage esk kar youre a great leader of soldiers and you understand how and why men fight the alur meriki came here not expecting any strong resistance they made no real preparations to capture the village even though they knew we were building a wall you were always a step ahead of them you anticipated their plans and they never caught up with yours no other man in orak could have accomplished what you did in the last few months you have truly won a great victory her hands caressed his but more important than that is what you have become more than anyone youve changed into someone better someone wiser and without you id have failed esk kar replied you made the villagers work organized the craftsmen got the people to support me and kept the nobles at bay without you there would be no victory every soldier that fought today knows that she stayed silent for a moment today many may know that but in a few months only your name will be spoken as conqueror of the barbarians only the victors in battle are remembered it seems i suppose that is a good thing she turned in his arms and faced him placing her hands on his shoulders she looked into his eyes do you truly wish to rule here in orak husband ruling the village will be different from planning for a siege it will be even more difficult a new wall much higher and stronger must be built and it must encompass twice as much land as does this one you will be building walls for many years as well as training men to defend them there will be more battles to fight and not just against barbarians others from distant lands may come against us to guard orak and make sure we are safe you will have to take control of all of the land surrounding us every farm and village for great distances in every direction it will be hard work even for a great leader of men but if you wish to rule then we must begin tomorrow its a task that may last a lifetime what you ask wont be easy its one thing to fight from behind a wall it is another to carry war to distant places and defeat your enemies in their own lands i have no doubt that you will find new ways of making war but those battles are in the future first you must decide whether you wish to rule here he gazed into her eyes in the gathering darkness she was asking him to rule but he knew without saying the words they would rule together that she would decide many of the rules and customs that would govern oraks daily life she would select who would have power and who would not and he would need to listen to her advice many of his soldiers and the villagers would know the truththat she ruled as much as he esk kar would see it in their eyes every day none of that mattered anymore hed accomplished enough even his fathers death had been avenged no one would ever forget his name now besides all of orak knew trella was touched by the gods that she was truly a gifted one there would be no shame in sharing power with her they would rule together or she offered as his silence began to lengthen we can leave orak in a few weeks she lowered her voice and rested her head against his chest we can take gold and men and go wherever you wish youd leave the village with me to go wandering around the countryside risking danger every day she laughed and the bright sound rang out across the tower ive risked my life every day for the last six months ive been enslaved sold given away stabbed and nearly killed would there be any more danger out there than that he squeezed her to him again much too late he knew for such a choice besides he remained as much in her spell tonight as that first night when she came into his arms his fate had been sealed then and his life would revolve around her until the spell was broken or until one of them died and perhaps not even then if the gods promise of an afterlife held true well stay trella and we both of us will rule in orak he reached out to touch the wall before him the gritty feeling oddly satisfying our blood is already in these walls youre right there must be a new wall greater than this trella laid her hand on top of his the wall will hold our voices for a hundred years perhaps even two hundred as long as the wall stands around orak well be remembered she turned her head slightly to look up at him i can help you rule over a great village you will guide me in all things and i will protect you he barely heard her next words so softly did she speak them protect us esk kar i carry your child now you must protect both of us he lifted her chin up and looked into her eyes as hed done that first night youre with child when were you planning on telling me if orak fell then there was no need i didnt want to give you something else to worry about its still months away but im certain i carry our child annok sur agrees she turned again still staying within his arms but now she faced out toward the fields deep shadows hid the dead bodies scattered across the plain except for the faint glow from behind the hill the darkness was nearly complete fewer campfires would burn tonight esk kar knew theres so much to do esk kar you must control the soldiers establish outposts and villages up and down the river overcome those who resist and plan for the next barbarian migration she sighed the livestock and grain must be brought back from across the river there will be more fighting esk kar but in the future youll be leading it not fighting yourself not ever again in all the time weve been together ive asked you for nothing for myself but this you must promise me the great sword must stay in your scabbard that might not be such a bad thing esk kar decided his thoughts flashing back to that terrible fight in the alur meriki camp he was getting old even among the steppes people hard fighting was best left to the young he brushed away such thoughts from his mind ill leave the fighting to others he said finally unable to keep a hint of regret from his words but ill keep your sword at my side in case its needed he took a breath and you will have to decide how to rule orak what customs and decrees will come to pass what families to ennoble how we will get enough gold to pay for the soldiers and for rebuilding orak and everything else we will need i see theres as much work in keeping power as winning it yes there is much for you to do trella the sun had set completely now the darkness before them stretched all the way to the hills when she spoke the question surprised him what would you name our child should the babe be a son he thought a moment then shrugged i know only barbarian names and theyre not fit for our son who will rule orak after us and villager names are as one to me do you have a name that you would choose id like to honor my father since i owe so much to him his name was sargat if you allow we could name our son after him esk kar still getting used to the idea of being a father considered her request thoughtfully even among villagers naming a son was the husbands responsibility and not something to be passed off lightly but her fathers name did not convey the qualities of a leader it was an ordinary name used by many esk kar knew some names had power of their own as certain words had influence over men he had no preference for any name himself but still sargat its a good name but a common one our son should have a name that shows strength and power he thought again the name sargat had no equivalent in his native tongue but if he had to translate it suppose we call him sargon thats a name that i havent heard before and it seems to me to carry strength would that honor your father sargon she repeated saying the strange name aloud as if listening for the gods to approve sargon yes that is a fine new name and it honors my father as well he will be called sargon and hell give honor both to his grandfather and his father sargon who will rule the village of orak he repeated no orak is no longer a village it has grown into something greater it is a city with a wall and brave men to defend it a city that will grow in strength and have greatness of its own for the first time villagers and farmers joined together and resisted the barbarians who knows what we can do in the future it should have its own name then a new name like the name of our son esk kar suggested maybe we can think of a new name for orak as well can you choose a new name for orak then a name that will make them forget the old village and instead remind them of you and your victories esk kar kept silent for a long time thinking about names of places trella as always let him take his time when i was a boy we spent part of a summer far to the north by a tiny stream we called the akkad i saw my first lion there it was the last happy time i had with my family he smiled to himself at the distant memory how does akkad sound for the name of our city akkad akkad esk kar of akkad sargon of akkad yes its a strong name esk kar like your own perhaps the lion spirit will approve and give his protection to both sargon and the city of akkad but lets not tell the others yet what new name we plan for orak the new name can come in its own time when everyone sees what we have accomplished so the city of akkad would come to be in a few months or whenever she thought it was ready he understood her reasons the village had endured so much change in the past months with more to come it would be wise to let them get used to some things gradually a cool breeze rustled through the stillness and for a moment the air smelled clean and fresh he heard the bodyguards waiting below to give them privacy shifting their feet probably impatient to join the revelry since there is to be so much work tomorrow then perhaps you could find time tonight to please your husband his hands moved up from her waist and he cupped her breasts and squeezed them enjoying the feel of her body through her dress that too hadnt changed from their first night her body the scent of her hair even her smile still excited him or have you already forgotten your wifely duties she leaned her head back and placed her hands atop his and pressed them to her no master i await your pleasure her voice was soft and her tone as seductive as that first night in his bed only now she sounded happier than hed ever heard her esk kar shook his head at the mystery of women sometimes i wonder girl who was the master and who was the slave her answering laugh sounded low and enticing and they turned away from the darkened battleground and its dead they faced the village brightly lit by many torches and fires as the villagers celebrated their deliverance his village now no his city and someday if his luck stayed true and the gods approved it would be his sons but tonighttonight there would be more magic and tomorrow would take care of itself epilogue the war drum sounded faint at first then growing in intensity and changing into a rolling thunder as a second and third merged in the rapid strokes summoning every soldier and villager to his post esk kars feeling of contentment vanished in an instant as fear and doubt rushed through him the bench flew backward as he rose from the table he grabbed his sword from the wall as he ran down the stairs and out into the courtyard a quick thinking soldier brought out esk kars horse he leapt astride the animal and galloped out of the courtyard racing through the lanes scattering stunned and fearful villagers as he burst past them at oraks main gate soldiers milled about in confusion cursing as they gathered weapons and climbed to their stations esk kar jumped down from the still moving animal dashed into the tower and raced up the steps emerging into the sunlight he found gatus waiting gatus pointed to the east and esk kars eyes took in the still barren plain he saw the warriors lined up across one of the hilltops to the southeast automatically he began to count them but gatus saved him the trouble about sixty of them id say the old soldier spat over the wall not enough to attack us not yet the distant warriors sat on their horses staring in silence at orak and its wall or perhaps at the dead bodies of their kinsmen still littering the landscape moments passed but the horsemen made no move just waited patiently as if expecting something to happen esk kar felt just as confused as his men four days after the alur meriki failed to capture the gate they broke camp and moved off to the south three days had passed since then and he didnt understand why their horsemen would be back raiding around orak they had exhausted what little grass had grown back and the barbarians lacked the strength to assault orak again nevertheless none of oraks inhabitants dared leave the safety of its walls to return to their farms so a raiding party didnt make sense the center of the line of horsemen parted the grand standard of the chief of the alur meriki rose up from behind the hilltop preceding another handful of riders the warriors closed behind their leader as he passed through surveying the scene before him the great chief sat on his horse in front of the standard the only movement was the wheeling of crows and vultures circling over the bodies of his dead warriors finally he began to move forward and the whole line of warriors followed all riding slowly down the hill at the bottom they set their horses to a canter and rode through the ruined fields toward the village they stopped just out of bowshot as esk kar watched the clans sarrum paced his horse a few steps forward he drew his sword and raised it high over his head the bronze blade flashed golden in the sun as the sarrum taking his time moved the sword from side to side from horizon to horizon three times then he lifted it toward the sky once again he held it there for a few seconds before lowering his arm until the blade pointed straight toward the tower where esk kar stood the words just carried across the gap between them esk kar cocked his head to hear but he understood them well enough esk kar ignored the murmur that moved across the wall as each man asked his companion what the words meant esk kar climbed onto the face of the tower feet spread out and balanced precariously on the narrow ledge the thickness of the towers wall tapered near the top and he barely had enough room to place his feet gatus grasped his captains belt from behind keeping a firm grip on his leader drawing his sword from its scabbard esk kar held it up to the sky for a long moment whirled it three times around his head then lowered the tip until it pointed directly at the alur meriki leader esk kar took a deep breath and bellowed his response in the barbarian tongue the harsh words echoing out over the empty plain between them the great chief thrust his sword once more up to the sky sunlight again glinting off the blade then drew it down sheathed it and turned his mount without a glance back he put the horse to a gallop his men wheeling their mounts around as they followed him the grand standard waving in the breeze esk kar watched as they rode back up the hill crossed the top and disappeared once vanished from sight it was as if they had never existed he sheathed his blade and jumped lightly down from the wall what did he say gatus couldnt keep the curiosity out of his voice what did you say i heard your name men packed the top of the tower his commanders soldiers with their weapons even a few villagers fear showing on their faces everyone stared at him mouths agape he said i am thutmose sin leader of the alur meriki esk kar shook his head in disbelief somehow thutmose sin survived how he managed that the gods must favor him gatus stepped closer to his commander what else did he say esk kar took one last look at the empty hill before answering raising his voice so that all could hear he said you fought bravely but it is not yet finished we will return another day nervous whispers ran through the crowd at the threat and gatus had to lift his voice to be heard and your answer i told him i am esk kar son of hogarthak that i had repaid the alur meriki for my familys blood and never to come to these lands again the soldiers nearby turned to repeat their captains words breaking into cheers and yelling their approval a smile crossed esk kars face though there was no warmth in his eyes he lowered his voice so that only gatus could catch his words and i said ill be waiting for him the end of the beginning historical footnote and so began the era of walled cities others sprang up across the land each fortifi ed with its own great wall and surrounded by farms and herds each a center of local trade and industry these cities contended with one another for supremacy for many thousands of years with power shifting from one to another and back again but less than seven hundred years after the battle of orak in approximately bce armies united under the ruler of the city of akkad swept over all the lands to the south occupied by those who called themselves sumerians the akkadians defeated the sumerians and ruled over them for many years the akkadians had achieved their victories primarily through the skill and strength of well organized infantry equipped with powerful bows and trained in siege warfare it was historys first recorded use of an army of foot soldiers skilled in the use of the bow the land the akkadians conquered and ruled became known to the western nations as mesopotamia the land between the rivers leading this first conquest was the first great king in recorded history his name was sargon and he built the worlds fi rst empire uniting by conquest not only his own lands but also the lands surrounding mesopotamia eventually his son also named sargon would extend the empires reach as far as the shores of the mediterranean sea to the west and india to the east from these places the influence and power of walled cities would spread to many new lands including one that would come to be called greece the greeks would learn much from their eastern neighbors and build many walled cities of their own one of which would be called athens in the east the great walled city of akkad would endure for many many generations even after the shifting of the tigris gave rise to an even greater city called babylon that would raise its walls higher than any other but that is another story
