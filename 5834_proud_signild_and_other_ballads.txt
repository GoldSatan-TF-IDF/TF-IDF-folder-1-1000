never expect thou to me wilt be good the child by the small of the leg she has taen and against the bed side she has beat out its brain now i the proud signild have slain man for man and ill hie me away to my land and my clan the damsel of the wood the knight takes hawk and the man takes hound and away to the good greenwood they rambled there beasts both great and small they found amid the forest glades that gambold a hind neath a linden tree he spied a maid beneath the willows sitting the knight outspread his mantle wide within that spot for love so fitting and there throughout the night they lie and no one sought their rest to trouble the linden tree so charmingly conceals them with its foliage noble no sooner dawned the morning light and early cocks commenced their crowing the damsel pats on his breast the knight sweet love you must be up and going ride oer the brig at full career and oer the verdant meadows hurry my brothers seven youll meet i fear so full of courage strength and fury if seven or ten thy brothers be each full of courage strength and beauty if a comrade good they seek in me i trust i know a comrades duty and if me theyll have as a brother dear their brother straight to be im willing but they shall win the victory neer if bent my youthful blood on spilling o dearest heart with tears i pray that thou wilt not go lightly nigh them but ride about another way far distant off thou mayst descry them o neer at court shall it be said that i a knight for warriors sevenor ten times seven the straight road fled to match them all i trust in heaven his sword to his side the warrior tied and then himself in his acton casing a fond adieu to the damsel cried who sadly stood behind him gazing the youth despising all alarms with spur so keen his courser urges seven knights he meets in burnished arms from out the wood as he emerges ha early met thou warrior good pray tell us what thou hast been doing o i have been to the good greenwood with hound and hawk the deer pursuing where is thy hawk and greyhound say thy silvan spoil we pray thee show it a good friend came across my way and on that friend i did bestow it no knight will part with his prey so light for which in wood hes toiled and panted with a maiden bright you slept last night her brothers leave nor sought nor granted to chase the dun deer sirs i rode full little of your sister knowing the first fair deer itself that showed i chased with heart and bosom glowing it crouched beneath my scarlet cloak it pleased me sirs beyond all measure with thanks to heaven the gift i took and made me happy with my treasure i let my hounds the wild deer chase i thought but little of their capture but i took the hind to my embrace what moments then of bliss and rapture of all the worlds fair maids was she the fairest both in face and carriage if she sir knights your sister be i beg your sisters hand in marriage a faithful brother i will be and in your cause i death will suffer and her ill hold in respect and love and nothing more a knight can proffer thou shalt not get the maid for mate but thou shalt die thou knight enamourd so make thy shrift neath the linden straight the little birds shall hear it stammerd now wilt thou stand or wilt thou fly into the deep wood for protection or guard thy young life valiantly to prove thy courage and affection o i will stand nor craven flyunto the murky wood for cover ill guard my life right valiantly and thus ill prove me worthy of her first one he slew then quickly two his knightly courage well displayd he but though his seven foes he slew with his own life full dearly paid he when the tidings reached the maidens ear she let fall briny tears in plenty but if for her kin she shed one tear she shed i ween for the bold

gage that i lure the fair mettie this night twas late in the evening mist fell from the skies sir olaf he plays in his very best guise sir olaf he plays on his gold harp a strain that heard the proud mettie far over the plain sir olaf a tune on his golden horn blew to the house of fair mettie the thrilling sounds flew long stood the fair mettie and listened thereto now shall i or not to that hornplayer go long stood damsel mettie in doubt and in care no one of my maidens take with me i dare the maid and the little brown messan her friend through the paths of the forest so lonely they wend her mantle of blue the fair mettie puts on and unto the bower of sir olaf shes goneon the door of the chamber she gave a low knock sir olaf i pray thee arise and unlock o none have i summoned to me at this hour and unto no one will i open my door sir olaf arise let me in i request at what i have heard im so sorely distrest at what thou hast heard be thou glad or distrest thou comest not into my bower of rest but soon should the door to thee open i wot provided sir peter thy sweetheart were not although in my heart i may love thee full dear sir peter for me to admit thees too near sir olaf

the mead so back by thyself to thy chamber proceed the maid and the little brown messan her friend they home through the forest so lonely must wend and when to the gate of the castle she came sir peter was leaning against it his frame thrice welcome thrice welcome thou proud mettelil say where hast thou been in the night season still i walked out my lord by no mortal eye seen and i gathered the herbs both the blue and the green the herbs i collected with diligent hand which just at this season in fullest bloom stand i stood in the meadows throughout the long night and harked to the nightingales song with delight no not to the song from the nightingales throat but unto sir olaf his gilded horns note this nights walk and others of similar sort will make thee the subject of common report the walk of this night and perhaps many more by the saints my fair mettie this walking give oer now hear thou proud mettie to bed hie away and neath the white linen thy fair body lay depart to thy bed that i rede thee to do wouldst have me remain to thee tender and trueive lost now my courser the steady and tried because thou hast proved thee a false fickle bride and what became of her no man ever knew nor whither her ashes before the wind flew but as soon as her bower in ruddy flame blazed in the breast of sir peter such anguish was raised sir peter he grieved to his very death day sir olaf neer ventured to cross his friends way i counsel each swain in affectionate part to tempt not too hardly the maid of his heart
