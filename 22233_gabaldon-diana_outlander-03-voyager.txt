margaret ball paul solyn diane engel david chaifetz and many others for being interested providing useful discussion and laughing in the right places prologue when i was small i never wanted to step in puddles not because of any fear of drowned worms or wet stockings i was by and large a grubby child with a blissful disregard for filth of any kind it was because i couldnt bring myself to believe that that perfect smooth expanse was no more than a thin film of water over solid earth i believed it was an opening into some fathomless space sometimes seeing the tiny ripples caused by my approach i thought the puddle impossibly deep a bottomless sea in which the lazy coil of tentacle and gleam of scale lay hidden with the threat of huge bodies and sharp teeth adrift and silent in the fardown depths and then looking down into reflection i would see my own round face and frizzled hair against a featureless blue sweep and think instead that the puddle was the entrance to another sky if i stepped in there i would drop at once and keep on falling on and on into blue space the only time i would dare to walk through a puddle was at twilight when the evening stars came out if i looked in the water and saw one lighted pinprick there i could splash through unafraidfor if i should fall into the puddle and on into space i could grab hold of the star as i passed and be safe even now when i see a puddle in my path my mind halfhaltsthough my feet do notthen hurries on with only the echo of the thought left behind what if this time you fall part one battle and the loves of men the corbies feast many a highland chieftain fought many a gallant man did fall death itself were dearly bought all for scotlands king and law will ye no come back again april he was dead however his nose throbbed painfully which he thought odd in the circumstances while he placed considerable trust in the understanding and mercy of his creator he harbored that residue of elemental guilt that made all men fear the chance of hell still all he had ever heard of hell made him think it unlikely that the torments reserved for its luckless inhabitants could be restricted to a sore nose on the other hand this couldnt be heaven on several counts for one he didnt deserve it for another it didnt look it and for a third he doubted that the rewards of the blessed included a broken nose any more than those of the damned while he had always thought of purgatory as a gray sort of place the faint reddish light that hid everything around him seemed suitable his mind was clearing a bit and his power to reason was coming back if slowly someone he thought rather crossly ought to see him and tell him just what the sentence was until he should have suffered enough to be purified and at last to enter the kingdom of god whether he was expecting a demon or an angel was uncertain he had no idea of the staffing requirements of purgatory it wasnt a matter the dominie had addressed in his schooldays while waiting he began to take stock of whatever other torments he might be required to endure there were numerous cuts gashes and bruises here and there and he was fairly sure hed broken the fourth finger of his right hand againdifficult to protect it the way it stuck out so stiff with the joint frozen none of that was too bad though what else claire the name knifed across his heart with a pain that was more racking than anything his body had ever been called on to withstand if he had had an actual body anymore he was sure it would have doubled up in agony he had known it would be like this when he sent her back to the stone circle spiritual anguish could be taken as a standard condition in purgatory and he had expected all along that the pain of separation would be his chief punishmentsufficient he thought to atone for anything hed ever done murder and betrayal included he did not know whether persons in purgatory were allowed to pray or not but tried anyway lord he prayed that she may be safe she and the child he was sure she would have made it to the circle itself only two months gone with child she was still light and fleet of footand the most stubbornly determined woman he had ever met but whether she had managed the dangerous transition back to the place from which she had comesliding precariously through whatever mysterious layers lay between then and now powerless in the grip of the rockthat he could never know and the thought of it was enough to make him forget even the throbbing in his nose he resumed his interrupted inventory of bodily ills and became inordinately distressed at the discovery that his left leg appeared to be missing sensation stopped at the hip with a sort of pinsandneedles tingling at the joint presumably he would get it back in due time either when he finally arrived in heaven or at the least at judgment day and after all his brotherinlaw ian managed very well on the wooden peg he wore to replace his missing leg still his vanity was troubled ah that must be it a punishment meant to cure him of the sin of vanity he mentally set his teeth determined to accept whatever came to him with fortitude and such humility as he could manage still he couldnt help reaching an exploratory hand or whatever he was using for a hand tentatively downward to see just where the limb now ended the hand struck something hard and the fingers tangled in wet snarled hair he sat up abruptly and with some effort cracked the layer of dried blood that had sealed his eyelids shut memory flooded back and he groaned aloud he had been mistaken this was hell but james fraser was unfortunately not dead after all the body of a man lay across his own its dead weight crushed his left leg explaining the absence of feeling the head heavy as a spent cannonball pressed facedown into his abdomen the dampmatted hair a dark spill on the wet linen of his shirt he jerked upward in sudden panic the head rolled sideways into his lap and a halfopen eye stared sightlessly up behind the sheltering strands of hair it was jack randall his fine red captains coat so dark with the wet it looked almost black jamie made a fumbling effort to push the body away but found himself amazingly weak his hand splayed feebly against randalls shoulder and the elbow of his other arm buckled suddenly as he tried to support himself he found himself lying once more flat on his back the sleeting sky pale gray and whirling dizzily overhead jack randalls head moved obscenely up and down on his stomach with each gasping breath he pressed his hands flat against the boggy groundthe water rose up cold through his fingers and soaked the back of his shirtand wriggled sideways some warmth was trapped between them as the limp dead weight slid slowly free the freezing rain struck his newly exposed flesh with a shock like a blow and he shivered violently with sudden chill as he squirmed on the ground struggling with the crumpled mudstained folds of his plaid he could hear sounds above the keening of the april wind faroff shouts and a moaning and wailing like the calling of ghosts in the wind and overall the raucous calling of crows dozens of crows from the sound that was strange he thought dimly birds shouldnt fly in a storm like this a final heave freed the plaid from under him and he fumbled it over his body as he reached to cover his legs he saw that his kilt and left leg were soaked with blood the sight didnt distress him it seemed only vaguely interesting the dark red smears a contrast to the grayish green of the moor plants around him the echoes of battle faded from his ears and he left culloden field to the calling of the crows he was wakened much later by the calling of his name fraser jamie fraser are ye here no he thought groggily im not wherever he had been while unconscious it was a better place than this he lay in a small declivity halffilled with water the sleeting rain had stopped but the wind hadnt it whined over the moor piercing and chilling the sky had darkened nearly to black it must be near evening then i saw him go down here i tell ye right near a big clump of gorse the voice was at a distance fading as it argued with someone there was a rustle near his ear and he turned his head to see the crow it stood on the grass a foot away a blotch of windruffled black feathers regarding him with a beadbright eye deciding that he posed no threat it swiveled its neck with casual ease and jabbed its thick sharp bill into jack randalls eye jamie jerked up with a cry of revulsion and a flurry of movement that sent the crow flapping off squawking with alarm ay over there there was a squelching through boggy ground and a face before him and the welcome feel of a hand on his shoulder hes alive come on macdonald dye lend a hand here hell no be walkin on his own there were four of them and with a good deal of effort they got him up arms draped helpless about the shoulders of ewan cameron and iain mackinnon he wanted to tell them to leave him his purpose had returned to him with the waking and he remembered that he had meant to die but the sweetness of their company was too much to resist the rest had restored the feeling in his dead leg and he knew the seriousness of the wound he would die soon in any case thank god that it need not be alone in the dark water the edge of the cup pressed against his lip and he roused himself long enough to drink careful not to spill it a hand pressed briefly against his forehead and dropped away without comment he was burning he could feel the flames behind his eyes when he closed them his lips were cracked and sore from the heat but it was better than the chills that came at intervals at least when he was fevered he could lie still the shaking of the chills woke the sleeping demons in his leg murtagh he had a terrible feeling about his godfather but no memory to give it shape murtagh was dead he knew that must be it but didnt know why or how he knew a good half of the highland army was dead slaughtered on the moorso much he had gathered from the talk of the men in the farmhouse but he had no memory of the battle himself he had fought with armies before and knew such loss of memory was not uncommon in soldiers he had seen it though never before suffered it himself he knew the memories would come back and hoped he would be dead before they did he shifted at the thought and the movement sent a jolt of whitehot pain through his leg that made him groan all right jamie ewan rose on one elbow next to him worried face wan in the dawning light a bloodstained bandage circled his head and there were rusty stains on his collar from the scalp wound left by a bullets graze aye ill do he reached up a hand and touched ewans shoulder in gratitude ewan patted it and lay back down the crows were back black as night themselves they had gone to roost with the darkness but with the dawn they were backbirds of war the corbies had come to feast on the flesh of the fallen it could as well be his own eyes the cruel beaks picked out he thought he could feel the shape of his eyeballs beneath his lids round and hot tasty bits of jelly rolling restless to and fro looking vainly for oblivion while the rising sun turned his lids a dark and bloody red four of the men were gathered near the single window of the farmhouse talking quietly together make a run for it one said with a nod outside christ man the best of us can barely staggerand theres six at least canna walk at all if ye can go be going said a man from the floor he grimaced toward his own leg wrapped in the remains of a tattered quilt dinna linger on our account duncan macdonald turned from the window with a grim smile shaking his head the windows light shone off the rough planes of his face deepening the lines of fatigue nay well bide he said for one thing the english are thick as lice on the ground ye can see them swarm from the window theres no man would get away whole from drumossie now even those that fled the field yesterday will no get far mackinnon put in softly did ye no hear the english troops passing in the night at the quickmarch dye think it will be hard for them to hunt down our ragtag lot there was no response to this all of them knew the answer too well many of the highlanders had been barely able to stand on the field before the battle weakened as they were by cold fatigue and hunger jamie turned his face to the wall praying that his men had started early enough lallybroch was remote if they could get far enough from culloden it was unlikely they would be caught and yet claire had told him that cumberlands troops would ravage the highlands ranging far afield in their thirst for revenge the thought of her this time caused only a wave of terrible longing god to have her here to lay her hands on him to tend his wounds and cradle his head in her lap but she was gonegone away two hundred years from himand thank the lord that she was tears trickled slowly from under his closed lids and he rolled painfully onto his side to hide them from the others lord that she might be safe he prayed she and the child toward midafternoon the smell of burning came suddenly on the air wafting through the glassless window it was thicker than the smell of blackpowder smoke pungent with an underlying odor that was faintly horrible in its reminiscent smell of roasting meat they are burning the dead said macdonald he had scarcely moved from his seat by the window in all the time they had been in the cottage he looked like a deathshead himself hair coalblack and matted with dirt scraped back from a face in which every bone showed here and there a small flat crack sounded on the moor gunshots the coups de grace administered by those english officers with a sense of compassion before a tartanclad wretch should be stacked on the pyre with his luckier fellows when jamie looked up duncan macdonald still sat by the window but his eyes were closed next to him ewan cameron crossed himself may we find as much mercy he whispered they did it was just past noon on the second day when booted feet at last approached the farmhouse and the door swung open on silent leather hinges christ it was a muttered exclamation at the sight within the farmhouse the draft from the door stirred the fetid air over grimed bedraggled bloodstained bodies that lay or sat huddled on the packeddirt floor there had been no discussion of the possibility of armed resistance they had no heart and there was no point the jacobites simply sat waiting the pleasure of their visitor he was a major all fresh and new in an uncreased uniform with polished boots after a moments hesitation to survey the inhabitants he stepped inside his lieutenant close behind i am lord melton he said glancing around as though seeking the leader of these men to whom his remarks might most properly be addressed duncan macdonald after a glance of his own stood slowly and inclined his head duncan macdonald of glen richie he said and othershe waved a handlate of the forces of his majesty king james so i surmised the englishman said dryly he was young in his early thirties but he carried himself with a seasoned soldiers confidence he looked deliberately from man to man then reached into his coat and produced a folded sheet of paper i have here an order from his grace the duke of cumberland he said authorizing the immediate execution of any man found to have engaged in the treasonous rebellion just past he glanced around the confines of the cottage once more is there any man here who claims innocence of treason there was the faintest breath of laughter from the scots innocence with the smoke of battle still black on their faces here on the edge of the slaughterfield no my lord said macdonald the faintest of smiles on his lips traitors all shall we be hanged then meltons face twitched in a small grimace of distaste then settled back into impassivity he was a slight man with small fine bones but carried his authority well nonetheless you will be shot he said you have an hour in which to prepare yourselves he hesitated shooting a glance at his lieutenant as though afraid to sound overgenerous before his subordinate but continued if any of you wish writing materialsto compose a letter perhapsthe clerk of my company will attend you he nodded briefly to macdonald turned on his heel and left it was a grim hour a few men availed themselves of the offer of pen and ink and scribbled doggedly paper held against the slanted wooden chimney for lack of another firm writing surface others prayed quietly or simply sat waiting macdonald had begged mercy for giles mcmartin and frederick murray arguing that they were barely seventeen and should not be held to the same account as their elders this request was denied and the boys sat together whitefaced against the wall holding each others hands for them jamie felt a piercing sorrowand for the others here loyal friends and gallant soldiers for himself he felt only relief no more to worry nothing more to do he had done all he could for his men his wife his unborn child now let this bodily misery be ended and he would go grateful for the peace of it more for forms sake than because he felt the need of it he closed his eyes and began the act of contrition in french as he always said it mon dieu je regretteand yet he didnt it was much too late for any sort of regret would he find claire at once when he died he wondered or perhaps as he expected be condemned to separation for a time in any case he would see her again he clung to the conviction much more firmly than he embraced the tenets of the church god had given her to him he would restore her forgetting to pray he instead began to conjure her face behind his eyelids the curve of cheek and temple a broad fair brow that always moved him to kiss it just there in that small smooth spot between her eyebrows just at the top of her nose between clear amber eyes he fixed his attention on the shape of her mouth carefully imagining the full sweet curve of it and the taste and the feel and the joy of it the sounds of praying the penscratching and the small choked sobs of giles mcmartin faded from his ears it was midafternoon when melton returned this time with six soldiers in attendance as well as the lieutenant and the clerk again he paused in the doorway but macdonald rose before he could speak ill go first he said and walked steadily across the cottage as he bent his head to go through the door though lord melton laid a hand on his sleeve will you give your full name sir my clerk will make note of it macdonald glanced at the clerk a small bitter smile tugging at the corner of his mouth a trophy list is it aye well he shrugged and drew himself upright duncan william macleod macdonald of glen richie he bowed politely to lord melton at your servicesir he passed through the door and shortly there came the sound of a single pistolshot from near at hand the boys were allowed to go together hands still clutched tightly as they passed through the door the rest were taken one by one each asked for his name that the clerk might make a record of it the clerk sat on a stool by the door head bent to the papers in his lap not looking up as the men passed by when it came ewans turn jamie struggled to prop himself on his elbows and grasped his friends hand as hard as he could i shall see ye soon again he whispered ewans hand shook in his but the cameron only smiled then he leaned across simply and kissed jamies mouth and rose to go they left the six who could not walk to the last james alexander malcolm mackenzie fraser he said speaking slowly to allow the clerk time to get it down right laird of broch tuarach patiently he spelled it then glanced up at melton i must ask your courtesy my lord to give me help to stand melton didnt answer him but stared down at him his expression of remote distaste altering to one of mingled astonishment and something like dawning horror fraser he said of broch tuarach i am jamie said patiently would the man not hurry a bit being resigned to being shot was one thing but listening to your friends being killed in your hearing was another and not just calculated to settle the nerves his arms were trembling with the strain of propping him and his bowels not sharing the resignation of his higher faculties were twitching with a gurgling dread bloody hell the englishman muttered he bent and peered at jamie where he lay in the shadow of the wall then turned and beckoned to his lieutenant help me get him into the light he ordered they werent gentle about it and jamie grunted as the movement sent a bolt of pain from his leg right up through the top of his head it made him dizzy for a moment and he missed what melton was saying to him are you the jacobite they call red jamie he asked again impatiently a streak of fear went through jamie at that let them know he was the notorious red jamie and they wouldnt shoot him theyd take him in chains to london to be trieda prize of war and after that it would be the hangmans rope and lying half strangled on the gallows platform while they slit his belly and ripped out his bowels his bowels gave another long rumbling gurgle they didnt think much of the notion either no he said with as much firmness as he could manage just get on wi it eh ignoring this melton dropped to his knees and ripped open the throat of jamies shirt he gripped jamies hair and jerked back his head damn melton said meltons finger prodded him in the throat just above the collarbone there was a small triangular scar there and this appeared to be what was causing his interrogators concern james fraser of broch tuarach red hair and a threecornered scar on his throat melton let go of the hair and sat back on his heels rubbing his chin in a distracted sort of way then he pulled himself together and turned to the lieutenant gesturing at the five men remaining in the farm cottage take the rest he ordered his fair brows were knitted together in a deep frown he stood over jamie scowling while the other scottish prisoners were removed i have to think he muttered damme i must think do that said jamie if youre able i must lie down myself they had propped him sitting against the far wall his leg stretched out in front of him but sitting upright after two days of lying flat was more than he could manage the room was tilting drunkenly and small flashing lights kept coming before his eyes he leaned to one side and eased himself down hugging the dirt floor eyes closed as he waited for the dizziness to pass melton was muttering under his breath but jamie couldnt make out the words didnt care greatly in any case sitting up in the sunlight he had seen his leg clearly for the first time and he was fairly sure that he wouldnt live long enough to be hanged the deep angry red of inflammation spread from midthigh upward much brighter than the remaining smears of dried blood the wound itself was purulent with the stench of the other men lessening he could smell the faint sweetfoul odor of the discharge still a quick bullet through the head seemed much preferable to the pain and delirium of death by infection did you hear the bang he wondered and drifted off the cool pounded dirt smooth and comforting as a mothers breast under his hot cheek he wasnt really asleep only drifting in a feverish doze but meltons voice in his ear jerked him to alertness grey the voice was saying john william grey do you know that name no he said mazy with sleep and fever look man either shoot me or go away aye im ill near carryarrick meltons voice was prodding impatient a boy a fairhaired boy about sixteen you met him in the wood jamie squinted up at his tormentor the fever distorted his vision but there seemed something vaguely familiar about the fineboned face above him with those large almost girlish eyes oh he said catching a single face from the flood of images that swirled erratically through his brain the wee laddie that tried to kill me aye i mind him he closed his eyes again in the odd way of fever one sensation seemed to blend into another he had broken john william greys arm the memory of the boys fine bone beneath his hand became the bone of claires forearm as he tore her from the grip of the stones the cool misty breeze stroked his face with claires fingers wake up damn you his head snapped on his neck as melton shook him impatiently listen to me jamie opened his eyes wearily aye john william grey is my brother melton said he told me of his meeting with you you spared his life and he made you a promiseis that true with great effort he cast his mind back he had met the boy two days before the first battle of the rebellion the scottish victory at prestonpans the six months between then and now seemed a vast chasm so much had happened in between aye i recall he promised to kill me i dinna mind if you do it for him though his eyelids were drooping again did he have to be awake in order to be shot he said he owed you a debt of honor and he does melton stood up dusting the knees of his breeches and turned to his lieutenant who had been watching the questioning with considerable bewilderment its the deuce of a situation wallace thisthis jacobite scut is famous youve heard of red jamie the one on the broadsheets the lieutenant nodded looking curiously down at the bedraggled form in the dirt at his feet melton smiled bitterly no he doesnt look so dangerous now does he but hes still red jamie fraser and his grace would be more than pleased to hear of such an illustrious prisoner they havent yet found charles stuart but a few wellknown jacobites would please the crowds at tower hill nearly as much shall i send a message to his grace the lieutenant reached for his message box no melton wheeled to glare down at his prisoner thats the difficulty besides being prime gallows bait this filthy wretch is also the man who captured my youngest brother near preston and rather than shooting the brat which is what he deserved spared his life and returned him to his companions thus he said through his teeth incurring a bloody great debt of honor upon my family dear me said the lieutenant so you cant give him to his grace after all no blast it i cant even shoot the bastard without dishonoring my brothers sworn word the prisoner opened one eye i willna tell anyone if you dont he suggested and promptly closed it again shut up losing his temper entirely melton kicked the prisoner who grunted at the impact but said nothing more perhaps we could shoot him under an assumed name the lieutenant suggested helpfully lord melton gave his aide a look of withering scorn then looked out the window to judge the time it will be dark in three hours ill oversee the burial of the other executed prisoners find a small wagon and have it filled with hay find a driverpick someone discreet wallace that means bribable wallaceand have them here as soon as its dark yes sir er sir what about the prisoner the lieutenant gestured diffidently toward the body on the floor what about him melton said brusquely hes too weak to crawl let alone walk he isnt going anywhereat least not until the wagon gets here wagon the prisoner was showing signs of life in fact under the stimulus of agitation he had managed to raise himself onto one arm bloodshot blue eyes gleamed wide with alarm under the spikes of matted red hair where are ye sending me turning from the door melton cast him a glance of intense dislike youre the laird of broch tuarach arent you well thats where im sending you i dinna want to go home i want to be shot the englishmen exchanged a look raving the lieutenant said significantly and melton nodded i doubt hell live through the journeybut his death wont be on my head at least the door shut firmly behind the englishmen leaving jamie fraser quite aloneand still alive the hunt begins inverness may of course hes dead claires voice was sharp with agitation it rang loudly in the halfempty study echoing among the rifled bookshelves she stood against the corklined wall like a prisoner awaiting a firing squad staring from her daughter to roger wakefield and back again i dont think so roger felt terribly tired he rubbed a hand over his face then picked up the folder from the desk the one containing all the research hed done since claire and her daughter had first come to him three weeks before and asked his help he opened the folder and thumbed slowly through the contents the jacobites of culloden the rising of the the gallant scots who had rallied to the banner of bonnie prince charlie and cut through scotland like a blazing swordonly to come to ruin and defeat against the duke of cumberland on the gray moor at culloden here he said plucking out several sheets clipped together the archaic writing looked odd rendered in the black crispness of a photocopy this is the muster roll of the master of lovats regiment he thrust the thin sheaf of papers at claire but it was her daughter brianna who took the sheets from him and began to turn the pages a slight frown between her reddish brows read the top sheet roger said where it says officers all rightofficers she read aloud simon master of lovat the young fox roger interrupted lovats son and five more names right brianna cocked one brow at him but went on reading william chisholm fraser lieutenant george damerd fraser shaw captain duncan joseph fraser lieutenant bayard murray fraser major she paused swallowing before reading the last name james alexander malcolm mackenzie fraser captain she lowered the papers looking a little pale my father claire moved quickly to her daughters side squeezing the girls arm she was pale too yes she said to roger i know he went to culloden when he left methere at the stone circlehe meant to go back to culloden field to rescue his men who were with charles stuart and we know he didshe nodded at the folder on the desk its manila surface blank and innocent in the lamplightyou found their names butbutjamie speaking the name aloud seemed to rattle her and she clamped her lips tight now it was briannas turn to support her mother he meant to go back you said her eyes dark blue and encouraging were intent on her mothers face he meant to take his men away from the field and then go back to the battle claire nodded recovering herself slightly he knew he hadnt much chance of getting away if the english caught himhe said hed rather die in battle thats what he meant to do she turned to roger her gaze an unsettling amber her eyes always reminded him of hawks eyes as though she could see a good deal farther than most people i cant believe he didnt die thereso many men did and he meant to almost half the highland army had died at culloden cut down in a blast of cannonfire and searing musketry but not jamie fraser no roger said doggedly that bit i read you from linklaters book he reached to pick it up a white volume entitled the prince in the heather following the battle he read eighteen wounded jacobite officers took refuge in the farmhouse near the moor here they lay in pain their wounds untended for two days at the end of that time they were taken out and shot one man a fraser of the master of lovats regiment escaped the slaughter the rest are buried at the edge of the domestic park see he said laying the book down and looking earnestly at the two women over its pages an officer of the master of lovats regiment he grabbed up the sheets of the muster roll and here they are just six of them now we know the man in the farmhouse cant have been young simon hes a wellknown historical figure and we know very well what happened to him he retreated from the fieldunwounded mind youwith a group of his men and fought his way north eventually making it back to beaufort castle near here he waved vaguely at the fulllength window through which the nighttime lights of inverness twinkled faintly nor was the man who escaped leanach farmhouse any of the other four officerswilliam george duncan or bayard roger said why he snatched another paper out of the folder and brandished it almost triumphantly because they all did die at culloden all four of them were killed on the fieldi found their names listed on a plaque in the church at beauly claire let out a long breath then eased herself down into the old leather swivel chair behind the desk jesus h christ she said she closed her eyes and leaned forward elbows on the desk and her head against her hands the thick curly brown hair spilling forward to hide her face brianna laid a hand on claires back face troubled as she bent over her mother she was a tall girl with large fine bones and her long red hair glowed in the warm light of the desk lamp if he didnt die she began tentatively claires head snapped up but he is dead she said her face was strained and small lines were visible around her eyes for gods sake its two hundred years whether he died at culloden or not hes dead now brianna stepped back from her mothers vehemence and lowered her head so the red hairher fathers red hairswung down beside her cheek i guess so she whispered roger could see she was fighting back tears and no wonder he thought to find out in short order that first the man you had loved and called father all your life really wasnt your father secondly that your real father was a highland scot who had lived two hundred years ago and thirdly to realize that he had likely perished in some horrid fashion unthinkably far from the wife and child he had sacrificed himself to saveenough to rattle one roger thought he crossed to brianna and touched her arm she gave him a brief distracted glance and tried to smile he put his arms around her even in his pity for her distress thinking how marvelous she felt all warm and soft and springy at once claire still sat at the desk motionless the yellow hawks eyes had gone a softer color now remote with memory they rested sightlessly on the east wall of the study still covered from floor to ceiling with the notes and memorabilia left by the reverend wakefield rogers late adoptive father looking at the wall himself roger saw the annual meeting notice sent by the society of the white rosethose enthusiastic eccentric souls who still championed the cause of scottish independence meeting in nostalgic tribute to charles stuart and the highland heroes who had followed him roger cleared his throat slightly erif jamie fraser didnt die at culloden he said then he likely died soon afterward claires eyes met rogers straight on the cool look back in the yellowbrown depths you have no idea how it was she said there was a famine in the highlandsnone of the men had eaten for days before the battle he was woundedwe know that even if he escaped there would have beenno one to care for him her voice caught slightly at that she was a doctor now had been a healer even then twenty years before when she had stepped through a circle of standing stones and met destiny with james alexander malcolm mackenzie fraser roger was conscious of them both the tall shaking girl he held in his arms and the woman at the desk so still so poised she had traveled through the stones through time been suspected as a spy arrested as a witch snatched by an unimaginable quirk of circumstance from the arms of her first husband frank randall and three years later her second husband james fraser had sent her back through the stones pregnant in a desperate effort to save her and the unborn child from the onrushing disaster that would soon engulf him surely he thought to himself shes been through enough but roger was a historian he had a scholars insatiable amoral curiosity too powerful to be constrained by simple compassion more than that he was oddly conscious of the third figure in the family tragedy in which he found himself involvedjamie fraser if he didnt die at culloden he began again more firmly then perhaps i can find out what did happen to him do you want me to try he waited breathless feeling briannas warm breath through his shirt jamie fraser had had a life and a death roger felt obscurely that it was his duty to find out all the truth that jamie frasers women deserved to know all they could of him for brianna such knowledge was all she would ever have of the father she had never known and for clairebehind the question he had asked was the thought that had plainly not yet struck her stunned with shock as she was she had crossed the barrier of time twice before she could just possibly do it again and if jamie fraser had not died at culloden he saw awareness flicker in the clouded amber of her eyes as the thought came to her she was normally pale now her face blanched white as the ivory handle of the letter opener before her on the desk her fingers closed around it clenching so the knuckles stood out in knobs of bone she didnt speak for a long time her gaze fixed on brianna and lingered there for a moment then returned to rogers face yes she said in a whisper so soft he could barely hear her yes find out for me please find out frank and full disclosure inverness may the foot traffic was heavy on the bridge over the river ness with folk streaming home to their teas roger moved in front of me his wide shoulders protecting me from the buffets of the crowd around us i could feel my heart beating heavily against the stiff cover of the book i was clutching to my chest it did that whenever i paused to think what we were truly doing i wasnt sure which of the two possible alternatives was worse to find that jamie had died at culloden or to find that he hadnt the boards of the bridge echoed hollowly underfoot as we trudged back toward the manse my arms ached from the weight of the books i carried and i shifted the load from one side to the other watch your bloody wheel man roger shouted nudging me adroitly to the side as a workingman on a bicycle plowed headdownward through the bridge traffic nearly running me against the railing sorry came back the apologetic shout and the rider gave a wave of the hand over his shoulder as the bike wove its way between two groups of schoolchildren coming home for their teas i glanced back across the bridge in case brianna should be visible behind us but there was no sign of her roger and i had spent the afternoon at the society for the preservation of antiquities brianna had gone down to the highland clans office there to collect photocopies of a list of documents roger had compiled its very kind of you to take all this trouble roger i said raising my voice to be heard above the echoing bridge and the rivers rush its all right he said a little awkwardly pausing for me to catch him up im curious he added smiling a little you know historianscant leave a puzzle alone he shook his head trying to brush the windblown dark hair out of his eyes without using his hands i did know historians id lived with one for twenty years frank hadnt wanted to leave this particular puzzle alone either but neither had he been willing to solve it frank had been dead for two years though and now it was my turnmine and briannas have you heard yet from dr linklater i asked as we came down the arch of the bridge late in the afternoon as it was the sun was still high so far north as we were caught among the leaves of the lime trees on the riverbank it glowed pink on the granite cenotaph that stood below the bridge roger shook his head squinting against the wind no but its been only a week since i wrote if i dont hear by the monday ill try telephoning dont worryhe smiled sideways at mei was very circumspect i just told him that for purposes of a study i was making i needed a listif one existedof the jacobite officers who were in leanach farmhouse after culloden and if any information exists as to the survivor of that execution could he refer me to the original sources do you know linklater i asked easing my left arm by tilting the books sideways against my hip no but i wrote my request on the balliol college letterhead and made tactful reference to mr cheesewright my old tutor who does know linklater roger winked reassuringly and i laughed his eyes were a brilliant lucent green bright against his olive skin curiosity might be his stated reason for helping us to find out jamies history but i was well aware that his interest went a good bit deeperin the direction of brianna i also knew that the interest was returned what i didnt know was whether roger realized that as well back in the late reverend wakefields study i dropped my armload of books on the table in relief and collapsed into the wing chair by the hearth while roger went to fetch a glass of lemonade from the manses kitchen my breathing slowed as i sipped the tart sweetness but my pulse stayed erratic as i looked over the imposing stack of books we had brought back was jamie in there somewhere and if he wasmy hands grew wet on the cold glass and i choked the thought off dont look too far ahead i cautioned myself much better to wait and see what we might find roger was scanning the shelves in the study in search of other possibilities the reverend wakefield rogers late adoptive father had been both a good amateur historian and a terrible pack rat letters journals pamphlets and broadsheets antique and contemporary volumesall were crammed cheek by jowl together on the shelves roger hesitated then his hand fell on a stack of books sitting on the nearby table they were franks booksan impressive achievement so far as i could tell by reading the encomiums printed on the dust jackets have you ever read this he asked picking up the volume entitled the jacobites no i said i took a restorative gulp of lemonade and coughed no i said again i couldnt after my return i had resolutely refused to look at any material dealing with scotlands past even though the eighteenth century had been one of franks areas of specialty knowing jamie dead and faced with the necessity of living without him i avoided anything that might bring him to mind a useless avoidancethere was no way of keeping him out of my mind with briannas existence a daily reminder of himbut still i could not read books about the bonnie princethat terrible futile young manor his followers i see i just thought you might know whether there might be something useful in here roger paused the flush deepening over his cheekbones dider did your husbandfrank i mean he added hastily did you tell himumabout his voice trailed off choked with embarrassment well of course i did i said a little sharply what did you thinkid just stroll back into his office after being gone for three years and say oh hullo there darling and what would you like for supper tonight no of course not roger muttered he turned away eyes fixed on the bookshelves the back of his neck was deep red with embarrassment im sorry i said taking a deep breath its a fair question to ask its only that itsa bit raw yet a good deal more than a bit i was both surprised and appalled to find just how raw the wound still was i set the glass down on the table at my elbow if we were going on with this i was going to need something stronger than lemonade yes i said i told him all about the stonesabout jamie everything roger didnt reply for a moment then he turned halfway so that only the strong sharp lines of his profile were visible he didnt look at me but down at the stack of franks books at the backcover photo of frank leanly dark and handsome smiling for posterity did he believe you roger asked quietly my lips felt sticky from the lemonade and i licked them before answering no i said not at first he thought i was mad even had me vetted by a psychiatrist i laughed shortly but the memory made me clench my fists with remembered fury later then roger turned to face me the flush had faded from his skin leaving only an echo of curiosity in his eyes what did he think i took a deep breath and closed my eyes i dont know the tiny hospital in inverness smelled unfamiliar like carbolic disinfectant and starch i couldnt think and tried not to feel the return was much more terrifying than my venture into the past had been for there i had been shrouded by a protective layer of doubt and disbelief about where i was and what was happening and had lived in constant hope of escape now i knew only too well where i was and i knew that there was no escape jamie was dead the doctors and nurses tried to speak kindly to me to feed me and bring me things to drink but there was no room in me for anything but grief and terror i had told them my name when they asked but wouldnt speak further i lay in the clean white bed fingers clamped tight together over my vulnerable belly and kept my eyes shut i visualized over and over the last things i had seen before i stepped through the stonesthe rainy moor and jamies faceknowing that if i looked too long at my new surroundings these sights would fade replaced by mundane things like the nurses and the vase of flowers by my bed i pressed one thumb secretly against the base of the other taking an obscure comfort in the tiny wound there a small cut in the shape of a j jamie had made it at my demandthe last of his touch on my flesh i must have stayed that way for some time i slept sometimes dreaming of the last few days of the jacobite risingi saw again the dead man in the wood asleep beneath a coverlet of bright blue fungus and dougal mackenzie dying on the floor of an attic in culloden house the ragged men of the highland army asleep in the muddy ditches their last sleep before the slaughter i would wake screaming or moaning to the scent of disinfectant and the sound of soothing words incomprehensible against the echoes of gaelic shouting in my dreams and fall asleep again my hurt clutched tight in the palm of my hand and then i opened my eyes and frank was there he stood in the door smoothing back his dark hair with one hand looking uncertainand no wonder poor man i lay back on the pillows just watching him not speaking he had the look of his ancestors jack and alex randall fine clear aristocratic features and a wellshaped head under a spill of straight dark hair his face had some indefinable difference from theirs though beyond the small differences of feature there was no mark of fear or ruthlessness on him neither the spirituality of alex nor the icy arrogance of jack his lean face looked intelligent kind and slightly tired unshaven and with smudges beneath his eyes i knew without being told that he had driven all night to get here claire he came over to the bed and spoke tentatively as though not sure that i really was claire i wasnt sure either but i nodded and said hullo frank my voice was scratchy and rough unaccustomed to speech he took one of my hands and i let him have it are youall right he said after a minute he was frowning slightly as he looked at me im pregnant that seemed the important point to my disordered mind i had not thought of what i would say to frank if i ever saw him again but the moment i saw him standing in the door it seemed to come clear in my mind i would tell him i was pregnant he would leave and i would be alone with my last sight of jamies face and the burning touch of him on my hand his face tightened a bit but he didnt let go of my other hand i know they told me he took a deep breath and let it out clairecan you tell me what happened to you i felt quite blank for a moment but then shrugged i suppose so i said i mustered my thoughts wearily i didnt want to be talking about it but i had some feeling of obligation to this man not guilt not yet but obligation nonetheless i had been married to him well i said i fell in love with someone else and i married him im sorry i added in response to the look of shock that crossed his face i couldnt help it he hadnt been expecting that his mouth opened and closed for a bit and he gripped my hand hard enough to make me wince and jerk it out of his grasp what do you mean he said his voice sharp where have you been claire he stood up suddenly looming over the bed do you remember that when i last saw you i was going up to the stone circle on craigh na dun yes he was staring down at me with an expression somewhere between anger and suspicion welli licked my lips which had gone quite drythe fact is i walked through a cleft stone in that circle and ended up in dont be facetious claire you think im being funny the thought was so absurd that i actually began to laugh though i felt a good long way from real humor stop that i quit laughing two nurses appeared at the door as though by magic they must have been lurking in the hall nearby frank leaned over and grabbed my arm listen to me he said through his teeth you are going to tell me where youve been and what youve been doing i am telling you let go i sat up in bed and yanked at my arm pulling it out of his grasp i told you i walked through a stone and ended up two hundred years ago and i met your bloody ancestor jack randall there frank blinked entirely taken aback who black jack randall and a bloody filthy nasty pervert he was too franks mouth hung open and so did the nurses i could hear feet coming down the corridor behind them and hurried voices i had to marry jamie fraser to get away from jack randall but thenjamiei couldnt help it frank i loved him and i would have stayed with him if i could but he sent me back because of culloden and the baby and i broke off as a man in a doctors uniform pushed past the nurses by the door frank i said tiredly im sorry i didnt mean it to happen and i tried all i could to come backreally i didbut i couldnt and now its too late despite myself tears began to well up in my eyes and roll down my cheeks mostly for jamie and myself and the child i carried but a few for frank as well i sniffed hard and swallowed trying to stop and pushed myself upright in the bed look i said i know you wont want to have anything more to do with me and i dont blame you at all justjust go away will you his face had changed he didnt look angry anymore but distressed and slightly puzzled he sat down by the bed ignoring the doctor who had come in and was groping for my pulse im not going anywhere he said quite gently he took my hand again though i tried to pull it away thisjamie who was he i took a deep ragged breath the doctor had hold of my other hand still trying to take my pulse and i felt absurdly panicked as though i were being held captive between them i fought down the feeling though and tried to speak steadily james alexander malcolm mackenzie fraser i said spacing the words formally the way jamie had spoken them to me when he first told me his full nameon the day of our wedding the thought made another tear overflow and i blotted it against my shoulder my hands being restrained he was a highlander he was kkilled at culloden it was no use i was weeping again the tears no anodyne to the grief that ripped through me but the only response i had to unendurable pain i bent forward slightly trying to encapsulate it wrapping myself around the tiny imperceptible life in my belly the only remnant left to me of jamie fraser frank and the doctor exchanged a glance of which i was only halfconscious of course to them culloden was part of the distant past to me it had happened only two days before perhaps we should let mrs randall rest for a bit the doctor suggested she seems a wee bit upset just now frank looked uncertainly from the doctor to me well she certainly does seem upset but i really want to find outwhats this claire stroking my hand he had encountered the silver ring on my fourth finger and now bent to examine it it was the ring jamie had given me for our marriage a wide silver band in the highland interlace pattern the links engraved with tiny stylized thistle blooms no i exclaimed panicked as frank tried to twist it off my finger i jerked my hand away and cradled it fisted beneath my bosom cupped in my left hand which still wore franks gold wedding band no you cant take it i wont let you thats my wedding ring now see here claire franks words were interrupted by the doctor who had crossed to franks side of the bed and was now bending down to murmur in his ear i caught a few wordsnot trouble your wife just now the shockand then frank was on his feet once more being firmly urged away by the doctor who gave a nod to one of the nurses in passing i barely felt the sting of the hypodermic needle too engulfed in the fresh wave of grief to take notice of anything i dimly heard franks parting words all rightbut claire i will know and then the blessed darkness came down and i slept without dreaming for a long long time roger tilted the decanter bringing the level of the spirit in the glass up to the halfway point he handed it to claire with a halfsmile fionas grannie always said whisky is good for what ails ye ive seen worse remedies claire took the glass and gave him back the halfsmile in change roger poured out a drink for himself then sat down beside her sipping quietly i tried to send him away you know she said suddenly lowering her glass frank i told him i knew he couldnt feel the same for me no matter what he believed had happened i said i would give him a divorce he must go away and forget about metake up the life hed begun building without me he wouldnt do it though roger said it was growing chilly in the study as the sun went down and he bent and switched on the ancient electric fire because you were pregnant he guessed she shot him a sudden sharp look then smiled a little wryly yes that was it he said no one but a cad would dream of abandoning a pregnant woman with virtually no resources particularly one whose grip on reality seemed a trifle tenuous she added ironically i wasnt quite without resourcesi had a bit of money from my uncle lambbut frank wasnt a cad either her glance shifted to the bookshelves her husbands historical works stood there side by side spines gleaming in the light of the desklamp he was a very decent man she said softly she took another sip of her drink closing her eyes as the alcoholic fumes rose up and thenhe knew or suspected that he couldnt have children himself rather a blow for a man so involved in history and genealogies all those dynastic considerations you see yes i can see that roger said slowly but wouldnt he feeli mean another mans child he might have the amber eyes were looking at him again their clearness slightly softened by whisky and reminiscence but as it was since he didntcouldntbelieve anything i said about jamie the babys father was essentially unknown if he didnt know who the man wasand convinced himself that i didnt really know either but had just made up these delusions out of traumatic shockwell then there was no one ever to say that the child wasnt his certainly not me she added with just a tinge of bitterness she took a large swallow of whisky that made her eyes water slightly and took a moment to wipe them but to make sure he took me clean away to boston she went on hed been offered a good position at harvard and no one knew us there thats where brianna was born the fretful crying jarred me awake yet again i had gone back to bed at after getting up five times during the night with the baby a blearyeyed look at the clock showed the time now as a cheerful singing came from the bathroom franks voice raised in rule britannia over the noise of rushing water i lay in bed heavylimbed with exhaustion wondering whether i had the strength to endure the crying until frank got out of the shower and could bring brianna to me as though the baby knew what i was thinking the crying rose two or three tones and escalated to a sort of periodic shriek punctuated by frightening gulps for air i flung back the covers and was on my feet propelled by the same sort of panic with which i had greeted air raids during the war i lumbered down the chilly hall and into the nursery to find brianna aged three months lying on her back yelling her small red head off i was so groggy from lack of sleep that it took a moment for me to realize that i had left her on her stomach darling you turned over all by yourself terrorized by her audacious act brianna waved her little pink fists and squalled louder eyes squeezed shut i snatched her up patting her back and murmuring to the top of her redfuzzed head oh you precious darling what a clever girl you are whats that whats happened frank emerged from the bathroom toweling his head a second towel wrapped about his loins is something the matter with brianna he came toward us looking worried as the birth grew closer we had both been edgy frank irritable and myself terrified having no idea what might happen between us with the appearance of jamie frasers child but when the nurse had taken brianna from her bassinet and handed her to frank with the words heres daddys little girl his face had grown blank and thenlooking down at the tiny face perfect as a rosebudgone soft with wonder within a week he had been hers body and soul i turned to him smiling she turned over all by herself really his scrubbed face beamed with delight isnt it early for her to do that yes it is dr spock says she oughtnt to be able to do it for another month at least well what does dr spock know come here little beauty give daddy a kiss for being so precocious he lifted the soft little body encased in its snug pink sleepsuit and kissed her button of a nose brianna sneezed and we both laughed i stopped then suddenly aware that it was the first time i had laughed in nearly a year still more that it was the first time i had laughed with frank he realized it too his eyes met mine over the top of briannas head they were a soft hazel and at the moment filled with tenderness i smiled at him a little tremulous and suddenly very much aware that he was all but naked with water droplets sliding down his lean shoulders and shining on the smooth brown skin of his chest the smell of burning reached us simultaneously jarring us from this scene of domestic bliss the coffee thrusting bree unceremoniously into my arms frank bolted for the kitchen leaving both towels in a heap at my feet smiling at the sight of his bare buttocks gleaming an incongruous white as he sprinted into the kitchen i followed him more slowly holding bree against my shoulder he was standing at the sink naked amid a cloud of malodorous steam rising from the scorched coffeepot tea maybe i asked adroitly anchoring brianna on my hip with one arm while i rummaged in the cupboard none of the orange pekoe leaf left im afraid just liptons teabags frank made a face an englishman to the bone he would rather lap water out of the toilet than drink tea made from teabags the liptons had been left by mrs grossman the weekly cleaning woman who thought tea made from loose leaves messy and disgusting no ill get a cup of coffee on my way to the university oh speaking of which you recall that were having the dean and his wife to dinner tonight mrs hinchcliffe is bringing a present for brianna oh right i said without enthusiasm i had met the hinchcliffes before and wasnt all that keen to repeat the experience still the effort had to be made with a mental sigh i shifted the baby to the other side and groped in the drawer for a pencil to make a grocery list brianna burrowed into the front of my red chenille dressing gown making small voracious grunting noises you cant be hungry again i said to the top of her head i fed you not two hours ago my breasts were beginning to leak in response to her rooting though and i was already sitting down and loosening the front of my gown mrs hinchcliffe said that a baby shouldnt be fed every time it cries frank observed they get spoilt if they arent kept to a schedule it wasnt the first time i had heard mrs hinchcliffes opinions on childrearing then shell be spoilt wont she i said coldly not looking at him the small pink mouth clamped down fiercely and brianna began to suck with mindless appetite i was aware that mrs hinchcliffe also thought breastfeeding both vulgar and insanitary i who had seen any number of eighteenthcentury babies nursing contentedly at their mothers breasts didnt frank sighed but didnt say anything further after a moment he put down the pot holder and sidled toward the door well he said awkwardly ill see you around six then shall i ought i to bring home anythingsave you going out i gave him a brief smile and said no ill manage oh good he hesitated a moment as i settled bree more comfortably on my lap head resting on the crook of my arm the round of her head echoing the curve of my breast i looked up from the baby and found him watching me intently eyes fixed on the swell of my halfexposed bosom my own eyes flicked downward over his body i saw the beginnings of his arousal and bent my head over the baby to hide my flushing face goodbye i muttered to the top of her head he stood still a moment then leaned forward and kissed me briefly on the cheek the warmth of his bare body unsettlingly near goodbye claire he said softly ill see you tonight he didnt come into the kitchen again before leaving so i had a chance to finish feeding brianna and bring my own feelings into some semblance of normality i hadnt seen frank naked since my return he had always dressed in bathroom or closet neither had he tried to kiss me before this mornings cautious peck the pregnancy had been what the obstetrician called highrisk and there had been no question of franks sharing my bed even had i been so disposedwhich i wasnt i should have seen this coming but i hadnt absorbed first in sheer misery and then in the physical torpor of oncoming motherhood i had pushed away all considerations beyond my bulging belly after briannas birth i had lived from feeding to feeding seeking small moments of mindless peace when i could hold her oblivious body close and find relief from thought and memory in the pure sensual pleasure of touching and holding her frank too cuddled the baby and played with her falling asleep in his big chair with her stretched out atop his lanky form rosy cheek pressed flat against his chest as they snored together in peaceful companionship he and i did not touch each other though nor did we truly talk about anything beyond our basic domestic arrangementsexcept brianna the baby was our shared focus a point through which we could at once reach each other and keep each other at arms length it looked as though arms length was no longer close enough for frank i could do itphysically at least i had seen the doctor for a checkup the week before and he hadwith an avuncular wink and a pat on the bottomassured me that i could resume relations with my husband at any time i knew frank hadnt been celibate since my disappearance in his late forties he was still lean and muscular dark and sleek a very handsome man women clustered about him at cocktail parties like bees round a honeypot emitting small hums of sexual excitement there had been one girl with brown hair whom i had noticed particularly at the departmental party she stood in the corner and stared at frank mournfully over her drink later she became tearfully and incoherently drunk and was escorted home by two female friends who took turns casting evil looks at frank and at me standing by his side silently bulging in my flowered maternity dress hed been discreet though he was always home at night and took pains not to have lipstick on his collar so now he meant to come home all the way i supposed he had some right to expect it was that not a wifely duty and i once more his wife there was only one small problem it wasnt frank i reached for deep in the night waking out of sleep it wasnt his smooth lithe body that walked my dreams and roused me so that i came awake moist and gasping my heart pounding from the halfremembered touch but i would never touch that man again jamie i whispered oh jamie my tears sparkled in the morning light adorning briannas soft red fuzz like scattered pearls and diamonds it wasnt a good day brianna had a bad diaper rash which made her cross and irritable needing to be picked up every few minutes she nursed and fussed alternately pausing to spit up at intervals making clammy wet patches on whatever i wore i changed my blouse three times before eleven oclock the heavy nursing bra i wore chafed under the arms and my nipples felt cold and chapped midway through my laborious tidyingup of the house there was a whooshing clank from under the floorboards and the hotair registers died with a feeble sigh no next week wont do i said over the telephone to the furnacerepair shop i looked at the window where the cold february fog was threatening to seep under the sill and engulf us its fortytwo degrees in here and i have a threemonthold baby the baby in question was sitting in her baby seat swaddled in all her blankets squalling like a scalded cat ignoring the quacking of the person on the other end i held the receiver next to briannas wide open mouth for several seconds see i demanded lifting the phone to my ear again awright lady said a resigned voice on the other end of the line ill come out this afternoon sometime between noon and six noon and six cant you narrow it down a little more than that i have to get out to the market i protested you aint the only dead furnace in town lady the voice said with finality and hung up i glanced at the clock eleventhirty id never be able to get the marketing done and get back in half an hour marketing with a small baby was more like a ninetyminute expedition into darkest borneo requiring massive amounts of equipment and tremendous expenditures of energy gritting my teeth i called the expensive market that delivered ordered the necessities for dinner and picked up the baby who was by now the shade of an eggplant and markedly smelly that looks ouchy darling youll feel much better if we get it off wont you i said trying to talk soothingly as i wiped the brownish slime off briannas brightred bottom she arched her back trying to escape the clammy washcloth and shrieked some more a layer of vaseline and the tenth clean diaper of the day the diaper service truck wasnt due til tomorrow and the house reeked of ammonia all right sweetheart there there i hoisted her up on my shoulder patting her but the screeching went on and on not that i could blame her her poor bottom was nearly raw ideally she should be let to lie about on a towel with nothing on but with no heat in the house that wasnt feasible she and i were both wearing sweaters and heavy winter coats which made the frequent feedings even more of a nuisance than usual excavating a breast could take several minutes while the baby screamed brianna couldnt sleep for more than ten minutes at a time consequently neither could i when we did drift off together at four oclock we were roused within a quarter of an hour by the crashing arrival of the furnace man who pounded on the door not bothering to set down the large wrench he was holding jiggling the baby against my shoulder with one hand i began cooking the dinner with the other to the accompaniment of screeches in my ear and the sounds of violence from the cellar below i aint promising nothin lady but you got heat for now the furnace man appeared abruptly wiping a smear of grease from his creased forehead he leaned forward to inspect brianna who was lying more or less peacefully across my shoulder loudly sucking her thumb hows that thumb taste sweetie he inquired they say you shouldnt oughta let em suck their thumbs you know he informed me straightening up gives em crooked teeth and theyll need braces is that so i said through my own teeth how much do i owe you half an hour later the chicken lay in its pan stuffed and basted surrounded by crushed garlic sprigs of rosemary and curls of lemon peel a quick squeeze of lemon juice over the buttery skin and i could stick it in the oven and go get myself and brianna dressed the kitchen looked like the result of an incompetent burglary with cupboards hanging open and cooking paraphernalia strewn on every horizontal surface i banged shut a couple of cupboard doors and then the kitchen door itself trusting that that would keep mrs hinchcliffe out even if good manners wouldnt frank had brought a new pink dress for brianna to wear it was a beautiful thing but i eyed the layers of lace around the neck dubiously they looked not only scratchy but delicate well well give it a try i told her daddy will like you to look pretty lets try not to spit up in it hm brianna responded by shutting her eyes stiffening and grunting as she extruded more slime oh well done i said sincerely it meant changing the crib sheet but at least it wouldnt make the diaper rash worse the mess attended to and a fresh diaper in place i shook out the pink dress and paused to carefully wipe the snot and drool from her face before popping the garment over her head she blinked at me and gurgled enticingly windmilling her fists i obligingly lowered my head and went pfffft into her navel which made her squirm and gurgle with joy we did it a few more times then began the painstaking job of getting into the pink dress brianna didnt like it she started to complain as i put it over her head and as i crammed her chubby little arms into the puffed sleeves put back her head and let out a piercing cry what is it i demanded startled i knew all her cries by now and mostly what she meant by them but this was a new one full of fright and pain whats the matter darling she was screaming furiously now tears rolling down her face i turned her frantically over and patted her back thinking she might have had a sudden attack of colic but she wasnt doubled up she was struggling violently though and as i turned her back over to pick her up i saw the long red line running up the tender inside of her waving arm a pin had been left in the dress and had scored her flesh as i forced the sleeve up her arm oh baby oh im so sorry mummys so sorry tears were running down my own face as i eased the stabbing pin free and removed it i clutched her to my shoulder patting and soothing trying to calm my own feelings of panicked guilt of course i hadnt meant to hurt her but she wouldnt know that oh darling i murmured its all right now yes mummy loves you its all right why hadnt i thought to check for pins for that matter what sort of maniac would package a babys clothes using straight pins torn between fury and distress i eased brianna into the dress wiped her chin and carried her into the bedroom where i laid her on my twin bed while i hastily changed to a decent skirt and a fresh blouse the doorbell rang as i was pulling on my stockings there was a hole in one heel but no time to do anything about it now i stuck my feet into the pinching alligator pumps snatched up brianna and went to answer the door it was frank too laden with packages to use his key onehanded i took most of them from him and parked them on the hall table dinner all ready dear ive brought a new tablecloth and napkinsthought ours were a bit shabby and the wine of course he lifted the bottle in his hand smiling then leaned forward to peer at me and stopped smiling he looked disapprovingly from my disheveled hair to my blouse freshly stained with spitup milk christ claire he said couldnt you fix yourself up a bit i mean its not as though you have anything else to do at home all daycouldnt you take a few minutes for a no i said quite loudly i pushed brianna who was wailing again with fretful exhaustion into his arms no i said again and took the wine bottle from his unresisting hand no i shrieked stamping my foot i swung the bottle widely and he dodged but it was the doorjamb i struck and purplish splatters of beaujolais flew across the stoop leaving glass shards glittering in the light from the entryway i flung the shattered bottle into the azaleas and ran coatless down the walk and into the freezing fog at the foot of the walk i passed the startled hinchcliffes who were arriving half an hour early presumably in hopes of catching me in some domestic deficiency i hoped theyd enjoy their dinner i drove aimlessly through the fog the cars heater blasting on my feet until i began to get low on gas i wasnt going home not yet an allnight cafe then i realized that it was friday night and getting on for twelve oclock i had a place to go after all i turned back toward the suburb where we lived and the church of st finbar at this hour the chapel was locked to prevent vandalism and burglary for the late adorers there was a pushbutton lock set just below the door handle five buttons numbered one to five by pushing three of them in the proper combination the latch could be sprung to allow lawful entry i moved quietly along the back of the chapel to the logbook that sat at the feet of st finbar to record my arrival st finbar frank had said incredulously there isnt such a saint there cant possibly be there is i said with a trace of smugness an irish bishop from the twelfth century oh irish said frank dismissively that explains it but what i cant understand he said careful to be tactful is er wellwhy why what why go in for this perpetual adoration business youve never been the least devout no more than i have and you dont go to mass or anything father beggs asks me every week where you are i shook my head i cant really say frank its just somethingi need to do i looked at him helpless to explain adequately itspeaceful there i said finally he opened his mouth as though to speak further then turned away shaking his head it was peaceful the car park at the church was deserted save for the single car of the adorer on duty at this hour gleaming an anonymous black under the arc lights inside i signed my name to the log and walked forward coughing tactfully to alert the eleven oclock adorer to my presence without the rudeness of direct speech i knelt behind him a heavyset man in a yellow windcheater after a moment he rose genuflected before the altar turned and walked to the door nodding briefly as he passed me the door hissed shut and i was alone save for the sacrament displayed on the altar in the great golden sunburst of the monstrance there were two candles on the altar big ones smooth and white they burned steadily in the still air without a flicker i closed my eyes for a moment just listening to the silence everything that had happened during the day whirled through my mind in a disjointed welter of thoughts and feelings coatless i was shaking with cold from the short walk through the parking lot but slowly i grew warm again and my clenched hands relaxed in my lap at last as usually happened here i ceased to think whether it was the stoppage of time in the presence of eternity or only the overtaking of a bonedeep fatigue i didnt know but the guilt over frank eased the wrenching grief for jamie lessened and even the constant tug of motherhood upon my emotions receded to the level of background noise no louder than the slow beating of my own heart regular and comforting in the dark peace of the chapel o lord i whispered i commend to your mercy the soul of your servant james and mine i added silently and mine i sat there without moving watching the flickering glow of the candle flames in the gold surface of the monstrance until the soft footsteps of the next adorer came down the aisle behind me ending in the heavy creak of genuflection they came once each hour day and night the blessed sacrament was never left alone i stayed for a few minutes more then slid out of the pew with my own nod toward the altar as i walked toward the back of the chapel i saw a figure in the back row under the shadow of the statue of st anthony it stirred as i approached then the man rose to his feet and made his way to the aisle to meet me what are you doing here i hissed frank nodded toward the form of the new adorer already kneeling in contemplation and took my elbow to guide me out i waited until the chapel door had closed behind us before pulling away and whirling to confront him what is this i said angrily why did you come after me i was worried about you he gestured toward the empty car park where his large buick nestled protectively next to my small ford its dangerous a lone woman walking about in the very late night in this part of town i came to see you home thats all he didnt mention the hinchcliffes or the dinner party my annoyance ebbed a bit oh i said what did you do with brianna asked old mrs munsing from next door to keep an ear out in case she cried but she seemed dead asleep i didnt think there was much chance come along now its cold out it was the freezing air off the bay was coiling in white tendrils around the posts of the arc lights and i shivered in my thin blouse ill meet you at home then i said the warmth of the nursery reached out to embrace me as i went in to check brianna she was still asleep but restless turning her russet head from side to side the groping little mouth opening and closing like the breathing of a fish shes getting hungry i whispered to frank who had come in behind me and was hovering over my shoulder peering fondly at the baby id better feed her before i come to bed then shell sleep later in the morning ill get you a hot drink and he vanished through the door to the kitchen as i picked up the sleepy warm bundle she had only drained one side but she was full the slack mouth pulled slowly away from the nipple rimmed with milk and the fuzzy head fell heavily back on my arm no amount of gentle shaking or calling would rouse her to nurse on the other side so at last i gave up and tucked her back in her crib patting her back softly until a faint contented belch wafted up from the pillow succeeded by the heavy breathing of absolute satiation down for the night is she frank drew the baby blanket decorated with yellow bunnies up over her yes i sat back in my rocking chair mentally and physically too exhausted to get up again frank came to stand behind me his hand rested lightly on my shoulder hes dead then he asked gently i told you so i started to say then i stopped closed my mouth and only nodded rocking slowly staring at the dark crib and its tiny occupant my right breast was still painfully swollen with milk no matter how tired i was i couldnt sleep until i took care of it with a sigh of resignation i reached for the breast pump an ungainly and ridiculouslooking rubber contraption using it was undignified and uncomfortable but better than waking up in an hour in bursting pain sopping wet from overflowing milk i waved a hand at frank dismissing him go ahead it will only take a few minutes but i have to instead of leaving or answering he took the pump from my hand and laid it down on the table as though it moved of its own will without direction from him his hand rose slowly through the warm dark air of the nursery and cupped itself gently around the swollen curve of my breast his head bowed and his lips fastened softly on my nipple i groaned feeling the halfpainful prickle of the milk rushing through the tiny ducts i put a hand behind his head and pressed him slightly closer harder i whispered his mouth was soft gentle in its pressure nothing like the relentless grasp of a babys hard toothless gums that fasten on like grim death demanding and draining releasing the bounteous fountain at once in response to their greed frank knelt before me his mouth a supplicant was this how god felt i wondered seeing the adorers before himwas he too filled with tenderness and pity the haze of fatigue made me feel as though everything happened in slow motion as though we were under water franks hands moved slowly as sea fronds swaying in the current moving over my flesh with a touch as gentle as the brush of kelp leaves lifting me with the strength of a wave and laying me down on the shore of the nursery rug i closed my eyes and let the tide carry me away the front door of the old manse opened with a screech of rusty hinges announcing the return of brianna randall roger was on his feet and into the hall at once drawn by the sound of girls voices a pound of best butterthats what you told me to ask for and i did but i kept wondering whether there was such a thing as secondbest butter or worst butter brianna was handing over wrapped packages to fiona laughing and talking at once well and if ye got it from that auld rascal wicklow worst is what its likely to be no matter what he says fiona interrupted oh and yeve got the cinnamon thats grand ill make cinnamon scones then dye want to come and watch me do it yes but first i want supper im starved brianna stood on tiptoe sniffing hopefully in the direction of the kitchen what are we havinghaggis haggis gracious ye silly sassenachye dinna have haggis in the spring ye have it in the autumn when the sheep are killed am i a sassenach brianna seemed delighted at the name of course ye are gowk but i like ye fine anyway fiona laughed up at brianna who towered over the small scottish girl by nearly a foot fiona was nineteen prettily charming and slightly plump next to her brianna looked like a medieval carving strongboned and severe with her long straight nose and the long hair glowing redgold beneath the glass bowl of the ceiling fixture she might have walked out of an illuminated manuscript vivid enough to endure a thousand years unchanged roger was suddenly conscious of claire randall standing near his elbow she was looking at her daughter with an expression in which love pride and something else were mingledmemory perhaps he realized with a slight shock that jamie fraser too must have had not only the striking height and viking red hair he had bequeathed to his daughter but likely the same sheer physical presence it was quite remarkable he thought she didnt do or say anything so out of the ordinary and yet brianna undeniably drew people there was some attraction about her almost magnetic that drew everyone near into the glow of her orbit it drew him brianna turned and smiled at him and without consciousness of having moved he found himself near enough to see the faint freckles high on her cheekbones and smell the whiff of pipe tobacco that lingered in her hair from her expeditions to the shops hullo he said smiling any luck with the clans office or have you been too busy playing dogsbody for fiona dogsbody briannas eyes slanted into blue triangles of amusement dogsbody first im a sassenach and now im a dogsbody what do you scots call people when youre trying to be nice darrrrlin he said rolling his rs exaggeratedly and making both girls laugh you sound like an aberdeen terrier in a bad mood claire observed did you find anything at the highland clans library bree lots of stuff brianna replied rummaging through the stack of photocopies she had set down on the hall table i managed to read most of it while they were making the copiesthis one was the most interesting she pulled a sheet from the stack and handed it to roger it was an extract from a book of highland legends an entry headed leap o the cask legends said claire peering over his shoulder is that what we want could be roger was perusing the sheet and spoke absently his attention divided so far as the scottish highlands go most of the history is oral up to the midnineteenth century or so that means there wasnt a great distinction made between stories about real people stories of historical figures and the stories about mythical things like water horses and ghosts and the doings of the auld folk scholars who wrote the stories down often didnt know for sure which they were dealing with eithersometimes it was a combination of fact and myth and sometimes you could tell that it was a real historical occurrence being described this one for instancehe passed the paper to clairesounds like a real one its describing the story behind the name of a particular rock formation in the highlands claire brushed the hair behind her ear and bent her head to read squinting in the dim light of the ceiling fixture fiona too accustomed to musty papers and boring bits of history to be interested disappeared back into her kitchen to see to the dinner leap o the cask claire read this unusual formation located some distance above a burn is named after the story of a jacobite laird and his servant the laird one of the few fortunates to escape the disaster of culloden made his way with difficulty to his home but was compelled to lie hidden in a cave on his lands for nearly seven years while the english hunted the highlands for the fugitive supporters of charles stuart the lairds tenants loyally kept his presence a secret and brought food and supplies to the laird in his hiding place they were careful always to refer to the hidden man only as the dunbonnet in order to avoid any chance of giving him away to the english patrols who frequently crossed the district one day a boy bringing a cask of ale up the trail to the lairds cave met a group of english dragoons bravely refusing either to answer the soldiers questions or to give up his burden the boy was attacked by one of the dragoons and dropped the cask which bounded down the steep hill and into the burn below she looked up from the paper raising her eyebrows at her daughter why this one we knowor we think we know she corrected with a wry nod toward roger that jamie escaped from culloden but so did a lot of other people what makes you think this laird might have been jamie because of the dunbonnet bit of course brianna answered as though surprised that she should ask what roger looked at her puzzled what about the dunbonnet in answer brianna picked up a hank of her thick red hair and waggled it under his nose dunbonnet she said impatiently a dull brown bonnet right he wore a hat all the time because he had hair that could be recognized didnt you say the english called him red jamie they knew he had red hairhe had to hide it roger stared at her speechless the hair floated loose on her shoulders alive with fiery light you could be right claire said excitement made her eyes bright as she looked at her daughter it was like yoursjamies hair was just like yours bree she reached up and softly stroked briannas hair the girls face softened as she looked down at her mother i know she said i was thinking about that while i was readingtrying to see him you know she stopped and cleared her throat as though something might be caught in it i could see him out in the heather hiding and the sun shining off his hair you said hed been an outlaw i justi just thought he must have known pretty wellhow to hide if people were trying to kill him she finished softly right roger spoke briskly to dispel the shadow in briannas eyes thats a marvelous job of guesswork but maybe we can tell for sure with a little more work if we can find leap o the cask on a map what kind of dummy do you think i am brianna said scornfully i thought of that the shadow disappeared replaced by an expression of smugness thats why i was so late i made the clerk drag out every map of the highlands they had she withdrew another photocopied sheet from the stack and poked a finger triumphantly near the upper edge see its so tiny it doesnt show up on most maps but this one had it right there theres the village of broch mordha which mama says is near the lallybroch estate and thereher finger moved a quarterinch pointing to a line of microscopic print see she repeated he went back to his estatelallybrochand thats where he hid not having a magnifying glass to hand ill take your word for it that that says leap o the cask roger said straightening up he grinned at brianna congratulations then he said i think youve found himthat far at least brianna smiled her eyes suspiciously bright yeah she said softly she touched the two sheets of paper with a gentle finger my father claire squeezed her daughters hand if you have your fathers hair its nice to see you have your mothers brains she said smiling lets go and celebrate your discovery with fionas dinner good job roger said to brianna as they followed claire toward the dining room his hand rested lightly on her waist you should be proud of yourself thanks she said with a brief smile but the pensive expression returned almost at once to the curve of her mouth what is it roger asked softly stopping in the hall is something the matter no not really she turned to face him a small line visible between the ruddy brows its onlyi was just thinking trying to imaginewhat do you think it was like for him living in a cave for seven years and what happened to him then moved by an impulse roger leaned forward and kissed her lightly between the brows i dont know darlin he said but maybe well find out part two lallybroch the dunbonnet lallybroch november he came down to the house once a month to shave when one of the boys brought him word it was safe always at night moving softfooted as a fox through the dark it seemed necessary somehow a small gesture toward the concept of civilization he would slip like a shadow through the kitchen door to be met with ians smile or his sisters kiss and would feel the transformation begin the basin of hot water the freshly stropped razor would be laid ready for him on the table with whatever there was for shaving soap now and then it was real soap if cousin jared had sent some from france more often just halfrendered tallow eyestinging with lye he could feel the change begin with the first scent of the kitchenso strong and rich after the windthin smells of loch and moor and woodbut it wasnt until he had finished the ritual of shaving that he felt himself altogether human once more they had learned not to expect him to talk until he had shaved words came hard after a months solitude not that he could think of nothing to say it was more that the words inside formed a logjam in his throat battling each other to get out in the short time he had he needed those few minutes of careful grooming to pick and choose what he would say first and to whom there was news to hear and to ask aboutof english patrols in the district of politics of arrests and trials in london and edinburgh that he could wait for better to talk to ian about the estate to jenny about the children if it seemed safe the children would be brought down to say hello to their uncle to give him sleepy hugs and damp kisses before stumbling back to their beds hell be getting a man soon had been his first choice of conversation when he came in september with a nod toward jennys eldest child his namesake the tenyearold sat at the table with a certain constraint immensely conscious of the dignity of his temporary position as man of the house aye all i needs another of the creatures to worry over his sister replied tartly but she touched her sons shoulder in passing with a pride that belied her words have ye word from ian then his brotherinlaw had been arrestedfor the fourth timethree weeks before and taken to inverness under suspicion of being a jacobite sympathizer jenny shook her head bringing a covered dish to set before him the thick warm smell of partridge pie drifted up from the pricked crust and made his mouth water so heavily he had to swallow before he could speak its naught to fret for jenny said spooning out the pie onto his plate her voice was calm but the small vertical line between her brows deepened ive sent fergus to show them the deed of sasine and ians discharge from his regiment theyll send him home again so soon as they realize he isna the laird of lallybroch and theres naught to be gained by deviling him with a glance at her son she reached for the ale jug precious chance they have of provin a wee bairn to be a traitor her voice was grim but held a note of satisfaction at the thought of the english courts confusion the rainspattered deed of sasine that proved transfer of the title of lallybroch from the elder james to the younger had made its appearance in court before each time foiling the crowns attempt to seize the estate as the property of a jacobite traitor he would feel it begin to slip away when he leftthat thin veneer of humanitymore of it gone with each step away from the farmhouse sometimes he would keep the illusion of warmth and family all the way to the cave where he hid other times it would disappear almost at once torn away by a chill wind rank and acrid with the scent of burning the english had burned three crofts beyond the high field pulled hugh kirby and geoff murray from their firesides and shot them by their own doorsteps with no question or word of formal accusation young joe fraser had escaped warned by his wife who had seen the english coming and had lived three weeks with jamie in the cave until the soldiers were well away from the districtand ian with them in october it had been the older lads he spoke to fergus the french boy he had taken from a paris brothel and rabbie macnab the kitchenmaids son ferguss best friend he had drawn the razor slowly down one cheek and round the angle of his jaw then wiped the lathered blade against the edge of the basin from the corner of one eye he caught a faint glimpse of fascinated envy on the face of rabbie macnab turning slightly he saw that the three boysrabbie fergus and young jamiewere all watching him intently mouths slightly open have ye no seen a man shave before he asked cocking one brow rabbie and fergus glanced at each other but left it to young jamie as titular owner of the estate to answer oh wellaye uncle he said blushing buti mmeanhe stammered slightly and blushed even harderwith my da gone and even when hes home we dinna see him shave himself always and well youve just such a lot of hair on your face uncle after a whole month and its only were so glad to see you again and it dawned on jamie quite suddenly that to the boys he must seem a most romantic figure living alone in a cave emerging at dark to hunt coming down out of the mist in the night filthy and wildhaired beard all in a fierce red sproutyes at their age it likely seemed a glamorous adventure to be an outlaw and live hidden in the heather in a dank cramped cave at fifteen and sixteen and ten they had no notion of guilt or bitter loneliness of the weight of a responsibility that could not be relieved by action they might understand fear of a sort fear of capture fear of death not the fear of solitude of his own nature fear of madness not the constant chronic fear of what his presence might do to themif they thought about that risk at all they dismissed it with the casual assumption of immortality that was the right of boys aye well he had said turning casually back to the looking glass as young jamie stuttered to a halt man is born to sorrow and whiskers one of the plagues of adam of adam fergus looked openly puzzled while the others tried to pretend they had the slightest idea what jamie was talking about fergus as a frenchie was not expected to know everything oh aye jamie pulled his upper lip down over his teeth and scraped delicately beneath his nose in the beginning when god made man adams chin was as hairless as eves and their bodies both smooth as a newborn childs he added seeing young jamies eyes dart toward rabbies crotch beardless rabbie still was but the faint dark down on his upper lip bespoke new sproutings elsewhere but when the angel wi the flaming sword drove them out of eden no sooner had they passed the gate of the garden when the hair began to sprout and itch on adams chin and ever since man has been cursed with shaving he finished his own chin with a final flourish and bowed theatrically to his audience but what about the other hair rabbie demanded ye dinna shave there young jamie giggled at the thought going red again and a damn good thing too his elder namesake observed yed need the devil of a steady hand no need of a looking glass though he added to a chorus of giggles what about the ladies fergus said his voice broke on the word ladies in a bullfrog croak that made the other two laugh harder certainly les filles have hair there too but they do not shave itusually not anyway he added clearly thinking of some of the sights of his early life in the brothel jamie heard his sisters footsteps coming down the hall oh well thats no a curse he told his rapt audience picking up the basin and tossing the contents neatly through the open window god gave that as a consolation to man if yeve ever the privilege of seeing a woman in her skin gentlemen he said looking over his shoulder toward the door and lowering his voice confidentially yell observe that the hair there grows in the shape of an arrowpointing the way ye ken so as a poor ignorant man can find his way safe home he turned grandly away from the guffawing and sniggers behind him to be struck suddenly with shame as he saw his sister coming down the hall with the slow waddling stride of advanced pregnancy she was holding the tray with his supper on top of her swelling stomach how could he have demeaned her so for a crude jest and the sake of a moments camaraderie with the boys be still he had snapped at the boys who stopped giggling abruptly and stared at him in puzzlement he hastened forward to take the tray from jenny and set it on the table it was a savoury made of goats meat and bacon and he saw ferguss prominent adams apple bob in the slender throat at the smell of it he knew they saved the best of the food for him it didnt take much looking at the pinched faces across the table when he came he brought what meat he could snared rabbits or grouse sometimes a nest of plovers eggsbut it was never enough for a house where hospitality must stretch to cover the needs of not only family and servants but the families of the murdered kirby and murray at least until spring the widows and children of his tenants must bide here and he must do his best to feed them sit down by me he said to jenny taking her arm and gently guiding her to a seat on the bench beside him she looked surprisedit was her habit to wait on him when he camebut sat down gladly enough it was late and she was tired he could see the dark smudges beneath her eyes with great firmness he cut a large slab of the savoury and set the plate before her but thats all for you jenny protested ive eaten not enough he said ye need morefor the babe he added with inspiration if she would not eat for herself she would for the child she hesitated a moment longer but then smiled at him picked up her spoon and began to eat now it was november and the chill struck through the thin shirt and breeches he wore he hardly noticed intent on his tracking it was cloudy but with a thinlayered mackerel sky through which the full moon shed plenty of light thank god it wasnt raining impossible to hear through the pattering of raindrops and the pungent scent of wet plants masked the smell of animals his nose had grown almost painfully acute through the long months of living outdoors the smells of the house sometimes nearly knocked him down when he stepped inside he wasnt quite close enough to smell the musky scent of the stag but he heard the telltale rustle of its brief start when it scented him now it would be frozen one of the shadows that rippled across the hillside around him under the racing clouds he turned as slowly as he possibly could toward the spot where his ears had told him the stag stood his bow was in his hand an arrow ready to the string he would have one shotmaybewhen the stag bolted yes there his heart sprang into his throat as he saw the antlers pricking sharp and black above the surrounding gorse he steadied himself took a deep breath and then the one step forward the crash of a deers flight was always startlingly loud to frighten back a stalker this stalker was prepared though he neither startled nor pursued but stood his ground sighting along the shaft of the arrow following with his eye the track of the springing deer judging the moment holding fire and then the bowstring slapped his wrist with stinging force it was a clean shot just behind the shoulder and a good thing too he doubted he had the strength to run down a fullgrown stag it had fallen in a clear spot behind a clump of gorse legs stuck out stiff as sticks in the oddly helpless way of dying ungulates the hunters moon lit its glazing eye so the soft dark stare was hidden the mystery of its dying shielded by blank silver he pulled the dirk from his belt and knelt by the deer hastily saying the words of the gralloch prayer old john murray ians father had taught him his own fathers mouth had twisted slightly hearing it from which he gathered that this prayer was perhaps not addressed to the same god they spoke to in church on sunday but his father had said nothing and he had mumbled the words himself scarcely noticing what he said in the nervous excitement of feeling old johns hand steady on his own for the first time pressing down the knife blade into hairy hide and steaming flesh now with the sureness of practice he thrust up the sticky muzzle in one hand and with the other slit the deers throat the blood spurted hot over knife and hand pumping two or three times the jet dying away to a steady stream as the carcass drained the great vessels of the throat cut through had he paused to think he might not have done it but hunger and dizziness and the cold fresh intoxication of the night had taken him far past the point of thinking he cupped his hands beneath the running stream and brought them steaming to his mouth the moon shone black on his cupped spilling hands and it was as though he absorbed the deers substance rather than drank it the taste of the blood was salt and silver and the heat of it was his own there was no startlement of hot or cold as he swallowed only the taste of it rich in his mouth and the headswimming hotmetal smell and the sudden clench and rumble of his belly at the nearness of food he closed his eyes and breathed and the cold damp air came back between the hot reek of the carcass and his senses he swallowed once then wiped the back of his hand across his face cleaned his hands on the grass and set about the business at hand there was the sudden effort of moving the limp heavy carcass and then the gralloch the long stroke of mingled strength and delicacy that slit the hide between the legs but did not penetrate the sac that held the entrails he forced his hands into the carcass a hot wet intimacy and again there was an effortful tug that brought out the sac slick and moonshining in his hands a slash above and another below and the mass slid free the transformation of black magic that changed a deer to meat it was a small stag although it had points to its antlers with luck he could carry it alone rather than leave it to the mercy of foxes and badgers until he could bring help to move it he ducked a shoulder under one leg and slowly rose grunting with effort as he shifted the burden to a solid resting place across his back the moon cast his shadow on a rock humped and fantastic as he made his slow ungainly way down the hill the deers antlers bobbed above his shoulder giving him in shadowed profile the semblance of a horned man he shivered slightly at the thought remembering tales of witches sabbats where the horned one came to drink the sacrifice of goats or roosters blood he felt a little queasy and more than a little lightheaded more and more he felt the disorientation the fragmenting of himself between day and night by day he was a creature of the mind alone as he escaped his damp immobility by a stubborn disciplined retreat into the avenues of thought and meditation seeking refuge in the pages of books but with the rising of the moon all sense fled succumbing at once to sensation as he emerged into the fresh air like a beast from its lair to run the dark hills beneath the stars and hunt driven by hunger drunk with blood and moonlight he stared at the ground as he walked nightsight keen enough to keep his footing despite the heavy burden the deer was limp and cooling its stiff soft hair scratching against the back of his neck and his own sweat cooling in the breeze as though he shared his preys fate it was only as the lights of lallybroch manor came into view that he felt at last the mantle of humanity fall upon him and mind and body joined as one again as he prepared himself to greet his family to us a child is given three weeks later there was still no word of ians return no word of any kind in fact fergus had not come to the cave in several days leaving jamie in a fret of worry over how things might be at the house if nothing else the deer he had shot would have gone long since with all the extra mouths to feed and there would be precious little from the kailyard at this time of year he was sufficiently worried to risk an early visit checking his snares and coming down from the hills just before sunset just in case he was careful to pull on the woolen bonnet knitted of rough dun yarn that would hide his hair from any telltale fingering of late sunbeams his size alone might provoke suspicion but not certainty and he had full confidence in the strength of his legs to carry him out of harms way should he have the ill luck to meet with an english patrol hares in the heather were little match for jamie fraser given warning the house was strangely quiet as he approached there was none of the usual racket made by children jennys five and the six bairns belonging to the tenants to say nothing of fergus and rabbie macnab who were a long way from being too old to chase each other round the stables screeching like fiends the house felt strangely empty round him as he paused just inside the kitchen door he was standing in the back hall the pantry to one side the scullery to the other and the main kitchen just beyond he stood stockstill reaching out with all his senses listening as he inhaled the overpowering smells of the house no there was someone here the faint sound of a scrape followed by a soft regular clinking came from behind the clothpadded door that kept the heat of the kitchen from seeping out into the chilly back pantry it was a reassuringly domestic sound so he pushed open the door cautiously but without undue fear his sister jenny alone and vastly pregnant was standing at the table stirring something in a yellow bowl what are you doing in here wheres mrs coker his sister dropped the spoon with a startled shriek jamie palefaced she pressed a hand to her breast and closed her eyes christ ye scairt the bowels out of me she opened her eyes dark blue like his own and fixed him with a penetrating stare and what in the name of the holy mother are ye doing here now i wasna expecting ye for a week at least fergus hasna come up the hill lately i got worried he said simply yere a sweet man jamie the color was coming back into her face she smiled at her brother and came close to hug him it was an awkward business with the impending baby in the way but pleasant nonetheless he rested his cheek for a moment on the sleek darkness of her head breathing in her complex aroma of candle wax and cinnamon tallowsoap and wool there was an unusual element to her scent this evening he thought she was beginning to smell of milk where is everyone he asked releasing her reluctantly well mrs cokers dead she answered the faint crease between her brows deepening aye he said softly and crossed himself im sorry for it mrs coker had been first housemaid and then housekeeper for the family since the marriage of his own parents fortyodd years before when yesterday forenoon twasnt unexpected poor soul and it was peaceful she died in her own bed like she wanted and father mcmurtry prayin over her jamie glanced reflexively toward the door that led to the servants rooms off the kitchen is she still here his sister shook her head no i told her son they should have the wake here at the house but the cokers thought everything being like it isher small moue encompassed ians absence lurking redcoats refugee tenants the dearth of food and his own inconvenient presence in the cavethey thought better to have it at broch mordha at her sisters place so thats where everyones gone i told them i didna feel well enough to go she added then smiled raising an impish brow but it was really that i wanted a few hours peace and quiet wi the lot of them gone and here ive come breakin in on your peace jamie said ruefully shall i go no clotheid his sister said affably sit ye down and ill get on wi the supper whats to eat then he asked sniffing hopefully depends on what yeve brought his sister replied she moved heavily about the kitchen taking things from cupboard and hutch pausing to stir the large kettle hung over the fire from which a thin steam was rising if yeve brought meat well have it if not its brose and hough he made a face at this the thought of boiled barley and shinbeef the last remnants of the salted beef carcass theyd bought two months before was unappealing just as well i had luck then he said he upended his game bag and let the three rabbits fall onto the table in a limp tumble of gray fur and crumpled ears and blackthorn berries he added tipping out the contents of the dun bonnet now stained inside with the rich red juice jennys eyes brightened at the sight hare pie she declared theres no currants but the berries will do even better and theres enough butter thank god catching a tiny blink of movement among the gray fur she slapped her hand down on the table neatly obliterating the minuscule intruder take them out and skin em jamie or the kitchen will be hopping wi fleas returning with the skinned carcasses he found the piecrust well advanced and jenny with smears of flour on her dress cut them into collops and break the bones for me will ye jamie she said frowning at mrs mcclintocks receipts for cookery and pastrywork laid open on the table beside the pie pan surely ye can make hare pie without looking in the wee book he said obligingly taking the big bonecrushing wooden mallet from the top of the hutch where it was kept he grimaced as he took it into his hand feeling the weight of it it was very like the one that had broken his right hand several years before in an english prison and he had a sudden vivid memory of the shattered bones in a hare pie splintered and cracked leaking salty blood and marrowsweetness into the meat aye i can his sister answered abstractedly thumbing through the pages its only that when ye havena got half the things ye need to make a dish sometimes theres something else youll come across in here that ye can use instead she frowned at the page before her ordinarily id use claret in the sauce but weve none in the house save one of jareds casks in the priest hole and i dinna want to broach that yetwe might need it he didnt need telling what she might use it for a cask of claret might grease the skids for ians releaseor at least pay for news of his welfare he stole a sidewise glance at the great round of jennys belly it wasnt for a man to say but to his not inexperienced eyes she looked damn near her time absently he reached over the kettle and swished the blade of his dirk to and fro in the scalding liquid then pulled it out and wiped it clean whyever did ye do that jamie he turned to find jenny staring at him the black curls were coming undone from their ribbon and it gave him a pang to see the glimmer of a single white hair among the ebony oh he said too obviously offhand as he picked up one carcass claireshe told me ye ought to wash off a blade in boiling water before ye touched food with it he felt rather than saw jennys eyebrows rise she had asked him about claire only once when he had come home from culloden halfconscious and mostly dead with fever she is gone he had said and turned his face away dinna speak her name to me again loyal as always jenny had not and neither had he he could not have said what made him say it today unless perhaps it was the dreams he had them often in varying forms and it always unsettled him the day after as though for a moment claire had really been near enough to touch and then had drawn away again he could swear that sometimes he woke with the smell of her on him musky and rich pricked with the sharp fresh scents of leaves and green herbs he had spilled his seed in his sleep more than once while dreaming an occurrence that left him faintly shamed and uneasy in mind to distract both of them he nodded at jennys stomach how close is it he asked frowning at her swollen midsection ye look like a puffball mushroomone touch and poof he flicked his fingers wide in illustration oh aye well and i could wish it was as easy as poof she arched her back rubbing at the small of it and making her belly protrude in an alarming fashion he pressed back against the wall to give it room as for when anytime i expect no telling for sure she picked up the cup and measured out the flour precious little left in the bag he noted with some grimness send up to the cave when it starts he said suddenly ill come down redcoats or no jenny stopped stirring and stared at him you why well ians not here he pointed out picking up one skinned carcass with the expertise of long practice he neatly disjointed a thigh and cut it free from the backbone three quick smacks with the boning mallet and the pale flesh lay flattened and ready for the pie and a great lot of help hed be if he was jenny said he took care of his part o the business nine months ago she wrinkled her nose at her brother and reached for the plate of butter mmphm he sat down to continue his work which brought her belly close to his eyelevel the contents awake and active was shifting to and fro in a restless manner making her apron twitch and bulge as she stirred he couldnt resist reaching out to put a light hand against the monstrous curve to feel the surprising strong thrusts and kicks of the inhabitant impatient of its cramped confinement send fergus for me when its time he said again she looked down at him in exasperation and batted his hand away with the spoon have i no just been telling ye i dinna need ye for gods sake man have i not enough to worry me wi the house full of people and scarce enough to feed them ian in gaol in inverness and redcoats crawling in at the windows every time i look round should i have to worry that yell be taken up as well ye needna be worrit for me ill take care he didnt look at her but focused his attention on the forejoint he was slicing through well then have a care and stay put on the hill she looked down her long straight nose peering at him over the rim of the bowl ive had six bairns already aye ye dinna think i can manage by now no arguing wi you is there he demanded no she said promptly so youll stay ill come jenny narrowed her eyes and gave him a long level look yere maybe the most stubborn gomerel between here and aberdeen no a smile spread across her brothers face as he looked up at her maybe so he said he reached across and patted her heaving belly and maybe no but im coming send fergus when its time it was near dawn three days later that fergus came panting up the slope to the cave missing the trail in the dark and making such a crashing through the gorse bushes that jamie heard him coming long before he reached the opening milord he began breathlessly as he emerged by the head of the trail but jamie was already past the boy pulling his cloak around his shoulders as he hurried down toward the house but milord ferguss voice came behind him panting and frightened milord the soldiers soldiers he stopped suddenly and turned waiting impatiently for the french lad to make his way down the slope what soldiers he demanded as fergus slithered the last few feet english dragoons milord milady sent me to tell youon no account are you to leave the cave one of the men saw the soldiers yesterday camped near dunmaglas damn yes milord fergus sat down on a rock and fanned himself narrow chest heaving as he caught his breath jamie hesitated irresolute every instinct fought against going back into the cave his blood was heated by the surge of excitement caused by ferguss appearance and he rebelled at the thought of meekly crawling back into hiding like a grub seeking refuge beneath its rock mmphm he said he glanced down at fergus the changing light was beginning to outline the boys slender form against the blackness of the gorse but his face was still a pale smudge marked with a pair of darker smudges that were his eyes a certain suspicion was stirring in jamie why had his sister sent fergus at this odd hour if it had been necessary urgently to warn him about the dragoons it would have been safer to send the boy up during the night if the need was not urgent why not wait until the next night the answer to that was obviousbecause jenny thought she might not be able to send him word the next night how is it with my sister he asked fergus oh well milord quite well the hearty tone of this assurance confirmed all jamies suspicions shes having the child no he demanded no milord certainly not jamie reached down and clamped a hand on ferguss shoulder the bones felt small and fragile beneath his fingers reminding him uncomfortably of the rabbits he had broken for jenny nonetheless he forced his grip to tighten fergus squirmed trying to ease away tell me the truth man jamie said no milord truly the grip tightened inexorably did she tell you not to tell me jennys prohibition must have been a literal one for fergus answered this question with evident relief yes milord ah he relaxed his grip and fergus sprang to his feet now talking volubly as he rubbed his scrawny shoulder she said i must not tell you anything except about the soldiers milord for if i did she would cut off my cods and boil them like turnips and sausage jamie could not repress a smile at this threat short of food we may be he assured his protégé but not that short he glanced at the horizon where a thin line of pink showed pure and vivid behind the black pines silhouette come along then itll be full light in half an hour there was no hint of silent emptiness about the house this dawn anyone with half an eye could see that things were not as usual at lallybroch the wash kettle sat on its plinth in the yard with the fire gone out under it full of cold water and sodden clothes moaning cries from the barnlike someone being strangledindicated that the sole remaining cow urgently required milking an irritable blatting from the goat shed let him know that the female inhabitants would like some similar attention as well as he came into the yard three chickens ran past in a feathery squawk with jehu the rat terrier in close pursuit with a quick dart he leaped forward and booted the dog catching it just under the ribs it flew into the air with a look of intense surprise on its face then landing with a yip picked itself up and made off he found the children the older boys mary macnab and the other housemaid sukie all crammed into the parlor under the watchful eye of mrs kirby a stern and rockribbed widow who was reading to them from the bible and adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression read mrs kirby there was a loud rolling scream from upstairs that seemed to go on and on mrs kirby paused for a moment to allow everyone to appreciate it before resuming the reading her eyes pale gray and wet as raw oysters flickered toward the ceiling then rested with satisfaction on the row of strained faces before her notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing if she continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety she read kitty burst into hysterical sobbing and buried her head in her sisters shoulder maggie ellen was growing bright red beneath her freckles while her elder brother had gone deadwhite at the scream mrs kirby said jamie be still if ye please the words were civil enough but the look in his eyes must have been the one that jehu saw just before his bootassisted flight for mrs kirby gasped and dropped the bible which landed on the floor with a papery thump jamie bent and picked it up then showed mrs kirby his teeth the expression evidently was not successful as a smile but had some effect nonetheless mrs kirby went quite pale and put a hand to her ample bosom perhaps yed go to the kitchen and make yourself useful he said with a jerk of his head that sent sukie the kitchenmaid scuttling out like a windblown leaf with considerably more dignity but no hesitation mrs kirby rose and followed her heartened by this small victory jamie disposed of the parlors other occupants in short order sending the widow murray and her daughters out to deal with the wash kettle the smaller children out to catch chickens under the supervision of mary macnab the older lads departed with obvious relief to tend the stock the room empty at last he stood for a moment hesitating as to what to do next he felt obscurely that he should stay in the house on guard though he was acutely aware that he couldas jenny had saiddo nothing to help whatever happened there was an unfamiliar mule hobbled in the dooryard presumably the midwife was upstairs with jenny unable to sit he prowled restlessly around the parlor the bible in his hand touching things jennys bookshelf battered and scarred from the last incursion of redcoats three months ago the big silver epergne that was slightly dented but had been too heavy to fit in a soldiers knapsack and so had escaped the pilfering of smaller objects not that the english had got so much the few truly valuable items along with the tiny store of gold they had left were safely tucked away in the priest hole with jareds wine hearing a prolonged moan from above he glanced down involuntarily at the bible in his hand not really wanting to still he let the book fall open showing the page at the front where the marriages births and deaths of the family were recorded the entries began with his parents marriage brian fraser and ellen mackenzie the names and the date were written in his mothers fine round hand with underneath a brief notation in his fathers firmer blacker scrawl marrit for love it saida pointed observation in view of the next entry which showed willies birth which had occurred scarcely two months past the date of the marriage jamie smiled as always at sight of the words and glanced up at the painting of himself aged two standing with willie and bran the huge deerhound all that was left of willie who had died of the smallpox at eleven the painting had a slash through the canvasthe work of a bayonet he supposed taking out its owners frustration and if ye hadna died he said softly to the picture then what then what indeed closing the book his eye caught the last entrycaitlin maisri murray born december died december aye if if the redcoats had not come on december would jenny have borne the child too early if they had had enough food so that she like the rest of them was no more than skin and bones and the bulge of her belly would that have helped no telling is there he said to the painting willies painted hand rested on his shoulder he had always felt safe with willie standing behind him another scream came from upstairs and a spasm of fear clenched his hands on the book pray for us brother he whispered and crossing himself laid down the bible and went out to the barn to help with the stock there was little to do here rabbie and fergus between them were more than able to take care of the few animals that remained and young jamie at ten was big enough to be a substantial help looking about for something to do jamie gathered up an armful of scattered hay and took it down the slope to the midwifes mule when the hay was gone the cow would have to be slaughtered unlike the goats it couldnt get enough forage on the winter hills to sustain it even with the picked grass and weeds the small children brought in with luck the salted carcass would last them through til spring as he came back into the barn fergus looked up from his manure fork this is a proper midwife of good repute fergus demanded he thrust out a long chin aggressively madame should not be entrusted to the care of a peasant surely how should i know jamie said testily dye think i had anything to do wi engaging midwives mrs martin the old midwife who had delivered all previous murray children had diedlike so many othersduring the famine in the year following culloden mrs innes the new midwife was much younger he hoped she had sufficient experience to know what she was doing rabbie seemed inclined to join the argument as well he scowled blackly at fergus aye and what dye mean peasant yere a peasant too or have ye not noticed fergus stared down his nose at rabbie with some dignity despite the fact that he was forced to tilt his head backward in order to do so he being several inches shorter than his friend whether i am a peasant or not is of no consequence he said loftily i am not a midwife am i no yere a fiddlemafyke rabbie gave his friend a rough push and with a sudden whoop of surprise fergus fell backward to land heavily on the stable floor in a flash he was up he lunged at rabbie who sat laughing on the edge of the manger but jamies hand snatched him by the collar and pulled him back none of that said his employer i willna have ye spoilin what little hays left he set fergus back on his feet and to distract him asked and what dye ken of midwives anyway a great deal milord fergus dusted himself off with elegant gestures many of the ladies at madame elises were brought to bed while i was there i daresay they were jamie interjected dryly or is it childbed ye mean childbed certainly why i was born there myself the french boy puffed his narrow chest importantly indeed jamies mouth quirked slightly well and i trust ye made careful observations at the time so as to say how such matters should be arranged fergus ignored this piece of sarcasm well of course he said matteroffactly the midwife will naturally have put a knife beneath the bed to cut the pain im none so sure she did that rabbie muttered at least it doesna sound much like it most of the screaming was inaudible from the barn but not all of it and an egg should be blessed with holy water and put at the foot of the bed so that the woman shall bring forth the child easily fergus continued oblivious he frowned i gave the woman an egg myself but she did not appear to know what to do with it and i had been keeping it especially for the last month too he added plaintively since the hens scarcely lay anymore i wanted to be sure of having one when it was needed now following the birth he went on losing his doubts in the enthusiasm of his lecture the midwife must brew a tea of the placenta and give it to the woman to drink so that her milk will flow strongly rabbie made a faint retching sound of the afterbirth ye mean he said disbelievingly god jamie felt a bit queasy at this exhibition of modern medical knowledge himself aye well he said to rabbie striving for casualness they eat frogs ye know and snails i suppose maybe afterbirth isna so strange considering privately he wondered whether it might not be long before they were all eating frogs and snails but thought that a speculation better kept to himself rabbie made mock puking noises christ whod be a frenchie fergus standing close to rabbie whirled and shot out a lightning fist fergus was small and slender for his age but strong for all that and with a deadly aim for a mans weak points knowledge acquired as a juvenile pickpocket on the streets of paris the blow caught rabbie squarely in the wind and he doubled over with a sound like a steppedon pigs bladder speak with respect of your betters if you please fergus said haughtily rabbies face turned several shades of red and his mouth opened and closed like a fishs as he struggled to get his breath back his eyes bulged with a look of intense surprise and he looked so ridiculous that it was a struggle for jamie not to laugh despite his worry over jenny and his irritation at the boys squabbling will ye wee doiters no keep your paws off he began when he was interrupted by a cry from young jamie who had until now been silent fascinated by the conversation what jamie whirled hand going automatically to the pistol he carried whenever he left the cave but there was not as he had halfexpected an english patrol in the stableyard what the hell is it he demanded then following young jamies pointing finger he saw them three small black specks drifting across the brown crumple of dead vines in the potato field ravens he said softly and felt the hair rise on the back of his neck for those birds of war and slaughter to come to a house during a birth was the worst sort of ill luck one of the filthy beasts was actually settling on the rooftree as he watched with no conscious thought he took the pistol from his belt and braced the muzzle across his forearm sighting carefully it was a long shot from the door of the stable to the rooftree and sighted upward too still the pistol jerked in his hand and the raven exploded in a cloud of black feathers its two companions shot into the air as though blown there by the explosion and flapped madly away their hoarse cries fading quickly on the winter air mon dieu fergus exclaimed cest bien ça aye bonny shooting sir rabbie still redfaced and a little breathless had recovered himself in time to see the shot now he nodded toward the house pointing with his chin look sir is that the midwife it was mrs innes poked her head out of the secondstory window fair hair flying loose as she leaned out to peer into the yard below perhaps she had been drawn by the sound of the shot fearing some trouble jamie stepped into the stableyard and waved at the window to reassure her its all right he shouted only an accident he didnt mean to mention the ravens lest the midwife tell jenny come up she shouted ignoring this the bairns born and your sister wants ye jenny opened one eye blue and slightly slanted like his own so ye came aye i thought someone should be hereif only to pray for ye he said gruffly she closed the eye and a small smile curved her lips she looked he thought very like a painting he had seen in francean old one by some italian fellow but a good picture nonetheless yere a silly fooland im glad of it she said softly she opened her eyes and glanced down at the swaddled bundle she held in the crook of her arm dye want to see him oh a him is it with hands experienced by years of unclehood he lifted the tiny package and cuddled it against himself pushing back the flap of blanket that shaded its face its eyes were closed tight shut the lashes not visible in the deep crease of the eyelids the eyelids themselves lay at a sharp angle above the flushed smooth rounds of the cheeks giving promise that it mightin this one recognizable feature at leastresemble its mother the head was oddly lumpy with a lopsided appearance that made jamie think uncomfortably of a kickedin melon but the small fat mouth was relaxed and peaceful the moist pink underlip quivering faintly with the snore attendant on the exhaustion of being born hard work was it he said speaking to the child but it was the mother who answered him aye it was jenny said theres whisky in the armoirewill ye fetch me a glass her voice was hoarse and she had to clear her throat before finishing the request whisky should ye not be having ale wi eggs beaten up in it he asked repressing with some difficulty a mental vision of ferguss suggestion of appropriate sustenance for newly delivered mothers whisky his sister said definitely when ye were lyin downstairs crippled and your leg killin ye did i give ye ale wi eggs beaten up in it ye fed me stuff a damn sight worse than that her brother said with a grin but yere right ye gave me whisky too he laid the sleeping child carefully on the coverlet and turned to get the whisky has he a name yet he asked nodding toward the baby as he poured out a generous cup of the amber liquid ill call him ian for his da jennys hand rested gently for a moment on the rounded skull lightly furred with a goldbrown fuzz a pulse beat visibly in the soft spot on top it seemed hideously fragile to jamie but the midwife had assured him the babe was a fine lusty lad and he supposed he must take her word for it moved by an obscure impulse to protect that nakedly exposed soft spot he picked up the baby once more pulling the blanket up over its head mary macnab told me about you and mrs kirby jenny remarked sipping pity i didna see itshe said the wretched auld besom nearly swallowed her tongue when ye spoke to her jamie smiled in return gently patting the babys back as it lay against his shoulder dead asleep the little body lay inert as a boneless ham a soft comforting weight too bad she didnt how can ye stand the woman living in the same house wi ye id strangle her were i here every day his sister snorted and closed her eyes tilting her head back to let the whisky slide down her throat ah folk fash ye as much as ye let them i dinna let her much still she added opening her eyes i canna say as ill be sorry to be rid of her i have it in my mind to palm her off on auld kettrick down at broch mordha his wife and his daughter both died last year and hell be wanting someone to do for him aye but if i were samuel kettrick id take the widow murray jamie observed not the widow kirby peggy murrays already provided for his sister assured him shell wed duncan gibbons in the spring thats fast work for duncan he said a little surprised then a thought occurred to him and he grinned at her do either o them know it yet no she said grinning back then the smile faded into a speculative look unless you were thinking of peggy yourself that is me jamie was as startled as if she had suddenly suggested he might wish to jump out of the secondstory window shes only five and twenty jenny pursued young enough for more bairns and a good mother how much of that whisky have ye had her brother bent forward and pretended to examine the level of the decanter cupping the babys head in one palm to prevent it wobbling he straightened up and gave his sister a look of mild exasperation im living like an animal in a cave and ye wish me to take a wife he felt suddenly hollow inside to prevent her seeing that the suggestion had upset him he rose and walked up and down the room making unnecessary small humming noises to the bundle in his arms how long is it since yeve lain wi a woman jamie his sister asked conversationally behind him shocked he turned on his heel to stare at her what the hell sort of question is that to ask a man youve not gone wi any of the unwed lasses between lallybroch and broch mordha she went on paying no attention or id have heard of it none of the widows either i dinna think she paused delicately ye know damn well i havent he said shortly he could feel his cheeks flushing with annoyance why not his sister asked bluntly why not he stared at her his mouth slightly open have ye lost your senses what dye think im the sort of man would slink about from house to house bedding any woman who didna drive me out wi a girdle in her hand as if they would no youre a good man jamie jenny smiled half sadly ye wouldna take advantage of any woman yed marry first no no he said violently the baby twitched and made a sleepy sound and he transferred it automatically to his other shoulder patting as he glared at his sister i dinna mean to marry again so ye just abandon all thought of matchmaking jenny murray i willna have it dye hear oh i hear she said unperturbed she pushed herself higher on the pillow so as to look him in the eye ye mean to live a monk to the end of your days she asked go to your grave wi no son to bury you or bless your name mind your own business damn ye heart pounding he turned his back on her and strode to the window where he stood staring sightlessly out over the stableyard i ken ye mourn claire his sisters voice came softly from behind him dye think i could forget ian if he doesna come back but its time ye went on jamie ye dinna think claire would mean ye to live alone all your life with no one to comfort ye or bear your children he didnt answer for a long time just stood feeling the soft heat of the small fuzzy head pressed against the side of his neck he could see himself dimly in the misted glass a tall dirty gangle of a man the round white bundle incongruous beneath his own grim face she was with child he said softly at last speaking to the reflection when shewhen i lost her how else could he put it there was no way to tell his sister where claire waswhere he hoped she was that he could not think of another woman hoping that claire still lived even knowing her truly lost to him for good there was a long silence from the bed then jenny said quietly is that why ye came today he sighed and turned sideways toward her leaning his head against the cool glass his sister was lying back her dark hair loose on the pillow eyes gone soft as she looked at him aye maybe he said i couldna help my wife i suppose i thought i might help you not that i could he added with some bitterness i am as useless to you as i was to her jenny stretched out a hand to him face filled with distress jamie mo chridhe she said but then stopped eyes widening in sudden alarm as a splintering crash and the sound of screams came from the house below holy mary she said growing even whiter its the english christ it was as much a prayer as an exclamation of surprise he glanced quickly from the bed to the window judging the possibilities of hiding versus those of escape the sounds of booted feet were already on the stair the cupboard jamie jenny whispered urgently pointing without hesitation he stepped into the armoire and pulled the door to behind him the door of the chamber sprang open with a crash a moment later to be filled with a redcoated figure in a cocked hat holding a drawn sword before him the captain of dragoons paused and darted his eyes all round the chamber finally settling on the small figure in the bed mrs murray he said jenny struggled to pull herself upright i am and what in flaming hell are ye doing in my house she demanded her face was pale and shiny with sweat and her arms trembled but she held her chin up and glared at the man get out disregarding her the man moved into the room and over to the window jamie could see his indistinct form disappear past the edge of the wardrobe then reappear back turned as he spoke to jenny one of my scouts reported hearing a shot from the vicinity of this house not long since where are your men i have none her trembling arms would not support her longer and jamie saw his sister ease herself back collapsing on the pillows youve taken my husband alreadymy eldest son is no more than ten she did not mention rabbie or fergus boys of their age were old enough to be treatedor mistreatedas men should the captain take the notion with luck they would have taken to their heels at the first sight of the english the captain was a hardbitten man of middle age and not overly given to credulity the keeping of weapons in the highlands is a serious offense he said and turned to the soldier who had come into the room behind him search the house jenkins he had to raise his voice in the giving of the order for there was a rising commotion in the stairwell as jenkins turned to leave the room mrs innes the midwife burst past the soldier who tried to bar her way leave the poor lady alone she cried facing the captain with fists clenched at her sides the midwifes voice shook and her hair was coming down from its snood but she stood her ground get out ye wretches leave her be i am not mistreating your mistress the captain said with some irritation evidently mistaking mrs innes for one of the maids i am merely and her not delivered but an hour since it isna decent even for ye to lay eyes on her so much as delivered the captains voice sharpened and he glanced from the midwife to the bed in sudden interest you have borne a child mrs murray where is the infant the infant in question stirred inside its wrappings disturbed by the tightened grip of its horrorstricken uncle from the depths of the wardrobe he could see his sisters face white to the lips and set like stone the child is dead she said the midwifes mouth dropped open in shock but luckily the captains attention was riveted on jenny oh he said slowly was it mama the cry of anguish came from the doorway as young jamie broke free of a soldiers grip and hurled himself at his mother mama the babys dead no no sobbing he flung himself on his knees and buried his head in the bedclothes as though to refute his brothers statement baby ian gave evidence of his living state by kicking his legs with considerable vigor against his uncles ribs and emitting a series of small snuffling grunts which fortunately went unheard in the commotion outside jenny was trying to comfort young jamie mrs innes was futilely attempting to raise the boy who kept a death grip on his mothers sleeve the captain was vainly trying to make himself heard above young jamies griefstricken wails and over all the muted sound of boots and shouting vibrated through the house jamie rather thought the captain was inquiring as to the location of the infants body he clutched the body in question closer joggling it in an attempt to prevent any disposition on its part to cry his other hand went to the hilt of his dirk but it was a vain gesture it was doubtful that even cutting his own throat would be of help if the wardrobe were opened baby ian made an irascible noise suggesting that he disliked being joggled with visions of the house in flames and the inhabitants slaughtered the noise sounded as loud to jamie as his elder nephews anguished howls you did it young jamie had gotten to his feet face wet and swollen with tears and rage and was advancing on the captain curly black head lowered like a small rams you killed my brother ye english prick the captain was somewhat taken aback by this sudden attack and actually took a step back blinking at the boy no boy youre quite mistaken why i only prick cod a mhic an diabhoil entirely beside himself young jamie was stalking the captain yelling every obscenity he had ever heard used in gaelic or english enh said baby ian in the elder jamies ear enh enh this sounded very much like the preliminary to a fullfledged screech and in a panic jamie let go of his dirk and thrust his thumb into the soft moist opening from which the sounds were issuing the babys toothless gums clamped onto his thumb with a ferocity that nearly made him exclaim aloud get out get out get out or ill kill ye young jamie was screaming at the captain face contorted with rage the redcoat looked helplessly at the bed as though to ask jenny to call off this implacable small foe but she lay as though dead with her eyes closed i shall wait for my men downstairs the captain said with what dignity he could and withdrew shutting the door hastily behind him deprived of his enemy young jamie fell to the floor and collapsed into helpless weeping through the crack in the door jamie saw mrs innes look at jenny mouth opening to ask a question jenny shot up from the bedclothes like lazarus scowling ferociously finger pressed to her lips to enjoin silence baby ian champed viciously at the thumb growling at its failure to yield any sustenance jenny swung herself to the side of the bed and sat there waiting the sounds of the soldiers below throbbed and eddied through the house jenny was shaking with weakness but she reached out a hand toward the armoire where her men lay hidden jamie drew a deep breath and braced himself it would have to be risked his hand and wrist were wet with saliva and the babys growls of frustration were growing louder he stumbled from the wardrobe drenched with sweat and thrust the infant at jenny baring her breast with a single wrench she pressed the small head to her nipple and bent over the tiny bundle as though to protect it the beginnings of a squawk disappeared into the muffled sounds of vigorous sucking and jamie sat down on the floor quite suddenly feeling as though someone had run a sword behind his knees young jamie had sat up at the sudden opening of the wardrobe and now sat spraddled against the door his face blank with bewildered shock as he looked from his mother to his uncle and back again mrs innes knelt beside him whispering urgently in his ear but no sign of comprehension showed on the small tearstreaked face by the time shouts and the creaking of harness outside betokened the soldiers departure young ian lay replete and snoring in his mothers arms jamie stood by the window just out of sight watching them go the room was silent save for the liquid noise of mrs innes drinking whisky young jamie sat close against his mother cheek pressed to her shoulder she had not looked up once since taking the baby and still sat head lowered over the child in her lap her black hair hiding her face jamie stepped forward and touched her shoulder the warmth of her seemed shocking as though cold dread were his natural state and the touch of another person somehow foreign and unnatural ill go to the priest hole he said softly and to the cave when its dark jenny nodded but without looking up at him there were several white hairs among the black he saw glinting silver by the parting down the center of her head i thinki should not come down again he said at last for a time jenny said nothing but nodded once more being now justified by his blood as it was he did come down to the house once more for two months he stayed close hidden in the cave scarcely daring to come out at night to hunt for the english soldiers were still in the district quartered at comar the troops went out by day in small patrols of eight or ten combing the countryside looting what little there was to steal destroying what they could not use and all with the blessing of the english crown a path led close by the base of the hill where his cavern was concealed no more than a rude track it had begun as a deer path and still largely served that use though it was a foolish stag that would venture within smelling distance of the cave still sometimes when the wind was right he would see a small group of the red deer on the path or find fresh spoor in the exposed mud of the track next day it was helpful as well for such people as had business on the mountainsidefew enough as those were the wind had been blowing downwind from the cave and he had no expectation of seeing deer he had been lying on the ground just within the cave entrance where enough light filtered through the overhanging screen of gorse and rowan for him to read on fine days there were not a great many books but jared managed still to smuggle a few with his gifts from france this violent rain forced me to a new work viz to cut a hole through my new fortification like a sink to let the water go out which would else have drowned my cave after i had been in my cave some time and found still no more shocks of the earthquake follow i began to be more composed and now to support my spirits which indeed wanted it very much i went to my little store and took a small sup of rum which however i did then and always very sparingly knowing i could have no more when that was gone it continued raining all that night and great part of the next day so that i could not stir abroad but my mind being more composed i began to think the shadows across the page moved as the bushes above him stirred instincts attuned he caught the shift of the wind at onceand on it the sound of voices he sprang to his feet hand on the dirk that never left his side barely pausing to put the book carefully on its ledge he grasped the knob of granite that he used as a handhold and pulled himself up into the steep narrow crevice that formed the caves entrance the bright flash of red and metal on the path below hit him with a blow of shock and annoyance damn he had little fear that any of the soldiers would leave the paththey were poorly equipped for making their way even through the normal stretches of open spongy peat and heather let alone an overgrown brambly slope like thisbut having them so close meant he could not risk leaving the cave before dark even to get water or relieve himself he cast a quick glance at his water jug knowing as he did so that it was nearly empty a shout pulled his attention back to the track below and he nearly lost his grip on the rock the soldiers had bunched themselves around a small figure humped under the weight of a small cask it bore on its shoulder fergus on his way up with a cask of freshbrewed ale damn and damn again he could have done with that ale it had been months since hed had any the wind had changed again so he caught only small snatches of words but the small figure seemed to be arguing with the soldier in front of him gesticulating violently with its free hand idiot said jamie under his breath give it to them and begone ye wee clot one soldier made a twohanded grab at the cask and missed as the small darkhaired figure jumped nimbly back jamie smacked himself on the forehead with exasperation fergus could never resist insolence when confronted with authorityespecially english authority the small figure now was skipping backward shouting something at his pursuers fool jamie said violently drop it and run instead of either dropping the cask or running fergus apparently sure of his own speed turned his back on the soldiers and waggled his rump insultingly at them sufficiently incensed to risk their footing in the soggy vegetation several of the redcoats jumped the path to follow jamie saw their leader raise an arm and shout in warning it had evidently dawned on him that fergus might be a decoy trying to lead them into ambush but fergus too was shouting and evidently the soldiers knew enough gutter french to interpret what he was saying for while several of the men halted at their leaders shout four of the soldiers hurled themselves at the dancing boy there was a scuffle and more shouting as fergus dodged twisting like an eel between the soldiers in all the commotion and above the whining wind jamie could not have heard the rush of the saber being drawn from its scabbard but ever after felt as though he had as though the faint swish and ring of drawn metal had been the first inkling of disaster it seemed to ring in his ears whenever he remembered the sceneand he remembered it for a very long time perhaps it was something in the attitudes of the soldiers an irritableness of mood that communicated itself to him in the cave perhaps only the sense of doom that had clung to him since culloden as though everything in his vicinity were tainted at risk by virtue only of being near him whether he had heard the sound of the saber or not his body had tensed itself to spring before he saw the silver arc of the blade swing through the air it moved almost lazily slowly enough for his brain to have tracked its arc deduced its target and shouted wordless no surely it moved slowly enough that he could have darted down into the midst of the swarming men seized the wrist that wielded the sword and twisted the deadly length of metal free to tumble harmless to the ground the conscious part of his brain told him this was nonsense even as it froze his hands around the granite knob anchoring him against the overwhelming impulse to heave himself out of the earth and run forward you cant it said to him a thready whisper under the fury and the horror that filled him he has done this for you you cannot make it senseless you cant it said cold as death beneath the searing rush of futility that drowned him you can do nothing and he did nothing nothing but watch as the blade completed its lazy swing crashed home with a small almost inconsequential thunk and the disputed cask tumbled end over end over end down the slope of the burn its final splash lost in the merry gurgle of brown water far below the shouting ceased abruptly in shocked silence he scarcely heard when it resumed it sounded so much like the roaring in his ears his knees gave way and he realized dimly that he was about to faint his vision darkened into reddish black shot with stars and streaks of lightbut not even the encroaching dark would blot out the final sight of ferguss hand that small and deft and clever pickpockets hand lying still in the mud of the track palm turned upward in supplication he waited for fortyeight long dragging hours before rabbie macnab came to whistle on the path below the cave how is he he said without preliminary mrs jenny says hell be all right rabbie answered his young face was pale and drawn plainly he had not yet recovered from the shock of his friends accident she says hes not fevered and theres no trace of rot yet in thehe swallowed audiblyin thestump the soldiers took him down to the house then not waiting for an answer he was already making his way down the hillside aye they were all amoil wi iti thinkrabbie paused to distentangle his shirt from a clinging brier and had to hurry to catch up with his employeri think they were sorry about it the captain said so at least and he gave mrs jenny a gold sovereignfor fergus oh aye jamie said verra generous and did not speak again until they reached the house fergus was lying in state in the nursery ensconced in a bed by the window his eyes were closed when jamie entered the room long lashes lying softly against thin cheeks seen without its customary animation his usual array of grimaces and poses his face looked quite different the slightly beaked nose above the long mobile mouth gave him a faintly aristocratic air and the bones hardening beneath the skin gave some promise that his face might one day pass from boyish charm to outright handsomeness jamie moved toward the bed and the dark lashes lifted at once milord fergus said and a weak smile restored his face at once to its familiar contours you are safe here god laddie im sorry jamie sank to his knees by the bed he could scarcely bear to look at the slender forearm that lay across the quilt its frail bandaged wrist ending in nothing but forced himself to grip ferguss shoulder in greeting and rub a palm gently over the shock of dark hair does it hurt much he asked no milord fergus said then a sudden belying twinge of pain crossed his features and he grinned shamefacedly well not so much and madame has been most generous with the whisky there was a tumbler full of it on the sidetable but no more than a thimbleful had been drunk fergus weaned on french wine did not really like the taste of whisky im sorry jamie said again there was nothing else to say nothing he could say for the tightening in his throat he looked hastily down knowing that it would upset fergus to see him weep ah milord do not trouble yourself there was a note of the old mischief in ferguss voice me i have been fortunate jamie swallowed hard before replying aye youre aliveand thank god for it oh beyond that milord he glanced up to see fergus smiling though still very pale do you not recall our agreement milord agreement yes when you took me into your service in paris you told me then that should i be arrested and executed you would have masses said for my soul for the space of a year the remaining hand fluttered toward the battered greenish medal that hung about his neckst dismas patron saint of thieves but if i should lose an ear or a hand while doing your service i would support you for the rest of your life jamie was unsure whether to laugh or cry and contented himself with patting the hand that now lay quiet on the quilt aye i remember you may trust me to keep the bargain oh i have always trusted you milord fergus assured him clearly he was growing tired the pale cheeks were even whiter than they had been and the shock of black hair fell back against the pillow so i am fortunate he murmured still smiling for in one stroke i am become a gentleman of leisure non jenny was waiting for him when he left ferguss room come down to the priest hole wi me he said taking her by the elbow i need to talk wi ye a bit and i shouldna stay in the open longer she followed him without comment down to the stonefloored back hall that separated kitchen and pantry set into the flags of the floor was a large wooden panel perforated with drilled holes apparently mortared into the floorstones theoretically this gave air to the root cellar below and in factshould any suspicious person choose to investigate the root cellar reached by a sunken door outside the house did have just such a panel set into its ceiling what was not apparent was that the panel also gave light and air to a small priest hole that had been built just behind the root cellar which could be reached by pulling up the panel mortared frame and all to reveal a short ladder leading down into the tiny room it was no more than five feet square equipped with nothing in the way of furniture beyond a rude bench a blanket and a chamber pot a large jug of water and a small box of hard biscuit completed the chambers accoutrements it had in fact been added to the house only within the last few years and therefore was not really a priest hole as no priest had occupied it or was likely to a hole it definitely was though two people could occupy the hole only by sitting side by side on the bench and jamie sat down beside his sister as soon as he had replaced the panel overhead and descended the ladder he sat still for a moment then took a breath and started i canna bear it anymore he said he spoke so softly that jenny was forced to bend her head close to hear him like a priest receiving some penitents confession i cant i must go they sat so close together that he could feel the rise and fall of her breast as she breathed then she reached out and took hold of his hand her small firm fingers tight on his will ye try france again then he had tried to escape to france twice before thwarted each time by the tight watch the english placed on all ports no disguise was sufficient for a man of his remarkable height and coloring he shook his head no i shall let myself be captured jamie in her agitation jenny allowed her voice to rise momentarily then lowered it again in response to the warning squeeze of his hand jamie ye canna do that she said lower christ man yell be hangit he kept his head bent as though in thought but shook it not hesitating i think not he glanced at his sister then quickly away claireshe had the sight as good an explanation as any he thought if not quite the real truth she saw what would happen at cullodenshe knew and she told me what would come after ah said jenny softly i wondered so that was why she bade me plant potatoesand build this place aye he gave his sisters hand a small squeeze then let go and turned slightly on the narrow seat to face her she told me that the crown would go on hunting jacobite traitors for some timeand they have he added wryly but that after the first few years they would no longer execute the men that were capturedonly imprison them only his sister echoed if ye mun go jamie take to the heather then but to give yourself up to an english prison whether theyll hang ye or no wait his hand on her arm stopped her i havena told it all to ye yet i dinna mean just to walk up to the english and surrender theres a goodly price on my head no be a shame to let that go to waste dye not think he tried to force a smile in his voice she heard it and glanced sharply up at him holy mother she whispered so ye mean to have someone betray ye seemingly aye he had decided upon the plan alone in the cave but it had not seemed quite real until now i thought perhaps joe fraser would be best for it jenny rubbed her fist hard against her lips she was quick he knew she had grasped the plan at onceand all its implications but jamie she whispered even if they dinna hang ye outrightand thats the hell of a risk to takejamie ye could be killed when they take ye his shoulders slumped suddenly under the weight of misery and exhaustion god jenny he said dye think i care there was a long silence before she answered no i dont she said and i canna say as i blame ye either she paused a moment to steady her voice but i still care her fingers gently touched the back of his head stroking his hair so yell mind yourself wont ye clotheid the ventilation panel overhead darkened momentarily and there was the tapping sound of light footsteps one of the kitchenmaids on her way to the pantry perhaps then the dim light came back and he could see jennys face once more aye he whispered at last ill mind it took more than two months to complete the arrangements when at last word came it was full spring he sat on his favorite rock near the caves entrance watching the evening stars come out even in the worst of the year after culloden he had always been able to find a moment of peace at this time of the day as the daylight faded it was as though objects became faintly lit from within so they stood outlined against sky or ground perfect and sharp in every detail he could see the shape of a moth invisible in the light now limned in the dusk with a triangle of deeper shadow that made it stand out from the trunk it hid upon in a moment it would take wing he looked out across the valley trying to stretch his eyes as far as the black pines that edged the distant cliffside then up among the stars orion there striding stately over the horizon and the pleiades barely visible in the darkening sky it might be his last sight of the sky for some time and he meant to enjoy it he thought of prison of bars and locks and solid walls and remembered fort william wentworth prison the bastille walls of stone four feet thick that blocked all air and light filth stench hunger entombment he shrugged such thoughts away he had chosen his way and was satisfied with it still he searched the sky looking for taurus not the prettiest of constellations but his own born under the sign of the bull stubborn and strong strong enough he hoped to do what he intended among the growing night sounds there was a sharp high whistle it might have been the homing song of a curlew on the loch but he recognized the signal someone was coming up the patha friend it was mary macnab who had become kitchenmaid at lallybroch after the death of her husband usually it was her son rabbie or fergus who brought him food and news but she had come a few times before she had brought a basket unusually wellsupplied with a cold roast partridge fresh bread several young green onions a bunch of early cherries and a flask of ale jamie examined the bounty then looked up with a wry smile my farewell feast eh she nodded silent she was a small woman dark hair heavily streaked with gray and her face lined by the difficulties of life still her eyes were soft and brown and her lips still full and gently curved he realized that he was staring at her mouth and hastily turned again to the basket lord ill be so full ill not be able to move even a cake now however did ye ladies manage that she shruggedshe wasnt a great chatterer mary macnaband taking the basket from him proceeded to lay the meal on the wooden tabletop balanced on stones she laid places for both of them this was nothing out of the ordinary she had supped with him before to give him the gossip of the district while they ate still if this was his last meal before leaving lallybroch he was surprised that neither his sister nor the boys had come to share it perhaps the farmhouse had visitors that would make it difficult for them to leave undetected he gestured politely for her to sit first before taking his own place crosslegged on the hard dirt floor yeve spoken wi joe fraser where is it to be then he asked taking a bite of cold partridge she told him the details of the plan a horse would be brought before dawn and he would ride out of the narrow valley by way of the pass then turn cross the rocky foothills and come down back into the valley by feesyhants burn as though he were coming home the english would meet him somewhere between struy and eskadale most likely at midmains it was a good place for an ambush for the glen rose steeply there on both sides but with a wooded patch by the stream where several men could conceal themselves after the meal she packed the basket tidily leaving out enough food for a small breakfast before his dawn leaving he expected her to go then but she did not she rummaged in the crevice where he kept his bedding spread it neatly upon the floor turned back the blankets and knelt beside the pallet hands folded on her lap he leaned back against the wall of the cave arms folded he looked down at the crown of her bowed head in exasperation oh like that is it he demanded and whose idea was this yours or my sisters does it matter she was composed her hands perfectly still on her lap her dark hair smooth in its snood he shook his head and bent down to pull her to her feet no it doesna matter because its no going to happen i appreciate your meaning but his speech was interrupted by her kiss her lips were as soft as they looked he grasped her firmly by both wrists and pushed her away from him no he said it isna necessary and i dinna want to do it he was uncomfortably aware that his body did not agree at all with his assessments of necessity and still more uncomfortable at the knowledge that his breeches too small and worn thin made the magnitude of the disagreement obvious to anyone who cared to look the slight smile curving those full sweet lips suggested that she was looking he turned her toward the entrance and gave her a light push to which she responded by stepping aside and reaching behind her for the fastenings to her skirt dont do that he exclaimed how dye mean to stop me she asked stepping out of the garment and folding it tidily over the single stool her slender fingers went to the laces of her bodice if ye wont leave then ill have to he replied with decision he whirled on his heel and headed for the cave entrance when he heard her voice behind him my lord she said he stopped but did not turn around it isna suitable to call me that he said lallybroch is yours she said and will be so long as ye live if yere its laird ill call ye so it isna mine the estate belongs to young jamie it isna young jamie thats doing what you are she answered with decision and it isna your sister thats asked me to do what im doin turn round he turned reluctantly she stood barefoot in her shift her hair loose over her shoulders she was thin as they all were these days but her breasts were larger than he had thought and the nipples showed prominently through the thin fabric the shift was as worn as her other garments frayed at the hem and shoulders almost transparent in spots he closed his eyes he felt a light touch on his arm and willed himself to stand still i ken weel enough what yere thinkin she said for i saw your lady and i know how it was between the two of ye i never had that she added in a softer voice not wi either of the two men i wed but i know the look of a true love and its not in my mind to make ye feel yeve betrayed it the touch featherlight moved to his cheek and a workworn thumb traced the groove that ran from nose to mouth what i want she said quietly is to give ye something different something less mayhap but something ye can use something to keep ye whole your sister and the bairns canna give ye thatbut i can he heard her draw breath and the touch on his face lifted away yeve given me my home my life and my son will ye no let me gie ye this small thing in return he felt tears sting his eyelids the weightless touch moved across his face wiping the moisture from his eyes smoothing the roughness of his hair he lifted his arms slowly and reached out she stepped inside his embrace as neatly and simply as she had laid the table and the bed ihavena done this in a long time he said suddenly shy neither have i she said with a tiny smile but well remember how tis part three when i am thy captive a faith in documents inverness may the envelope from linklater arrived in the morning post look how fat it is brianna exclaimed hes sent something the tip of her nose was pink with excitement looks like it said roger he was outwardly calm but i could see the pulse beating in the hollow of his throat he picked up the thick manila envelope and held it for a moment weighing it then he ripped the flap recklessly with his thumb and yanked out a sheaf of photocopied pages the cover letter on heavy university stationery fluttered out i snatched it from the floor and read it aloud my voice shaking a little dear dr wakefield i read this is in reply to your inquiry regarding the execution of jacobite officers by the duke of cumberlands troops following the battle of culloden the main source of the quote in my book to which you refer was the private journal of one lord melton in command of an infantry regiment under cumberland at the time of culloden i have enclosed photocopies of the relevant pages of the journal as you will see the story of the survivor one james fraser is an odd and touching one fraser is not an important historical character and not in line with the thrust of my own work but i have often thought of investigating further in hopes of determining his eventual fate should you find that he did survive the journey to his own estate i should be happy if you would inform me i have always rather hoped that he did though his situation as described by melton makes the possibility seem unlikely sincerely yours eric linklater the paper rattled in my hand and i set it down very carefully on the desk unlikely huh brianna said standing on tiptoe to see over rogers shoulder ha he did make it back we know he did we think he did roger corrected but it was only scholarly caution his grin was as broad as briannas will ye be havin tea or cocoa to your elevenses fionas curly dark head poked through the study doorway interrupting the excitement theres fresh gingernut biscuits just baked the scent of warm ginger came into the study with her wafting enticingly from her apron tea please said roger just as brianna said oh cocoa sounds great fiona wearing a smug expression pushed in the tea cart sporting both tea cozy and pot of cocoa as well as a plate of fresh gingernut biscuits i accepted a cup of tea myself and sat down in the wing chair with the pages of meltons journal the flowing eighteenthcentury handwriting was surprisingly clear in spite of the archaic spelling and within minutes i was in the confines of leanach farmhouse imagining the sound of buzzing flies the stir of closepacked bodies and the harsh smell of blood soaking into the packeddirt floor in satisfaction of my brothers debt of honor i could not do otherwise than to spare frasers life i therefore omitted his name from the list of traitors executed at the farmhouse and have made arrangement for his transport to his own estate i cannot feel myself either altogether merciful toward fraser in the taking of this action nor yet altogether culpable with respect to my service toward the duke as frasers situation with a great wound in his leg festering and pustulent makes it unlikely that he will survive the journey to his home still honor prevents my acting otherwise and i will confess that my spirit was lightened to see the man removed still living from the field as i turned my own attentions to the melancholy task of disposing of the bodies of his comrades so much killing as i have seen these last two days oppresses me the entry ended simply i laid the pages down on my knee swallowing heavily a great woundfestering and pustulent i knew as roger and brianna could not just how serious such a wound would have been with no antibiotics nothing in the way of proper medical treatment not even the crude herbal poultices available to a highland charmer at the time how long would it have taken jolting from culloden to broch tuarach in a wagon two days three how could he have lived in such a state and neglected for so long he did though briannas voice broke in upon my thoughts answering what seemed to be a similar thought expressed by roger she spoke with simple assurance as though she had seen all the events described in meltons journal and were sure of their outcome he did get back he was the dunbonnet i know it the dunbonnet fiona tuttutting over my cold cup of undrunk tea looked over her shoulder in surprise heard of the dunbonnet have ye have you roger looked at the young housekeeper in astonishment she nodded casually dumping my tea into the aspidistra that stood by the hearth and refilling my cup with fresh steaming brew oh aye my grannie tellt me that tale often and often tell us brianna leaned forward intent her cocoa cupped between her palms please fiona whats the story fiona seemed mildly surprised to find herself suddenly the center of so much attention but shrugged goodnaturedly och its just the story of one o the followers o the bonnie prince when there was the great defeat at culloden and sae many were killed a few escaped why one man fled the field and swam the river to get away but the redcoats were after him nonetheless he came to a kirk along his way and a service going on inside and he dashing in prayed mercy from the minister the minister and the people took pity on him and he put on the ministers robe so when the redcoats burst in moments later there he was standing at the pulpit preachin the sermon and the water from his beard and clothes puddled up about his feet the redcoats thought they were mistaken and went on down the road and so he escapedand everyone in the kirk said twas the best sermon they ever heard fiona laughed heartily while brianna frowned and roger looked puzzled that was the dunbonnet he said but i thought och no she assured him that was no the dunbonnetonly the dunbonnet was another o the men who got away from culloden he came back to his own estate but because the sassenachs were hunting men all across the highlands he lay hidden there in a cave for seven years hearing this brianna slumped back in her chair with a sigh of relief and his tenants called him the dunbonnet so as not to speak his name and betray him she murmured ye ken the story fiona asked astonished aye thats right and did your grannie say what happened to him after that roger prompted oh aye fionas eyes were round as butterscotch drops thats the best part o the story see there was a great famine after culloden folk were starvin in the glens turned out of their houses in winter the men shot and the cots set afire the dunbonnets tenants managed better than most but even so there came a day when the food ran out and their bellies garbeled from dawn til darkno game in the forest nay grain in the field and the weans dyin in their mothers arms for lack o milk to feed them a cold chill swept over me at her words i saw the faces of the lallybroch inhabitantsthe people i had known and lovedpinched with cold and starvation not only horror filled me there was guilt too i had been safe warm and wellfed instead of sharing their fatebecause i had done as jamie wanted and left them i looked at brianna smooth red head bent in absorption and the tight feeling in my chest eased a bit she too had been safe for these past years warm wellfed and lovedbecause i had done as jamie wanted so he made a bold plan the dunbonnet did fiona was continuing her round face was alight with the drama of her tale he arranged that one of his tenants should go to the english and offer to betray him there was a good price on his head for hed been a great warrior for the prince the tenant would take the gold o the rewardto use for the folk on the estate o courseand tell the english where the dunbonnet might be taken my hand clenched so convulsively at this that the delicate handle of my teacup snapped clean off taken i croaked my voice hoarse with shock did they hang him fiona blinked at me in surprise why no she said they wanted to my grannie said and took him to trial for treason but in the end they shut him up in a prison insteadbut the gold went to his tenants and so they lived through the famine she ended cheerfully obviously regarding this as the happy ending jesus christ roger breathed he set his cup down carefully and sat staring into space transfixed prison you sound like thats good brianna protested the corners of her mouth were tight with distress and her eyes slightly shiny it is roger said not noticing her distress there werent that many prisons where the english imprisoned jacobite traitors and they all kept official records dont you see he demanded looking from fionas bewilderment to briannas scowl then settling on me in hope of finding understanding if he went to prison i can find him he turned then to look up at the towering shelves of books that lined three walls of the study holding the late reverend wakefields collection of jacobite arcana hes in there roger said softly on a prison roll in a documentreal evidence dont you see he demanded again turning back to me going to prison made him a part of written history again and somewhere in there well find him and what happened to him then brianna breathed when he was released rogers lips pressed tight together to cut off the alternative that sprang to his mind as it had to mineor died yes thats right he said taking briannas hand his eyes met mine deep green and unfathomable when he was released a week later rogers faith in documents remained unshaken the same could not be said for the eighteenthcentury table in the late reverend wakefields study whose spindly legs wobbled and creaked alarmingly beneath their unaccustomed burden this table normally was asked to accommodate no more than a small lamp and a collection of the reverends smaller artifacts it was pressed into service now only because every other horizontal surface in the study already overflowed with papers journals books and bulging manila envelopes from antiquarian societies universities and research libraries across england scotland and ireland if you set one more page on that thing its going to collapse claire observed as roger carelessly reached out meaning to drop the folder he was carrying on the little inlaid table ah oh right he switched direction in midair looked vainly for another place to put the folder and finally settled for placing it on the floor at his feet ive just about finished with wentworth claire said she indicated a precarious stack on the floor with her toe have we got in the records for berwick yet yes just this morning where did i put them though roger stared vaguely about the room which strongly resembled the sacking of the library at alexandria just before the first torch was lit he rubbed his forehead trying to concentrate after a week of spending tenhour days thumbing the handwritten registers of british prisons and the letters journals and diaries of their governors searching for any official trace of jamie fraser roger was beginning to feel as though his eyes had been sandpapered it was blue he said at last i distinctly remember it was blue i got those from mcallister the history lecturer at trinity at cambridge and trinity college uses those big envelopes in pale blue with the colleges coat of arms on the front maybe fionas seen it fiona he stepped to the study door and called down the hall toward the kitchen despite the lateness of the hour the light was still on and the heartening scent of cocoa and freshly baked almond cake lingered in the air fiona would never abandon her post while there was the faintest possibility that someone in her vicinity might require nourishment och aye fionas curly brown head poked out of the kitchen therell be cocoa ready directly she assured him im only waiting for the cake to be out of the oven roger smiled at her with deep affection fiona had not the slightest use herself for historynever read anything beyond my weekly magazinebut she never questioned his activities tranquilly dusting the heaps of books and papers daily without bothering about their contents thanks fiona he said i was only wondering though have you seen a big blue envelopea fat one about so he measured with his hands it came in the morning post but ive misplaced it ye left it in the upstairs bath she said promptly theres that great thick book wi the gold writing and the picture of the bonnie prince on the front up there and three letters yed just opened and theres the gas bill too which ye dinna want to be forgetting its due on the fourteenth o the month ive put it all on the top of the geyser so as to be out of the way a tiny sharp ding from the oven timer made her withdraw her head abruptly with a smothered exclamation roger turned and went up the stairs two at a time smiling given other inclinations fionas memory might have made her a scholar as it was she was no mean research assistant so long as a particular document or book could be described on the basis of its appearance rather than its title or contents fiona was bound to know exactly where it was och its nothing she had assured roger airily when he had tried to apologize earlier for the mess he was making of the house yed think the reverend was still alive wi such a moil of papers strewn everywhere its just like old times no coming down more slowly with the blue envelope in his hands he wondered what his late adoptive father might have thought of this present quest in it up to the eyebrows i shouldnt wonder he murmured to himself he had a vivid memory of the reverend bald head gleaming under the oldfashioned bowl lamps that hung from the hall ceiling as he pottered from his study to the kitchen where old mrs graham fionas grandmother would have been manning the stove supplying the old mans bodily needs during bouts of latenight scholarship just as fiona was now doing for him it made one wonder he thought as he went into the study in the old days when a mans son usually followed his fathers profession was that only a matter of conveniencewanting to keep the business in the familyor was there some sort of family predisposition for some kinds of work were some people actually born to be smiths or merchants or cooksborn to an inclination and an aptitude as well as to the opportunity clearly it didnt apply to everyone there were always the people who left their homes went awandering tried things hitherto unknown in their family circles if that werent so probably there would be no inventors no explorers still there seemed to be a certain affinity for some careers in some families even in these restless modern times of widespread education and easy travel what he was really wondering about he thought to himself was brianna he watched claire her curly goldshot head bent over the desk and found himself wondering how much brianna would be like her and how much like the shadowy scotwarrior farmer courtier lairdwho had been her father his thoughts were still running on such lines a quarterhour later when claire closed the last folder on her stack and sat back sighing penny for your thoughts she asked reaching for her drink not worth that much roger replied with a smile coming out of his reverie i was only wondering how people come to be what they are how did you come to be a doctor for instance how did i come to be a doctor claire inhaled the steam from her cup of cocoa decided it was too hot to drink and set it back on the desk among the litter of books and journals and pencilscribbled sheets of paper she gave roger a halfsmile and rubbed her hands together dispersing the warmth of the cup how did you come to be a historian more or less honestly he answered leaning back in the reverends chair and waving at the accumulation of papers and trivia all around them he patted a small gilt traveling clock that sat on the desk an elegant bit of eighteenthcentury workmanship with miniature chimes that struck the hour the quarter and the half i grew up in the midst of it all i was ferreting round the highlands in search of artifacts with my father from the time i could read i suppose it just seemed natural to keep doing it but you she nodded and stretched easing her shoulders from the long hours of stooping over the desk brianna unable to stay awake had given up and gone to bed an hour before but claire and roger had gone on with their search through the administrative records of british prisons well it was something like that for me she said it wasnt so much that i suddenly decided i must become a doctorit was just that i suddenly realized one day that id been one for a long timeand then i wasnt and i missed it she spread her hands out on the desk and flexed her fingers long and supple the nails buffed into neat shiny ovals there used to be an old song from the first world war she said reflectively i used to hear it sometimes when some of uncle lambs old army friends would come round and stay up late and get drunk it went how you gonna keep em down on the farm after theyve seen paree she sang the first line then broke off with a wry smile id seen paree she said softly she looked up from her hands alert and present but with the traces of memory in her eyes fixed on roger with the clarity of a second sight and a lot of other things besides caen and amiens preston and falkirk the hôpital des anges and the socalled surgery at leoch id been a doctor in every way there isid delivered babies set bones stitched wounds treated fevers she trailed off and shrugged there was a terrible lot i didnt know of course i knew how much i could learnand thats why i went to medical school but it didnt really make a difference you know she dipped a finger into the whipped cream floating on her cocoa and licked it off i have a diploma with an md on itbut i was a doctor long before i set foot in medical school it cant possibly have been as easy as you make it sound roger blew on his own cocoa studying claire with open interest there werent many women in medicine thenthere arent that many women doctors now come to thatand you had a family besides no i cant say it was easy at all claire looked at him quizzically i waited until brianna was in school of course and we had enough money to afford someone to come in to cook and cleanbut she shrugged and smiled ironically i stopped sleeping for several years there that helped a bit and oddly enough frank helped too roger tested his own cup and found it almost cool enough to drink he held it between his hands enjoying the heat of the thick white porcelain seeping into his palms early june it might be but the nights were cool enough to make the electric fire still a necessity really he said curiously only from the things youve said about him i shouldnt have thought hed have liked your wanting to go to medical school or be a doctor he didnt her lips pressed tight together the motion told roger more than words might recalling arguments conversations halffinished and abandoned an opposition of stubbornness and devious obstruction rather than of open disapproval what a remarkably expressive face she had he thought watching her he wondered quite suddenly whether his own were as easily readable the thought was so unsettling that he dipped his face into his mug gulping the cocoa although it was still a bit too hot he emerged from the cup to find claire watching him slightly sardonic why he asked quickly to distract her what made him change his mind bree she said and her face softened as it always did at the mention of her daughter bree was the only thing really important to frank i had as id said waited until brianna began school before beginning medical school myself but even so there was a large gap between her hours and my own which we filled haphazardly with a series of more or less competent housekeepers and babysitters some more most of them less my mind went back to the frightful day when i had gotten a call at the hospital telling me that brianna was hurt i had dashed out of the place not pausing to change out of the green linen scrubsuit i was wearing and raced for home ignoring all speed limits to find a police car and an ambulance lighting the night with bloodred pulses and a knot of interested neighbors clustered on the street outside as we pieced the story together later what had happened was that the latest temporary sitter annoyed at my being late yet again had simply put on her coat at quitting time and left abandoning sevenyearold brianna with instructions to wait for mommy this she had obediently done for an hour or so but as it began to get dark she had become frightened in the house alone and determined to go out and find me making her way across one of the busy streets near our house she had been struck by a car turning into the street she wasntthank godhurt badly the car had been moving slowly and she had only been shaken and bruised by the experience not nearly as shaken as i was for that matter nor as bruised when i came into the living room to find her lying on the sofa and she looked at me tears welling afresh on her stained cheeks and said mommy where were you i couldnt find you it had taken just about all my reserves of professional composure to comfort her to check her over retend her cuts and scrapes thank her rescuerswho to my fevered mind all glared accusingly at meand put her to bed with her teddy bear clutched securely in her arms then i sat down at the kitchen table and cried myself frank patted me awkwardly murmuring but then gave it up and with more practicality went to make tea ive decided i said when he set the steaming cup in front of me i spoke dully my head feeling thick and clogged ill resign ill do it tomorrow resign franks voice was sharp with astonishment from the school what for i cant stand it anymore i never took cream or sugar in my tea now i added both stirring and watching the milky tendrils swirl through the cup i cant stand leaving bree and not knowing if shes well cared forand knowing she isnt happy you know she doesnt really like any of the sitters weve tried i know that yes he sat opposite me stirring his own tea after a long moment he said but i dont think you should resign it was the last thing i had expected i had thought he would greet my decision with relieved applause i stared at him in astonishment then blew my nose yet again on the wadded tissue from my pocket you dont ah claire he spoke impatiently but with a tinge of affection nonetheless youve known forever who you are do you realize at all how unusual it is to know that no i wiped my nose with the shredding tissue dabbing carefully to keep it in one piece frank leaned back in his chair shaking his head as he looked at me no i suppose not he said he was quiet for a minute looking down at his folded hands they were longfingered narrow smooth and hairless as a girls elegant hands made for casual gestures and the emphasis of speech he stretched them out on the table and looked at them as though hed never seen them before i havent got that he said quietly at last im good all right at what i dothe teaching the writing bloody splendid sometimes in fact and i like it a good bit enjoy what i do but the thing is he hesitated then looked at me straight on hazeleyed and earnest i could do something else and be as good care as much or as little i havent got that absolute conviction that theres something in life im meant to doand you have is that good the edges of my nostrils were sore and my eyes puffed from crying he laughed shortly its damned inconvenient claire to you and me and bree all three but my god i do envy you sometimes he reached out for my hand and after a moments hesitation i let him have it to have that passion for anythinga small twitch tugged the corner of his mouthor anyone thats quite splendid claire and quite terribly rare he squeezed my hand gently and let it go turning to reach behind him for one of the books on the shelf beside the table it was one of his references woodhills patriots a series of profiles of the american founding fathers he laid his hand on the cover of the book gently as though reluctant to disturb the rest of the sleeping lives interred there these were people like that the ones who cared so terribly muchenough to risk everything enough to change and do things most people arent like that you know it isnt that they dont care but that they dont care so greatly he took my hand again this time turning it over one finger traced the lines that webbed my palm tickling as it went is it there i wonder he said smiling a little are some people destined for a great fate or to do great things or is it only that theyre born somehow with that great passionand if they find themselves in the right circumstances then things happen its the sort of thing you wonder studying historybut theres no way of telling really all we know is what they accomplished but claire his eyes held a definite note of warning as he tapped the cover of his book they paid for it he said i know i felt very remote now as though i were watching us from a distance i could see it quite clearly in my minds eye frank handsome lean and a little tired going beautifully gray at the temples me grubby in my surgical scrubs my hair coming down the front of my shirt crumpled and stained with briannas tears we sat in silence for some time my hand still resting in franks i could see the mysterious lines and valleys clear as a road mapbut a road to what unknown destination i had had my palm read once years before by an old scottish lady named grahamfionas grandmother in fact the lines in your hand change as you change she had said its no so much what youre born with as what ye make of yourself and what had i made of myself what was i making a mess that was what neither a good mother nor a good wife nor a good doctor a mess once i had thought i was wholehad seemed to be able to love a man to bear a child to heal the sickand know that all these things were natural parts of me not the difficult troubled fragments into which my life had now disintegrated but that had been in the past the man i had loved was jamie and for a time i had been part of something greater than myself ill take bree i was so deep in miserable thought that for a moment franks words didnt register and i stared at him stupidly what did you say i said he repeated patiently that ill take bree she can come from her school to the university and play at my office until im ready to come home i rubbed my nose i thought you didnt think it appropriate for staff to bring their children to work he had been quite critical of mrs clancy one of the secretaries who had brought her grandson to work for a month when his mother was sick he shrugged looking uncomfortable well circumstances alter cases and briannas not likely to be running up and down the halls shrieking and spilling ink like bart clancy i wouldnt bet my life on it i said wryly but youd do that a small feeling was growing in the pit of my clenched stomach a cautious unbelieving feeling of relief i might not trust frank to be faithful to mei knew quite well he wasntbut i did trust him unequivocally to care for bree suddenly the worry was removed i neednt hurry home from the hospital filled with dread because i was late hating the thought of finding brianna crouched in her room sulking because she didnt like the current sitter she loved frank i knew she would be ecstatic at the thought of going to his office every day why i asked bluntly it isnt that youre dead keen on my being a doctor i know that no he said thoughtfully it isnt that but i do think there isnt any way to stop youperhaps the best i can do is to help so that there will be less damage to brianna his features hardened slightly then and he turned away so far as he ever felt he had a destinysomething he was really meant to dohe felt that brianna was it claire said she stirred her cocoa meditatively why do you care roger she asked him suddenly why are you asking me he took a moment to answer slowly sipping his cocoa it was rich and dark made with new cream and a sprinkle of brown sugar fiona always a realist had taken one look at brianna and given up her attempts to lure roger into matrimony via his stomach but fiona was a cook the same way claire was a doctor born to skill and unable not to use it because im a historian i suppose he answered finally he watched her over the rim of his cup i need to know what people really did and why they did it and you think i can tell you that she glanced sharply at him or that i know he nodded sipping you know better than most people most of a historians sources havent yourhe paused and gave her a grinyour unique perspective shall we say there was a sudden lessening of tension she laughed and picked up her own cup we shall say that she agreed the other thing he went on watching her closely is that youre honest i dont think you could lie even if you wanted to she glanced at him sharply and gave a short dry laugh everyone can lie young roger given cause enough even me its only that its harder for those of us who live in glass faces we have to think up our lies ahead of time she bent her head and shuffled through the papers before her turning the pages over slowly one by one they were lists of names these sheets lists of prisoners copied from the ledger books of british prisons the task was complicated by the fact that not all prisons had been wellrun some governors kept no official lists of their inmates or listed them haphazardly in their journals in among the notations of daily expenditure and maintenance making no great distinction between the death of a prisoner and the slaughter of two bullocks salted for meat roger thought claire had abandoned the conversation but a moment later she looked up again youre quite right though she said im honestfrom default more than anything it isnt easy for me not to say what im thinking i imagine you see it because youre the same way am i roger felt absurdly pleased as though someone had given him an unexpected present claire nodded a small smile on her lips as she watched him oh yes its unmistakable you know there arent many people like thatwho will tell you the truth about themselves and anything else right out ive only met three people like that i thinkfour now she said her smile widening to warm him there was jamie of course her long fingers rested lightly on the stack of papers almost caressing in their touch master raymond the apothecary i knew in paris and a friend i met in medical schooljoe abernathy now you i think she tilted her cup and swallowed the last of the rich brown liquid she set it down and looked directly at roger frank was right in a way though it isnt necessarily easier if you know what it is youre meant to dobut at least you dont waste time in questioning or doubting if youre honestwell that isnt necessarily easier either though i suppose if youre honest with yourself and know what you are at least youre less likely to feel that youve wasted your life doing the wrong thing she set aside the stack of papers and drew up anothera set of folders with the characteristic logo of the british museum on the covers jamie had that she said softly as though to herself he wasnt a man to turn away from anything he thought his job dangerous or not and i think he wont have felt himself wastedno matter what happened to him she lapsed into silence then absorbed in the spidery tracings of some longdead writer looking for the entry that might tell her what jamie fraser had done and been and whether his life had been wasted in a prison cell or ended in a lonely dungeon the clock on the desk struck midnight its chimes surprisingly deep and melodious for such a small instrument the quarterhour struck and then the half punctuating the monotonous rustle of pages roger put down the sheaf of flimsy papers he had been thumbing through and yawned deeply not troubling to cover his mouth im so tired im seeing double he said shall we go on with it in the morning claire didnt answer for a moment she was looking into the glowing bars of the electric fire a look of unutterable distance on her face roger repeated his question and slowly she came back from wherever she was no she said she reached for another folder and smiled at roger the look of distance lingering in her eyes you go on roger she said illjust look a little longer when i finally found it i nearly flipped right past it i had not been reading the names carefully but only skimming the pages for the letter j john joseph jacques james there were james edward james alan james walter ad infinitum then it was there the writing small and precise across the page jms mackenzie fraser of brock turac i put the page down carefully on the table shut my eyes for a moment to clear them then looked again it was still there jamie i said aloud my heart was beating heavily in my chest jamie i said again more quietly it was nearly three oclock in the morning everyone was asleep but the house in the manner of old houses was still awake around me creaking and sighing keeping me company strangely enough i had no desire to leap up and wake brianna or roger to tell them the news i wanted to keep it to myself for a bit as though i were alone here in the lamplit room with jamie himself my finger traced the line of ink the person who had written that line had seen jamieperhaps had written this with jamie standing in front of him the date at the top of the page was may it had been close to this time of year then i could imagine how the air had been chilly and fresh with the rare spring sun across his shoulders lighting sparks in his hair how had he worn his hair thenshort or long he had preferred to wear it long plaited or tailed behind i remembered the casual gesture with which he would lift the weight of it off his neck to cool himself in the heat of exercise he would not have worn his kiltthe wearing of all tartans had been outlawed after culloden breeks then likely and a linen shirt i had made such sarks for him i could feel the softness of the fabric in memory the billowing length of the three full yards it took to make one the long tails and full sleeves that let the highland men drop their plaids and sleep or fight with a sark their only garment i could imagine his shoulders broad beneath the roughwoven cloth his skin warm through it hands touched with the chill of the scottish spring he had been imprisoned before how would he have looked facing an english prison clerk knowing all too well what waited for him grim as hell i thought staring down that long straight nose with his eyes a cold dark bluedark and forbidding as the waters of loch ness i opened my own eyes realizing only then that i was sitting on the edge of my chair the folder of photocopied pages clasped tight to my chest so caught up in my conjuration that i had not even paid attention to which prison these registers had come from there were several large prisons that the english had used regularly in the eighteenth century and a number of minor ones i turned the folder over slowly would it be berwick near the border the notorious tolbooth of edinburgh or one of the southern prisons leeds castle or even the tower of london ardsmuir said the notecard neatly stapled to the front of the folder ardsmuir i said blankly where the hell is that honors prisoner ardsmuir scotland february ardsmuir is the carbuncle on gods bum colonel harry quarry said he raised his glass sardonically to the young man by the window ive been here a twelvemonth and thats eleven months and twentynine days too long give you joy of your new posting my lord major john william grey turned from the window over the courtyard where he had been surveying his new domain it does appear a trifle incommodious he agreed dryly picking up his own glass does it rain all the time of course its scotlandand the backside of bloody scotland at that quarry took a deep pull at his whisky coughed and exhaled noisily as he set down the empty glass the drink is the only compensation he said a trifle hoarsely call on the local boozemerchants in your best uniform and theyll make you a decent price its astounding cheap without the tariff ive left you a note of the best stills he nodded toward the massive oaken desk at the side of the room planted foursquare on its island of carpet like a small fortress confronting the barren room the illusion of fortifications was enhanced by the banners of regiment and nation that hung from the stone wall behind it the guards roster is here quarry said rising and groping in the top desk drawer he slapped a battered leather folder on the desktop and added another on top of that and the prisoners roll you have one hundred and ninetysix at the moment two hundred is the usual count give or take a few deaths from sickness or the odd poacher taken up in the countryside two hundred grey said and how many in the guards barracks eightytwo by number in use about half that quarry reached into the drawer again and withdrew a brown glass bottle with a cork he shook it heard it slosh and smiled sardonically the commander isnt the only one to find consolation in drink half the sots are usually incapable at roll call ill leave this for you shall i youll need it he put the bottle back and pulled out the lower drawer requisitions and copies here the paperworks the worst of the post not a great deal to do really if youve a decent clerk you havent at the moment i had a corporal who wrote a fairish hand but he died two weeks ago train up another and youll have nothing to do save to hunt for grouse and the frenchmans gold he laughed at his own joke rumors of the gold that louis of france had supposedly sent to his cousin charles stuart were rife in this end of scotland the prisoners are not difficult grey asked i had understood them to be mostly jacobite highlanders they are but theyre docile enough quarry paused looking out of the window a small line of ragged men was issuing from a door in the forbidding stone wall opposite no heart in them after culloden he said matteroffactly butcher billy saw to that and we work them hard enough that theyve no vigor left for troublemaking grey nodded ardsmuir fortress was undergoing renovation rather ironically using the labor of the scots incarcerated therein he rose and came to join quarry at the window theres a work crew going out now for peatcutting quarry nodded at the group below a dozen bearded men ragged as scarecrows formed an awkward line before a redcoated soldier who walked up and down inspecting them evidently satisfied he shouted an order and jerked a hand toward the outer gate the prisoners crew was accompanied by six armed soldiers who fell in before and behind muskets held in marching order their smart appearance a marked contrast to the ragged highlanders the prisoners walked slowly oblivious to the rain that soaked their rags a muledrawn wagon creaked behind a bundle of peat knives gleaming dully in its bed quarry frowned counting them some must be ill a work crew is eighteen menthree prisoners to a guard because of the knives though surprisingly few of them try to run he added turning away from the window nowhere to go i suppose he left the desk kicking aside a large woven basket that sat on the hearth filled with crude chunks of a rough darkbrown substance leave the window open even when its raining he advised the peat smoke will choke you otherwise he took a deep breath in illustration and let it out explosively god ill be glad to get back to london not much in the way of local society i collect grey asked dryly quarry laughed his broad red face creasing in amusement at the notion society my dear fellow bar one or two passable blowzabellas down in the village society will consist solely of conversation with your officersthere are four of them one of whom is capable of speaking without the use of profanityyour orderly and one prisoner a prisoner grey looked up from the ledgers he had been perusing one fair brow lifted in inquiry oh yes quarry was prowling the office restlessly eager to be off his carriage was waiting he had stayed only to brief his replacement and make the formal handover of command now he paused glancing at grey one corner of his mouth curled up enjoying a secret joke youve heard of red jamie fraser i expect grey stiffened slightly but kept his face as unmoved as possible i should imagine most people have he said coldly the man was notorious during the rising quarry had heard the story damn him all of it or only the first part quarrys mouth twitched slightly but he merely nodded quite well we have him hes the only senior jacobite officer here the highlander prisoners treat him as their chief consequently if any matters arise involving the prisonersand they will i assure youhe acts as their spokesman quarry was in his stockinged feet now he sat and tugged on long cavalry boots in preparation for the mud outside seumas mac an fhear dhuibh they call him or just mac dubh speak gaelic do you neither do igrissom does though he says it means james son of the black one half the guards are afraid of himthose that fought with cope at prestonpans say hes the devil himself poor devil now quarry gave a brief snort forcing his foot into the boot he stamped once to settle it and stood up the prisoners obey him without question but give orders without his putting his seal to them and you might as well be talking to the stones in the courtyard ever had much to do with scots oh of course you fought at culloden with your brothers regiment didnt you quarry struck his brow at his pretended forgetfulness damn the man he had heard it all youll have an idea then stubborn does not begin to describe it he flapped a hand in the air as though to dismiss an entire contingent of recalcitrant scots which means quarry paused enjoying it youll need frasers goodwillor at least his cooperation i had him take supper with me once a week to talk things over and found it answered very well you might try the same arrangement i suppose i might greys tone was cool but his hands were clenched tight at his sides when icicles grew in hell he might take supper with james fraser hes an educated man quarry continued eyes bright with malice fixed on greys face a great deal more interesting to talk to than the officers plays chess you have a game now and then do you not now and then the muscles of his abdomen were clenched so tightly that he had trouble drawing breath would this bulletheaded fool not stop talking and leave ah well ill leave you to it as though divining greys wish quarry settled his wig more firmly then took his cloak from the hook by the door and swirled it rakishly about his shoulders he turned toward the door hat in hand then turned back oh one thing if you do dine with fraser alonedont turn your back on him the offensive jocularity had left quarrys face grey scowled at him but could see no evidence that the warning was meant as a joke i mean it quarry said suddenly serious hes in irons but its easy to choke a man with the chain and hes a very large fellow fraser i know to his fury grey could feel the blood rising in his cheeks to hide it he swung about letting the cold air from the halfopen window play on his countenance surely he said to the rainslick gray stones below if he is the intelligent man you say he would not be so foolish as to attack me in my own quarters in the midst of the prison what would be the purpose in it quarry didnt answer after a moment grey turned around to find the other staring at him thoughtfully all trace of humor gone from the broad ruddy face theres intelligence quarry said slowly and then there are other things but perhaps youre too young to have seen hate and despair at close range theres been a deal of it in scotland these last ten years he tilted his head surveying the new commander of ardsmuir from his vantage point of fifteen years seniority major grey was young no more than twentysix and with a faircomplexioned face and girlish lashes that made him look still younger than his years to compound the problem he was an inch or two shorter than the average and fineboned as well he drew himself up straight i am aware of such things colonel he said evenly quarry was a younger son of good family like himself but still his superior in rank he must keep his temper quarrys bright hazel gaze rested on him in speculation i daresay with a sudden motion he clapped his hat on his head he touched his cheek where the darker line of a scar sliced across the ruddy skin a memento of the scandalous duel that had sent him into exile at ardsmuir god knows what you did to be sent here grey he said shaking his head but for your own sake i hope you deserved it luck to you and with a swirl of blue cloak he was gone better the devil ye ken than the devil ye dont murdo lindsay said shaking his head lugubriously handsome harry was nain sae bad no he wasna then agreed kenny lesley but yell ha been here when he came no he was a deal better than that shiteface bogle aye aye said murdo looking blank whats your meaning man so if handsome was better than bogle lesley explained patiently then handsome was the devil we didna ken and bogle the one that we didbut handsome was better in spite of that so youre wrong man i am murdo hopelessly confused by this bit of reasoning glowered at lesley no im not ye are then lesley said losing patience yere always wrong murdo why dye argue when yere never in the right of it im no arguin murdo protested indignantly yere takin exception to me not tother way aboot only because youre wrong man lesley said if ye were right id have said not a word im not wrong at least i dinna think so murdo muttered unable to recall precisely what he had said he turned appealing to the large figure seated in the corner mac dubh was i wrong the tall man stretched himself the chain of his irons chiming faintly as he moved and laughed no murdo yere no wrong but we canna say if yere right yet awhile not til we see what the new devils like aye seeing lesleys brows draw down in preparation for further dispute he raised his voice speaking to the room at large has anyone seen the new governor yet johnson mactavish i have hayes said pushing gladly forward to warm his hands at the fire there was only one hearth in the large cell and room for no more than six men before it at a time the other forty were left in bitter chill huddling together in small groups for warmth consequently the agreement was that whoever had a tale to tell or a song to sing might have a place by the hearth for as long as he spoke mac dubh had said this was a bardright that when the bards came to the auld castles they would be given a warm place and plenty to eat and drink to the honor of the lairds hospitality there was never food or drink to spare here but the warm place was certain hayes relaxed eyes closed and a beatific smile on his face as he spread his hands to the warmth warned by restive movement to either side though he hastily opened his eyes and began to speak i saw him when he came in from his carriage and then again when i brought up a platter o sweeties from the kitchens whilst he and handsome harry were nattering to ain another hayes frowned in concentration hes fairhaired wi long yellow locks tied up wi blue ribbon and big eyes and long lashes too like a lassies hayes leered at his listeners batting his own stubby lashes in mock flirtation encouraged by the laughter he went on to describe the new governors clothesfine as a lairdshis equipage and servantone of they sassenachs as talks like hes burnt his tongueand as much as had been overheard of the new mans speech he talks sharp and quick like hell know whats what hayes said shaking his head dubiously but hes verra young forbyehe looks scarce more than a wean though id reckon hes older than his looks aye hes a bittie fellow smaller than wee angus baird chimed in with a jerk of the head at angus mackenzie who looked down at himself in startlement angus had been twelve when he fought beside his father at culloden he had spent nearly half his life in ardsmuir and in consequence of the poor fare of prison had never grown much bigger aye hayes agreed but he carries himself well shoulders square and a ramrod up his arse this gave rise to a burst of laughter and ribald comment and hayes gave way to ogilvie who knew a long and scurrilous story about the laird of donibristle and the hogmans daughter hayes left the hearth without resentment and wentas was the customto sit beside mac dubh mac dubh never took his place on the hearth even when he told them the long stories from the books that hed readthe adventures of roderick random the history of tom jones a foundling or everyones favorite robinson crusoe claiming that he needed the room to accommodate his long legs mac dubh sat always in his same spot in the corner where everyone might hear him but the men who left the fire would come one by one and sit down on the bench beside him to give him the warmth that lingered in their clothes shall ye speak to the new governor tomorrow dye think mac dubh hayes asked as he sat i met billy malcolm coming in from the peatcutting and he shouted to me as the rats were grown uncommon bold in their cell just now six men bitten this sennight as they slept and two of them festering mac dubh shook his head and scratched at his chin he had been allowed a razor before his weekly audiences with harry quarry but it had been five days since the last of these and his chin was thick with red stubble i canna say gavin he said quarry did say as hed tell the new fellow of our arrangement but the new man might have his own ways aye if im called to see him though i shall be sure to say about the rats did malcolm ask for morrison to come and see to the festering though the prison had no doctor morrison who had a touch for healing was permitted by the guards to go from cell to cell to tend the sick or injured at mac dubhs request hayes shook his head he hadna time to say morethey were marching past aye best i send morrison mac dubh decided he can ask billy is there aught else amiss there there were four main cells where the prisoners were kept in large groups word passed among them by means of morrisons visits and the mingling of men on the work crews that went out daily to haul stone or cut peats on the nearby moor morrison came at once when summoned pocketing four of the carved rats skulls with which the prisoners improvised games of draughts mac dubh groped under the bench where he sat drawing out the cloth bag he carried when he went to the moor och not more o the damn thistles morrison protested seeing mac dubhs grimace as he groped in the bag i canna make them eat those things they all say do i think them kine or maybe pigs mac dubh gingerly set down a fistful of wilted stalks and sucked his pricked fingers theyre stubborn as pigs to be sure he remarked its only milk thistle how often must i tell ye morrison take the thistle heads off and mash the leaves and stems fine and if theyre too prickly to eat spread on a bannock then make a tea of them and have them drink it ive yet to see pigs drink tea tell them morrisons lined face cracked in a grin an elderly man he knew well enough how to handle recalcitrant patients he only liked to complain for the fun of it aye well ill say have they ever seen a toothless cow he said resigned as he tucked the limp greens carefully into his own sack but youll be sure to bare your teeth at joel mcculloch next time ye see him hes the worst o them for not believin as the greens do help wi the scurvy say as ill bite him in the arse mac dubh promised with a flash of his excellent teeth if i hear he hasna eaten his thistles morrison made the small amused noise that passed for a belly laugh with him and went to gather up the bits of ointment and the few herbs he had for medicines mac dubh relaxed for the moment glancing about the room to be sure no trouble brewed there were feuds at the moment hed settled bobby sinclair and edwin murrays trouble a week back and while they were not friends they were keeping their distance from one another he closed his eyes he was tired he had been hauling stone all day supper would be along in a few minutesa tub of parritch and some bread to be shared out a bit of brose too if they were luckyand likely most of the men would go to sleep soon after leaving him a few minutes of peace and semiprivacy when he need not listen to anyone or feel he must do anything he had had no time as yet even to wonder about the new governor important as the man would be to all their lives young hayes had said that might be good or might be bad older men who had fought in the rising were often prejudiced against highlandersbogle who had put him in irons had fought with cope a scared young soldier though trying to keep abreast of an unfamiliar job could be more rigid and tyrannical than the crustiest of old colonels aye well and nothing to be done but wait to see he sighed and shifted his posture incommodedfor the tenthousandth timeby the manacles he wore he shifted irritably banging one wrist against the edge of the bench he was large enough that the weight of the irons didnt trouble him overmuch but they chafed badly with the work worse was the inability to spread his arms more than eighteen inches apart this gave him cramp and a clawing feeling deep in the muscle of chest and back that left him only when he slept mac dubh said a soft voice beside him a word in your ear if i might he opened his eyes to see ronnie sutherland perched alongside pointed face intent and foxlike in the faint glow from the fire aye ronnie of course he pushed himself upright and put both his irons and the thought of the new governor firmly from his mind dearest mother john grey wrote later that night i am arrived safely at my new post and find it comfortable colonel quarry my predecessorhe is the duke of clarences nephew you recallmade me welcome and acquainted with my charge i am provided with a most excellent servant and while i am bound to find many things about scotland strange at first i am sure i will find the experience interesting i was served an object for my supper which the steward told me was called a haggis upon inquiry this proved to be the interior organ of a sheep filled with a mixture of ground oats and a quantity of unidentifiable cooked flesh though i am assured the inhabitants of scotland esteem this dish a particular delicacy i sent it to the kitchens and requested a plain boiled saddle of mutton in its place having thus made my firsthumblemeal here and being somewhat fatigued by the long journeyof whose details i shall inform you in a subsequent missivei believe i shall now retire leaving further descriptions of my surroundingswith which i am imperfectly acquainted at present as it is darkfor a future communication he paused tapping the quill on the blotter the point left small dots of ink and he abstractedly drew lines connecting these making the outlines of a jagged object dared he ask about george not a direct inquiry that wouldnt do but a reference to the family asking whether his mother had happened to encounter lady everett lately and might he ask to be remembered to her son he sighed and drew another point on his object no his widowed mother was ignorant of the situation but lady everetts husband moved in military circles his brothers influence would keep the gossip to a minimum but lord everett might catch a whiff of it nonetheless and be quick enough to put two and two together let him drop an injudicious word to his wife about george and the word pass on from lady everett to his motherthe dowager countess melton was not a fool she knew quite well that he was in disgrace promising young officers in the good graces of their superiors were not sent to the arseend of scotland to oversee the renovation of small and unimportant prisonfortresses but his brother harold had told her that the trouble was an unfortunate affair of the heart implying sufficient indelicacy to stop her questioning him about it she likely thought he had been caught with his colonels wife or keeping a whore in his quarters an unfortunate affair of the heart he smiled grimly dipping his pen perhaps hal had a greater sensitivity than hed thought in so describing it but then all his affairs had been unfortunate since hectors death at culloden with the thought of culloden the thought of fraser came back to him something he had been avoiding all day he looked from the blotter to the folder which held the prisoners roll biting his lip he was tempted to open it and look to see the name but what point was there in that there might be scores of men in the highlands named james fraser but only one known also as red jamie he felt himself flush as waves of heat rolled over him but it was not nearness to the fire in spite of that he rose and went to the window drawing in great lungfuls of air as though the cold draft could cleanse him of memory pardon sir but will ye be wantin your bed warmed now the scottish speech behind him startled him and he whirled round to find the tousled head of the prisoner assigned to tend his quarters poking through the door that led to his private rooms oh er yes thank youmacdonell he said doubtfully mackay my lord the man corrected without apparent resentment and the head vanished grey sighed there was nothing that could be done tonight he came back to the desk and gathered up the folders to put them away the jagged object he had drawn on the blotter looked like one of those spiked maces with which ancient knights had crushed the heads of their foes he felt as though he had swallowed one though perhaps this was no more than indigestion occasioned by halfcooked mutton he shook his head pulled the letter to him and signed it hastily with all affection your obt son john wm grey he shook sand over the signature sealed the missive with his ring and set it aside to be posted in the morning he rose and stood hesitating surveying the shadowy reaches of the office it was a great cold barren room with little in it bar the huge desk and a couple of chairs he shivered the sullen glow of the peat bricks on the hearth did little to warm its vast spaces particularly with the freezing wet air coming in at the window he glanced once more at the prisoners roll then he bent opened the lower drawer of the desk and drew out the brown glass bottle he pinched out the candle and made his way toward his bed by the dull glow of the hearth the mingled effects of exhaustion and whisky should have sent him to sleep at once but sleep kept its distance hovering over his bed like a bat but never lighting every time he felt himself sinking into dreams a vision of the wood at carryarrick came before his eyes and he found himself lying once more wideawake and sweating his heart thundering in his ears he had been sixteen then excited beyond bearing by his first campaign he had not got his commission then but his brother hal had taken him along with the regiment so that he might get a taste of soldiering camped at night near a dark scottish wood on their way to join general cope at prestonpans john had found himself too nervous to sleep what would the battle be like cope was a great general all hals friends said so but the men around the fires told frightful stories of the fierce highlanders and their bloody broadswords would he have the courage to face the dreadful highland charge he couldnt bring himself to mention his fears even to hector hector loved him but hector was twenty tall and muscular and fearless with a lieutenants commission and dashing stories of battles fought in france he didnt know even now whether it had been an urge to emulate hector or merely to impress him that had led him to do it in either case when he saw the highlander in the wood and recognized him from the broadsheets as the notorious red jamie fraser he had determined to kill or capture him the notion of returning to camp for help had occurred to him but the man was aloneat least john had thought he was aloneand evidently unawares seated quietly upon a log eating a bit of bread and so he had drawn his knife from his belt and crept quietly through the wood toward that shining red head the haft slippery in his grasp his mind filled with visions of glory and hectors praise instead there had been a glancing blow as his knife flashed down his arm locked tight round the scots neck to choke him and then lord john grey flung himself over in his bed hot with remembrance they had fallen back rolling together in the crackling oakleaf dark grappling for the knife thrashing and fightingfor his life he had thought first the scot had been under him then twisting somehow over he had touched a great snake once a python that a friend of his uncles had brought from the indies and that was what it had been like frasers touch lithe and smooth and horribly powerful moving like the muscular coils never where you expected it to be he had been flung ignominiously on his face in the leaves his wrist twisted painfully behind his back in a frenzy of terror convinced he was about to be slain he had wrenched with all his strength at his trapped arm and the bone had snapped with a redblack burst of pain that rendered him momentarily senseless he had come to himself moments later slumped against a tree facing a circle of ferociouslooking highlanders all in their plaids in the midst of them stood red jamie fraserand the woman grey clenched his teeth curse that woman if it hadnt been for herwell god knew what might have happened what had happened was that she had spoken she was english a lady by her speech and heidiot that he washad leapt at once to the conclusion that she was a hostage of the vicious highlanders no doubt kidnapped for the purpose of ravishment everyone said that highlanders indulged in rapine at every opportunity and took delight in dishonoring englishwomen how should he have known otherwise and lord john william grey aged sixteen and filled to the brim with regimental notions of gallantry and noble purpose bruised shaken and fighting the pain of his broken arm had tried to bargain to save her from her fate fraser tall and mocking had played him like a salmon stripping the woman halfnaked before him to force from him information about the position and strength of his brothers regiment and then when he had told all he could fraser had laughingly revealed that the woman was his wife theyd all laughed he could hear the ribald scottish voices now hilarious in memory grey rolled over shifting his weight irritably on the unaccustomed mattress and to make it all worse fraser had not even had the decency to kill him but instead had tied him to a tree where he would be found by his friends in the morning by which time frasers men had visited the camp andwith the information he had given themhad immobilized the cannon they were bringing to cope everyone had found out of course and while excuses were made because of his age and his noncommissioned status he had been a pariah and an object of scorn no one would speak to him save his brotherand hector loyal hector he sighed rubbing his cheek against the pillow he could see hector still in his minds eye darkhaired and blueeyed tendermouthed always smiling it had been ten years since hector had died at culloden hacked to pieces by a highland broadsword and still john woke in the dawn sometimes body arched in clutching spasm feeling hectors touch and now this he had dreaded this posting being surrounded by scots by their grating voices overwhelmed with the memory of what they had done to hector but never in the most dismal moments of anticipation had he thought he would ever meet james fraser again the peat fire on the hearth died gradually to hot ash then cold and the window paled from deep black to the sullen gray of a rainy scottish dawn and still john grey lay sleepless burning eyes fixed on the smokeblackened beams above him grey rose in the morning unrested but with his mind made up he was here fraser was here and neither could leave for the foreseeable future so he must see the man now and againhe would be speaking to the assembled prisoners in an hour and must inspect them regularly thereafterbut he would not see him privately if he kept the man himself at a distance perhaps he could also keep at bay the memories he stirred and the feelings for while it was the memory of his past rage and humiliation that had kept him awake to begin with it was the other side of the present situation that had left him still wakeful at dawn the slowly dawning realization that fraser was now his prisoner no longer his tormentor but a prisoner like the others entirely at his mercy he rang the bell for his servant and padded to the window to see how the weather kept wincing at the chill of the stone under his bare feet it was not surprisingly raining in the courtyard below the prisoners were already being formed up in work crews wet to the skin shivering in his shirt grey pulled in his head and shut the window halfway a nice compromise between death from suffocation and death from the ague it had been visions of revenge that kept him tossing in his bed as the window lightened and the rain pattered on the sill thoughts of fraser confined to a tiny cell of freezing stone kept naked through the winter nights fed on slops stripped and flogged in the courtyard of the prison all that arrogant power humbled reduced to groveling misery dependent solely on his word for a moments relief yes he thought all those things imagined them in vivid detail reveled in them he heard fraser beg for mercy imagined himself disdaining haughty he thought these things and the spiked object turned over in his guts piercing him with selfdisgust whatever he might once have been to grey fraser now was a beaten foe a prisoner of war and the charge of the crown he was greys charge in fact a responsibility and his welfare the duty of honor his servant had brought hot water for shaving he splashed his cheeks feeling the warmth soothe him laying to rest the tormented fancies of the night that was all they were he realizedfancies and the realization brought him a certain relief he might have met fraser in battle and taken a real and savage pleasure in killing or maiming him but the inescapable fact was that so long as fraser was his prisoner he could not in honor harm the man by the time he had shaved and his servant had dressed him he was recovered enough to find a certain grim humor in the situation his foolish behavior at carryarrick had saved frasers life at culloden now that debt discharged and fraser in his power frasers sheer helplessness as a prisoner made him completely safe for whether foolish or wise naive or experienced all the greys were men of honor feeling somewhat better he met his gaze in the looking glass set his wig to rights and went to eat breakfast before giving his first address to the prisoners will you have your supper served in the sitting room sir or in here mackays head uncombed as ever poked into the office um grey murmured absorbed in the papers spread out on the desk oh he said looking up in here if you please he waved vaguely at the corner of the huge desk and returned to his work scarcely looking up when the tray with his food arrived sometime later quarry had not been joking about the paperwork the sheer quantity of food alone required endless orders and requisitionsall orders to be submitted in duplicate to london if he pleasedlet alone the hundreds of other necessities required by the prisoners the guards and the men and women from the village who came in by the day to clean the barracks and work in the kitchens he had done nothing all day but write and sign requisitions he must find a clerk soon or die of sheer ennui two hundred lb wheat flowr he wrote for prisoners use six hogsheads ale for use of barracks his normally elegant handwriting had quickly degenerated into a utilitarian scrawl his stylish signature become a curt j grey he laid down his pen with a sigh and closed his eyes massaging the ache between his brows the sun had not bothered to show its face once since his arrival and working all day in a smoky room by candlelight left his eyes burning like lumps of coal his books had arrived the day before but he had not even unpacked them too exhausted by nightfall to do more than bathe his aching eyes in cold water and go to sleep he heard a small stealthy sound and sat up abruptly his eyes popping open a large brown rat sat on the corner of his desk a morsel of plum cake held in its front paws it didnt move but merely looked at him speculatively whiskers twitching well god damn my eyes grey exclaimed in amazement here you bugger thats my supper the rat nibbled pensively at the plum cake bright beady eyes fixed on the major get out of it enraged grey snatched up the nearest object and let fly at the rat the ink bottle exploded on the stone floor in a spray of black and the startled rat leapt off the desk and fled precipitously galloping between the legs of the even more startled mackay who appeared at the door to see what the noise was has the prison got a cat grey demanded dumping the contents of his supper tray into the waste can by his desk aye sir theres cats in the storerooms mackay offered crawling backward on hands and knees to wipe up the small black footprints the rat had left in its precipitous flight through the ink puddle well fetch one up here if you please mackay grey ordered at once he grunted at the memory of that obscenely naked tail draped nonchalantly over his plate he had encountered rats often enough in the field of course but there was something about having his own personal supper molested before his eyes that seemed particularly infuriating he strode to the window and stood there trying to clear his head with fresh air as mackay finished his moppingup dusk was drawing down filling the courtyard with purple shadows the stones of the cell wing opposite looked even colder and more dreary than usual the turnkeys were coming through the rain from the kitchen wing a procession of small carts laden with the prisoners food huge pots of steaming oatmeal and baskets of bread covered with cloths against the rain at least the poor devils had hot food after their wet days work in the stone quarry a thought struck him as he turned from the window are there many rats in the cells he asked mackay aye sir a great many the prisoner replied with a final swipe to the threshold ill tell the cook to make ye up a fresh tray shall i sir if you please grey said and then if you will mr mackay please see that each cell is provided with its own cat mackay looked slightly dubious at this grey paused in the act of retrieving his scattered papers is there something wrong mackay no sir mackay replied slowly only the wee brown beasties do keep down the cockchafers and with respect sir i dinna think the men would care to have a cat takin all their rats grey stared at the man feeling mildly queasy the prisoners eat the rats he asked with a vivid memory of sharp yellow teeth nibbling at his plum cake only when theyre lucky enough to catch one sir mackay said perhaps the cats would be a help wi that after all will that be all for tonight sir the wanderer greys resolve concerning james fraser lasted for two weeks then the messenger arrived from the village of ardsmuir with news that changed everything does he still live he asked the man sharply the messenger one of the inhabitants of ardsmuir village who worked for the prison nodded i saw him mysel sir when they brought him in hes at the lime tree now being cared forbut i didna think he looked as though care would be enough sir if ye take my meaning he raised one brow significantly i take it grey answered shortly thank you mr allison sir rufus allison your servant sir the man accepted the shilling offered him bowed with his hat under his arm and took his leave grey sat at his desk staring out at the leaden sky the sun had scarcely shone for a day since his arrival he tapped the end of the quill with which he had been writing on the desk oblivious to the damage he was inflicting on the sharpened tip the mention of gold was enough to prick up any mans ears but especially his a man had been found this morning wandering in the mist on the moor near the village his clothes were soaked not only with the damp but with seawater and he was out of his mind with fever he had talked unceasingly since he was found babbling for the most part but his rescuers were unable to make much sense of his ravings the man appeared to be scottish and yet he spoke in an incoherent mixture of french and gaelic with here and there the odd word of english thrown in and one of those words had been gold the combination of scots gold and the french tongue mentioned in this area of the country could bring only one thought to the mind of anyone who had fought through the last days of the jacobite rising the frenchmans gold the fortune in gold bullion that louis of france hadaccording to rumorsent secretly to the aid of his cousin charles stuart but sent far too late some stories said that the french gold had been hidden by the highland army during the last headlong retreat to the north before the final disaster at culloden others held that the gold had never reached charles stuart but had been left for safekeeping in a cave near the place where it had come ashore on the northwestern coast some said that the secret of the hiding place had been lost its guardian killed at culloden others said that the hiding place was still known but a closekept secret held among the members of a single highland family whatever the truth the gold had never been found not yet french and gaelic grey spoke passable french the result of several years fighting abroad but neither he nor any of his officers spoke the barbarous gaelic save a few words sergeant grissom had learned as a child from a scottish nursemaid he could not trust a man from the village not if there was anything to this tale the frenchmans gold beyond its value as treasurewhich would belong to the crown in any casethe gold had a considerable and personal value to john william grey the finding of that halfmythical hoard would be his passport out of ardsmuirback to london and civilization the blackest disgrace would be instantly obscured by the dazzle of gold he bit the end of the blunted quill feeling the cylinder crack between his teeth damn no it couldnt be a villager nor one of his officers a prisoner then yes he could use a prisoner without risk for a prisoner would be unable to make use of the information for his own ends damn again all of the prisoners spoke gaelic many had some english as wellbut only one spoke french besides he is an educated man quarrys voice echoed in his memory damn damn damn grey muttered it couldnt be helped allison had said the wanderer was very ill there was no time to look for alternatives he spat out a shred of quill brame he shouted the startled corporal poked his head in yes sir bring me a prisoner named james fraser at once the governor stood behind his desk leaning on it as though the huge slab of oak were in fact the bulwark it looked his hands were damp on the smooth wood and the white stock of his uniform felt tight around his neck his heart leapt violently as the door opened the scot came in his irons chinking slightly and stood before the desk the candles were all lit and the office nearly as bright as day though it was nearly full dark outside he had seen fraser several times of course standing in the courtyard with the other prisoners red head and shoulders above most of the other men but never close enough to see his face clearly he looked different that was both shock and relief for so long he had seen a cleanshaven face in memory dark with threat or alight with mocking laughter this man was shortbearded his face calm and wary and while the deep blue eyes were the same they gave no sign of recognition the man stood quietly before the desk waiting grey cleared his throat his heart was still beating too fast but at least he could speak calmly mr fraser he said i thank you for coming the scot bent his head courteously but did not answer that he had had no choice in the matter his eyes said that doubtless you wonder why i have sent for you grey said he sounded insufferably pompous to his own ears but was unable to remedy it i find that a situation has arisen in which i require your assistance what is that major the voice was the samedeep and precise marked with a soft highland burr he took a deep breath bracing himself on the desk he would rather have done anything but ask help of this particular man but there was no bloody choice fraser was the only possibility a man has been found wandering the moor near the coast he said carefully he appears to be seriously ill and his speech is deranged however certainmatters to which he refers appear to be ofsubstantial interest to the crown i require to talk with him and discover as much as i can of his identity and the matters of which he speaks he paused but fraser merely stood there waiting unfortunately grey said taking another breath the man in question has been heard to speak in a mixture of gaelic and french with no more than a word or two of english one of the scots ruddy eyebrows stirred his face didnt change in any appreciable way but it was evident that he had grasped the implications of the situation i see major the scots soft voice was full of irony and you would like my assistance to interpret for ye what this man might have to say grey couldnt trust himself to speak but merely jerked his head in a short nod i fear i must decline major fraser spoke respectfully but with a glint in his eye that was anything but respectful greys hand curled tight around the brass letteropener on his blotter you decline he said he tightened his grasp on the letteropener in order to keep his voice steady might i inquire why mr fraser i am a prisoner major the scot said politely not an interpreter your assistance would beappreciated grey said trying to infuse the word with significance without offering outright bribery conversely his tone hardened a failure to render legitimate assistance it is not legitimate for ye either to extort my services or to threaten me major frasers voice was a good deal harder than greys i did not threaten you the edge of the letteropener was cutting into his hand he was forced to loosen his grip did ye no well and im pleased to hear it fraser turned toward the door in that case major i shall bid ye good night grey would have given a great deal simply to have let him go unfortunately duty called mr fraser the scot stopped a few feet from the door but didnt turn grey took a deep breath steeling himself to it if you do what i ask i will have your irons struck off he said fraser stood quite still young and inexperienced grey might be but he was not unobservant neither was he a poor judge of men grey watched the rise of his prisoners head the increased tension of his shoulders and felt a small relaxation of the anxiety that had gripped him since the news of the wanderer had come mr fraser he said very slowly the scot turned around his face was quite expressionless you have a bargain major he said softly it was well past midnight when they arrived in the village of ardsmuir no lights showed in the cottages they passed and grey found himself wondering what the inhabitants thought as the sound of hooves and the jingle of arms passed by their windows late at night a faint echo of the english troops who had swept through the highlands ten years before the wanderer had been taken to the lime tree an inn so called because for many years it had boasted a huge lime tree in the yard the only tree of any size for thirty miles there was nothing left now but a broad stumpthe tree like so many other things had perished in the aftermath of culloden burned for firewood by cumberlands troopsbut the name remained at the door grey paused and turned to fraser you will recall the terms of our agreement i will fraser answered shortly and brushed past him in return for having the irons removed grey had required three things firstly that fraser would not attempt to escape during the journey to or from the village secondly fraser would undertake to give a full and true account of all that the vagrant should say and thirdly fraser would give his word as a gentleman to speak to no one but grey of what he learned there was a murmur of gaelic voices inside a sound of surprise as the innkeeper saw fraser and deference at the sight of the red coat behind him the goodwife stood on the stair an oildip in her hand making the shadows dance around her grey laid a hand on the innkeepers arm startled who is that there was another figure on the stairs an apparition clothed all in black that is the priest fraser said quietly beside him the man will be dying then grey took a deep breath trying to steady himself for what might come then there is little time to waste he said firmly setting a booted foot on the stair let us proceed the man died just before dawn fraser holding one of his hands the priest the other as the priest leaned over the bed mumbling in gaelic and latin making popish signs over the body fraser sat back on his stool eyes closed still holding the small frail hand in his own the big scot had sat by the mans side all night listening encouraging comforting grey had stood by the door not wishing to frighten the man by the sight of his uniform both surprised and oddly touched at frasers gentleness now fraser laid the thin weathered hand gently across the still chest and made the same sign as the priest had touching forehead heart and both shoulders in turn in the sign of a cross he opened his eyes and rose to his feet his head nearly brushing the low rafters he nodded briefly to grey and preceded him down the narrow stair in here grey motioned to the door of the taproom empty at this hour a sleepyeyed barmaid laid the fire for them and brought bread and ale then went out leaving them alone he waited for fraser to refresh himself before asking well mr fraser the scot set down his pewter mug and wiped a hand across his mouth already bearded with his long hair neatly plaited he didnt look disheveled by the long night watch but there were dark smudges of tiredness under his eyes all right he said it doesna make a great deal of sense major he added warningly but this is all he said and he spoke carefully pausing now and then to recall a word stopping again to explain some gaelic reference grey sat listening in deepening disappointment fraser had been correctit didnt make much sense the white witch grey interrupted he spoke of a white witch and seals it scarcely seemed more farfetched than the rest of it but still he spoke disbelievingly aye he did say it to me again grey commanded as best you remember if you please he added he felt oddly comfortable with the man he realized with a feeling of surprise part of it was sheer fatigue of course all his usual reactions and feelings were numbed by the long night and the strain of watching a man die by inches the entire night had seemed unreal to grey not least was this odd conclusion wherein he found himself sitting in the dim dawn light of a country tavern sharing a pitcher of ale with red jamie fraser fraser obeyed speaking slowly stopping now and then to recall with the difference of a word here or there it was identical to the first accountand those parts of it that grey himself had been able to understand were faithfully translated he shook his head discouraged gibberish the mans ravings had been precisely thatravings if the man had ever seen any goldand it did sound as though he had at one timethere was no telling where or when from this hodgepodge of delusion and feverish delirium you are quite positive that is all he said grey grasped at the slim hope that fraser might have omitted some small phrase some statement that would yield a clue to the lost gold frasers sleeve fell back as he lifted his cup grey could see the deep band of raw flesh about his wrist dark in the gray early light of the taproom fraser saw him looking at it and set down the cup the frail illusion of companionship shattered i keep my bargains major fraser said with cold formality he rose to his feet shall we be going back now they rode in silence for some time fraser was lost in his own thoughts grey sunk in fatigue and disappointment they stopped at a small spring to refresh themselves just as the sun topped the small hills to the north grey drank cold water then splashed it on his face feeling the shock of it revive him momentarily he had been awake for more than twentyfour hours and was feeling slow and stupid fraser had been awake for the same twentyfour hours but gave no apparent sign of being troubled by the fact he was crawling busily around the spring on his hands and knees evidently plucking some sort of weed from the water what are you doing mr fraser grey asked in some bewilderment fraser looked up mildly surprised but not embarrassed in the slightest i am picking watercress major i see that grey said testily what for to eat major fraser replied evenly he took the stained cloth bag from his belt and dropped the dripping green mass into it indeed are you not fed sufficiently grey asked blankly i have never heard of people eating watercress its green major in his fatigued state the major had suspicions that he was being practiced upon what in damnation other color ought a weed to be he demanded frasers mouth twitched slightly and he seemed to be debating something with himself at last he shrugged slightly wiping his wet hands on the sides of his breeks i only meant major that eating green plants will stop ye getting scurvy and loose teeth my men eat such greens as i take them and cress is bettertasting than most things i can pick on the moor grey felt his brows shoot up green plants stop scurvy he blurted wherever did you get that notion from my wife fraser snapped he turned away abruptly and stood tying the neck of his sack with hard quick movements grey could not prevent himself asking your wife sirwhere is she the answer was a sudden blaze of dark blue that seared him to the backbone so shocking was its intensity perhaps you are too young to know the power of hate and despair quarrys voice spoke in greys memory he was not he recognized them at once in the depths of frasers eyes only for a moment though then the mans normal veil of cool politeness was back in place my wife is gone fraser said and turned away again so abruptly that the movement verged on rudeness grey felt himself shaken by an unexpected feeling in part it was relief the woman who had been both cause of and party to his humiliation was dead in part it was regret neither of them spoke again on the journey back to ardsmuir three days later jamie fraser escaped it had never been a difficult matter for prisoners to escape from ardsmuir no one ever did simply because there was no place for a man to go three miles from the prison the coast of scotland dropped into the ocean in a spill of crumbled granite on the other three sides nothing but empty moorland stretched for miles once a man might take to the heather depending on clan and kinsmen for support and protection but the clans were crushed the kin dead the scottish prisoners removed far away from their own clan lands starving on the bleak moor was little improvement on a prison cell escape was not worth itto anyone but jamie fraser who evidently had a reason the dragoons horses kept to the road while the surrounding moor looked smooth as a velvet counterpane the purpling heather was a thin layer deceptively spread over a foot or more of wet spongy peat moss even the red deer didnt walk at random in that boggy massgrey could see four of the animals now stick figures a mile away the line of their track through the heather seeming no wider than a thread fraser of course was not mounted that meant that the escaped prisoner might be anywhere on the moor free to follow the red deers paths it was john greys duty to pursue his prisoner and attempt his recapture it was something more than duty that had made him strip the garrison for his search party and urge them on with only the briefest of stops for rest and food duty yes and an urgent desire to find the french gold and win approval from his mastersand reprieve from this desolate scottish exile but there was anger too and an odd sense of personal betrayal grey wasnt sure whether he was more angry at fraser for breaking his word or at himself for having been fool enough to believe that a highlandergentleman or notheld a sense of honor equal to his own but angry he was and determined to search every deer path on this moor if necessary in order to lay james fraser by the heels they reached the coast the next night well after dark after a laborious day of combing the moor the fog had thinned away over the rocks swept out by the offshore wind and the sea spread out before them cradled by cliffs and strewn with tiny barren islets john grey stood beside his horse on the clifftops looking down at the wild black sea it was a clear night on the coast thank god and the moon was at the half its gleam painted the spraywet rocks making them stand out hard and shining as silver ingots against black velvet shadows it was the most desolate place he had ever seen though it had a sort of terrible beauty about it that made the blood run cold in his veins there was no sign of james fraser no sign of life at all one of the men with him gave a sudden exclamation of surprise and drew his pistol there he said on the rocks hold your fire fool said another of the soldiers grabbing his companions arm he made no effort to disguise his contempt have you neer seen seals ahno said the first man rather sheepishly he lowered his pistol staring out at the small dark forms on the rocks below grey had never seen seals either and he watched them with fascination they looked like black slugs from this distance the moonlight gleaming wetly on their coats as they raised restless heads seeming to roll and weave unsteadily as they made their awkward way on land his mother had had a cloak made of sealskin when he was a boy he had been allowed to touch it once marveling at the feel of it dark and warm as a moonless summer night amazing that such thick soft fur came from these slick wet creatures the scots call them silkies said the soldier who had recognized them he nodded at the seals with the proprietary air of special knowledge silkies greys attention was caught he stared at the man with interest what else do you know about them sykes the soldier shrugged enjoying his momentary importance not a great deal sir the folk hereabout have stories about them though they say sometimes one of them will come ashore and leave off its skin and inside is a beautiful woman if a man should find the skin and hide it so she cant go back why thenshell be forced to stay and be his wife they make good wives sir or so im told at least theyd always be wet murmured the first soldier and the men erupted in guffaws that echoed among the cliffs raucous as seabirds thats enough grey had to raise his voice to be heard above the rash of laughter and crude suggestions spread out grey ordered i want the cliffs searched in both directionsand keep an eye out for boats below god knows theres room enough to hide a sloop behind some of those islands abashed the men went without comment they returned an hour later wet from spray and disheveled with climbing but with no sign of jamie fraseror the frenchmans gold at dawn as the light stained the slippery rocks red and gold small parties of dragoons were sent off to search the cliffs in both directions making their way carefully down the rocky clefts and tumbled piles of stone nothing was found grey stood by a fire on the clifftop keeping an eye on the search he was swathed in his greatcoat against the biting wind and fortified periodically by hot coffee supplied by his servant the man at the lime tree had come from the sea his clothes soaked in saltwater whether fraser had learned something from the mans words that he had not told or had decided only to take the chance of looking for himself surely he also would have gone to the sea and yet there was no sign of james fraser anywhere along this stretch of coast worse yet there was no sign of the gold if he went in anywhere along this stretch major youll have seen the last of him im thinking it was sergeant grissom standing beside him gazing down at the crash and whirl of water through the jagged rocks below he nodded at the furious water they call this spot the devils cauldron because of the way it boils all the time fishermen drowned off this coast are seldom found there are wicked currents to blame for it of course but folk say the devil seizes them and pulls them below do they grey said bleakly he stared down into the smash and spume forty feet below i wouldnt doubt it sergeant he turned back toward the campfire give orders to search until nightfall sergeant if nothing is found well start back in the morning grey lifted his gaze from his horses neck squinting through the dim early light his eyes felt swollen from peat smoke and lack of sleep and his bones ached from several nights spent lying on damp ground the ride back to ardsmuir would take no more than a day the thought of a soft bed and a hot supper was delightfulbut then he would have to write the official dispatch to london confessing frasers escapethe reason for itand his own shameful failure to recapture the man the feeling of bleakness at this prospect was reinforced by a deep griping in the majors lower abdomen he raised a hand signaling a halt and slid wearily to the ground wait here he said to his men there was a small hillock a few hundred feet away it would afford him sufficient privacy for the relief he sorely needed his bowels unaccustomed to scottish parritch and oatcake had rebelled altogether at the exigencies of a field diet the birds were singing in the heather away from the noise of hooves and harness he could hear all the tiny sounds of the waking moor the wind had changed with the dawn and the scent of the sea came inland now whispering through the grass some small animal made a rustling noise on the other side of a gorse bush it was all very peaceful straightening up from what too late struck him as a most undignified posture grey raised his head and looked straight into the face of james fraser he was no more than six feet away he stood still as one of the red deer the moor wind brushing over him with the rising sun tangled in his hair they stood frozen staring at each other the smell of the sea came faintly on the wind there was no sound but the sea wind and the singing of meadowlarks for a moment then grey drew himself up swallowing to bring his heart down from his throat i fear you take me at a disadvantage mr fraser he said coolly fastening his breeches with as much selfpossession as he could muster the scots eyes were the only part of him to move down over grey and slowly back up looked over his shoulder to where six armed soldiers stood pointing their muskets dark blue eyes met his straight on at last the edge of frasers mouth twitched and he said i think ye take me at the same major white witchs curse jamie fraser sat shivering on the stone floor of the empty storeroom clutching his knees and trying to get warm he thought he likely would never be warm again the chill of the sea had seeped into his bones and he could still feel the churn of the crashing breakers deep in his belly he wished for the presence of the other prisonersmorrison hayes sinclair sutherland not only for company but for the heat of their bodies on bitter nights the men would huddle close together for warmth breathing each others stale breath tolerating the bump and knock of close quarters for the sake of warmth he was alone though likely they would not return him to the large cell with the other men until after they had done whatever they meant to do to him as punishment for escaping he leaned back against the wall with a sigh morbidly aware of the bones of his spine pressing against the stone and the fragility of the flesh covering them he was very much afraid of being flogged and yet he hoped that would be his punishment it would be horrible but it would be soon overand infinitely more bearable than being put back in irons he could feel in his flesh the crash of the smiths hammer echoing through the bones of his arm as the smith pounded the fetters firmly into place holding his wrist steady on the anvil his fingers sought the rosary around his neck his sister had given it to him when he left lallybroch the english had let him keep it as the string of beechwood beads had no value hail mary full of grace he muttered blessed art thou amongst women he hadnt much hope that wee yellowhaired fiend of a major had seen damn his soulhe knew just how terrible the fetters had been blessed is the fruit of thy womb jesus holy mary mother of god pray for us sinners the wee major had made him a bargain and he had kept it the major would not be thinking so though he had kept his oath had done as he promised had relayed the words spoken to him one by one just as he had heard them from the wandering man it was no part of his bargain to tell the englishman that he knew the manor what conclusions he had drawn from the muttered words he had recognized duncan kerr at once changed though he was by time and mortal illness before culloden he had been a tacksman of colum mackenzie jamies uncle after he had escaped to france to eke out what living might be made there be still a charaid bi sàmhach he had said softly in gaelic dropping to his knees by the bed where the sick man lay duncan was an elderly man his worn face wasted by illness and fatigue and his eyes were bright with fever at first he had thought duncan too far gone to know him but the wasted hand had gripped his with surprising strength and the man had repeated through his rasping breath mo charaid my kinsman the innkeeper was watching from his place near the door peering over major greys shoulder jamie had bent his head and whispered in duncans ear all you say will be told to the english speak wary the landlords eyes narrowed but the distance between them was too far jamie was sure he hadnt heard then the major had turned and ordered the innkeeper out and he was safe he couldnt tell whether it was the effect of his warning or only the derangement of fever but duncans speech wandered with his mind often incoherent images of the past overlapping with those of the present sometimes he had called jamie dougal the name of colums brother jamies other uncle sometimes he dropped into poetry sometimes he simply raved and within the ravings and the scattered words sometimes there was a grain of senseor more than sense it is cursed duncan whispered the gold is cursed do ye be warned lad it was given by the white witch given for the kings son but the cause is lost and the kings son fled and she will not let the gold be given to a coward who is she jamie asked his heart had sprung up and choked him at duncans words and it beat madly as he asked the white witchwho is she she seeks a brave man a mackenzie it is for himself mackenzie it is theirs she says it for the sake of him who is dead who is the witch jamie asked again the word duncan used was bandruidha witch a wisewoman a white lady they had called his wife that once clairehis own white lady he squeezed duncans hand tight in his own willing him to keep his senses who he said again who is the witch the witch duncan muttered his eyes closing the witch she is a souleater she is death he is dead the mackenzie he is dead who is dead colum mackenzie all of them all of them all dead all dead cried the sick man clutching tight to his hand colum and dougal and ellen too suddenly his eyes opened and fixed on jamies the fever had dilated his pupils so his gaze seemed a pool of drowning black folk do say he said with surprising clarity as how ellen mackenzie did leave her brothers and her home and go to wed with a silkie from the sea she heard them aye duncan smiled dreamily the black stare swimming with distant vision she heard the silkies singing there upon the rocks one and two and three of them and she saw from her tower one and two and three of them and so she came down and went to the sea and so under it to live wi the silkies aye did she no so folk say jamie had answered mouth gone dry ellen had been his mothers name and that was what folk had said when she had left her home to elope with brian dubh fraser a man with the shining black hair of a silkie the man for whose sake he was himself now called mac dubhblack brians son major grey stood close on the other side of the bed brow furrowed as he watched duncans face the englishman had no gaelic but jamie would have been willing to wager that he knew the word for gold he caught the majors eye and nodded bending again to speak to the sick man the gold man he said in french loud enough for grey to hear where is the gold he squeezed duncans hand as hard as he could hoping to convey some warning duncans eyes closed and he rolled his head restlessly to and fro upon the pillow he muttered something but the words were too faint to catch what did he say the major demanded sharply what i dont know jamie patted duncans hand to rouse him speak to me man tell me again there was no response save more muttering duncans eyes had rolled back in his head so that only a thin line of gleaming white showed beneath the wrinkled lids impatient the major leaned forward and shook him by one shoulder wake up he said speak to us at once duncan kerrs eyes flew open he stared up up past the two faces bending over him seeing something far beyond them she will tell you he said in gaelic she will come for you for a split second his attention seemed to return to the inn room where he lay and his eyes focused on the men with him for both of you he said distinctly then he closed his eyes and spoke no more but clung ever tighter to jamies hand then after a time his grip relaxed his hand slid free and it was over the guardianship of the gold had passed and so jamie fraser had kept his word to the englishmanand his obligation to his countrymen he had told the major all that duncan had said and the devil of a help to him that had been and when the opportunity of escape offered he had taken itgone to the heather and sought the sea and done what he could with duncan kerrs legacy and now he must pay the price of his actions whatever that turned out to be there were footsteps coming down the corridor outside he clutched his knees harder trying to quell the shivering at least it would be decided now either way pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death amen the door swung open letting in a shaft of light that made him blink it was dark in the corridor but the guard standing over him held a torch on your feet the man reached down and pulled him up against the stiffness of his joints he was pushed toward the door stumbling youre wanted upstairs upstairs where he was startled at thatthe smiths forge was downstairs from where he was off the courtyard and they wouldnt flog him so late in the evening the mans face twisted fierce and ruddy in the torchlight to the majors quarters the guard said grinning and may god have mercy on your soul mac dubh no sir i will not say where i have been he repeated it firmly trying not to let his teeth chatter he had been brought not to the office but to greys private sitting room there was a fire on the hearth but grey was standing in front of it blocking most of the warmth nor why you chose to escape greys voice was cool and formal jamies face tightened he had been placed near the bookshelf where the light of a triplebranched candlestick fell on his face grey himself was no more than a silhouette black against the fires glow that is my private affair he said private affair grey echoed incredulously did you say your private affair i did the governor inhaled strongly through his nose that is possibly the most outrageous thing i have heard in my life your life has been rather brief then major fraser said if you will pardon my saying so there was no point in dragging it out or trying to placate the man better to provoke a decision at once and get it over with he had certainly provoked something greys fists clenched tight at his sides and he took a step toward him away from the fire have you any notion what i could do to you for this grey inquired his voice low and very much controlled aye i have major more than a notion he knew from experience what they might do to him and he wasnt looking forward to it it wasnt as though hed a choice about it though grey breathed heavily for a moment then jerked his head come here mr fraser he ordered jamie stared at him puzzled here he said peremptorily pointing to a spot directly before him on the hearthrug stand here sir i am not a dog major jamie snapped yell do as ye like wi me but ill no come when ye call me to heel taken by surprise grey uttered a short involuntary laugh my apologies mr fraser he said dryly i meant no offense by the address i merely wish you to approach nearer if you will he stepped aside and bowed elaborately gesturing to the hearth jamie hesitated but then stepped warily onto the patterned rug grey stepped close to him nostrils flared so close the fine bones and fair skin of his face made him look almost girlish the major put a hand on his sleeve and the longlashed eyes sprang wide in shock youre wet yes i am wet jamie said with elaborate patience he was also freezing a fine continuous shiver ran through him even this close to the fire why why jamie echoed astonished did you not order the guards to douse me wi water before leaving me in a freezing cell i did not no it was clear enough that the major was telling the truth his face was pale under the ruddy flush of the firelight and he looked angry his lips thinned to a fine line i apologize for this mr fraser accepted major small wisps of steam were beginning to rise from his clothes but the warmth was seeping through the damp cloth his muscles ached from the shivering and he wished he could lie down on the hearthrug dog or not did your escape have anything to do with the matter of which you learned at the lime tree inn jamie stood silent the ends of his hair were drying and small wisps floated across his face will you swear to me that your escape had nothing to do with that matter jamie stood silent there seemed no point in saying anything now the little major was pacing up and down the hearth before him hands locked behind his back now and then the major glanced up at him and then resumed his pacing finally he stopped in front of jamie mr fraser he said formally i will ask you once morewhy did you escape from the prison jamie sighed he wouldnt get to stand by the fire much longer i cannot tell you major cannot or will not grey asked sharply it doesna seem a useful distinction major as ye willna hear anything either way he closed his eyes and waited trying to soak up as much heat as possible before they took him away grey found himself at a loss both for words and action stubborn does not begin to describe it quarry had said it didnt he took a deep breath wondering what to do he found himself embarrassed by the petty cruelty of the guards revenge the more so because it was just such an action he had first contemplated upon hearing that fraser was his prisoner he would be perfectly within his rights now to order the man flogged or put back in irons condemned to solitary confinement put on short rationshe could in justice inflict any of a dozen different punishments and if he did the odds of his ever finding the frenchmans gold became vanishingly small the gold did exist or at least there was a good probability that it did only a belief in that gold would have stirred fraser to act as he had he eyed the man frasers eyes were closed his lips set firmly he had a wide strong mouth whose grim expression was somewhat belied by the sensitive lips set soft and exposed in their curly nest of red beard grey paused trying to think of some way to break past the mans wall of bland defiance to use force would be worse than uselessand after the guards actions he would be ashamed to order it even had he the stomach for brutality the clock on the mantelpiece struck ten it was late there was no sound in the fortress save the occasional footsteps of the soldier on sentry in the courtyard outside the window clearly neither force nor threat would work in gaining the truth reluctantly he realized that there was only one course open to him if he still wished to pursue the gold he must put aside his feelings about the man and take quarrys suggestion he must pursue an acquaintance in the course of which he might worm out of the man some clue that would lead him to the hidden treasure if it existed he reminded himself turning to his prisoner he took a deep breath mr fraser he said formally will you do me the honor to take supper tomorrow in my quarters he had the momentary satisfaction of having startled the scottish bastard at least the blue eyes opened wide and then fraser regained the mastery of his face he paused for a moment and then bowed with a flourish as though he wore a kilt and swinging plaid and not damp prison rags it will be my pleasure to attend ye major he said march fraser was delivered by the guard and left to wait in the sitting room where a table was laid when grey came through the door from his bedroom a few moments later he found his guest standing by the bookshelf apparently absorbed in a copy of nouvelle héloïse you are interested in french novels he blurted not realizing until too late how incredulous the question sounded fraser glanced up startled and snapped the book shut very deliberately he returned it to its shelf i can read major he said he had shaved a slight flush burned high on his cheekbones iyes of course i did not meani merely greys own cheeks were more flushed than frasers the fact was that he had subconsciously assumed that the other did not read his evident education notwithstanding merely because of his highland accent and shabby dress while his coat might be shabby frasers manners were not he ignored greys flustered apology and turned to the bookshelf i have been telling the men the story but it has been some time since i read it i thought i would refresh my memory as to the sequence of the ending i see just in time grey stopped himself from saying they understand it fraser evidently read the unspoken question in his face for he said dryly all scottish children are taught their letters major still we have a great tradition of storytelling in the highlands ah yes i see the entry of his servant with dinner saved him from further awkwardness and the supper passed uneventfully though there was little conversation and that little limited to the affairs of the prison the next time he had had the chess table set up before the fire and invited fraser to join him in a game before the supper was served there had been a brief flash of surprise from the slanted blue eyes and then a nod of acquiescence that had been a small stroke of genius grey thought in retrospect relieved of the need for conversation or social courtesies they had slowly become accustomed to each other as they sat over the inlaid board of ivory and ebonywood gauging each other silently by the movements of the chessmen when they had at length sat down to dine they were no longer quite strangers and the conversation while still wary and formal was at least true conversation and not the awkward affair of starts and stops it had been before they discussed matters of the prison had a little conversation of books and parted formally but on good terms grey did not mention gold and so the weekly custom was established grey sought to put his guest at ease in the hopes that fraser might let drop some clue to the fate of the frenchmans gold it had not come so far despite careful probing any hint of inquiry as to what had transpired during the three days of frasers absence from ardsmuir met with silence over the mutton and boiled potatoes he did his best to draw his odd guest into a discussion of france and its politics by way of discovering whether there might exist any links between fraser and a possible source of gold from the french court much to his surprise he was informed that fraser had in fact spent two years living in france employed in the wine business prior to the stuart rebellion a certain cool humor in frasers eyes indicated that the man was well aware of the motives behind this questioning at the same time he acquiesced gracefully enough in the conversation though taking some care always to lead questions away from his personal life and instead toward more general matters of art and society grey had spent some time in paris and despite his attempts at probing frasers french connections found himself becoming interested in the conversation for its own sake tell me mr fraser during your time in paris did you chance to encounter the dramatic works of monsieur voltaire fraser smiled oh aye major in fact i was privileged to entertain monsieur arouetvoltaire being his nom de plume ayeat my table on more than one occasion really grey cocked a brow in interest and is he as great a wit in person as with the pen i couldna really say fraser replied tidily forking up a slice of mutton he seldom said anything at all let alone much sparkling with wit he only sat hunched over in his chair watching everyone wi his eyes rolling about from one to another i shouldna be at all surprised to hear that things said at my dinner table later appeared on the stage though fortunately i never encountered a parody of myself in his work he closed his eyes in momentary concentration chewing his mutton is the meat to your taste mr fraser grey inquired politely it was gristled tough and seemed barely edible to him but then he might well think differently had he been eating oatmeal weeds and the occasional rat aye it is major i thank ye fraser dabbed up a bit of wine sauce and brought the last bite to his lips making no demur when grey signaled mackay to bring back the platter monsieur arouet wouldna appreciate such an excellent meal im afraid fraser said shaking his head as he helped himself to more mutton i should expect a man so feted in french society to have somewhat more exacting tastes grey answered dryly half his own meal remained on his plate destined for the supper of the cat augustus fraser laughed scarcely that major he assured grey i have never seen monsieur arouet consume anything beyond a glass of water and a dry biscuit no matter how lavish the occasion hes a weazened wee scrap of a man ye ken and a martyr to the indigestion indeed grey was fascinated perhaps that explains the cynicism of some of the sentiments i have seen expressed in his plays or do you not think that the character of an author shows in the construction of his work given some of the characters that i have seen appear in plays and novels major i should think the author a bit depraved who drew them entirely from himself no i suppose that is so grey answered smiling at the thought of some of the more extreme fictional characters with whom he was acquainted though if an author constructs these colorful personages from life rather than from the depths of imagination surely he must boast a most varied acquaintance fraser nodded brushing crumbs from his lap with the linen napkin it was not monsieur arouet but a colleague of hisa lady novelistwho remarked to me once that writing novels was a cannibals art in which one often mixed small portions of ones friends and ones enemies together seasoned them with imagination and allowed the whole to stew together into a savory concoction grey laughed at the description and beckoned to mackay to take away the plates and bring in the decanters of port and sherry a delightful description indeed speaking of cannibals though have you chanced to be acquainted with mr defoes robinson crusoe it has been a favorite of mine since boyhood the conversation turned then to romances and the excitement of the tropics it was very late indeed when fraser returned to his cell leaving major grey entertained but no wiser concerning either the source or the disposition of the wanderers gold april john grey opened the packet of quills his mother had sent from london swans quills both finer and stronger than common goosequills he smiled faintly at the sight of them an unsubtle reminder that his correspondence was in arrears his mother would have to wait until tomorrow though he took out the small monogrammed penknife he always carried and slowly trimmed a quill to his liking composing in his mind what he meant to say by the time he dipped his quill into the ink the words were clear in his mind and he wrote quickly seldom pausing april to harold lord melton earl of moray my dear hal he wrote i write to inform you of a recent occurrence which has much engaged my attention it may amount in the end to nothing but if there be any substance in the matter it is of great import the details of the wandering mans appearance and the report of his ravings followed swiftly but grey found himself slowing as he told of frasers escape and recapture the fact that fraser vanished from the precincts of the prison so soon following these events suggests strongly to me that there was in truth some substance in the vagrants words if this were the case however i find myself at a loss to account for frasers subsequent actions he was recaptured within three days of his escape at a point no more than a mile from the coast the countryside beyond the prison is deserted for a great many miles beyond the village of ardsmuir and there is little likelihood of his meeting with a confederate to whom he might pass word of the treasure every house in the village has been searched as was fraser himself with no trace discovered of any gold it is a remote district and i am reasonably sure that he communicated with no one outside the prison prior to his escapei am positive that he has not done so since for he is closely watched grey stopped seeing once more the windswept figure of james fraser wild as the red stags and as much at home on the moor as one of them he had not the slightest doubt that fraser could have eluded the dragoons easily had he so chosen but he had not he had deliberately allowed himself to be recaptured why he resumed writing more slowly it may be of course that fraser failed to find the treasure or that such a treasure does not exist i find myself somewhat inclined to this belief for if he were in possession of a great sum surely he would have departed from the district at once he is a strong man wellaccustomed to rough living and entirely capable i believe of making his way overland to some point on the coast from which he might make an escape by sea grey bit the end of the quill gently tasting ink he made a face at the bitterness rose and spat out the window he stood there for a minute looking out into the cold spring night absently wiping his mouth it had finally occurred to him to ask not the question he had been asking all along but the more important one he had done it at the conclusion of a game of chess which fraser had won the guard was standing at the door ready to escort fraser back to his cell as the prisoner had risen from his seat grey had stood up too i shall not ask you again why you left the prison he had said calmly conversational but i will ask youwhy did you come back fraser had frozen briefly startled he turned back and met greys eyes directly for a moment he said nothing then his mouth curled up in a smile i suppose i must value the company major i can tell ye its not the food grey snorted slightly remembering unable to think of a suitable response he had allowed fraser to leave it was only later that night that he had laboriously arrived at an answer at last having had the wit to ask questions of himself rather than of fraser what would he grey have done had fraser not returned the answer was that his next step would have been an inquiry into frasers family connections in case the man had sought refuge or help from them and that he was fairly sure was the answer grey had not taken part in the subjugation of the highlandshe had been posted to italy and francebut he had heard more than enough of that particular campaign he had seen the blackened stones of too many charred cottages rising like cairns amid the ruined fields as he traveled north to ardsmuir the fierce loyalties of the scottish highlanders were legendary a highlander who had seen those cots in flames might well choose to suffer prison irons or even flogging to save his family a visitation from english soldiers grey sat and took up his quill dipping it afresh you will know i think the mettle of the scots he wrote that one in particular he thought wryly it is unlikely that any force or threat i can exert will induce fraser to reveal the whereabouts of the goldshould it exist and if it does not i can still less expect any threat to be effective i have instead chosen to begin a formal acquaintance with fraser in his capacity as chief of the scottish prisoners in hopes of surprising some clue from his conversation so far i have gained nothing from this process one further avenue of approach suggests itself however for obvious reasons he went on writing slowly as he formed the thought i do not wish to make this matter known officially to call attention to a hoard that might well prove to be chimerical was dangerous the chance of disappointment was too great time enough if the gold were found to inform his superiors and collect his deserved rewardescape from ardsmuir a posting back to civilization therefore i approach you dear brother and ask for your help in discovering what particulars may obtain regarding the family of james fraser i pray you do not let anyone be alarmed by your inquiries if such family connections exist i would have them ignorant of my interest for the present my deepest thanks for any efforts you may be able to exert on my behalf and believe me always he dipped the pen once more and signed with a small flourish your humble servant and most affectionate brother john william grey may the men sick of la grippe grey inquired how do they fare dinner was over and with it their conversation of books now it was time for business fraser frowned over the single glass of sherry that was all he would accept in the way of drink he still had not tasted it though dinner had been over for some time none so well i have more than sixty men ill fifteen of them verra badly off he hesitated might i ask i can promise nothing mr fraser but you may ask grey answered formally he had barely sipped his own sherry nor more than tasted his dinner his stomach had been knotted with anticipation all day jamie paused a moment longer calculating his chances he wouldnt get everything he must try for what was most important but leave grey room to reject some requests we have need of more blankets major more fires and more food and medicines grey swirled the sherry in his cup watching the light from the fire play in the vortex ordinary business first he reminded himself time enough for the other later we have no more than twenty spare blankets in store he answered but you may have those for the use of the very sick i fear i cannot augment the ration of food the ratspoilage has been considerable and we lost a great quantity of meal in the collapse of the storeroom two months ago we have limited resources and it is not so much a question of more fraser put in quickly but rather of the type of food those who are most ill cannot readily digest the bread and parritch perhaps a substitution of some sort might be arranged each man was given by law a quart of oatmeal parritch and a small wheaten loaf each day thin barley brose supplemented this twice each week with a quart of meat stew added on sunday to sustain the needs of men working at manual labor for twelve to sixteen hours per day grey raised one eyebrow what are you suggesting mr fraser i assume that the prison does have some allowance for the purchase of salt beef turnips and onions for the sunday stew yes but that allowance must provide for the next quarters supplies then what i suggest major is that you might use that money now to provide broth and stew for those who are sick those of us who are hale will willingly forgo our share of meat for the quarter grey frowned but will the prisoners not be weakened with no meat at all will they not be unable to work those who die of the grippe will assuredly not work fraser pointed out acerbically grey snorted briefly true but those of you who remain healthy will not be healthy long if you give up your rations for so long a time he shook his head no mr fraser i think not it is better to let the sick take their chances than to risk many more falling ill fraser was a stubborn man he lowered his head for a moment then looked up to try again then i would ask your leave to hunt for ourselves major if the crown cannot supply us with adequate food hunt greys fair brows rose in astonishment give you weapons and allow you to wander the moors gods teeth mr fraser i think god doesna suffer much from the scurvy major jamie said dryly his teeth are in no danger he saw the twitch of greys mouth and relaxed slightly grey always tried to suppress his sense of humor no doubt feeling that put him at a disadvantage in his dealings with jamie fraser it did emboldened by that telltale twitch jamie pressed on not weapons major and not wandering will ye give us leave to set snares upon the moor when we cut peats though and to keep such meat as we take a prisoner would now and then contrive a snare as it was but as often as not the catch would be taken from him by the guards grey drew a deep breath and blew it out slowly considering snares would you not require materials for the construction of these snares mr fraser only a bit of string major jamie assured him a dozen balls no more of any sort of twine or string and ye may leave the rest to us grey rubbed slowly at his cheek in contemplation then nodded very well the major turned to the small secretary plucked the quill out of its inkwell and made a note i shall give orders to that effect tomorrow now as to the rest of your requests a quarterhour later it was settled jamie sat back at last sighing and finally took a sip of his sherry he considered that he had earned it he had permission not only for the snares but for the peatcutters to work an extra halfhour per day the extra peats to provide for an additional small fire in each cell no medicines were to be had but he had leave for sutherland to send a message to a cousin in ullapool whose husband was an apothecary if the cousins husband were willing to send medicines the prisoners could have them a decent evenings work jamie thought he took another sip of sherry and closed his eyes enjoying the warmth of the fire against his cheek grey watched his guest beneath lowered lids seeing the broad shoulders slump a little tension eased now that their business was finished or so fraser thought very good grey thought to himself yes drink your sherry and relax i want you thoroughly off guard he leaned forward to pick up the decanter and felt the crackle of hals letter in his breast pocket his heart began to beat faster will you not take a drop more mr fraser and tell mehow does your sister fare these days he saw frasers eyes spring open and his face whiten with shock how are matters there atlallybroch they call it do they not grey pushed aside the decanter keeping his eyes fixed on his guest i could not say major frasers voice was even but his eyes were narrowed to slits no but i daresay they do very well these days what with the gold you have provided them the broad shoulders tightened suddenly bunched under the shabby coat grey carelessly picked up one of the chessmen from the nearby board tossing it casually from one hand to the other i suppose ianyour brotherinlaw is named ian i thinkwill know how to make good use of it fraser had himself under control again the dark blue eyes met greys directly since you are so well informed as to my connections major he said evenly i must suppose that you also are aware that my home lies well over a hundred miles from ardsmuir perhaps you will explain how i might have traveled that distance twice within the space of three days greys eyes stayed on the chess piece rolling idly from hand to hand it was a pawn a coneheaded little warrior with a fierce face carved from a cylinder of walrus ivory you might have met someone upon the moor who would have borne word of the goldor borne the gold itselfto your family fraser snorted briefly on ardsmuir how likely is it major that i should by happenstance encounter a person known to me on that moor much less that it should be a person whom i would trust to convey a message such as you suggest he set down his glass with finality i met no one on the moor major and should i trust your word to that effect mr fraser grey allowed considerable skepticism to show in his voice he glanced up brows raised frasers high cheekbones flushed slightly no one has ever had cause to doubt my word major he said stiffly have they not indeed grey was not altogether feigning his anger i believe you gave me your word upon the occasion of my ordering your irons stricken off and i kept it did you the two men sat upright glaring at each other over the table you asked three things of me major and i have kept that bargain in every particular grey gave a contemptuous snort indeed mr fraser and if that is so pray what was it caused you suddenly to despise the company of your fellows and seek congress with the coneys on the moor since you assure me that you met no one elseyou give me your word that it is so this last was spoken with an audible sneer that brought the color surging into frasers face one of the big hands curled slowly into a fist aye major he said softly i give ye my word that that is so he seemed to realize at this point that his fist was clenched very slowly he unfolded it laying his hand flat on the table and as to your escape and as to my escape major i have told you that i will say nothing fraser exhaled slowly and sat back in his chair eyes fixed on grey under thick ruddy brows grey paused for a moment then sat back himself setting the chess piece on the table let me speak plainly mr fraser i do you the honor of assuming you to be a sensible man i am deeply sensible of the honor major i do assure you grey heard the irony but did not respond he held the upper hand now the fact is mr fraser that it is of no consequence whether you did in fact communicate with your family regarding the matter of the gold you might have done so that possibility alone is sufficient to warrant my sending a party of dragoons to search the premises of lallybrochthoroughlyand to arrest and interrogate the members of your family he reached into his breast pocket and withdrew a piece of paper unfolding it he read the list of names ian murrayyour brotherinlaw i collect his wife janet that would be your sister of course their children jamesnamed for his uncle perhapshe glanced up briefly long enough to catch a glimpse of frasers face than returned to his listmargaret katherine janet michael and ian quite a brood he said in a tone of dismissal that equated the six younger murrays with a litter of piglets he laid the list on the table beside the chess piece the three eldest children are old enough to be arrested and interrogated with their parents you know such interrogations are frequently ungentle mr fraser in this he spoke no less than the truth and fraser knew it all color had faded from the prisoners face leaving the strong bones stark under the skin he closed his eyes briefly then opened them grey had a brief memory of quarrys voice saying if you dine alone with the man dont turn your back on him the hair rose briefly on the back of his neck but he controlled himself returning frasers blue stare what do you want of me the voice was low and hoarse with fury but the scot sat motionless a figure carved in cinnabar gilded by the flame grey took a deep breath i want the truth he said softly there was no sound in the chamber save the pop and hiss of the peats in the grate there was a flicker of movement from fraser no more than the twitch of his fingers against his leg and then nothing the scot sat head turned staring into the fire as though he sought an answer there grey sat quietly waiting he could afford to wait at last fraser turned back to face him the truth then he took a deep breath grey could see the breast of his linen shirt swell with ithe had no waistcoat i kept my word major i told ye faithfully all that the man said to me that night what i didna tell ye was that some of what he said had meaning to me indeed grey held himself still scarcely daring to move and what meaning was that frasers wide mouth compressed to a thin line ispoke to you of my wife he said forcing the words out as though they hurt him yes you said that she was dead i said that she was gone major fraser corrected softly his eyes were fixed on the pawn it is likely she is dead but he stopped and swallowed then went on more firmly my wife was a healer what they call in the highlands a charmer but more than that she was a white ladya wisewoman he glanced up briefly the word in gaelic is bandruidh it also means witch the white witch grey also spoke softly but excitement was thrumming through his blood so the mans words referred to your wife i thought they might and if so the wide shoulders stirred in a slight shrug i had to go he said simply to see how did you know where to go was that also something you gleaned from the vagrants words grey leaned forward slightly curious fraser nodded eyes still fixed on the ivory chess piece there is a spot i knew of not too far distant from this place where there is a shrine to st bride st bride was also called the white lady he explained looking up though the shrine has been there a verra long timesince long before st bride came to scotland i see and so you assumed that the mans words referred to this spot as well as to your wife again the shrug i did not know fraser repeated i couldna say whether he meant anything to do with my wife or whether the white witch only meant st bridewas only meant to direct me to the placeor perhaps neither but i felt i must go he described the place in question and at greys prodding gave directions for reaching it the shrine itself is a small stone in the shape of an ancient cross so weathered that the markings scarce show on it it stands above a small pool halfburied in the heather ye can find small white stones in the pool tangled among the roots of the heather that grows on the bank the stones are thought to have great powers major he explained seeing the others blank look but only when used by a white lady i see and your wife grey paused delicately fraser shook his head briefly there was nothing there to do with her he said softly she is truly gone his voice was low and controlled but grey could hear the undertone of desolation frasers face was normally calm and unreadable he did not change expression now but the marks of grief were clear etched in the lines beside mouth and eyes thrown into darkness by the flickering fire it seemed an intrusion to break in upon such a depth of feeling unstated though it was but grey had his duty and the gold mr fraser he asked quietly what of that fraser heaved a deep sigh it was there he said flatly what grey sat bolt upright in his chair staring at the scot you found it fraser glanced up at him then and his mouth twisted wryly i found it was it indeed the french gold that louis sent for charles stuart excitement was racing through greys bloodstream with visions of himself delivering great chests of gold louis dor to his superiors in london louis never sent gold to the stuarts fraser said with certainty no major what i found at the saints pool was gold but not french coin what he had found was a small box containing a few gold and silver coins and a small leather pouch filled with jewels jewels grey blurted where the devil did they come from fraser cast him a glance of mild exasperation i havena the slightest notion major he said how should i know no of course not grey said coughing to cover his flusterment certainly but this treasurewhere is it now i threw it into the sea grey stared blankly at him youwhat i threw it into the sea fraser repeated patiently the slanted blue eyes met greys steadily yell maybe have heard of a place called the devils cauldron major its no more than half a mile from the saints pool why why would you have done such a thing grey demanded it isnt sense man i wasna much concerned with sense at the time major fraser said softly i had gone there hopingand with that hope gone the treasure seemed no more to me than a wee box of stones and bits of tarnished metal i had no use for it he looked up one brow slightly raised in irony but i didna see the sense in giving it to king geordie either so i flung it into the sea grey sat back in his chair and mechanically poured out another cup of sherry hardly noticing what he was doing his thoughts were in turmoil fraser sat head turned away and chin propped on his fist gazing into the fire his face gone back to its usual impassivity the light glowed behind him lighting the long straight line of his nose and the soft curve of his lip shadowing jaw and brow with sternness grey took a goodsized swallow of his drink and steadied himself it is a moving story mr fraser he said levelly most dramatic and yet there is no evidence that it is the truth fraser stirred turning his head to look at grey jamies slanted eyes narrowed in what might have been amusement aye there is major he said he reached under the waistband of his ragged breeches fumbled for a moment and held out his hand above the tabletop waiting grey extended his own hand in reflex and a small object dropped into his open palm it was a sapphire dark blue as frasers own eyes and a good size too grey opened his mouth but said nothing choked with astonishment there is your evidence that the treasure existed major fraser nodded toward the stone in greys hand his eyes met greys across the tabletop and as for the resti am sorry to say major that ye must take my word for it butbutyou said i did fraser was as calm as though they had been discussing the rain outside i kept that one wee stone thinking that it might be some use if i were ever to be freed or that i might find some chance of sending it to my family for yell appreciate majora light glinted derisively in jamies blue eyesthat my family couldna make use of a treasure of that sort without attracting a deal of unwelcome attention one stone perhaps but not a great many of them grey could scarcely think what fraser said was true a highland farmer like his brotherinlaw would have no way of turning such a treasure into money without causing talk that would bring down the kings men on lallybroch in short order and fraser himself might well be imprisoned for the rest of his life but still to toss away a fortune so lightly and yet looking at the scot he could well believe it if ever there was a man whose judgment would not be distorted by greed james fraser was it still how did you keep this by you grey demanded abruptly you were searched to the skin when you were brought back the wide mouth curved slightly in the first genuine smile grey had seen i swallowed it fraser said greys hand closed convulsively on the sapphire he opened his hand and rather gingerly set the gleaming blue thing on the table by the chess piece i see he said im sure ye do major said fraser with a gravity that merely made the glint of amusement in his eyes more pronounced a diet of rough parritch has its advantages now and again grey quelled the sudden urge to laugh rubbing a finger hard over his lip im sure it does mr fraser he sat for a moment contemplating the blue stone then he looked up abruptly you are a papist mr fraser he knew the answer already there were few adherents of the catholic stuarts who were not without waiting for a reply he rose and went to the bookshelf in the corner it took a moment to find a gift from his mother it was not part of his usual reading he laid the calfbound bible on the table next to the stone i am myself inclined to accept your word as a gentleman mr fraser he said but you will understand that i have my duty to consider fraser gazed at the book for a long moment then looked up at grey his expression unreadable aye i ken that fine major he said quietly without hesitation he laid a broad hand on the bible i swear in the name of almighty god and by his holy word he said firmly the treasure is as i told you his eyes glowed in the firelight dark and unfathomable and i swear on my hope of heaven he added softly that it rests now in the sea the torremolinos gambit with the question of the french gold thus settled they returned to what had become their routine a brief period of formal negotiation over the affairs of the prisoners followed by informal conversation and sometimes a game of chess this evening they had come from the dinner table still discussing samuel richardsons immense novel pamela do you think that the size of the book is justified by the complexity of the story grey asked leaning forward to light a cheroot from the candle on the sideboard it must after all be a great expense to the publisher as well as requiring a substantial effort from the reader a book of that length fraser smiled he did not smoke himself but had chosen to drink port this evening claiming that to be the only drink whose taste would be unaffected by the stink of tobacco what is ittwelve hundred pages aye i think so after all it is difficult to sum up the complications of a life in a short space with any hope of constructing an accurate account true i have heard the point made though that the novelists skill lies in the artful selection of detail do you not suppose that a volume of such length may indicate a lack of discipline in such selection and hence a lack of skill fraser considered sipping the ruby liquid slowly i have seen books where that is the case to be sure he said an author seeks by sheer inundation of detail to overwhelm the reader into belief in this case however i think it isna so each character is most carefully considered and all the incidents chosen seem necessary to the story no i think it is true that some stories simply require a greater space in which to be told he took another sip and laughed of course i admit to some prejudice in that regard major given the circumstances under which i read pamela i should have been delighted had the book been twice as long as it was and what circumstances were those grey pursed his lips and blew a careful smoke ring that floated toward the ceiling i lived in a cave in the highlands for several years major fraser said wryly i seldom had more than three books with me and those must last me for months at a time aye im partial to lengthy tomes but i must admit that it is not a universal preference thats certainly true grey agreed he squinted following the track of the first smoke ring and blew another just off target it drifted to the side i remember he continued sucking fiercely on his cheroot encouraging it to draw a friend of my motherssaw the bookin mothers drawing room he drew deeply and blew once more giving a small grunt of satisfaction as the new ring struck the old dispersing it into a tiny cloud lady hensley it was she picked up the book looked at it in that helpless way so many females affect and said oh countess you are so courageous to attack a novel of such stupendous size i fear i should never dare to start so lengthy a book myself grey cleared his throat and lowered his voice from the falsetto he had affected for lady hensley to which mother replied he went on in his normal voice dont worry about it for a moment my dear you wouldnt understand it anyway fraser laughed then coughed waving away the remnants of another smoke ring grey quickly snuffed out the cheroot and rose from his seat come along then weve just time for a quick game they were not evenly matched fraser was much the better player but grey could now and then contrive to rescue a match through sheer bravado of play tonight he tried the torremolinos gambit it was a risky opening a queens knight opening successfully launched it paved the way for an unusual combination of rook and bishop depending for its success upon a piece of misdirection by the kings knight and king bishops pawn grey used it seldom for it was a trick that would not work on a mediocre player one not sharp enough to detect the knights threat or its possibilities it was a gambit for use against a shrewd and subtle mind and after nearly three months of weekly games grey knew quite well what sort of mind he was facing across the tinted ivory squares he forced himself not to hold his breath as he made the nexttofinal move of the combination he felt frasers eyes rest on him briefly but didnt meet them for fear of betraying his excitement instead he reached to the sideboard for the decanter and refilled both glasses with the sweet dark port keeping his eyes carefully on the rising liquid would it be the pawn or the knight frasers head was bent over the board in contemplation small reddish lights winking in his hair as he moved slightly the knight and all was well it would be too late the pawn and all was likely lost grey could feel his heart beating heavily behind his breastbone as he waited frasers hand hovered over the board then suddenly decided swooped down and touched the piece the knight he must have let his breath out too noisily for fraser glanced sharply up at him but it was too late careful to keep any overt expression of triumph off his face grey castled fraser frowned at the board for a long moment eyes flicking among the pieces assessing then he jerked slightly seeing it and looked up eyes wide why ye cunning wee bastard he said in a tone of surprised respect where in the bloody hell did ye learn that trick my elder brother taught it to me grey answered losing his customary wariness in a rush of delight at his success he normally beat fraser no more than three times in ten and victory was sweet fraser uttered a short laugh and reaching out a long index finger delicately tipped his king over i should have expected something like that from a man like my lord melton he observed casually grey stiffened in his seat fraser saw the movement and arched one brow quizzically it is lord melton ye mean is it not he said or perhaps you have another brother no grey said his lips felt slightly numb though that might only be the cheroot no i have only one brother his heart had begun to pound again but this time with a heavy dull beat had the scottish bastard remembered all the time who he was our meeting was necessarily rather brief the scot said dryly but memorable he picked up his glass and took a drink watching grey across the crystal rim perhaps ye didna know that i had met lord melton on culloden field i knew i fought at culloden all greys pleasure in his victory had evaporated he felt slightly nauseated from the smoke i didnt know that you would recall hal thoughor know of the relationship between us as i have that meeting to thank for my life i am not likely to forget it fraser said dryly grey looked up i understand that you were not so thankful when hal met you at culloden the line of frasers mouth tightened then relaxed no he said softly he smiled without humor your brother verra stubbornly refused to shoot me i wasna inclined to be grateful for the favor at the time you wished to be shot greys eyebrows rose the scots eyes were remote fixed on the chessboard but clearly seeing something else i thought i had reason he said softly at the time what reason grey asked he caught a gimlet glance and added hastily i mean no impertinence in asking it is onlyat that time ii felt similarly from what you have said of the stuarts i cannot think that the loss of their cause would have led you to such despair there was a faint flicker near frasers mouth much too faint to be called a smile he inclined his head briefly in acknowledgment there were those who fought for love of charles stuartor from loyalty to his fathers right of kingship but you are right i wasna one of those he didnt explain further grey took a deep breath keeping his eyes fixed on the board i said that i felt much as you did at the time ilost a particular friend at culloden he said with half his mind he wondered why he should speak of hector to this man of all men a scottish warrior who had slashed his way across that deadly field whose sword might well have been the oneat the same time he could not help but speak there was no one to whom he could speak of hector save this man this prisoner who could speak to no one else whose words could do him no damage he made me go and look at the bodyhal did my brother grey blurted he looked down at his hand where the deep blue of hectors sapphire burned against his skin a smaller version of the one fraser had reluctantly given him he said that i must that unless i saw him dead i should never really believe it that unless i knew hectormy friendwas really gone i would grieve forever if i saw and knew i would grieve but then i should healand forget he looked up with a painful attempt at a smile hal is generally right but not always perhaps he had healed but he would never forget certainly he would not forget his last sight of hector lying waxfaced and still in the early morning light long dark lashes resting delicately on his cheeks as they did when he slept and the gaping wound that had halfsevered his head from his body leaving the windpipe and large vessels of the neck exposed in butchery they sat silent for a moment fraser said nothing but picked up his glass and drained it without asking grey refilled both glasses for the third time he leaned back in his chair looking curiously at his guest do you find your life greatly burdensome mr fraser the scot looked up then and met his eyes with a long level gaze evidently fraser found nothing in his own face save curiosity for the broad shoulders across the board relaxed their tension somewhat and the wide mouth softened its grim line the scot leaned back and flexed his right hand slowly opening and closing it to stretch the muscles grey saw that the hand had been damaged at one time small scars were visible in the firelight and two of the fingers were set stiffly perhaps not greatly so the scot replied slowly he met greys eyes with dispassion i think perhaps the greatest burden lies in caring for those we cannot help not in having no one for whom to care fraser paused before answering he might have been weighing the position of the pieces on the table that is emptiness he said at last softly but no great burden it was late there was no sound from the fortress around them save the occasional step of the soldier on sentry in the courtyard below your wifeshe was a healer you said she was sheher name was claire fraser swallowed then lifted his cup and drank as though trying to dislodge something stuck in his throat you cared very much for her i think grey said softly he recognized in the scot the same compulsion he had had a few moments earlierthe need to speak a name kept hidden to bring back for a moment the ghost of a love i had meant to thank you sometime major the scot said softly grey was startled thank me for what the scot looked up eyes dark over the finished game for that night at carryarrick where we first met his eyes were steady on greys for what ye did for my wife you remembered grey said hoarsely i hadna forgotten fraser said simply grey steeled himself to look across the table but when he did so he found no hint of laughter in the slanted blue eyes fraser nodded at him gravely formal ye were a worthy foe major i wouldna forget you john grey laughed bitterly oddly enough he felt less upset than he had thought he would at having the shameful memory so explicitly recalled if you found a sixteenyearold shitting himself with fear a worthy foe mr fraser then it is little wonder that the highland army was defeated fraser smiled faintly a man that doesna shit himself with a pistol held to his head major has either no bowels or no brains despite himself grey laughed one edge of frasers mouth turned slightly up ye wouldna speak to save your own life but ye would do it to save a ladys honor the honor of my own lady fraser said softly that doesna seem like cowardice to me the ring of truth was too evident in the scots voice to mistake or ignore i did nothing for your wife grey said rather bitterly she was in no danger after all ye didna ken that aye fraser pointed out ye thought to save her life and virtue at the risk of your own ye did her honor by the notionand i have thought of it now and again since isince i lost her the hesitation in frasers voice was slight only the tightening of the muscles in his throat betrayed his emotion i see grey breathed deep and let it out slowly i am sorry for your loss he added formally they were both quiet for a moment alone with their ghosts then fraser looked up and drew in his breath your brother was right major he said i thank ye and ill bid ye good een he rose set down his cup and left the room it reminded him in some ways of his years in the cave with his visits to the house those oases of life and warmth in the desert of solitude here it was the reverse going from the crowded cold squalor of the cells up to the majors glowing suite able for a few hours to stretch both mind and body to relax in warmth and conversation and the abundance of food it gave him the same odd sense of dislocation though that sense of losing some valuable part of himself that could not survive the passage back to daily life each time the passage became more difficult he stood in the drafty passageway waiting for the turnkey to unlock the cell door the sounds of sleeping men buzzed in his ears and the smell of them wafted out as the door opened pungent as a fart he filled his lungs with a quick deep breath and ducked his head to enter there was a stir among the bodies on the floor as he stepped into the room his shadow falling black across the prone and bundled shapes the door swung closed behind him leaving the cell in darkness but there was a ripple of awareness through the room as men stirred awake to his coming youre back late mac dubh said murdo lindsay voice rusty with sleep yell be sair tuckered tomorrow ill manage murdo he whispered stepping over bodies he pulled off his coat and laid it carefully over the bench then took up the rough blanket and sought his space on the floor his long shadow flickering across the moonbarred window ronnie sinclair turned over as mac dubh lay down beside him he blinked sleepily sandy lashes nearly invisible in the moonlight did wee goldie feed ye decent mac dubh he did ronnie thank ye he shifted on the stones seeking a comfortable position yell tell us about it tomorrow the prisoners took an odd pleasure in hearing what he had been served for dinner taking it as an honor that their chief should be well fed aye i will ronnie mac dubh promised but i must sleep now aye sleep well mac dubh came a whisper from the corner where hayes was rolled up curled like a set of teaspoons with macleod innes and keith who all liked to sleep warm sweet dreams gavin mac dubh whispered back and little by little the cell settled back into silence he dreamed of claire that night she lay in his arms heavylimbed and fragrant she was with child her belly round and smooth as a muskmelon her breasts rich and full the nipples dark as wine urging him to taste them her hand cupped itself between his legs and he reached to return the favor the small fat softness of her filling his hand pressing against him as she moved she rose over him smiling her hair falling down around her face and threw her leg across him give me your mouth he whispered not knowing whether he meant to kiss her or to have her take him between her lips only knowing he must have her somehow give me yours she said she laughed and leaned down to him hands on his shoulders her hair brushing his face with the scent of moss and sunlight and he felt the prickle of dry leaves against his back and knew they lay in the glen near lallybroch and her the color of the copper beeches all around beech leaves and beechwood gold eyes and a smooth white skin skimmed with shadows then her breast pressed against his mouth and he took it eagerly drawing her body tight against him as he suckled her her milk was hot and sweet with a faint taste of silver like a deers blood harder she whispered to him and put her hand behind his head gripping the back of his neck pressing him to her harder she lay at her length upon him his hands holding for dear life to the sweet flesh of her buttocks feeling the small solid weight of the child upon his own belly as though they shared it now protecting the small round thing between their bodies he flung his arms about her tight and she held him tight as he jerked and shuddered her hair in his face her hands in his hair and the child between them not knowing where any of the three of them began or ended he came awake suddenly panting and sweating halfcurled on his side beneath one of the benches in the cell it was not yet quite light but he could see the shapes of the men who lay near him and hoped he had not cried out he closed his eyes at once but the dream was gone he lay quite still his heart slowing and waited for the dawn june john grey had dressed carefully this evening with fresh linen and silk stockings he wore his own hair simply plaited rinsed with a tonic of lemonverbena he had hesitated for a moment over hectors ring but at last had put it on too the dinner had been good a pheasant he had shot himself and a salad of greens in deference to frasers odd tastes for such things now they sat over the chessboard lighter topics of conversation set aside in the concentration of the midgame will you have sherry he set down his bishop and leaned back stretching fraser nodded absorbed in the new position i thank ye grey rose and crossed the room leaving fraser by the fire he reached into the cupboard for the bottle and felt a thin trickle of sweat run down his ribs as he did so not from the fire simmering across the room from sheer nervousness he brought the bottle back to the table holding the goblets in his other hand the waterford crystal his mother had sent the liquid purled into the glasses shimmering amber and rose in the firelight frasers eyes were fixed on the cup watching the rising sherry but with an abstraction that showed he was deep in his thoughts the dark blue eyes were hooded grey wondered what he was thinking not about the gamethe outcome of that was certain grey reached out and moved his queens bishop it was no more than a delaying move he knew still it put frasers queen in danger and might force the exchange of a rook grey got up to put a brick of peat on the fire rising he stretched himself and strolled behind his opponent to view the situation from this angle the firelight shimmered as the big scot leaned forward to study the board picking up the deep red tones of james frasers hair echoing the glow of the light in the crystalline sherry fraser had bound his hair back with a thin black cord tied in a bow it would take no more than a slight tug to loosen it john grey could imagine running his hand up under that thick glossy mass to touch the smooth warm nape beneath to touch his palm closed abruptly imagining sensation it is your move major the soft scots voice brought him to himself again and he took his seat viewing the chessboard through sightless eyes without really looking he was intensely aware of the others movements his presence there was a disturbance of the air around fraser it was impossible not to look at him to cover his glance he picked up his sherry glass and sipped barely noticing the liquid gold taste of it fraser sat still as a statue of cinnabar only the deep blue eyes alive in his face as he studied the board the fire had burned down and the lines of his body were limned with shadow his hand all gold and black with the light of the fire on it rested on the table still and exquisite as the captured pawn beside it the blue stone in john greys ring glinted as he reached for his queens bishop is it wrong hector he thought that i should love a man who might have killed you or was it a way at last to put things right to heal the wounds of culloden for them both the bishop made a soft thump as he set the felted base down with precision without stopping his hand rose as though it moved without his volition the hand traveled the short distance through the air looking as though it knew precisely what it wanted and set itself on frasers palm tingling curved fingers gently imploring the hand under his was warmso warmbut hard and motionless as marble nothing moved on the table but the shimmer of the flame in the heart of the sherry he lifted his eyes then to meet frasers take your hand off me fraser said very very softly or i will kill you the hand under greys did not move nor did the face above but he could feel the shiver of revulsion a spasm of hatred and disgust that rose from the mans core radiating through his flesh quite suddenly he heard once more the memory of quarrys warning as clearly as though the man spoke in his ear this moment if you dine with him alonedont turn your back on him there was no chance of that he could not turn away could not even look away or blink to break the dark blue gaze that held him frozen moving as slowly as though he stood atop an unexploded mine he drew back his hand there was a moments silence broken only by the rains patter and the hissing of the peat fire when neither of them seemed to breathe then fraser rose without a sound and left the room sacrifice the rain of late november pattered down on the stones of the courtyard and on the sullen rows of men standing huddled under the downpour the redcoats who stood on guard over them didnt look much happier than the sodden prisoners major grey stood under the overhang of the roof waiting it wasnt the best weather for conducting a search and cleaning of the prisoners cells but at this time of year it was futile to wait for good weather and with more than two hundred prisoners in ardsmuir it was necessary to swab the cells at least monthly in order to prevent major outbreaks of illness the doors to the main cell block swung back and a small file of prisoners emerged the trustys who did the actual cleaning closely watched by the guards at the end of the line corporal dunstable came out his hands full of the small bits of contraband a search of this sort usually turned up the usual rubbish sir he reported dumping the collection of pitiful relics and anonymous junk onto the top of a cask that stood near the majors elbow just this you might take notice of this was a small strip of cloth perhaps six inches by four in a green tartan check dunstable glanced quickly at the lines of standing prisoners as if intending to catch someone in a telltale action grey sighed then straightened his shoulders yes i suppose so the possession of any scottish tartan was strictly forbidden by the diskilting act that had likewise disarmed the highlanders and prevented the wearing of their native dress he stepped in front of the rows of men as corporal dunstable gave a sharp shout to attract their attention whose is this the corporal raised the scrap high and raised his voice as well grey glanced from the scrap of bright cloth to the row of prisoners mentally ticking off the names trying to match them to his imperfect knowledge of tartans even within a single clan the patterns varied so wildly that a given pattern couldnt be assigned with any certainty but there were general patterns of color and design macalester hayes innes graham macmurtry mackenzie macdonaldstop mackenzie that one it was more an officers knowledge of men than any identification of the plaid with a particular clan that made him sure mackenzie was a young prisoner and his face was a shade too controlled too expressionless its yours mackenzie isnt it grey demanded he snatched the scrap of cloth from the corporal and thrust it under the young mans nose the prisoner was whitefaced under the blotches of dirt his jaw was clamped hard and he was breathing hard through his nose with a faint whistling sound grey fixed the young man with a hard triumphant stare the young scot had that core of implacable hate that they all had but he hadnt managed to build the wall of stoic indifference that held it in grey could feel the fear building in the lad another second and he would break its mine the voice was calm almost bored and spoke with such flat indifference that neither mackenzie nor grey registered it at once they stood locked in each others eyes until a large hand reached over angus mackenzies shoulder and gently plucked the scrap of cloth from the officers hand john grey stepped back feeling the words like a blow in the pit of his stomach mackenzie forgotten he lifted his eyes the several inches necessary to look jamie fraser in the face it isnt a fraser tartan he said feeling the words force their way past wooden lips his whole face felt numb a fact for which he was dimly grateful at least his expression couldnt betray him before the ranks of the watching prisoners frasers mouth widened slightly grey kept his gaze fastened on it afraid to meet the dark blue eyes above no it isnt fraser agreed its mackenzie my mothers clan in some faroff corner of his mind grey stored away another tiny scrap of information with the small hoard of facts kept in the jeweled coffer labeled jamiehis mother was a mackenzie he knew that was true just as he knew that the tartan didnt belong to fraser he heard his voice cool and steady saying possession of clan tartans is illegal you know the penalty of course the wide mouth curled in a onesided smile i do there was a shifting and a muttering among the ranks of the prisoners there was little actual movement but grey could feel the alignment changing as though they were in fact drawing toward fraser circling him embracing him the circle had broken and reformed and he was alone outside it jamie fraser had gone back to his own with an effort of will grey forced his gaze away from the soft smooth lips slightly chapped from exposure to sun and wind the look in the eyes above them was what he had been afraid of neither fear nor angerbut indifference he motioned to a guard take him major john william grey bent his head over the work on his desk signing requisitions without reading them he seldom worked so late at night but there had not been time during the day and the paperwork was piling up the requisitions must be sent to london this week two hundred pound wheat flowr he wrote trying to concentrate on the neatness of the black squiggles under his quill the trouble with such routine paperwork was that it occupied his attention but not his mind allowing memories of the day to creep in unawares six hogsheds ale for use of barracks he set down the quill and rubbed his hands briskly together he could still feel the chill that had settled in his bones in the courtyard that morning there was a hot fire but it didnt seem to be helping he didnt go nearer he had tried that once and stood mesmerized seeing the images of the afternoon in the flames roused only when the cloth of his breeches began to scorch he picked up the quill and tried again to banish the sights of the courtyard from his mind it was better not to delay execution of sentences of this kind the prisoners became restless and nervy in anticipation and there was considerable difficulty in controlling them executed at once though such discipline often had a salutary effect showing the prisoners that retribution would be swift and dire enhancing their respect for those who held their guardianship somehow john grey suspected that this particular occasion had not much enhanced his prisoners respectfor him at least feeling little more than the trickle of ice water through his veins he had given his orders swift and composed and they had been obeyed with equal competence the prisoners had been drawn up in ranks around the four sides of the courtyard square with shorter lines of guards arranged facing them bayonets fixed to the ready to prevent any unseemly outbreak but there had been no outbreak seemly or otherwise the prisoners had waited in a chill silence in the light rain that misted the stones of the courtyard with little sound other than the normal coughs and throatclearings of any assemblage of men it was the beginning of winter and catarrh was almost as common a scourge in the barracks as it was in the damp cells he had stood watching impassively hands folded behind his back as the prisoner was led to the platform watched feeling the rain seep into the shoulders of his coat and run in tiny rivulets down the neck of his shirt as jamie fraser stood on the platform a yard away and stripped to the waist moving without haste or hesitation as though this were something he had done before an accustomed task of no importance in itself he had nodded to the two privates who seized the prisoners unresisting hands and raised them binding them to the arms of the whipping post they gagged him and fraser stood upright the rain running down his raised arms and down the deep seam of his backbone to soak the thin cloth of his breeches another nod to the sergeant who held the charge sheet and a small surge of annoyance as the gesture caused a cascade of collected rain from one side of his hat he straightened his hat and sodden wig and resumed his stance of authority in time to hear the charge and sentence read in contravention of the diskilting act passed by his majestys parliament for which crime the sentence of sixty lashes shall be inflicted grey glanced with professional detachment at the sergeantfarrier designated to give the punishment this was not the first time for any of them he didnt nod this time the rain was still falling a halfclosing of the eyes instead as he spoke the usual words mr fraser you will take your punishment and he stood eyes front and steady watching and hearing the thud of the landing flails and the grunt of the prisoners breath forced past the gag by the blow the mans muscles tightened in resistance to the pain again and again until each separate muscle stood hard under the skin his own muscles ached with tension and he shifted inconspicuously from one leg to another as the brutal tedium continued thin streams of red ran down the prisoners spine blood mixed with water staining the cloth of his breeches grey could feel the men behind him soldiers and prisoners both all eyes fixed on the platform and its central figure even the coughing was silenced and over it all like a sticky coat of varnish sealing off greys feelings was a thin layer of selfdisgust as he realized that his eyes were fixed on the scene not out of duty but from sheer inability to look away from the sheen of mingled rain and blood that gleamed on muscle tightened in anguish to a curve of wrenching beauty the sergeantfarrier paused only briefly between blows he was hurrying it slightly everyone wanted to get it over and get out of the rain grissom counted each stroke in a loud voice noting it on his sheet as he did so the farrier checked the lash running the strands with their hardwaxed knots between his fingers to free them of blood and bits of flesh then raised the cat once more swung it slowly twice round his head and struck again thirty said the sergeant major grey pulled out the lowest drawer of his desk and was neatly sick all over a stack of requisitions his fingers were dug hard into his palms but the shaking wouldnt stop it was deep in his bones like the winter cold put a blanket over him ill tend him in a moment the english surgeons voice seemed to come from a long way off he felt no connection between the voice and the hands that gripped him firmly by both arms he cried out as they shifted him the torsion splitting the barely clotted wounds on his back the trickle of warm blood across his ribs made the shaking worse despite the rough blanket they laid over his shoulders he gripped the edges of the bench on which he lay cheek pressed against the wood eyes closed struggling against the shaking there was a stir and a shuffle somewhere in the room but he couldnt take notice couldnt take his attention from the clenching of his teeth and the tightness of his joints the door closed and the room grew quiet had they left him alone no there were footsteps near his head and the blanket over him lifted folded back to his waist mm made a mess of you didnt he boy he didnt answer no answer seemed expected in any case the surgeon turned away for a moment then he felt a hand beneath his cheek lifting his head a towel slid beneath his face cushioning it from the rough wood im going to cleanse the wounds now the voice said it was impersonal but not unfriendly he drew in his breath through his teeth as a hand touched his back there was an odd whimpering noise he realized he had made it and was ashamed how old are you boy nineteen he barely got the word out before biting down hard on a moan the doctor touched his back gently here and there then stood up he heard the sound of the bolt being shot to then the doctors steps returning no one will come in now the voice said kindly go ahead and cry hey the voice was saying wake up man he came slowly to consciousness the roughness of wood beneath his cheek brought dream and waking together for a moment and he couldnt remember where he was a hand came out of the darkness touching him tentatively on the cheek ye were greetin in your sleep man the voice whispered does it pain ye much a bit he realized the other link between dreaming and waking as he tried to raise himself and the pain crackled over his back like sheet lightning he let out his breath in an involuntary grunt and dropped back on the bench he had been lucky he had drawn dawes a stout middleaged soldier who didnt really like flogging prisoners and did it only because it was part of his job still sixty lashes did damage even if applied without enthusiasm nah then thats too hot by half want to scald him do ye it was morrisons voice scolding it would be morrison of course odd he thought dimly how whenever you had a group of men they seemed to find their proper jobs no matter whether it was a thing theyd done before morrison had been a cottar like most of them likely a good hand with his beasts but not thinking much about it now he was the natural healer for the men the one they turned to with a griping belly or a broken thumb morrison knew little more than the rest but the men turned to him when they were hurt as they turned to seumus mac dubh for reassurance and direction and for justice the steaming cloth was laid across his back and he grunted with the sting of it pressing his lips tight to keep from crying out he could feel the shape of morrisons small hand lightly laid in the center of his back bide ye mantil the heat passes as the nightmare faded he blinked for a moment adjusting himself to the nearby voices and the perception of company he was in the large cell in the shadowy nook by the chimney breast steam rose from the fire there must be a cauldron boiling he saw walter macleod lower a fresh armful of rags into its depths the fire touching macleods dark beard and brows with red then as the heated rags on his back cooled to a soothing warmth he closed his eyes and sank back into a halfdoze lulled by the soft conversation of the men nearby it was familiar this state of dreamy detachment he had felt much the same ever since the moment when he had reached over young anguss shoulder and closed his fist on the scrap of tartan cloth as though with that choice some curtain had come down between him and the men around him as though he were alone in some quiet place of infinite remoteness he had followed the guard who took him stripped himself when told but all without feeling as though he had truly waked taken his place on the platform and heard the words of crime and sentence pronounced without really listening not even the rough bite of the rope on his wrists or the cold rain on his naked back had roused him these seemed all things that had happened before nothing he said or did could change a thing it was all fated as for the flogging he had borne it there was no room then for thought or regret or for anything beyond the stubborn desperate struggle such bodily insult required still now still morrisons hand rested on his neck to prevent his moving as the sodden rags were taken off and a fresh hot poultice applied momentarily rousing all the dormant nerves to fresh startlement one consequence of his odd state of mind was that all sensations seemed of equal intensity he could if he tried feel each separate stripe across his back see each one in his minds eye as a vivid streak of color across the dark of imagination but the pain of the gash that ran from ribs to shoulder was of no more weight or consequence than the almost pleasant feeling of heaviness in his legs the soreness in his arms or the soft tickling brush of his hair across his cheek his pulse beat slow and regular in his ears the sigh of his breath was a thing apart from the heave of his chest as he breathed he existed only as a collection of fragments each small piece with its own sensations and none of them of any particular concern to the central intelligence here mac dubh said morrisons voice next to his ear lift your head and drink this the sharp scent of whisky struck him and he tried to turn his head away i dont need it he said that ye do morrison said with that firm matteroffactness that all healers seemed to have as though they always knew better than you did what you felt like or what you required lacking strength or will to argue he opened his mouth and sipped the whisky feeling his neck muscles quiver under the strain of holding his head up the whisky added its own bit to the chorus of sensations that filled him a burn in throat and belly sharp tingle up the back of the nose and a sort of whirling in his head that told him he had drunk too much too fast a bit more now aye thats it morrison said coaxing good lad aye thatll be better wont it morrisons thick body moved so his vision of the darkened room was obscured a draft blew from the high window but there seemed more stir about him than was accounted for by the wind now hows the back yell be stiff as a cornstook by the morrow but i think its maybe no so bad as it might be here man yell have a sup more the rim of the horn cup pressed insistently against his mouth morrison was still talking rather loudly of nothing in particular there was something wrong about that morrison was not a talkative man something was happening but he couldnt see he lifted his head searching for what was wrong but morrison pressed it down again dinna trouble yourself mac dubh he said softly ye canna stop it anyway surreptitious sounds were coming from the far corner of the cell the sounds morrison had tried to keep him from hearing scraping noises brief mutters a thud then the muffled sound of blows slow and regular and a heavy gasping of fright and pain punctuated with a small whimpering sound of indrawn breath they were beating young angus mackenzie he braced his hands beneath his chest but the effort made his back blaze and his head swim morrisons hand was back forcing him down be still mac dubh he said his tone was a mixture of authority and resignation a wave of dizziness washed through him and his hands slipped off the bench morrison was right in any case he realized he couldnt stop them he lay still then under morrisons hand eyes closed and waited for the sounds to stop despite himself he wondered who it was that administrator of blind justice in the dark sinclair his mind supplied the answer without hesitation and hayes and lindsay helping no doubt they could no more help themselves than he could or morrison men did as they were born to one man a healer another a bully the sounds had stopped except for a muffled sobbing gasp his shoulders relaxed and he didnt move as morrison took away the last wet poultice and gently blotted him dry the draft from the window making him shiver in sudden chill he pressed his lips tight to make no noise they had gagged him this afternoon and he was glad of it the first time he had been flogged years ago he had bitten his lower lip nearly in two the cup of whisky pressed against his mouth but he turned his head aside and it disappeared without comment to some place where it would find a more cordial reception milligan likely the irishman one man with the weakness for drink another with a hatred of it one man a lover of women and another he sighed and shifted slightly on the hard plank bed morrison had covered him with a blanket and gone away he felt drained and empty still in fragments but with his mind quite clear perched at some far remove from the rest of him morrison had taken away the candle as well it burned at the far end of the cell where the men sat hunched companionably together the light making black shapes of them one indistinguishable from another rimmed in gold light like the pictures of faceless saints in old missals he wondered where they came from these gifts that shaped a mans nature from god was it like the descent of the paraclete and the tongues of fire that came to rest on the apostles he remembered the picture in the bible in his mothers parlor the apostles all crowned with fire and looking fair daft with the shock of it standing about like a crowd of beeswax candles lit for a party he smiled to himself at the memory and closed his eyes the candle shadows wavered red on his lids claire his own clairewho knew what had sent her to him had thrust her into a life she had surely not been born to and yet she had known what to do what she was meant to be despite that not everyone was so fortunate as to know their gift there was a cautious shuffling in the darkness beside him he opened his eyes and saw no more than a shape but knew nonetheless who it was how are ye angus he said softly in gaelic the youngster knelt awkwardly by him and took his hand i amall right but yousir i meaniim sorry was it experience or instinct that made him tighten his own hand in reassurance i am all right too he said lay ye down wee angus and take your rest the shape bent its head in an oddly formal gesture and pressed a kiss on the back of his hand imay i stay by ye sir his hand weighed a ton but he lifted it nonetheless and laid it on the young mans head then it slipped away but he felt anguss tension relax as the comfort flowed from his touch he had been born a leader then bent and shaped further to fit such a destiny but what of a man who had not been born to the role he was required to fill john grey for one charles stuart for another for the first time in ten years from this strange distance he could find it in himself to forgive that feeble man who had once been his friend having so often paid the price exacted by his own gift he could at last see the more terrible doom of having been born a king without the gift of kingship angus mackenzie sat slumped against the wall next to him head bowed upon his knees his blanket over his shoulders a small gurgling snore came from the huddled form he could feel sleep coming for him fitting back the shattered scattered parts of himself as it came and knew he would wake wholeif very sorein the morning he felt relieved at once of many things of the weight of immediate responsibility of the necessity for decision temptation was gone along with the possibility of it more important the burden of anger had lifted perhaps it was gone for good so he thought through the gathering fog john grey had given him back his destiny almost he could be grateful midgame inverness june it was roger who found her in the morning curled up on the study sofa under the hearthrug papers scattered carelessly over the floor where they had spilled from one of the folders the light from the floorlength windows streamed in flooding the study but the high back of the sofa had shaded claires face and prevented the dawn from waking her the light was just now pouring over the curve of dusty velvet to flicker among the strands of her hair a glass face in more ways than one roger thought looking at her her skin was so fair that the blue veins showed through at temple and throat and the sharp clear bones were so close beneath that she might have been carved of ivory the rug had slipped half off exposing her shoulders one arm lay relaxed across her chest trapping a single crumpled sheet of paper against her body roger lifted her arm carefully to pull the paper loose without waking her she was limp with sleep her flesh surprisingly warm and smooth in his grasp his eyes found the name at once he had known she must have found it james mackenzie fraser he murmured he looked up from the paper to the sleeping woman on the sofa the light had just touched the curve of her ear she stirred briefly and turned her head then her face lapsed back into somnolence i dont know who you were mate he whispered to the unseen scot but you must have been something to deserve her very gently he replaced the rug over claires shoulders and lowered the blind of the window behind her then he squatted and gathered up the scattered papers from the ardsmuir folder ardsmuir that was all he needed for now even if jamie frasers eventual fate was not recorded in the pages in his hands it would be somewhere in the history of ardsmuir prison it might take another foray into the highland archives or even a trip to london but the next step in the link had been forged the path was clear brianna was coming down the stairs as he pulled the door of the study closed moving with exaggerated caution she arched a brow in question and he lifted the folder smiling got him he whispered she didnt speak but an answering smile spread across her face bright as the rising sun outside part four the lake district geneva helwater september i think grey said carefully that you might consider changing your name he didnt expect an answer in four days of travel fraser had not spoken a single word to him managing even the awkward business of sharing an inn room without direct communication grey had shrugged and taken the bed while fraser without gesture or glance had wrapped himself in his threadbare cloak and lain down before the hearth scratching an assortment of bites from fleas and bedbugs grey thought that fraser might well have had the better end of the sleeping arrangements your new host is not well disposed toward charles stuart and his adherents having lost his only son at prestonpans he went on addressing the ironset profile visible next to him gordon dunsany had been only a few years older than himself a young captain in boltons regiment they might easily have died together on that fieldif not for that meeting in the wood near carryarrick you can scarcely hope to conceal the fact that you are a scot and a highlander at that if you will condescend to consider a piece of wellmeant advice it might be judicious not to use a name which would be as easily recognized as your own frasers stony expression didnt alter in the slightest particular he nudged his horse with a heel and guided it ahead of greys bay seeking the remains of the track washed out by a recent flood it was late afternoon when they crossed the arch of ashness bridge and started down the slope toward watendlath tarn the lake district of england was nothing like scotland grey reflected but at least there were mountains here roundflanked fat and dreamy mountains not sternly forbidding like the highland crags but mountains nonetheless watendlath tarn was dark and ruffled in the early autumn wind its edges thick with sedge and marsh grass the summer rains had been more generous even than usual in this damp place and the tips of drowned shrubs poked limp and tattered above water that had run over its banks at the crest of the next hill the track split going off in two directions fraser some distance ahead pulled his horse to a stop and waited for direction the wind ruffling his hair he had not plaited it that morning and it blew free the flaming strands lifting wild about his head squelching his way up the slope john william grey looked up at the man above him still as a bronze statue on his mount save for that rippling mane the breath dried in his throat and he licked his lips o lucifer thou son of the morning he murmured to himself but forbore to add the rest of the quotation for jamie the fourday ride to helwater had been torture the sudden illusion of freedom combined with the certainty of its immediate loss gave him a dreadful anticipation of his unknown destination this with the anger and sorrow of his parting from his men fresh in memorythe wrenching loss of leaving the highlands with the knowledge that the parting might well be permanentand his waking moments suffused with the physical pain of longunused saddle muscles were together enough to have kept him in torment for the whole of the journey only the fact that he had given his parole kept him from pulling major john william grey off his horse and throttling him in some peaceful lane greys words echoed in his ears halfobliterated by the thrumming beat of his angry blood as the renovation of the fortress has largely been completedwith the able assistance of yourself and your mengrey had allowed a tinge of irony to show in his voicethe prisoners are to be removed to other accommodation and the fortress of ardsmuir garrisoned by troops of his majestys twelfth dragoons the scottish prisoners of war are to be transported to the american colonies he continued they will be sold under bond of indenture for a term of seven years jamie had kept himself carefully expressionless but at that news had felt his face and hands go numb with shock indenture that is no better than slavery he said but did not pay much attention to his own words america a land of wilderness and savagesand one to be reached across three thousand miles of empty roiling sea indenture in america was a sentence tantamount to permanent exile from scotland a term of indenture is not slavery grey had assured him but the major knew as well as he that the difference was merely a legality and true only insofar as indentured servants wouldif they survivedregain their freedom upon some predetermined date an indentured servant was to most other intents and purposes the slave of his or her masterto be misused whipped or branded at will forbidden by law to leave the masters premises without permission as james fraser was now to be forbidden you are not to be sent with the others grey had not looked at him while speaking you are not merely a prisoner of war you are a convicted traitor as such you are imprisoned at the pleasure of his majesty your sentence cannot be commuted to transportation without royal approval and his majesty has not seen fit to give that approval jamie was conscious of a remarkable array of emotions beneath his immediate rage was fear and sorrow for the fate of his men mingled with a small flicker of ignominious relief that whatever his own fate was to be it would not involve entrusting himself to the sea shamed by the realization he turned a cold eye on grey the gold he said flatly thats it aye so long as there remained the slightest chance of his revealing what he knew about that halfmythical hoard the english crown would take no chance of having him lost to the sea demons or the savages of the colonies the major still would not look at him but gave a small shrug as good as assent where am i to go then his own voice had sounded rusty to his ears slightly hoarse as he began to recover from the shock of the news grey had busied himself putting away his records it was early september and a warm breeze blew through the halfopen window fluttering the papers its called helwater in the lake district of england you will be quartered with lord dunsany to serve in whatever menial capacity he may require grey did look up then the expression in his light blue eyes unreadable i shall visit you there once each quarterto ensure your welfare he eyed the majors redcoated back now as they rode singlefile through the narrow lanes seeking refuge from his miseries in a satisfying vision of those wide blue eyes bloodshot and popping in amazement as jamies hands tightened on that slender throat thumbs digging into the sunreddened flesh until the majors small muscular body should go limp as a killed rabbit in his grasp his majestys pleasure was it he was not deceived this had been greys doing the gold only an excuse he was to be sold as a servant and kept in a place where grey could see it and gloat this was the majors revenge he had lain before the inn hearth each night aching in every limb acutely aware of every twitch and rustle and breath of the man in the bed behind him and deeply resentful of that awareness by the pale gray of dawn he was keyed to fury once more longing for the man to rise from his bed and make some disgraceful gesture toward him so that he might release his fury in the passion of murder but grey had only snored over helvellyn bridge and past another of the strange grassy tarns the red and yellow leaves of maple and larch whirling down in showers past the lightly sweated quarters of his horse striking his face and sliding past him with a papery whispering caress grey had stopped just ahead and turned in the saddle waiting they had arrived then the land sloped steeply down into a valley where the manor house lay halfconcealed in a welter of autumnbright trees helwater lay before him and with it the prospect of a life of shameful servitude he stiffened his back and kicked his horse harder than he intended grey was received in the main drawing room lord dunsany being cordially dismissive of his disheveled clothes and filthy boots and lady dunsany a small round woman with faded fair hair fulsomely hospitable a drink johnny you must have a drink and louisa my dear perhaps you should fetch the girls down to greet our guest as lady dunsany turned to give orders to a footman his lordship leaned close over the glass to murmur to him the scottish prisoneryouve brought him with you yes grey said lady dunsany now in animated conversation with the butler about the altered dispositions for dinner was unlikely to overhear but he thought it best to keep his own voice low i left him in the front halli wasnt sure quite what you meant to do with him you said the fellows good with horses eh best make him a groom then as you suggested lord dunsany glanced at his wife and carefully turned so that his lean back was to her further guarding their conversation i havent told louisa who he is the baronet muttered all that scare about the highlanders during the risingcountry was quite paralyzed with fear you know and shes never got over gordons death i quite see grey patted the old mans arm reassuringly he didnt think dunsany himself had got over the death of his son though he had rallied himself gamely for the sake of his wife and daughters ill just tell her the mans a servant youve recommended to me erhes safe of course i meanwell the girls lord dunsany cast an uneasy eye toward his wife quite safe grey assured his host hes an honorable man and hes given his parole hell neither enter the house nor leave the boundaries of your property save with your express permission helwater covered more than six hundred acres he knew it was a long way from freedom and from scotland as well but perhaps something better either than the narrow stones of ardsmuir or the distant hardships of the colonies a sound from the doorway swung dunsany around restored to beaming joviality by the appearance of his two daughters youll remember geneva johnny he asked urging his guest forward isobel was still in the nursery last time you camehow time does fly does it not and he shook his head in mild dismay isobel was fourteen small and round and bubbly and blond like her mother grey didnt in fact remember genevaor rather he did but the scrawny schoolgirl of years past bore little resemblance to the graceful seventeenyearold who now offered him her hand if isobel resembled their mother geneva rather took after her father at least in the matter of height and leanness lord dunsanys grizzled hair might once have been that shining chestnut and the girl had dunsanys clear gray eyes the girls greeted the visitor with politeness but were clearly more interested in something else daddy said isobel tugging on her fathers sleeve theres a huge man in the hall he watched us all the time we were coming down the stairs hes scarylooking who is he daddy geneva asked she was more reserved than her sister but clearly also interested erwhy that must be the new groom johns brought us lord dunsany said obviously flustered ill have one of the footmen take him the baronet was interrupted by the sudden appearance of a footman in the doorway sir he said looking shocked at the news he bore there is a scotchman in the hall lest this outrageous statement not be believed he turned and gestured widely at the tall silent figure standing cloaked behind him at this cue the stranger took a step forward and spotting lord dunsany politely inclined his head my name is alex mackenzie he said in a soft highland accent he bowed toward lord dunsany with no hint of mockery in his manner your servant my lord for one accustomed to the strenuous life of a highland farm or a labor prison the work of a groom on a lake district stud farm was no great strain for a man who had been mewed up in a cell for two monthssince the others had left for the coloniesit was the hell of a sweat for the first week while his muscles reaccustomed themselves to the sudden demands of constant movement jamie fraser fell into his hayloft pallet each evening too tired even to dream he had arrived at helwater in such a state of exhaustion and mental turmoil that he had at first seen it only as another prisonand one among strangers far away from the highlands now that he was ensconced here imprisoned as securely by his word as by bars he found both body and mind growing easier as the days passed by his body toughened his feelings calmed in the quiet company of horses and gradually he found it possible to think rationally again if he had no true freedom he did at least have air and light space to stretch his limbs and the sight of mountains and the lovely horses that dunsany bred the other grooms and servants were understandably suspicious of him but inclined to leave him alone out of respect for his size and forbidding countenance it was a lonely lifebut he had long since accepted the fact that for him life was unlikely ever to be otherwise the soft snows came down upon helwater and even major greys official visit at christmasa tense awkward occasionpassed without disturbing his growing feelings of content very quietly he made such arrangements as could be managed to communicate with jenny and ian in the highlands aside from the infrequent letters that reached him by indirect means which he read and then destroyed for safetys sake his only reminder of home was the beechwood rosary he wore about his neck concealed beneath his shirt a dozen times a day he touched the small cross that lay over his heart conjuring each time the face of a loved one with a brief word of prayerfor his sister jenny for ian and the childrenhis namesake young jamie maggie and katherine mary for the twins michael and janet and for baby ian for the tenants of lallybroch the men of ardsmuir and always the first prayer at morning the last at nightand many betweenfor claire lord that she may be safe she and the child as the snow passed and the year brightened into spring jamie fraser was aware of only one fly in the ointment of his daily existencethe presence of the lady geneva dunsany pretty spoilt and autocratic the lady geneva was accustomed to get what she wanted when she wanted it and damn the convenience of anyone standing in her way she was a good horsewomanjamie would give her thatbut so sharptongued and whimridden that the grooms were given to drawing straws to determine who would have the misfortune of accompanying her on her daily ride of late though the lady geneva had been making her own choice of companionalex mackenzie nonsense she said when he pleaded first discretion and then temporary indisposition to avoid accompanying her into the secluded mist of the foothills above helwater a place she was forbidden to ride because of the treacherous footing and dangerous fogs dont be silly nobodys going to see us come on and kicking her mare brutally in the ribs was off before he could stop her laughing back over her shoulder at him her infatuation with him was sufficiently obvious as to make the other grooms grin sidelong and make lowvoiced remarks to each other when she entered the stable he had a strong urge when in her company to boot her swiftly where it would do most good but so far had settled for maintaining a strict silence when in her company replying to all overtures with a mumpish grunt he trusted that she would get tired of this taciturn treatment sooner or later and transfer her annoying attentions to another of the grooms orpray godshe would soon be married and well away from both helwater and him it was a rare sunny day for the lake country where the difference between the clouds and the ground is often imperceptible in terms of damp still on this may afternoon it was warm warm enough for jamie to have found it comfortable to remove his shirt it was safe enough up here in the high field with no likelihood of company beyond bess and blossom the two stolid drayhorses pulling the roller it was a big field and the horses old and welltrained to the task which they liked all he need do was twitch the reins occasionally to keep their noses heading straight the roller was made of wood rather than the older kind of stone or metal and constructed with a narrow slit between each board so that the interior could be filled with wellrotted manure which dribbled out in a steady stream as the roller turned lightening the heavy contrivance as it drained jamie thoroughly approved this innovation he must tell ian about it draw a diagram the gypsies would be coming soon the kitchenmaids and grooms were all talking of it he would maybe have time to add another installment to the ongoing letter he kept sending the current crop of pages whenever a band of roving tinkers or gypsies came onto the farm delivery might be delayed for a month or three or six but eventually the packet would make its way into the highlands passed from hand to hand and on to his sister at lallybroch who would pay a generous fee for its reception replies from lallybroch came by the same anonymous routefor as a prisoner of the crown anything he sent or received by the mails must be inspected by lord dunsany he felt a moments excitement at the thought of a letter but tried to damp it down there might be nothing gee he shouted more as a matter of form than anything bess and blossom could see the approaching stone fence as well as he could and were perfectly well aware that this was the spot to begin the ponderous turnabout bess waggled one ear and snorted and he grinned aye i know he said to her with a light twitch of the rein but they pay me to say it then they were settled in the new track and there was nothing more to do until they reached the wagon standing at the foot of the field piled high with manure for refilling the roller the sun was on his face now and he closed his eyes reveling in the feel of warmth on his bare chest and shoulders the sound of a horses high whinny stirred him from somnolence a quarterhour later opening his eyes he could see the rider coming up the lane from the lower paddock neatly framed between blossoms ears hastily he sat up and pulled the shirt back over his head you neednt be modest on my account mackenzie geneva dunsanys voice was high and slightly breathless as she pulled her mare to a walk beside the moving roller mmphm she was dressed in her best habit he saw with a cairngorm brooch at her throat and her color was higher than the temperature of the day warranted what are you doing she asked after they had rolled and paced in silence for some moments i am spreading shit my lady he answered precisely not looking at her oh she rode on for the space of half a track before venturing further into conversation did you know i am to be married he did all the servants had known it for a month richards the butler having been in the library serving when the solicitor came from derwentwater to draw up the wedding contract the lady geneva had been informed two days ago according to her maid betty the news had not been well received he contented himself with a noncommittal grunt to ellesmere she said the color rose higher in her cheeks and her lips pressed together i wish ye every happiness my lady jamie pulled briefly on the reins as they came to the end of the field he was out of the seat before bess had set her hooves he had no wish at all to linger in conversation with the lady geneva whose mood seemed thoroughly dangerous happiness she cried her big gray eyes flashed and she slapped the thigh of her habit happiness married to a man old enough to be my own grandsire jamie refrained from saying that he suspected the earl of ellesmeres prospects for happiness were somewhat more limited than her own instead he murmured your pardon my lady and went behind to unfasten the roller she dismounted and followed him its a filthy bargain between my father and ellesmere hes selling me thats what it is my father cares not the slightest trifle for me or hed never have made such a match do you not think i am badly used on the contrary jamie thought that lord dunsany a most devoted father had probably made the best match possible for his spoilt elder daughter the earl of ellesmere was an old man there was every prospect that within a few years geneva would be left as an extremely wealthy young widow and a countess to boot on the other hand such considerations might well not weigh heavily with a headstrong missa stubborn spoilt bitch he corrected seeing the petulant set of her mouth and eyesof seventeen i am sure your father acts always in your best interests my lady he answered woodenly would the little fiend not go away she wouldnt assuming a more winsome expression she came and stood close to his side interfering with his opening the loading hatch of the roller but a match with such a driedup old man she said surely it is heartless of father to give me to such a creature she stood on tiptoe peering at jamie how old are you mackenzie his heart stopped beating for an instant a verra great deal older than you my lady he said firmly your pardon my lady he slid past her as well as he might without touching her and leaped up onto the manure wagon whence he was reasonably sure she wouldnt follow him but not ready for the boneyard yet are you mackenzie now she was in front of him shading her eyes with her hand as she peered upward a breeze had come up and wisps of her chestnut hair floated about her face have you ever been married mackenzie he gritted his teeth overcome with the urge to drop a shovelful of manure over her chestnut head but mastered it and dug the shovel into the pile merely saying i have in a tone that brooked no further inquiries the lady geneva was not interested in other peoples sensitivities good she said satisfied youll know what to do then to do he stopped short in the act of digging one foot braced on the shovel in bed she said calmly i want you to come to bed with me in the shock of the moment all he could think of was the ludicrous vision of the elegant lady geneva skirts thrown up over her face asprawl in the rich crumble of the manure wagon he dropped the shovel here he croaked no silly she said impatiently in bed in a proper bed in my bedroom you have lost your mind jamie said coldly the shock receding slightly or i should think you had if ye had one to lose her face flamed and her eyes narrowed how dare you speak that way to me how dare ye speak so to me jamie replied hotly a wee lassie of breeding to be makin indecent proposals to a man twice her age and a groom in her fathers house he added recollecting who he was he choked back further remarks recollecting also that this dreadful girl was the lady geneva and he was her fathers groom i beg your pardon my lady he said mastering his choler with some effort the sun is verra hot today and no doubt it has addled your wits a bit i expect ye should go back to the house at once and ask your maid to put cold cloths on your head the lady geneva stamped her moroccobooted foot my wits are not addled in the slightest she glared up at him chin set her chin was little and pointed so were her teeth and with that particular expression of determination on her face he thought she looked a great deal like the bloodyminded vixen she was listen to me she said i cannot prevent this abominable marriage but i amshe hesitated then continued firmlyi am damned if i will suffer my maidenhood to be given to a disgusting depraved old monster like ellesmere jamie rubbed a hand across his mouth despite himself he felt some sympathy for her but he would be damned if he allowed this skirted maniac to involve him in her troubles i am fully sensible of the honor my lady he said at last with a heavy irony but i really cannot yes you can her eyes rested frankly on the front of his filthy breeches betty says so he struggled for speech emerging at first with little more than incoherent sputterings finally he drew a deep breath and said with all the firmness he could muster betty has not the slightest basis for drawing conclusions as to my capacity i havena laid a hand on the lass geneva laughed delightedly so you didnt take her to bed she said you wouldnt but i thought perhaps she was only trying to avoid a beating thats good i couldnt possibly share a man with my maid he breathed heavily smashing her on the head with the shovel or throttling her were unfortunately out of the question his inflamed temper slowly calmed outrageous she might be but essentially powerless she could scarcely force him to go to her bed good day to ye my lady he said as politely as possible he turned his back on her and began to shovel manure into the hollow roller if you dont she said sweetly ill tell my father you made improper advances to me hell have the skin flayed off your back his shoulders hunched involuntarily she couldnt possibly know he had been careful never to take his shirt off in front of anyone since he came here he turned carefully and stared down at her the light of triumph was in her eye your father may not be so well acquent with me he said but hes kent you since ye were born tell him and be damned to ye she puffed up like a game cock her face growing bright red with temper is that so she cried well look at this then and be damned to you she reached into the bosom of her habit and pulled out a thick letter which she waved under his nose his sisters firm black hand was so familiar that a glimpse was enough give me that he was down off the wagon and after her in a flash but she was too fast she was up in the saddle before he could grab her backing with the reins in one hand waving the letter mockingly in the other want it do you yes i want it give it to me he was so furious he could easily have done her violence could he get his hands on her unfortunately her bay mare sensed his mood and backed away snorting and pawing uneasily i dont think so she eyed him coquettishly the red of ill temper fading from her face after all its really my duty to give this to my father isnt it he ought really to know that his servants are carrying on clandestine correspondences shouldnt he is jenny your sweetheart youve read my letter ye filthy wee bitch such language she said wagging the letter reprovingly its my duty to help my parents by letting them know what sorts of dreadful things the servants are up to isnt it and i am a dutiful daughter am i not submitting to this marriage without a squeak she leaned forward on her pommel smiling mockingly and with a fresh spurt of rage he realized that she was enjoying this very much indeed i expect papa will find it very interesting reading she said especially the bit about the gold to be sent to lochiel in france isnt it still considered treason to be giving comfort to the kings enemies tsk she said clicking her tongue roguishly how wicked he thought he might be sick on the spot from sheer terror did she have the faintest idea how many lives lay in that manicured white hand his sister ian their six children all the tenants and families of lallybrochperhaps even the lives of the agents who carried messages and money between scotland and france maintaining the precarious existence of the jacobite exiles there he swallowed once and then again before he spoke all right he said a more natural smile broke out on her face and he realized how very young she was aye well and a wee adders bite was as venomous as an auld ones i wont tell she assured him looking earnest ill give you your letter back afterward and i wont ever say what was in it i promise thank you he tried to gather his wits enough to make a sensible plan sensible going into his masters house to ravish his daughters maidenhoodat her request he had never heard of a less sensible prospect all right he said again we must be careful with a feeling of dull horror he felt himself being drawn into the role of conspirator with her yes dont worry i can arrange for my maid to be sent away and the footman drinks hes always asleep before ten oclock arrange it then he said his stomach curdling mind ye choose a safe day though a safe day she looked blank sometime in the week after yeve finished your courses he said bluntly youre less likely to get wi child then oh she blushed rosily at that but looked at him with a new interest they looked at each other in silence for a long moment suddenly linked by the prospect of the future ill send you word she said at last and wheeling her horse about galloped away across the field the mares hooves kicking up spurts of the freshly spread manure cursing fluently and silently he crept beneath the row of larches there wasnt much moon which was a blessing six yards of open lawn to cross in a dash and he was kneedeep in the columbine and germander of the flowerbed he looked up the side of the house its bulk looming dark and forbidding above him yes there was the candle in the window as shed said still he counted the windows carefully to verify it heaven help him if he chose the wrong room heaven help him if it was the right one too he thought grimly and took a firm hold on the trunk of the huge gray creeper that covered this side of the house the leaves rustled like a hurricane and the stems stout as they were creaked and bent alarmingly under his weight there was nothing for it but to climb as swiftly as possible and be ready to hurl himself off into the night if any of the windows should suddenly be raised he arrived at the small balcony panting heart racing and drenched in sweat despite the chilliness of the night he paused a moment alone beneath the faint spring stars to draw breath he used it to damn geneva dunsany once more and then pushed open her door she had been waiting and had plainly heard his approach up the ivy she rose from the chaise where she had been sitting and came toward him chin up chestnut hair loose over her shoulders she was wearing a white nightgown of some sheer material tied at the throat with a silk bow the garment didnt look like the nightwear of a modest young lady and he realized with a shock that she was wearing her bridalnight apparel so you came he heard the note of triumph in her voice but also the faint quaver so she hadnt been sure of him i hadnt much choice he said shortly and turned to close the french doors behind him will you have some wine striving for graciousness she moved to the table where a decanter stood with two glasses how had she managed that he wondered still a glass of something wouldnt come amiss in the present circumstances he nodded and took the full glass from her hand he looked at her covertly as he sipped it the nightdress did little to conceal her body and as his heart gradually slowed from the panic of his ascent he found his first fearthat he wouldnt be able to keep his half of the bargainallayed without conscious effort she was built narrowly slimhipped and smallbreasted but most definitely a woman finished he set down the glass no point in delay he thought the letter he said abruptly afterward she said tightening her mouth now or i leave and he turned toward the window as though about to execute the threat wait he turned back but eyed her with illdisguised impatience dont you trust me she said trying to sound winsome and charming no he said bluntly she looked angry at that and thrust out a petulant lower lip but he merely looked stonily over his shoulder at her still facing the window oh all right then she said at last with a shrug digging under the layers of embroidery in a sewing box she unearthed the letter and tossed it onto the washing stand beside him he snatched it up and unfolded the sheets to be sure of it he felt a surge of mingled fury and relief at the sight of the violated seal and jennys familiar hand within neat and strong well genevas voice broke in upon his reading impatient put that down and come here jamie im ready she sat on the bed arms curled around her knees he stiffened and turned a very cold blue look on her over the pages in his hands youll not use that name to me he said she lifted the pointed chin a trifle more and raised her plucked brows why not its yours your sister calls you so he hesitated for a moment then deliberately laid the letter aside and bent his head to the laces of his breeches ill serve ye properly he said looking down at his working fingers for the sake of my own honor as a man and yours as a woman buthe raised his head and the narrowed blue eyes bored into hershaving brought me to your bed by means of threats against my family ill not have ye call me by the name they give me he stood motionless eyes fixed on hers at last she gave a very small nod and her eyes dropped to the quilt she traced the pattern with a finger what must i call you then she asked at last in a small voice i cant call you mackenzie the corners of his mouth lifted slightly as he looked at her she looked quite small huddled into herself with her arms locked around her knees and her head bowed he sighed call me alex then its my own name as well she nodded without speaking her hair fell forward in wings about her face but he could see the brief shine of her eyes as she peeped out from behind its cover its all right he said gruffly you can watch me he pushed the loose breeches down rolling the stockings off with them he shook them out and folded them neatly over a chair before beginning to unfasten his shirt conscious of her gaze still shy but now direct out of some idea of thoughtfulness he turned to face her before removing the shirt to spare her for a moment the sight of his back oh the exclamation was soft but enough to stop him is something wrong he asked oh noi mean its only that i didnt expect the hair swung forward again but not before he had seen the telltale reddening of her cheeks youve not seen a man naked before he guessed the shiny brown head swayed back and forth noo she said doubtfully i have onlyit wasnt well it usually isnt he said matteroffactly sitting down on the bed beside her but if one is going to make love it has to be ye see i see she said but still sounded doubtful he tried to smile to reassure her dont worry it doesna get any bigger and it wilna do anything strange if ye want to touch it at least he hoped it wouldnt being naked in such close proximity to a halfclad girl was doing terrible things to his powers of selfcontrol his traitorous deprived anatomy didnt care a whit that she was a selfish blackmailing little bitch perhaps fortunately she declined his offer shrinking back a little toward the wall though her eyes stayed on him he rubbed his chin dubiously how much do youi mean have ye any idea how its done her gaze was clear and guileless though her cheeks flamed well like the horses i suppose he nodded but felt a pang recalling his wedding night when he too had expected it to be like horses something like that he said clearing his throat slower though more gentle he added seeing her apprehensive look oh thats good nurse and the maids used to tell stories aboutmen and er getting married and allit sounded rather frightening she swallowed hard wwill it hurt much she raised her head suddenly and looked him in the eye i dont mind if it does she said bravely its only that id like to know what to expect he felt an unexpected small liking for her she might be spoiled selfish and reckless but there was some character to her at least courage to him was no small virtue i think not he said if i take my time to ready you if he could take his time amended his brain i think it will be not much worse than a pinch he reached out and nipped a fold of skin on her upper arm she jumped and rubbed the spot but smiled i can stand that its only the first time its like that he assured her the next time it will be better she nodded then after a moments hesitation edged toward him reaching out a tentative finger may i touch you this time he really did laugh though he choked the sound off quickly i think youll have to my lady if im to do what you asked of me she ran her hand slowly down his arm so softly that the touch tickled and his skin shivered in response gaining confidence she let her hand circle his forearm feeling the girth of it youre quitebig he smiled but stayed motionless letting her explore his body at as much length as she might wish he felt the muscles of his belly tighten as she stroked the length of one thigh and ventured tentatively around the curve of one buttock her fingers approached the twisting knotted line of the scar that ran the length of his left thigh but stopped short its all right he assured her it doesna hurt me anymore she didnt reply but drew two fingers slowly along the length of the scar exerting no pressure the questing hands growing bolder slid up over the rounded curves of his broad shoulders slid down his backand stopped dead he closed his eyes and waited following her movements by the shifting of weight on the mattress she moved behind him and was silent then there was a quivering sigh and the hands touched him again soft on his ruined back and you werent afraid when i said id have you flogged her voice was queerly hoarse but he kept still eyes closed no he said i am not much afraid of things anymore in fact he was beginning to be afraid that he wouldnt be able to keep his hands off her or to handle her with the necessary gentleness when the time came his balls ached with need and he could feel his heartbeat pounding in his temples she got off the bed and stood in front of him he rose suddenly startling her so that she stepped back a pace but he reached out and rested his hands on her shoulders may i touch you my lady the words were teasing but the touch was not she nodded too breathless to speak and his arms came around her he held her against his chest not moving until her breathing slowed he was conscious of an extraordinary mixture of feelings he had never in his life taken a woman in his arms without some feeling of love but there was nothing of love in this encounter nor could there be for her own sake there was some tenderness for her youth and pity at her situation rage at her manipulation of him and fear at the magnitude of the crime he was about to commit but overall there was a terrible lust a need that clawed at his vitals and made him ashamed of his own manhood even as he acknowledged its power hating himself he lowered his head and cupped her face between his hands he kissed her softly briefly then a bit longer she was trembling against him as his hands undid the tie of her gown and slid it back off her shoulders he lifted her and laid her on the bed he lay beside her cradling her in one arm as the other hand caressed her breasts one and then the other cupping each so she felt the weight and the warmth of them even as he did a man should pay tribute to your body he said softly raising each nipple with small circling touches for you are beautiful and that is your right she let out her breath in a small gasp then relaxed under his touch he took his time moving as slowly as he could make himself do it stroking and kissing touching her lightly all over he didnt like the girl didnt want to be here didnt want to be doing this butit had been more than three years since hed touched a womans body he tried to gauge when she might be readiest but how in hell could he tell she was flushed and panting but she simply lay there like a piece of porcelain on display curse the girl could she not even give him a clue he rubbed a trembling hand through his hair trying to quell the surge of confused emotion that pulsed through him with each heartbeat he was angry scared and most mightily roused most of which feelings were of no great use to him now he closed his eyes and breathed deeply striving for calm seeking for gentleness no of course she couldnt show him shed never touched a man before having forced him here she was with a damnable unwanted unwarrantable trust leaving the conduct of the whole affair up to him he touched the girl gently stroking her between the thighs she didnt part them for him but didnt resist she was faintly moist there perhaps it would be all right now all right he murmured to her be still mo chridhe murmuring what he hoped sounded like reassurances he eased himself on top of her and used his knee to spread her legs he felt her slight start at the heat of his body covering her at the touch of his cock and he wrapped his hands in her hair to steady her still muttering things in soft gaelic he thought dimly that it was a good thing he was speaking gaelic as he was no longer paying any attention at all to what he was saying her small hard breasts poked against his chest mo nighean he murmured wait a minute said geneva i think perhaps the effort of control made him dizzy but he did it slowly only easing himself the barest inch within ooh said geneva her eyes flew wide uh he said and pushed a bit farther stop it its too big take it out panicked geneva thrashed beneath him pressed beneath his chest her breasts wobbled and rubbed so that his own nipples leapt erect in pinpoints of abrupt sensation her struggles were accomplishing by force what he had tried to do with gentleness halfdazed he fought to keep her under him while groping madly for something to say to calm her but he said stop it i take it out she screamed he clapped one hand over her mouth and said the only coherent thing he could think of no he said definitely and shoved what might have been a scream emerged through his fingers as a strangled eep genevas eyes were huge and round but dry in for a penny in for a pound the saying drifted absurdly through his head leaving nothing in its wake but a jumble of incoherent alarms and a marked feeling of terrible urgency down beween them there was precisely one thing he was capable of doing at this point and he did it his body ruthlessly usurping control as it moved into the rhythm of its inexorable pagan joy it took no more than a few thrusts before the wave came down upon him churning down the length of his spine and erupting like a breaker striking rocks sweeping away the last shreds of conscious thought that clung barnaclelike to the remnants of his mind he came to himself a moment later lying on his side with the sound of his own heartbeat loud and slow in his ears he cracked one eyelid and saw the shimmer of pink skin in lamplight he must see if hed hurt her much but god not just this minute he shut his eye again and merely breathed whatwhat are you thinking the voice sounded hesitant and a little shaken but not hysterical too shaken himself to notice the absurdity of the question he answered it with the truth i was wondering why in gods name men want to bed virgins there was a long moment of silence and then a tremulous intake of breath im sorry she said in a small voice i didnt know it would hurt you too his eyes popped open in astonishment and he raised himself on one elbow to find her looking at him like a startled fawn her face was pale and she licked dry lips hurt me he said in blank astonishment it didna hurt me butshe frowned as her eyes traveled slowly down the length of his bodyi thought it must you made the most terrible face as though it hurt awfully and youyou groaned like a aye well he interrupted hastily before she could reveal any more unflattering observations of his behavior i didna meani meanthats just how men act when theydo that he ended lamely her shock was fading into curiosity do all men act like that when theyredoing that how should i he began irritably then stopped himself with a shudder realizing that he did in fact know the answer to that aye they do he said shortly he pushed himself up to a sitting position and brushed the hair back from his forehead men are disgusting horrible beasts just as your nurse told you have i hurt ye badly i dont think so she said doubtfully she moved her legs experimentally it did hurt just for a moment like you said it would but it isnt so bad now he breathed a sigh of relief as he saw that while she had bled the stain on the towel was slight and she seemed not to be in pain she reached tentatively between her thighs and made a face of disgust ooh she said its all nasty and sticky the blood rose to his face in mingled outrage and embarrassment here he muttered and reached for a washcloth from the stand she didnt take it but opened her legs and arched her back slightly obviously expecting him to attend to the mess he had a strong urge to stuff the rag down her throat instead but a glance at the stand where his letter lay stopped him it was a bargain after all and shed kept her part grimly he wet the cloth and began to sponge her but he found the trust with which she presented herself to him oddly moving he carried out his ministrations quite gently and found himself at the end planting a light kiss on the smooth slope of her belly there thank you she said she moved her hips tentatively and reached out a hand to touch him he didnt move letting her fingers trail down his chest and toy with the deep indentation of his navel the light touch hesitantly descended you saidit would be better next time she whispered he closed his eyes and took a deep breath it was a long time until the dawn i expect it will he said and stretched himself once more beside her jaer alex he felt as though he had been drugged and it was an effort to answer her my lady her arms came around his neck and she nestled her head in the curve of his shoulder breath warm against his chest i love you alex with difficulty he roused himself enough to put her away from him holding her by the shoulders and looking down into the gray eyes soft as a does no he said but gently shaking his head thats the third rule you may have no more than the one night you may not call me by my first name and you may not love me the gray eyes moistened a bit but if i cant help it it isna love you feel now he hoped he was right for his sake as well as her own its only the feeling ive roused in your body its strong and its good but it isna the same thing as love whats the difference he rubbed his hands hard over his face she would be a philosopher he thought wryly he took a deep breath and blew it out before answering her well loves for only one person this what you feel from meye can have that with any man its not particular only one person he pushed the thought of claire firmly away and wearily bent again to his work he landed heavily in the earth of the flowerbed not caring that he crushed several small and tender plants he shivered this hour before dawn was not only the darkest but the coldest as well and his body strongly protested being required to rise from a warm soft nest and venture into the chilly blackness shielded from the icy air by no more than a thin shirt and breeks he remembered the heated rosy curve of the cheek he had bent to kiss before leaving the shapes of her lingered warm in his hands curving his fingers in memory even as he groped in the dark for the darker line of the stableyards stone wall drained as he was it was a dreadful effort to haul himself up and climb over but he couldnt risk the creak of the gate awakening hughes the head groom he felt his way across the inner yard crowded with wagons and packed bales ready for the journey of the lady geneva to the home of her new lord following the wedding on thursday next at last he pushed open the stable door and found his way up the ladder to his loft he lay down in the icy straw and pulled the single blanket over him feeling empty of everything by misadventure helwater january appropriately enough the weather was dark and stormy when the news reached helwater the afternoon exercise had been canceled owing to the heavy downpour and the horses were snug in their stalls below the homely peaceful sounds of munching and blowing rose up to the loft above where jamie fraser reclined in a comfortable haylined nest an open book propped on his chest it was one of several he had borrowed from the estates factor mr grieves and he was finding it absorbing despite the difficulty of reading by the poor light from the owlslits beneath the eaves my lips which i threw in his way so as that he could not escape kissing them fixd fird and emboldend him and now glancing my eyes towards that part of his dress which coverd the essential object of enjoyment i plainly discoverd the swell and commotion there and as i was now too far advancd to stop in so fair a way and was indeed no longer able to contain myself or wait the slower progress of his maiden bashfulness i stole my hand upon his thighs down one of which i could both see and feel a stiff hard body confind by his breeches that my fingers could discover no end to oh aye jamie muttered skeptically he raised his eyebrows and shifted himself on the hay he had been aware that books like this existed of course butwith jenny ordering the reading matter at lallybrochhad not encountered one personally before the type of mental engagement demanded was somewhat different from that required for the works of messieurs defoe and fielding but he was not averse to variety its prodigious size made me shrink again yet i could not without pleasure behold and even venturd to feel such a length such a breadth of animated ivory perfectly well turnd and fashiond the proud stiffness of which distended its skin whose smooth polish and velvet softness might vie with that of the most delicate of our sex and whose exquisite whiteness was not a little set off by a sprout of black curling hair round the root then the broad and blueish casted incarnate of the head and blue serpentines of its veins altogether composd the most striking assemblage of figures and colors in nature in short it stood an object of terror and delight jamie glanced at his own crotch and snorted briefly at this but flipped the page the crash of thunder outside meriting no more than a twinge of his attention he was so absorbed that at first he failed to hear the noises down below the sound of voices drowned in the heavy rush and beat of the rain on the planks a few feet above his head mackenzie the repeated stentorian bellow finally penetrated his awareness and he rolled hastily to his feet quickly straightening his clothes as he went toward the ladder aye he thrust his head over the edge of the loft to see hughes just opening his mouth for another bellow oh there ee are hughes shut his mouth and beckoned with one gnarled hand wincing as he did so hughes suffered mightily from rheumatics in damp weather he had been riding out the storm snug in the small chamber beside the tack room where he kept a bed and a jug of crudely distilled spirits the aroma was perceptible from the loft and grew substantially stronger as jamie descended the ladder youre to help ready the coach to drive lord dunsany and lady isobel to ellesmere hughes told him the moment his foot touched the flags of the stable floor the old man swayed alarmingly hiccuping softly to himself now are ye daft man or just drunk he glanced at the open halfdoor behind hughes which seemed a solid sheet of streaming water even as he looked the sky beyond lit up with a sudden flare of lightning that threw the mountain beyond into sudden sharp relief just as suddenly it disappeared leaving its afterimage printed on his retina he shook his head to clear the image and saw jeffries the coachman making his way across the yard head bowed against the force of wind and water cloak clutched tight about him so it wasnt only a drunken fancy of hughess jeffries needs help wi the horses hughes was forced to lean close and shout to be heard over the noise of the storm the smell of rough alcohol was staggering at close distance aye but why why must lord dunsanyah feckit the head grooms eyes were redrimmed and bleary clearly there was no sense to be got out of him disgusted jamie pushed past the man and mounted the ladder two rungs at a time a moment to wrap his own worn cloak about him a moment more to thrust the book he had been reading under the haystable lads were no respecters of propertyand he was slithering down the ladder again and out into the roar of the storm it was a hellish journey the wind screamed through the pass striking the bulky coach and threatening to overturn it at any moment perched aloft beside jeffries a cloak was little protection against the driving rain still less was it a help when he was forced to dismountas he did every few minutes it seemedand put his shoulder to the wheel to free the miserable contrivance from the clinging grip of a mudhole still he scarcely noticed the physical inconvenience of the journey preoccupied as he was with the possible reasons for it there couldnt be many matters of such urgency as to force an old man like lord dunsany outside on a day like this let alone over the rutted road to ellesmere some word had come from ellesmere and it could only concern the lady geneva or her child hearing through the servants gossip that lady geneva was due to be delivered in january he had counted quickly backward cursed geneva dunsany once more and then said a hasty prayer for her safe delivery since then he had done his best not to think about it he had been with her only three days before her wedding he couldnt be sure a week before lady dunsany had gone to ellesmere to be with her daughter since then she had sent daily messengers home to fetch the dozen things she had forgotten to take and must have at once and each of them upon arrival at helwater had reported no news yet now there was news and it was plainly bad passing back toward the front of the coach after the latest battle with the mud he saw the lady isobels face peering out from beneath the isinglass sheet that covered the window oh mackenzie she said her face contorted in fear and distress please is it much farther he leaned close to shout in her ear over the gurgle and rush of the gullies running down both sides of the road jeffries says its four mile yet milady two hours maybe if the damned and hellbent coach didnt tip itself and its hapless passengers off the ashness bridge into watendlath tarn he added silently to himself isobel nodded her thanks and lowered the window but not before he had seen that the wetness upon her cheeks was due as much to tears as to the rain the snake of anxiety wrapped round his heart slithered lower to twist in his guts it was closer to three hours by the time the coach rolled at last into the courtyard at ellesmere without hesitation lord dunsany leapt down and scarcely pausing to give his younger daughter an arm hurried into the house it took nearly another hour to unharness the team rub down the horses wash the cakedon mud from the coachs wheels and put everything away in ellesmeres stables numb with cold fatigue and hunger he and jeffries sought refuge and sustenance in ellesmeres kitchens poor fellows youre gone right blue wi the cold the cook observed sit ye down ere and ill soon ave yer a hot bite a sharpfaced spareframed woman her figure belied her skill for within minutes a huge savoury omelet was laid before them garnished with liberal amounts of bread and butter and a small pot of jam fair quite fair jeffries pronounced casting an appreciative eye on the spread he winked at the cook not as it wouldn go down easier wi a drop o something to pave the way eh you look the sort would have mercy on a pair o poor halffrozen chaps wouldnt ye darlin whether it was this piece of irish persuasion or the sight of their dripping steaming clothes the argument had its effect and a bottle of cooking brandy made its appearance next to the peppermill jeffries poured a large tot and drank it off without hesitation smacking his lips ah thats more like here boyo he passed the bottle to jamie then settled himself comfortably to a hot meal and gossip with the female servants well then whats to do here is the babe born yet oh yes last night the kitchen maid said eagerly we were up all night with the doctor comin and fresh sheets and towels called for and the house all topsleturvy but the babes the least of it now then the cook broke in frowning censoriously theres too much work to be standin about gossiping get yer on mary annup to the study and see if his lordshipll be wantin anything else served now jamie wiping his plate with a slice of bread observed that the maid far from being abashed at this rebuke departed with alacrity causing him to deduce that something of considerable interest was likely transpiring in the study the undivided attention of her audience thus obtained the cook allowed herself to be persuaded into imparting the gossip with no more than a token demur well it started some months ago when the lady geneva started to show poor thing his lordshipd been nicer than pie to er ever since they was married couldnt do enough for er anything she wanted ordered from lunnon always askin was she warm enoughad she what she wanted to eatfair dotin is lordship was but then when e found she was with child the cook paused to screw up her face portentously jamie wanted desperately to know about the child what was it and how did it fare there seemed no way to hurry the woman though so he composed his face to look as interested as possible leaning forward encouragingly why the shouting and the carryingson the cook said throwing up her hands in dismayed illustration im shoutin and er cryin and the both of em stampin up and down and slammin doors and im callin er names as isnt fit to be used in a stableyardand so i told mary ann when she told me was his lordship not pleased about the child then jamie interrupted the omelet was settling into a hard lump somewhere under his breastbone he took another gulp of brandy in hopes of dislodging it the cook turned a bright birdlike eye on him eyebrow cocked in appreciation at his intelligence well youd think as e would be wouldnt yer but no indeed far from it she added with emphasis why not said jeffries only mildly interested e said the cook said dropping her voice in awe at the scandalousness of the information as the child wasnt is jeffries well along with his second glass snorted in contemptuous amusement old goat with a young gel i should think it like enough but how on earth would his lordship know for sure whose the spawn was could be his as much as anyones couldnt it with only her ladyships word to go by eh the cooks thin mouth stretched in a bright malicious smile oh i dont say as ed know whose it was nowbut theres one sure way ed know it wasnt is now isnt there jeffries stared at the cook tilting back on his chair what he said you mean to tell me his lordships incapable a broad grin at this juicy thought split his weatherbeaten face jamie felt the omelet rising and hastily gulped more brandy well i couldnt say im sure the cooks mouth assumed a prim line then split asunder to add though the chambermaid did say as the sheets she took off the weddin bed was as white as when theyd gone on to be sure it was too much interrupting jeffriess delighted cackle jamie set down his glass with a thump and bluntly said did the child live the cook and jeffries both stared in astonishment but the cook after a moments startlement nodded in answer oh yes to be sure fine ealthy little lade is too or so i ear i thought you knew aready its is mother thats dead that blunt statement struck the kitchen with silence even jeffries was still for a moment sobered by death then he crossed himself quickly muttered god rest her soul and swallowed the rest of his brandy jamie could feel his own throat burning whether with brandy or tears he could not say shock and grief choked him like a ball of yarn wedged in his gullet he could barely manage to croak when this morning the cook said wagging her head mournfully just afore noon poor girl they thought for a time as shed be all right after the babe was born mary ann said she was sittin up holdin the wee thing and laughin she sighed heavily at the thought but then near dawn she started to bleed again bad they called back the doctor and he came fast as could be but the door slamming open interrupted her it was mary ann eyes wide under her cap gasping with excitement and exertion your master wants you she blurted out eyes flicking between jamie and the coachman the both of ye at once and oh sirshe gulped nodding at jeffrieshe says for gods sake to bring your pistols the coachman exchanged a glance of consternation with jamie then leapt to his feet and dashed out in the direction of the stables like most coachmen he carried a pair of loaded pistols beneath his seat against the possibility of highwaymen it would take jeffries a few minutes to find the arms and longer if he waited to check that the priming had not been harmed by the wet weather jamie rose to his feet and gripped the dithering maidservant by the arm show me to the study he said now the sound of raised voices would have led him there once he had reached the head of the stair pushing past mary ann without ceremony he paused for a moment outside the door uncertain whether he should enter at once or wait for jeffries that you can have the sheer heartless effrontery to make such accusations dunsany was saying his old mans voice shaking with rage and distress and my poor lamb not cold in her bed you blackguard you poltroon i will not suffer the child to stay a single night under your roof the little bastard stays here ellesmeres voice rasped hoarsely it would have been apparent to a far less experienced observer that his lordship was well the worse for drink bastard that he is hes my heir and he stays with me hes bought and paid for and if his dam was a whore at least she gave me a boy damn you dunsanys voice had reached such a pitch of shrillness that it was scarcely more than a squeak but the outrage in it was clear nonetheless bought youyouyou dare to suggest i dont suggest ellesmeres voice was still hoarse but under better control you sold me your daughterand under false pretenses i might add the hoarse voice said sarcastically i paid thirty thousand pound for a virgin of good name the first condition wasnt met and i take leave to doubt the second the sound of liquid being poured came through the door followed by the scrape of a glass across a wooden tabletop i would suggest that your burden of spirits is already excessive sir dunsany said his voice shook with an obvious attempt at mastery of his emotions i can only attribute the disgusting slurs you have cast upon my daughters purity to your apparent intoxication that being so i shall take my grandson and go oh your grandson is it ellesmeres voice was slurred and sneering you seem damned sure of your daughters purity sure the brat isnt yours she said he broke off with a cry of astonishment accompanied by a crash not daring to wait longer jamie plunged through the door to find ellesmere and lord dunsany entangled on the hearthrug rolling to and fro in a welter of coats and limbs both heedless of the fire behind them he took a moment to appraise the situation then seizing a fortuitous opening reached into the fray and snatched his employer upright be still my lord he muttered in dunsanys ear dragging him back from ellesmeres gasping form then give over ye auld fool he hissed as dunsany went on mindlessly struggling to reach his opponent ellesmere was almost as old as dunsany but more strongly built and clearly in better health despite his drunkenness the earl staggered to his feet balding hair disheveled and bloodshot eyes glaring fixedly at dunsany he wiped his spittleflecked mouth with the back of his hand fat shoulders heaving filth he said almost conversationally lay handson me would you still gasping for breath he lurched toward the bell rope it was by no means certain that lord dunsany would stay on his feet but there was no time to worry about that jamie let go of his employer and lunged for ellesmeres groping hand no my lord he said as respectfully as possible holding ellesmere in a crude bearleading embrace he forced the heavyset earl back across the room i think it would beunwiseto involve yourservants grunting he pushed ellesmere into a chair best stay there my lord jeffries a drawn pistol in each hand advanced warily into the room his darting glance divided between ellesmere struggling to rise from the depths of the armchair and lord dunsany who clung precariously to a table edge his aged face white as paper jeffries glanced at dunsany for instructions and seeing none forthcoming instinctively looked to jamie jamie was conscious of a monstrous irritation why should he be expected to deal with this imbroglio still it was important that the helwater party remove themselves from the premises with all haste he stepped forward and took dunsany by the arm let us go now my lord he said detaching the wilting dunsany from the table he tried to edge the tall old nobleman toward the door just at this moment of escape though the door was blocked william lady dunsanys round face splotched with the marks of recent grief showed a sort of dull bewilderment at the scene in the study in her arms was what looked like a large untidy bundle of washing she lifted this in a movement of vague inquiry the maid said you wanted me to bring the baby what a roar from ellesmere interrupted her heedless of the pointing pistols the earl sprang from his chair and shoved the gawking jeffries out of the way hes mine knocking lady dunsany roughly against the paneling ellesmere snatched the bundle from her arms clutching it to his bosom the earl retreated toward the window he glared at dunsany panting like a cornered beast mine dye hear the bundle emitted a loud shriek as if in protest at this asseveration and dunsany roused from his shock by the sight of his grandson in ellesmeres arms started forward his features contorted in fury give him to me go to hell you codless scut with an unforeseen agility ellesmere dodged away from dunsany he flung back the draperies and cranked the window open with one hand clutching the wailing child with the other getoutofmyhouse he panted gasping with each revolution that edged the casement wider go now or ill drop the little bastard i swear i will to mark his threat he thrust the yelling bundle toward the sill and the empty dark where the wet stones of the courtyard waited thirty feet below past all conscious thought or any fear of consequence jamie fraser acted on the instinct that had seen him through a dozen battles he snatched one pistol from the transfixed jeffries turned on his heel and fired in the same motion the roar of the shot struck everyone silent even the child ceased to scream ellesmeres face went quite blank thick eyebrows raised in question then he staggered and jamie leapt forward noting with a sort of detached clarity the small round hole in the babys trailing drapery where the pistol ball had passed through it he stood then rooted on the hearthrug heedless of the fire scorching the backs of his legs of the stillheaving body of ellesmere at his feet of the regular hysterical shrieks of lady dunsany piercing as a peacocks he stood eyes tight closed shaking like a leaf unable either to move or to think arms wrapped tight about the shapeless squirming squawking bundle that contained his son i wish to speak to mackenzie alone lady dunsany looked distinctly out of place in the stable small plump and impeccable in black linen she looked like a china ornament removed from its spot of cherished safety on the mantelpiece and in imminent and constant peril of breakage here in this world of rough animals and unshaven men hughes with a glance of complete astonishment at his mistress bowed and tugged at his forelock before retreating to his den behind the tack room leaving mackenzie facetoface with her close to the impression of fragility was heightened by the paleness of her face touched faintly with pink at the corners of nose and eyes she looked like a very small and dignified rabbit dressed in mourning jamie felt that he should ask her to sit down but there was no place for her to sit save on a pile of hay or an upturned barrow the coroners court met this morning mackenzie she said aye milady he had known thatthey all had and the other grooms had kept their distance from him all morning not out of respect out of the dread for one who suffers from a deadly disease jeffries knew what had happened in the drawing room at ellesmere and that meant all the servants knew but no one spoke of it the verdict of the court was that the earl of ellesmere met his death by misadventure the coroners theory is that his lordship wasdistraughtshe made a faint moue of distasteover my daughters death her voice quivered faintly but did not break the fragile lady dunsany had borne up much better beneath the tragedy than had her husband the servants rumor had it that his lordship had not risen from his bed since his return from ellesmere aye milady jeffries had been called to give evidence mackenzie had not so far as the coroners court was concerned the groom mackenzie had never set foot on ellesmere lady dunsanys eyes met his straight on they were a pale bluishgreen like her daughter isobels but the blond hair that glowed on isobel was faded on her mother touched with white strands that shone silver in the sun from the open door of the stable we are grateful to you mackenzie she said quietly thank ye milady very grateful she repeated still gazing at him intently mackenzie isnt your real name is it she said suddenly no milady a sliver of ice ran down his spine despite the warmth of the afternoon sun on his shoulders how much had the lady geneva told her mother before her death she seemed to feel his stiffening for the edge of her mouth lifted in what he thought was meant as a smile of reassurance i think i need not ask what it is just yet she said but i do have a question for you mackenziedo you want to go home home he repeated the word blankly to scotland she was watching him intently i know who you are she said not your name but that youre one of johns jacobite prisoners my husband told me jamie watched her warily but she didnt seem upset no more so than would be natural in a woman who has just lost a daughter and gained a grandson at least i hope you will forgive the deception milady he said his lordship wished to save me distress lady dunsany finished for him yes i know william worries too much still the deep line between her brows relaxed a bit at the thought of her husbands concern the sight with its underlying echo of marital devotion gave him a faint and unexpected pang we are not richyou will have gathered that from ellesmeres remarks lady dunsany went on helwater is rather heavily in debt my grandson however is now the possessor of one of the largest fortunes in the county there seemed nothing to say to this but aye milady though it made him feel rather like the parrot who lived in the main salon he had seen it as he crept stealthily through the flowerbeds at sunset the day before taking the chance of approaching the house while the family were dressing for dinner in an attempt to catch a glimpse through a window of the new earl of ellesmere we are very retired here she went on we seldom visit london and my husband has little influence in high circles but aye milady he had some inkling by now of where her ladyship was heading with this roundabout conversation and a feeling of sudden excitement hollowed the space beneath his ribs johnlord john grey that iscomes from a family with considerable influence his stepfather iswell thats of no consequence she shrugged the small blacklinen shoulders dismissing the details the point is that it might be possible to exert sufficient influence on your behalf to have you released from the conditions of your parole so that you might return to scotland so i have come to ask youdo you want to go home mackenzie he felt quite breathless as though someone had punched him very hard in the stomach scotland to go away from this damp spongy atmosphere set foot on that forbidden road and walk it with a free long stride up into the crags and along the deer trails to feel the air clearing and sharpening with the scent of gorse and heather to go home to be a stranger no longer to go away from hostility and loneliness come down into lallybroch and see his sisters face light with joy at the sight of him feel her arms around his waist ians hug about his shoulders and the pummeling grasping clutch of the childrens hands tugging at his clothes to go away and never to see or hear of his own child again he stared at lady dunsany his face quite blank so that she should not guess at the turmoil her offer had caused within him he had at last found the baby yesterday lying asleep in a basket near the nursery window on the second floor perched precariously on the branch of a huge norway spruce he had strained his eyes to see through the screen of needles that hid him the childs face had been visible only in profile one fat cheek resting on its ruffled shoulder its cap had slipped awry so he could see the smooth arching curve of the tiny skull lightly dusted with a pale gold fuzz thank god it isnt red had been his first thought and he had crossed himself in reflexive thanksgiving god hes so small had been his second coupled with an overwhelming urge to step through the window and pick the boy up the smooth beautifully shaped head would just fit resting in the palm of his hand and he could feel in memory the small squirming body that he had held so briefly to his heart youre a strong laddie he had whispered strong and braw and bonny but my god you are so small lady dunsany was waiting patiently he bowed his head respectfully to her not knowing whether he was making a terrible mistake but unable to do otherwise i thank ye milady buti think i shall not gojust yet one pale eyebrow quivered slightly but she inclined her head to him with equal grace as you wish mackenzie you have only to ask she turned like a tiny clockwork figure and left going back to the world of helwater a thousand times more his prison now than it had ever been willie to his extreme surprise the next few years were in many ways among the happiest of jamie frasers life aside from the years of his marriage relieved of responsibility for tenants followers or anyone at all beyond himself and the horses in his charge life was relatively simple while the coroners court had taken no notice of him jeffries had let slip enough about the death of ellesmere that the other servants treated him with distant respect but did not presume on his company he had enough to eat sufficient clothes to keep warm and decent and the occasional discreet letter from the highlands reassured him that similar conditions obtained there one unexpected benefit of the quiet life at helwater was that he had somehow resumed his odd halffriendship with lord john grey the major had as promised appeared once each quarter staying each time for a few days to visit with the dunsanys he had made no attempt to gloat though or even to speak with jamie beyond the barest formal inquiry very slowly jamie had realized all that lady dunsany had implied in her offer to have him released johnlord john grey that iscomes from a family with considerable influence his stepfather iswell thats of no consequence she had said it was of consequence though it had not been his majestys pleasure that had brought him here rather than condemning him to the perilous ocean crossing and nearslavery in america it had been john greys influence and he had not done it for revenge or from indecent motives for he never gloated made no advances never said anything beyond the most commonplace civilities no he had brought jamie here because it was the best he could do unable simply to release him at the time grey had done his best to ease the conditions of captivityby giving him air and light and horses it took some effort but he did it when grey next appeared in the stableyard on his quarterly visit jamie had waited until the major was alone admiring the conformation of a big sorrel gelding he had come to stand beside grey leaning on the fence they watched the horse in silence for several minutes kings pawn to king four jamie said quietly at last not looking at the man beside him he felt the others start of surprise and felt greys eyes on him but didnt turn his head then he felt the creak of the wood beneath his forearm as grey turned back leaning on the fence again queens knight to queen bishop three grey replied his voice a little huskier than usual since then grey had come to the stables during each visit to spend an evening perched on jamies crude stool talking they had no chessboard and seldom played verbally but the latenight conversations continuedjamies only connection with the world beyond helwater and a small pleasure to which both of them looked forward once each quarter above everything else he had willie helwater was dedicated to horses even before the boy could stand solidly on his feet his grandfather had him propped on a pony to be led round the paddock by the time willie was three he was riding by himselfunder the watchful eye of mackenzie the groom willie was a strong courageous bonny little lad he had a blinding smile and could charm birds from the trees if he liked he was also remarkably spoilt as the ninth earl of ellesmere and the only heir to both ellesmere and helwater with neither mother nor father to keep him under control he ran roughshod over his doting grandparents his young aunt and every servant in the placeexcept mackenzie and that was a near thing so far threats of not allowing the boy to help him with the horses had sufficed to quash willies worst excesses in the stables but sooner or later threats alone were not going to be sufficient and mackenzie the groom found himself wondering just what was going to happen when he finally lost his own control and clouted the wee fiend as a lad he would himself have been beaten senseless by the nearest male relative within earshot had he ever dared to address a woman the way he had heard willie speak to his aunt and the maidservants and the impulse to haul willie into a deserted box stall and attempt to correct his manners was increasingly frequent still for the most part he had nothing but joy in willie the boy adored mackenzie and as he grew older would spend hours in his company riding on the huge draft horses as they pulled the heavy roller through the high fields and perched precariously on the hay wagons as they came down from the upper pastures in summer there was a threat to this peaceful existence though which grew greater with each passing month ironically the threat came from willie himself and was one he could not help what a handsome little lad he is to be sure and such a lovely little rider it was lady grozier who spoke standing on the veranda with lady dunsany to admire willies peregrinations on his pony around the edge of the lawn willies grandmother laughed eyeing the boy fondly oh yes he loves his pony we have a terrible time getting him even to come indoors for meals and hes even more fond of his groom we joke sometimes that he spends so much time with mackenzie that hes even starting to look like mackenzie lady grozier who had of course paid no attention to a groom now glanced in mackenzies direction why youre right she exclaimed much amused just look willies got just that same cock to his head and the same set to his shoulders how funny jamie bowed respectfully to the ladies but felt cold sweat pop out on his face he had seen this coming but hadnt wanted to believe the resemblance was sufficiently pronounced as to be visible to anyone but himself willie as a baby had been fat and puddingfaced and resembled no one at all as he had grown though the pudginess had vanished from cheeks and chin and while his nose was still the soft snub of childhood the hint of high broad cheekbones was apparent and the slatyblue eyes of babyhood had grown dark blue and clear thickly fringed with sooty lashes and slightly slanted in appearance once the ladies had gone into the house and he could be sure no one was watching jamie passed a hand furtively over his own features was the resemblance truly that great willies hair was a soft middle brown with just a tinge of his mothers chestnut gleam and those large translucent earssurely his own didnt stick out like that the trouble was that jamie fraser had not actually seen himself clearly for several years grooms did not have looking glasses and he had sedulously avoided the company of the maids who might have provided him with one moving to the watering trough he bent over it casually as though inspecting one of the water striders that skated over its surface beneath the wavering surface flecked with floating bits of hay and crisscrossed by the dimpling striders his own face stared up at him he swallowed and saw the reflections throat move it was by no means a complete resemblance but it was definitely there more in the set and shape of the head and shoulders as lady grozier had observedbut most definitely the eyes as well fraser eyes his father brian had had them and his sister jenny as well let the boys bones go on pressing through his skin let the childsnub nose grow long and straight and the cheekbones still broaderand anyone would be able to see it the reflection in the trough vanished as he straightened up and stood staring blindly at the stable that had been home for the last several years it was july and the sun was hot but it made no impression on the chill that numbed his fingers and sent a shiver up his back it was time to speak to lady dunsany by the middle of september everything had been arranged the pardon had been procured john grey had brought it the day before jamie had a small amount of money saved enough for traveling expenses and lady dunsany had given him a decent horse the only thing that remained was to bid farewell to his acquaintances at helwaterand willie i shall be leaving tomorrow jamie spoke matteroffactly not taking his eyes off the bay mares fetlock the horny growth he was filing flaked away leaving a dust of coarse black shavings on the stable floor where are you going to derwentwater can i come with you william viscount dunsany ninth earl of ellesmere hopped down from the edge of the box stall landing with a thump that made the bay mare start and snort dont do that jamie said automatically have i not told ye to move quiet near milly shes skittish why youd be skittish too if i squeezed your knee one big hand darted out and pinched the muscle just above the boys knee willie squeaked and jerked back giggling can i ride millyflower when youre done mac no jamie answered patiently for the dozenth time that day ive told ye a thousand times shes too big for ye yet but i want to ride her jamie sighed but didnt answer instead moving around to the other side of milles fleurs and picking up the left hoof i said i want to ride milly i heard ye then saddle her for me right now the ninth earl of ellesmere had his chin thrust out as far as it would go but the defiant look in his eye was tempered with a certain doubt as he intercepted jamies cold blue gaze jamie set the horses hoof down slowly just as slowly stood up and drawing himself to his full height of six feet four put his hands on his hips looked down at the earl three feet six and said very softly no yes willie stamped his foot on the haystrewn floor you have to do what i tell you no i dont yes you do no i shaking his head hard enough to make the red hair fly about his ears jamie pressed his lips tight together then squatted down in front of the boy see here he said i havena got to do what ye say for im no longer going to be groom here i told ye i shall be leaving tomorrow willies face went quite blank with shock and the freckles on his nose stood out dark against the fair skin you cant he said you cant leave i have to no the small earl clenched his jaw which gave him a truly startling resemblance to his paternal greatgrandfather jamie thanked his stars that no one at helwater had likely ever seen simon fraser lord lovat i wont let you go for once my lord ye have nothing to say about it jamie replied firmly his distress at leaving tempered somewhat by finally being allowed to speak his mind to the boy if you leave willie looked around helplessly for a threat and spotted one easily to hand if you leave he repeated more confidently ill scream and shout and scare all the horses so there make a peep ye little fiend and ill smack ye a good one freed from his usual reserve and alarmed at the thought of this spoiled brat upsetting the highlystrung and valuable horses jamie glared at the boy the earls eyes bulged with rage and his face went red he took a deep breath then whirled and ran down the length of the stable shrieking and waving his arms milles fleurs already on edge from having her hoofs fiddled with reared and plunged neighing loudly her distress was echoed by kicks and highpitched whinnying from the box stalls nearby where willie was roaring out all the bad words he knewno small storeand kicking frenziedly at the doors of the stalls jamie succeeded in catching milles fleurss leadrope and with considerable effort managed to get the mare outside without damage to himself or the horse he tied her to the paddock fence and then strode back into the stable to deal with willie damn damn damn the earl was shrieking sluire quim shit swive without a word jamie grabbed the boy by the collar lifted him off his feet and carried him kicking and squirming to the farriers stool he had been using here he sat down flipped the earl over his knee and smacked his buttocks five or six times hard then he jerked the boy up and set him on his feet i hate you the viscounts tearsmudged face was bright red and his fists trembled with rage well im no verra fond of you either ye little bastard jamie snapped willie drew himself up fists clenched purple in the face im not a bastard he shrieked im not im not take it back nobody can say that to me take it back i said jamie stared at the boy in shock there had been talk then and willie had heard it he had delayed his going too long he drew a deep breath and then another and hoped that his voice would not tremble i take it back he said softly i shouldna have used the word my lord he wanted to kneel and embrace the boy or pick him up and comfort him against his shoulderbut that was not a gesture a groom might make to an earl even a young one the palm of his left hand stung and he curled his fingers tight over the only fatherly caress he was ever likely to give his son willie knew how an earl should behave he was making a masterful effort to subdue his tears sniffing ferociously and swiping at his face with a sleeve allow me my lord jamie did kneel then and wiped the little boys face gently with his own coarse handkerchief willies eyes looked at him over the cotton folds redrimmed and woeful have you really got to go mac he asked in a very small voice aye i have he looked into the dark blue eyes so heartbreakingly like his own and suddenly didnt give a damn what was right or who saw he pulled the boy roughly to him hugging him tight against his heart holding the boys face close to his shoulder that willie might not see the quick tears that fell into his thick soft hair willies arms went around his neck and clung tight he could feel the small sturdy body shake against him with the force of suppressed sobbing he patted the flat little back and smoothed willies hair and murmured things in gaelic that he hoped the boy would not understand at length he took the boys arms from his neck and put him gently away come wi me to my room willie i shall give ye something to keep he had long since moved from the hayloft taking over hughess snuggery beside the tack room when the elderly head groom retired it was a small room and very plainly furnished but it had the twin virtues of warmth and privacy besides the bed the stool and a chamber pot there was a small table on which stood the few books that he owned a large candle in a pottery candlestick and a smaller candle thick and squat that stood to one side before a small statue of the virgin it was a cheap wooden carving that jenny had sent him but it had been made in france and was not without artistry whats that little candle for willie asked grannie says only stinking papists burn candles in front of heathen images well i am a stinking papist jamie said with a wry twist of his mouth its no a heathen image though its a statue of the blessed mother you are clearly this revelation only added to the boys fascination why do papists burn candles before statues then jamie rubbed a hand through his hair aye well itsmaybe a way of prayingand remembering ye light the candle and say a prayer and think of people ye care for and while it burns the flame remembers them for ye who do you remember willie glanced up at him his hair was standing on end rumpled by his earlier distress but his blue eyes were clear with interest oh a good many people my family in the highlandsmy sister and her family friends my wife and sometimes the candle burned in memory of a young and reckless girl named geneva but he did not say that willie frowned you havent got a wife no not anymore but i remember her always willie put out a stubby forefinger and cautiously touched the little statue the womans hands were spread in welcome a tender maternity engraved on the lovely face i want to be a stinking papist too willie said firmly ye canna do that jamie exclaimed halfamused halftouched at the notion your grandmama and your auntie would go mad would they froth at the mouth like that mad fox you killed willie brightened i shouldna wonder jamie said dryly i want to do it the small clear features were set in determination i wont tell grannie or auntie isobel i wont tell anybody please mac please let me i want to be like you jamie hesitated both touched by the boys earnestness and suddenly wanting to leave his son with something more than the carved wooden horse he had made to leave as a farewell present he tried to remember what father mcmurtry had taught them in the schoolroom about baptism it was all right for a lay person to do it he thought provided that the situation was an emergency and no priest was to hand it might be stretching a point to call the present situation an emergency buta sudden impulse made him reach down the jug of water that he kept on the sill the eyes that were like his watched wide and solemn as he carefully brushed the soft brown hair back from the high brow he dipped three fingers into the water and carefully traced a cross on the lads forehead i baptize thee william james he said softly in the name o the father the son and the holy ghost amen willie blinked crossing his eyes as a drop of water rolled down his nose he stuck out his tongue to catch it and jamie laughed despite himself why did you call me william james willie asked curiously my other names are clarence henry george he made a face clarence wasnt his idea of a good name jamie hid a smile ye get a new name when youre baptized james is your special papist name its mine too it is willie was delighted im a stinking papist now like you aye as much as i can manage at least he smiled down at willie then struck by another impulse reached into the neck of his shirt here keep this too to remember me by he laid the beechwood rosary gently over willies head ye canna let anyone see that though he warned and for gods sake dinna tell anyone youre a papist i wont willie promised not a soul he tucked the rosary into his shirt patting carefully to be sure that it was hidden good jamie reached out and ruffled willies hair in dismissal its almost time for your tea yed best go on up to the house now willie started for the door but stopped halfway suddenly distressed again with a hand pressed flat to his chest you said to keep this to remember you but i havent got anything for you to remember me by jamie smiled slightly his heart was squeezed so tight he thought he could not draw breath to speak but he forced the words out dinna fret yourself he said ill remember ye monsters rising loch ness august brianna blinked brushing back a bright web of hair caught by the wind id almost forgotten what the sun looks like she said squinting at the object in question shining with unaccustomed ferocity on the dark waters of loch ness her mother stretched luxuriously enjoying the light wind to say nothing of what fresh air is like i feel like a toadstool thats been growing in the dark for weeksall pale and squashy fine scholars the two of you would make roger said but grinned all three of them were in high spirits after the arduous slog through the prison records to narrow the search to ardsmuir they had had a run of luck the records for ardsmuir were complete in one spot andin comparison to most othersremarkably clear ardsmuir had been a prison for only fifteen years following its renovation by jacobite prisonlabor it had been converted into a small permanent garrison and the prison population dispersedmostly transported to the american colonies i still cant imagine why fraser wasnt sent along to america with the rest roger said he had had a moments panic there going over and over the list of transported convicts from ardsmuir searching the names one by one nearly letter by letter and still finding no frasers he had been certain that jamie fraser had died in prison and had been in a cold sweat of fear over the thought of telling the randall womenuntil the flip of a page had showed him frasers parole to a place named helwater i dont know claire said but its a bloody good thing he wasnt heshe was she caught herself quickly but not quickly enough to stop roger noticing the slipterribly terribly seasick she gestured at the surface of the loch before them dancing with tiny waves even going out on something like that would turn him green in minutes roger glanced at brianna with interest are you seasick she shook her head bright hair lifting in the wind nah she patted her bare midriff smugly castiron roger laughed want to go out then its your holiday after all really could we can you fish in there brianna shaded her eyes looking eagerly out over the dark water certainly ive caught salmon and eels many a time in loch ness roger assured her come along well rent a wee boat at the dock in drumnadrochit the drive to drumnadrochit was a delight the day was one of those clear bright summer days that cause tourists from the south to stampede into scotland in droves during august and september with one of fionas larger breakfasts inside him one of her lunches stowed in a basket in the boot and brianna randall long hair blowing in the wind seated beside him roger was strongly disposed to consider that all was right with the world he allowed himself to dwell with satisfaction on the results of their researches it had meant taking additional leave from his college for the summer term but it had been worth it after finding the record of james frasers parole it had taken another two weeks of slog and inquiryeven a quick weekend trip by roger and bree to the lake district another by all three of them to londonand then the sight that had made brianna whoop out loud in the middle of the british museums sacrosanct reading room causing their hasty departure amid waves of icy disapproval the sight of the royal warrant of pardon stamped with the seal of george iii rex angleterre dated bearing the name of james alexdrl mkensie frazier were getting close roger had said gloating over the photocopy of the warrant of pardon bloody close close brianna had said but then had been distracted by the sight of their bus approaching and had not pursued the matter roger had caught claires eye on him though she knew very well what he meant she would of course have been thinking of it he wondered whether brianna had claire had disappeared into the past in vanishing through the circle of standing stones on craigh na dun and reappearing in she had lived with jamie fraser for nearly three years then returned through the stones and she had come back nearly three years past the time of her original disappearance in april of all of which meantjust possiblythat if she were disposed to try the trip back through the stones once more she would likely arrive twenty years past the time she had leftin and was only two years past the latest known date at which jamie fraser had been located alive and well if he had survived another two years and if roger could find him there it is brianna said suddenly boats for rent she pointed at the sign in the window of the dockside pub and roger nosed the car into a parking slot outside with no further thought of jamie fraser i wonder why short men are so often enamored of very tall women claires voice behind him echoed rogers thoughts with an uncanny accuracyand not for the first time moth and flame syndrome perhaps roger suggested frowning at the diminutive barmans evident fascination with brianna he and claire were standing before the counter for rentals waiting for the clerk to write up the receipt while brianna bought bottles of cocacola and brown ale to augment their lunch the young barman who came up approximately to briannas armpit was hopping to and fro offering pickled eggs and slices of smoked tongue eyes worshipfully upturned to the yellowhaltered goddess before him from her laughter brianna appeared to think the man cute i always told bree not to get involved with short men claire observed watching this did you roger said dryly somehow i didnt envision you being all that much in the motherly advice line she laughed disregarding his momentary sourness well im not all that much when you notice an important principle like that though it seems ones motherly duty to pass it along something wrong with short men is there roger inquired they tend to turn mean if they dont get their way claire answered like small yapping dogs cute and fluffy but cross them and youre likely to get a nasty nip in the ankle roger laughed this observation is the result of years of experience i take it oh yes she nodded glancing up at him ive never met an orchestra conductor over five feet tall vicious specimens practically all of them but tall menher lips curved slightly as she surveyed his sixfeetthreeinch frametall men are almost always very sweet and gentle sweet eh said roger with a cynical glance at the barman who was cutting up a jellied eel for brianna her face expressed a wary distaste but she leaned forward wrinkling her nose as she took the bite offered on a fork with women claire amplified ive always thought its because they realize that they dont have anything to prove when its perfectly obvious that they can do anything they like whether you want them to or not they dont need to try to prove it while a short man roger prompted while a short one knows he cant do anything unless you let him and the knowledge drives him mad so hes always trying something on just to prove he can mmphm roger made a scottish noise in the back of his throat meant to convey both appreciation of claires acuity and general suspicion of what the barman might be wanting to prove to brianna thanks he said to the clerk who shoved the receipt across the counter to him ready bree he asked the loch was calm and the fishing slow but it was pleasant on the water with the august sun warm on their backs and the scent of raspberry canes and sunwarmed pine trees wafting from the nearby shore full of lunch they all grew drowsy and before long brianna was curled up in the bow asleep with her head pillowed on rogers jacket claire sat in the stern blinking but still awake what about short and tall women roger asked resuming their earlier conversation as he sculled slowly across the loch he glanced over his shoulder at the amazing length of briannas legs awkwardly curled under her same thing the little ones nasty claire shook her head meditatively the curls beginning to work their way loose from her hairclip no i dont think so it doesnt seem to have anything to do with size i think its more a matter of whether they see men as the enemy or just see them as men and on the whole rather like them for it oh to do with womens liberation is it no not at all claire said i saw just the same kinds of behavior between men and women in that you see now some differences of course in how they each behave but not so much in how they behave to each other she looked out over the dark waters of the loch shading her eyes with her hand she might have been keeping an eye out for otters and floating logs but roger thought that farseeing gaze was looking a bit farther than the cliffs of the opposite shore you like men dont you he said quietly tall men she smiled briefly not looking at him one she said softly will you go thenif i can find him he rested his oars momentarily watching her she drew a deep breath before answering the wind flushed her cheeks with pink and molded the fabric of the white shirt to her figure showing off a high bosom and a slender waist too young to be a widow he thought too lovely to be wasted i dont know she said a little shakily the thought of itor rather the thoughts of it on the one hand to find jamieand then on the other togo through again a shudder went through her closing her eyes its indescribable you know she said eyes still closed as though she saw inside them the ring of stones on craigh na dun horrible but horrible in a way that isnt like other horrible things so you cant say she opened her eyes and smiled wryly at him a bit like trying to tell a man what having a baby is like he can more or less grasp the idea that its painful but he isnt equipped actually to understand what it feels like roger grunted with amusement oh aye well theres some difference you know ive actually heard those bloody stones he shivered himself involuntarily the memory of the night three months ago when gillian edgars had gone through the stones was not one he willingly called to mind it had come back to him in nightmares several times though he heaved strongly on the oars trying to erase it like being torn apart isnt it he said his eyes intent on hers theres something pulling at you ripping dragging and not just outsideinside you as well so you feel your skull will fly to pieces any moment and the filthy noise he shuddered again claires face had gone slightly pale i didnt know you could hear them she said you didnt tell me it didnt seem important he studied her a moment as he pulled then added quietly bree heard them as well i see she turned to look back over the loch where the wake of the tiny boat spread its vshaped wings far behind the waves from the passage of a larger boat reflected back from the cliffs and joined again in the center of the loch making a long humped form of glistening watera standing wave a phenomenon of the loch that had often been mistaken for a sighting of the monster its there you know she said suddenly nodding down into the black peatladen water he opened his mouth to ask what she meant but then realized that he did know he had lived near loch ness for most of his life fished for eels and salmon in its waters and heardand laughed atevery story of the fearsome beastie that had ever been told in the pubs of drumnadrochit and fort augustus perhaps it was the unlikeliness of the situationsitting here calmly discussing whether the woman with him should or should not take the unimaginable risk of catapulting herself into an unknown past whatever the cause of his certainty it seemed suddenly not only possible but sure that the dark water of the loch hid unknown but fleshly mystery what do you think it is he asked as much to give his disturbed feelings time to settle as out of curiosity claire leaned over the side watching intently as a log drifted into view the one i saw was probably a plesiosaur she said at last she didnt look at roger but kept her gaze astern though i didnt take notes at the time her mouth twisted in something not quite a smile how many stone circles are there she asked abruptly in britain in europe do you know not exactly several hundred though he answered cautiously do you think theyre all how should i know she interrupted impatiently the point is they may be they were set up to mark something which means there may be the hell of a lot of places where that something has happened she tilted her head to one side wiping the windblown hair out of her face and gave him a lopsided smile that would explain it you know explain what roger felt fogged by the rapid shifts of her conversation the monster she gestured out over the water what if theres another of thoseplacesunder the loch a time corridorpassagewhatever roger looked out over the purling wake staggered by the idea it would explain a lot there was a smile hiding at the corner of her mouth behind the veil of blowing hair he couldnt tell whether she was serious or not the best candidates for monster are all things that have been extinct for hundreds of thousands of years if theres a time passage under the loch that would take care of that little problem it would also explain why the reports are sometimes different roger said becoming intrigued by the idea if its different creatures who come through and it would explain why the creatureor creatureshavent been caught and arent seen all that often maybe they go back the other way too so they arent in the loch all the time what a marvelous idea roger said he and claire grinned at each other you know what she said ill bet that isnt going to make it on the list of popular theories roger laughed catching a crab and droplets of water sprayed over brianna she snorted sat up abruptly blinking then sank back down face flushed with sleep and was breathing heavily within seconds she was up late last night helping me box up the last set of records to go back to the university of leeds roger said defensive on her behalf claire nodded abstractedly watching her daughter jamie could do that she said softly lie down and sleep anywhere she fell silent roger rowed steadily on toward the point of the loch where the grim bulk of the ruins of castle urquhart stood amid its pines the thing is claire said at last it gets harder going through the first time was the most terrible thing id ever had happen to me coming back was a thousand times worse her eyes were fixed on the looming castle i dont know whether it was because i didnt come back on the right dayit was beltane when i went and two weeks before when i came back geiliegillian i meanshe went on beltane too in spite of the heat of the day roger felt slightly cold seeing again the figure of the woman who had been both his ancestor and his contemporary standing in the light of a blazing bonfire fixed for a moment in the light before disappearing forever into the cleft of the standing stones thats what her notebook saidthat the door is open on the sun feasts and the fire feasts perhaps its only partly open as you near those times or perhaps she was wrong altogether after all she thought you had to have a human sacrifice to make it work claire swallowed heavily the petrolsoaked remains of greg edgars gillians husband had been recovered from the stone circle by the police on may day the record concluded of his wife only fled whereabouts unknown claire leaned over the side trailing a hand in the water a small cloud drifted over the sun turning the loch a sudden gray with dozens of small waves rising on the surface as the light wind increased directly below in the wake of the boat the water was darkly impenetrable seven hundred feet deep is loch ness and bitter cold what can live in a place like that would you go down there roger she asked softly jump overboard dive in go on down through that dark until your lungs were bursting not knowing whether there are things with teeth and great heavy bodies waiting roger felt the hair on his arms rise and not only because the sudden wind was chilly but thats not all the question she continued still staring into the blank mysterious water would you go if brianna were down there she straightened up and turned to face him would you go the amber eyes were intent on his unblinking as a hawks he licked his lips chapped and dried by the wind and cast a quick look over his shoulder at brianna sleeping he turned back to face claire yes i think i would she looked at him for a long moment and then nodded unsmiling so would i part five you cant go home again roots september the woman next to me probably weighed three hundred pounds she wheezed in her sleep lungs laboring to lift the burden of her massive bosom for the twohundredthousandth time her hip and thigh and pudgy arm pressed against mine unpleasantly warm and damp there was no escape i was pinned on the other side by the steel curve of the planes fuselage i eased one arm upward and flicked on the overhead light in order to see my watch tenthirty by london time at least another six hours before the landing in new york promised escape the plane was filled with the collective sighs and snorts of passengers dozing as best they might sleep for me was out of the question with a sigh of resignation i dug into the pocket in front of me for the halffinished romance novel i had stashed there the tale was by one of my favorite authors but i found my attention slipping from the bookeither back to roger and brianna whom i had left in edinburgh there to continue the hunt or forward to what awaited me in boston i wasnt sure just what did await me which was part of the problem i had been obliged to come back if only temporarily i had long since exhausted my vacation plus several extensions there were matters to be dealt with at the hospital bills to be collected and paid at home the maintenance of the house and yard to be attended toi shuddered to think what heights the lawn in the backyard must have attained by nowfriends to be called on one friend in particular joseph abernathy had been my closest friend from medical school on before i made any finaland likely irrevocabledecisions i wanted to talk to him i closed the book in my lap and sat tracing the extravagant loops of the title with one finger smiling a little among other things i owed a taste for romance novels to joe i had known joe since the beginning of my medical training he stood out among the other interns at boston general just as i did i was the only woman among the budding doctors joe was the only black intern our shared singularity gave us each a special awareness for the other both of us sensed it clearly though neither mentioned it we worked together very well but both of us were waryfor good reasonof exposing ourselves and the tenuous bond between us much too nebulous to be called friendship remained unacknowledged until near the end of our internship i had done my first unassisted surgery that dayan uncomplicated appendectomy done on a teenaged boy in good health it had gone well and there was no reason to think there would be postoperative complications still i felt an odd kind of possessiveness about the boy and didnt want to go home until he was awake and out of recovery even though my shift had ended i changed clothes and went to the doctors lounge on the third floor to wait the lounge wasnt empty joseph abernathy sat in one of the rumpsprung stuffed chairs apparently absorbed in a copy of us news world report he looked up as i entered and nodded briefly to me before returning to his reading the lounge was equipped with stacks of magazinessalvaged from the waiting roomsand a number of tattered paperbacks abandoned by departing patients seeking distraction i thumbed past a sixmonthold copy of studies in gastroenterology a ragged copy of time magazine and a neat stack of watchtower tracts finally picking up one of the books i sat down with it it had no cover but the title page read the impetuous pirate a sensuous compelling love story boundless as the spanish main said the line beneath the title the spanish main eh if escape was what i wanted i couldnt do much better i thought and opened the book at random it fell open automatically to page tipping up her nose scornfully tessa tossed her lush blond tresses back oblivious to the fact that this caused her voluptuous breasts to become even more prominent in the lownecked dress valdezs eyes widened at the sight but he gave no outward sign of the effect such wanton beauty had on him i thought that we might become better acquainted señorita he suggested in a low sultry voice that made little shivers of anticipation run up and down tessas back i have no interest in becoming acquainted with aafilthy despicable underhanded pirate she said valdezs teeth gleamed as he smiled at her his hand stroking the handle of the dagger at his belt he was impressed at her fearlessness so bold so impetuousand so beautiful i raised an eyebrow but went on reading fascinated with an air of imperious possession valdez swooped an arm about tessas waist you forget señorita he murmured the words tickling her sensitive earlobe you are a prize of war and the captain of a pirate ship has first choice of the booty tessa struggled in his powerful arms as he bore her to the berth and tossed her lightly onto the jeweled coverlet she struggled to catch her breath watching in terror as he undressed laying aside his azureblue velvet coat and then the fine ruffled white linen shirt his chest was magnificent a smooth expanse of gleaming bronze her fingertips ached to touch it even though her heart pounded deafeningly in her ears as he reached for the waistband of his breeches but no he said pausing it is unfair of me to neglect you señorita allow me with an irresistible smile he bent and gently cupped tessas breasts in the heated palms of his calloused hands enjoying the voluptuous weight of them through the thin silken fabric with a small scream tessa shrank away from his probing touch pressing back against the laceembroidered feather pillow you resist what a pity to spoil such fine clothing señorita he took a firm grasp on her jadesilk bodice and yanked causing tessas fine white breasts to leap out of their concealment like a pair of plump partridges taking wing i made a sound causing dr abernathy to look sharply over the top of his us news world report hastily rearranging my face into a semblance of dignified absorption i turned the page valdezs thick black curls swept her chest as he fastened his hot lips on tessas rosepink nipples making waves of anguished desire wash through her being weakened by the unaccustomed feelings that his ardor aroused in her she was unable to move as his hand stealthily sought the hem of her gown and his blazing touch traced tendrils of sensation up the length of her slender thigh ah mi amor he groaned so lovely so pure you drive me mad with desire mi amor i have wanted you since i first saw you so proud and cold on the deck of your fathers ship but not so cold now my dear eh in fact valdezs kisses were wreaking havoc on tessas feelings how how could she be feeling such things for this man who had coldbloodedly sunk her fathers ship and murdered a hundred men with his own hands she should be recoiling in horror but instead she found herself gasping for breath opening her mouth to receive his burning kisses arching her body in involuntary abandon beneath the demanding pressure of his burgeoning manhood ah mi amor he gasped i cannot wait buti do not wish to hurt you gently mi amor gently tessa gasped as she felt the increasing pressure of his desire making its presence known between her legs oh she said oh please you cant i dont want you to fine time to start making protests i thought dont worry mi amor trust me gradually little by little she relaxed under the touch of his hypnotic caresses feeling the warmth in her stomach grow and spread his lips brushed her breast and his hot breath murmuring reassurances took away all her resistance as she relaxed her thighs opened without her willing it moving with infinite slowness his engorged shaft teased aside the membrane of her innocence i let out a whoop and lost my grasp on the book which slid off my lap and fell on the floor with a plop near dr abernathys feet excuse me i murmured and bent to retrieve it my face flaming as i came up with the impetuous pirate in my sweaty grasp though i saw that far from preserving his usual austere mien dr abernathy was grinning widely let me guess he said valdez just teased aside the membrane of her innocence yes i said breaking out into helpless giggling again how did you know well you werent too far into it he said taking the book from my hand his short blunt fingers flicked the pages expertly it had to be that one or maybe the one on page where he laves her pink mounds with his hungry tongue he what see for yourself he thrust the book back into my hands pointing to a spot halfway down the page sure enough lifting aside the coverlet he bent his coalblack head and laved her pink mounds with his hungry tongue tessa moaned and i gave an unhinged shriek youve actually read this i demanded tearing my eyes away from tessa and valdez oh yeah he said the grin widening he had a gold tooth far back on the right side two or three times its not the best one but it isnt bad the best one there are more like this sure lets see he rose and began digging through the pile of tattered paperbacks on the table you want to look for the ones with no covers he explained those are the best and here i thought you never read anything but lancet and the journal of the amai said what i spend thirtysix hours up to my elbows in peoples guts and i want to come up here and read advances in gallbladder resection hell noid rather sail the spanish main with valdez he eyed me with some interest the grin still not quite gone i didnt think you read anything but the new england journal of medicine either lady jane he said appearances are deceiving huh must be i said dryly whats this lady jane oh hoechstein started that one he said leaning back with his fingers linked around one knee its the voice that accent that sounds like you just drank tea with the queen thats what youve got keeps the guys from bein worse than they are see you sound like winston churchillif winston churchill was a lady that isand that scares them a little youve got somethin else thoughhe viewed me thoughtfully rocking back in his chair you have a way of talking like you expect to get your way and if you dont youll know the reason why whered you learn that in the war i said smiling at his description his eyebrows went up korea no i was a combat nurse during the second world war in france i saw a lot of head matrons who could turn interns and orderlies to jelly with a glance and later i had had a good deal of practice where that air of inviolate authorityassumed though it might behad stood me in good stead against people with a great deal more power than the nursing staff and interns of boston general hospital he nodded absorbed in my explanation yeah that makes sense i used walter cronkite myself walter cronkite i goggled at him he grinned again showing his gold tooth you can think of somebody better besides i got to hear him for free on the radio or the tv every night i used to entertain my mamashe wanted me to be a preacher he smiled half ruefully if i talked like walter cronkite where we lived in those days i wouldnt have lived to go to med school i was liking joe abernathy more by the second i hope your mother wasnt disappointed that you became a doctor intstead of a preacher tell you the truth im not sure he said still grinning when i told her she stared at me for a minute then heaved a big sigh and said well at least you can get my rheumatism medicine for me cheap i laughed wryly i didnt get that much enthusiasm when i told my husband i was going to be a doctor he stared at me and finally said if i was bored why didnt i volunteer to write letters for the inmates of the nursing home joes eyes were a soft golden brown like toffee drops there was a glint of humor in them as they fixed on me yeah folks still think its fine to say to your face that you cant be doing what youre doing why are you here little lady and not home minding your man and child he mimicked he grinned wryly and patted my hand dont worry theyll give it up sooner or later they mostly dont ask me to my face anymore why i aint cleanin the toilets like god made me to then the nurse had come with word that my appendix was awake and i had left but the friendship begun on page had flourished and joe abernathy had become one of my best friends possibly the only person close to me who truly understood what i did and why i smiled a little feeling the slickness of the embossing on the cover then i leaned forward and put the book back into the seat pocket perhaps i didnt want to escape just now outside a floor of moonlit cloud cut us off from the earth below up here everything was silent beautiful and serene in marked contrast to the turmoil of life below i had the odd feeling of being suspended motionless cocooned in solitude even the heavy breathing of the woman next to me only a part of the white noise that makes up silence one with the tepid rush of the airconditioning and the shuffle of the stewardesses shoes along the carpet at the same time i knew we were rushing on inexorably through the air propelled at hundreds of miles per hour to some endas for it being a safe one we could only hope i closed my eyes in suspended animation back in scotland roger and bree were hunting jamie ahead in boston my joband joewere waiting and jamie himself i tried to push the thought away determined not to think of him until the decision was made i felt a slight ruffling of my hair and one lock brushed against my cheek light as a lovers touch but surely it was no more than the rush of air from the vent overhead and my imagination that the stale smells of perfume and cigarettes were suddenly underlaid by the scents of wool and heather to lay a ghost home at last to the house on furey street where i had lived with frank and brianna for nearly twenty years the azaleas by the door were not quite dead but their leaves hung in limp shabby clusters a thick layer of fallen leaves curling on the drybaked bed underneath it was a hot summerthere wasnt any other kind in bostonand the august rains hadnt come even though it was midseptember by now i set my bags by the front door and went to turn on the hose it had been lying in the sun the green rubber snake was hot enough to burn my hand and i shifted it uneasily from palm to palm until the rumble of water brought it suddenly alive and cooled it with a burst of spray i didnt like azaleas all that much to start with i would have pulled them out long since but i had been reluctant to alter any detail of the house after franks death for briannas sake enough of a shock i thought to begin university and have your father die in one year without more changes i had been ignoring the house for a long time i could go on doing so all right i said crossly to the azaleas as i turned off the hose i hope youre happy because thats all you get i want to go have a drink myself and a bath i added seeing their mudspattered leaves i sat on the edge of the big sunken tub in my dressing gown watching the water thunder in churning the bubble bath into clouds of perfumed seafoam steam rose from the boiling surface the water would be almost too hot i turned it offone quick neat twist of the tapand sat for a moment the house around me still save for the crackle of popping bath bubbles faint as the sounds of a faroff battle i realized perfectly well what i was doing i had been doing it ever since i stepped aboard the flying scotsman in inverness and felt the thrum of the track come alive beneath my feet i was testing myself i had been taking careful note of the machinesall the contrivances of modern daily lifeand more important of my own response to them the train to edinburgh the plane to boston the taxicab from the airport and all the dozens of tiny mechanical flourishes attendingvending machines street lights the planes milehigh lavatory with its swirl of nasty bluegreen disinfectant whisking waste and germs away with the push of a button restaurants with their tidy certificates from the department of health guaranteeing at least a better than even chance of escaping food poisoning when eating therein inside my own house the omnipresent buttons that supplied light and heat and water and cooked food the question wasdid i care i dipped a hand into the steaming bathwater and swirled it to and fro watching the shadows of the vortex dancing in the marble depths could i live without all the conveniences large and small to which i was accustomed i had been asking myself that with each touch of a button each rumble of a motor and was quite sure that the answer was yes time didnt make all the difference after all i could walk across the city and find people who lived without many of these conveniencesfarther abroad and there were entire countries where people lived in reasonable content and complete ignorance of electricity for myself i had never cared a lot i had lived with my uncle lamb an eminent archaeologist since my own parents death when i was five consequently i had grown up in conditions that could conservatively be called primitive as i accompanied him on all his field expeditions yes hot baths and light bulbs were nice but i had lived without them during several periods of my lifeduring the war for instanceand never found the lack of them acute the water had cooled enough to be tolerable i dropped the dressing gown on the floor and stepped in feeling a pleasant shiver as the heat at my feet made my shoulders prickle in cool contrast i subsided into the tub and relaxed stretching my legs eighteenthcentury hip baths were barely more than large barrels one normally bathed in segments immersing the center of the body first with the legs hanging outside then stood up and rinsed the upper torso while soaking the feet more frequently one bathed from a pitcher and basin with the aid of a cloth no conveniences and comforts were merely that nothing essential nothing i couldnt do without not that conveniences were the only issue by a long chalk the past was a dangerous country but even the advances of socalled civilization were no guarantee of safety i had lived through two major modern warsactually served on the battlefields of one of themand could see another taking shape on the telly every evening civilized warfare was if anything more horrifying than its older versions daily life might be safer but only if one chose ones walk in it with care parts of roxbury now were as dangerous as any alley i had walked in the paris of two hundred years past i sighed and pulled up the plug with my toes no use speculating about impersonal things like bathtubs bombs and rapists indoor plumbing was no more than a minor distraction the real issue was the people involved and always had been me and brianna and jamie the last of the water gurgled away i stood up feeling slightly lightheaded and wiped away the last of the bubbles the big mirror was misted with steam but clear enough to show me myself from the knees upward pink as a boiled shrimp dropping the towel i looked myself over flexed my arms raised them overhead checking for bagginess none biceps and triceps all nicely defined deltoids neatly rounded and sloping into the high curve of the pectoralis major i turned slightly to one side tensing and relaxing my abdominalsobliques in decent tone the rectus abdominis flattening almost to concavity good thing the family doesnt run to fat i murmured uncle lamb had remained trim and taut to the day of his death at seventyfive i supposed my fatheruncle lambs brotherhad been constructed similarly and wondered suddenly what my mothers backside had looked like women after all had a certain amount of excess adipose tissue to contend with i turned all the way round and peered back over my shoulder at the mirror the long columnar muscles of my back gleamed wetly as i twisted i still had a waist and a good narrow one too as for my own backsidewell no dimples anyway i said aloud i turned around and stared at my reflection it could be a lot worse i said to it feeling somewhat heartened i put on my nightgown and went about the business of putting the house to bed no cats to put out no dogs to feedbozo the last of our dogs had died of old age the year before and i had not wanted to get another with brianna off at school and my own hours at the hospital long and irregular adjust the thermostat check the locks of windows and doors see that the burners of the stove were off that was all there was to it for eighteen years the nightly route had included a stop in briannas room but not since she had left for university moved by a mixture of habit and compulsion i pushed open the door to her room and clicked on the light some people have the knack of objects and others havent bree had it scarcely an inch of wall space showed between the posters photographs dried flowers scraps of tiedyed fabric framed certificates and other impedimenta on the walls some people have a way of arranging everything about them so the objects take on not only their own meaning and a relation to the other things displayed with them but something more besidesan indefinable aura that belongs as much to their invisible owner as to the objects themselves i am here because brianna placed me here the things in the room seemed to say i am here because she is who she is it was odd that she should have that really i thought frank had had it when i had gone to empty his university office after his death i had thought it like the fossilized cast of some extinct animal books and papers and bits of rubbish holding exactly the shape and texture and vanished weight of the mind that had inhabited the space for some of briannas objects the relation to her was obviouspictures of me of frank of bozo of friends the scraps of fabric were ones she had made her chosen patterns the colors she likeda brilliant turquoise deep indigo magenta and clear yellow but other thingswhy should the scatter of dried freshwater snail shells on the bureau say to me brianna why that one lump of rounded pumice taken from the beach at truro indistinguishable from a hundred thousand othersexcept for the fact that she had taken it i didnt have a way with objects i had no impulse either to acquire or to decoratefrank had often complained of the spartan furnishings at home until brianna grew old enough to take a hand whether it was the fault of my nomadic upbringing or only the way i was i lived mostly inside my skin with no impulse to alter my surroundings to reflect me jamie was the same he had had the few small objects always carried in his sporran for utility or as talismans and beyond that had neither owned nor cared for things even during the short period when we had lived luxuriously in paris and the longer time of tranquillity at lallybroch he had never shown any disposition to acquire objects for him as well it might have been the circumstances of his early manhood when he had lived like a hunted animal never owning anything beyond the weapons he depended on for survival but perhaps it was natural to him also this isolation from the world of things this sense of selfsufficiencyone of the things that had made us seek completion in each other odd all the same that brianna should have so much resembled both her fathers in their very different ways i said a silent good night to the ghost of my absent daughter and put out the light the thought of frank went with me into the bedroom the sight of the big double bed smooth and untroubled under its dark blue satin spread brought him suddenly and vividly to mind in a way i had not thought of him in many months i supposed it was the possibility of impending departure that made me think of him now this roomthis bed in factwas where i had said goodbye to him for the last time cant you come to bed claire its past midnight frank looked up at me over the edge of his book he was already in bed himself reading with the book propped upon his knees the soft pool of light from the lamp made him look as though he were floating in a warm bubble serenely isolated from the dark chilliness of the rest of the room it was early january and despite the furnaces best efforts the only truly warm place at night was bed under heavy blankets i smiled at him and rose from my chair dropping the heavy wool dressing gown from my shoulders am i keeping you up sorry just reliving this mornings surgery yes i know he said dryly i can tell by looking at you your eyes glaze over and your mouth hangs open sorry i said again matching his tone i cant be responsible for what my face is doing when im thinking but what good does thinking do he asked sticking a bookmark in his book youve done whatever you couldworrying about it now wont changeah well he shrugged irritably and closed the book ive said it all before you have i said shortly i got into bed shivering slightly and tucked my gown down round my legs frank scooted automatically in my direction and i slid down under the sheets beside him huddling together to pool our warmth against the cold oh wait ive got to move the phone i flung back the covers and scrambled out again to move the phone from franks side of the bed to mine he liked to sit in bed in the early evening chatting with students and colleagues while i read or made surgical notes beside him but he resented being wakened by the late calls that came from the hospital for me resented it enough that i had arranged for the hospital to call only for absolute emergencies or when i left instructions to keep me informed of a specific patients progress tonight i had left instructions it was a tricky bowel resection if things went wrong i might have to go back in in a hurry frank grunted as i turned out the light and slipped into bed again but after a moment he rolled toward me throwing an arm across my middle i rolled onto my side and curled against him gradually relaxing as my chilled toes thawed i mentally replayed the details of the operation feeling again the chill at my feet from the refrigeration in the operating room and the initial unsettling feeling of the warmth in the patients belly as my gloved fingers slid inside the diseased bowel itself coiled like a viper patterned with the purple splotches of ecchymosis and the slow leakage of bright blood from tiny ruptures id been thinking franks voice came out of the darkness behind me excessively casual mm i was still absorbed in the vision of the surgery but struggled to pull myself back to the present about what my sabbatical his leave from the university was due to start in a month he had planned to make a series of short trips through the northeastern united states gathering material then go to england for six months returning to boston to spend the last three months of the sabbatical writing id thought of going to england straight off he said carefully well why not the weather will be dreadful but if youre going to spend most of the time in libraries i want to take brianna with me i stopped dead the cold in the room suddenly coalescing into a small lump of suspicion in the pit of my stomach she cant go now shes only a semester from graduation surely you can wait until we can join you in the summer ive put in for a long vacation then and perhaps im going now for good without you i pulled away and sat up turning on the light frank lay blinking up at me dark hair disheveled it had gone gray at the temples giving him a distinguished air that seemed to have alarming effects on the more susceptible of his female students i felt quite astonishingly composed why now all of a sudden the latest one putting pressure on you is she the look of alarm that flashed into his eyes was so pronounced as to be comical i laughed with a noticeable lack of humor you actually thought i didnt know god frank you are the mostoblivious man he sat up in bed jaw tight i thought i had been most discreet you may have been at that i said sardonically i counted six over the last ten yearsif there were really a dozen or so then you were quite the model of discretion his face seldom showed great emotion but a whitening beside his mouth told me that he was very angry indeed this one must be something special i said folding my arms and leaning back against the headboard in assumed casualness but stillwhy the rush to go to england now and why take bree she can go to boarding school for her last term he said shortly be a new experience for her not one i expect she wants i said she wont want to leave her friends especially not just before graduation and certainly not to go to an english boarding school i shuddered at the thought i had come within inches of being immured in just such a school as a child the scent of the hospital cafeteria sometimes evoked memories of it complete with the waves of terrified helplessness i had felt when uncle lamb had taken me to visit the place a little discipline never hurt anyone frank said he had recovered his temper but the lines of his face were still tight might have done you some good he waved a hand dismissing the topic let that be still ive decided to go back to england permanently ive a good position offered at cambridge and i mean to take it up you wont leave the hospital of course but i dont mean to leave my daughter behind your daughter i felt momentarily incapable of speech so he had a new job all set and a new mistress to go along hed been planning this for some time then a whole new lifebut not with brianna my daughter he said calmly you can come to visit whenever you like of course youbloodybastard i said do be reasonable claire he looked down his nose giving me treatment a longsuffering patience reserved for students appealing failing grades youre scarcely ever home if im gone there will be no one to look after bree properly you talk as though shes eight not almost eighteen for heavens sake shes nearly grown all the more reason she needs care and supervision he snapped if youd seen what id seen at the universitythe drinking the drugging the i do see it i said through my teeth at fairly close range in the emergency room bree is not likely to she damn well is girls have no sense at that ageshell be off with the first fellow who dont be idiotic brees very sensible besides all young people experiment thats how they learn you cant keep her swaddled in cotton wool all her life better swaddled than fucking a black man he shot back a mottled red showed faintly over his cheekbones like mother like daughter eh but thats not how its going to be damn it not if ive anything to say about it i heaved out of bed and stood up glaring down at him you i said have not got one bloody filthy stinking thing to say about bree or anything else i was trembling with rage and had to press my fists into the sides of my legs to keep from striking him you have the absolute unmitigated gall to tell me that you are leaving me to live with the latest of a succession of mistresses and then imply that i have been having an affair with joe abernathy that is what you mean isnt it he had the grace to lower his eyes slightly everyone thinks you have he muttered you spend all your time with the man its the same thing so far as bree is concerned dragging her intosituations where shes exposed to danger andand to those sorts of people black people i suppose you mean i damn well do he said looking up at me with eyes flashing its bad enough to have the abernathys to parties all the time though at least hes educated but that obese person i met at their house with the tribal tattoos and the mud in his hair that repulsive lounge lizard with the oily voice and young abernathys taken to hanging round bree day and night taking her to marches and rallies and orgies in low dives i shouldnt think there are any high dives i said repressing an inappropriate urge to laugh at franks unkind but accurate assessment of two of leonard abernathys more outré friends did you know lennys taken to calling himself muhammad ishmael shabazz now yes he told me he said shortly and i am taking no risk of having my daughter become mrs shabazz i dont think bree feels that way about lenny i assured him struggling to suppress my irritation she isnt going to either shes going to england with me not if she doesnt want to i said with great finality no doubt feeling that his position put him at a disadvantage frank climbed out of bed and began groping for his slippers i dont need your permission to take my daughter to england he said and brees still a minor shell go where i say id appreciate it if youd find her medical records the new school will need them your daughter i said again i vaguely noticed the chill in the room but was so angry that i felt hot all over brees my daughter and youll take her bloody nowhere you cant stop me he pointed out with aggravating calmness picking up his dressing gown from the foot of the bed the hell i cant i said you want to divorce me fine use any grounds you likewith the exception of adultery which you cant prove because it doesnt exist but if you try to take bree away with you ill have a thing or two to say about adultery do you want to know how many of your discarded mistresses have come to see me to ask me to give you up his mouth hung open in shock i told them all that id give you up in a minute i said if you asked i folded my arms tucking my hands into my armpits i was beginning to feel the chilliness again i did wonder why you never askedbut i supposed it was because of brianna his face had gone quite bloodless now and showed white as a skull in the dimness on the other side of the bed well he said with a poor attempt at his usual selfpossession i shouldnt have thought you minded its not as though you ever made a move to stop me i stared at him completely taken aback stop you i said what should i have done steamed open your mail and waved the letters under your nose made a scene at the faculty christmas party complained to the dean his lips pressed tight together for a moment then relaxed you might have behaved as though it mattered to you he said quietly it mattered my voice sounded strangled he shook his head still staring at me his eyes dark in the lamplight not enough he paused face floating pale in the air above his dark dressing gown then came round the bed to stand by me sometimes i wondered if i could rightfully blame you he said almost thoughtfully he looked like bree didnt he he was like her yes he breathed heavily almost a snort i could see it in your facewhen youd look at her i could see you thinking of him damn you claire beauchamp he said very softly damn you and your face that cant hide a thing you think or feel there was a silence after this of the sort that makes you hear all the tiny unbearable noises of creaking wood and breathing housesonly in an effort to pretend you havent heard what was just said i did love you i said softly at last once once he echoed should i be grateful for that the feeling was beginning to come back to my numb lips i did tell you i said and then when you wouldnt gofrank i did try whatever he heard in my voice stopped him for a moment i did i said very softly he turned away and moved toward my dressing table where he touched things restlessly picking them up and putting them down at random i couldnt leave you at the firstpregnant alone only a cad would have done that and thenbree he stared sightlessly at the lipstick he held in one hand then set it gently back on the glassy tabletop i couldnt give her up he said softly he turned to look at me eyes dark holes in a shadowed face did you know i couldnt sire a child ihad myself tested a few years ago im sterile did you know i shook my head not trusting myself to speak bree is mine my daughter he said as though to himself the only child ill ever have i couldnt give her up he gave a short laugh i couldnt give her up but you couldnt see her without thinking of him could you without that constant memory i wonderwould you have forgotten him in time no the whispered word seemed to go through him like an electric shock he stood frozen for a moment then whirled to the closet and began to jerk on his clothes over his pajamas i stood arms wrapped around my body watching as he pulled on his overcoat and stamped out of the room not looking at me the collar of his blue silk pajamas stuck up over the astrakhan trim of his coat a moment later i heard the closing of the front doorhe had sufficient presence of mind not to slam itand then the sound of a cold motor turning reluctantly over the headlights swept across the bedroom ceiling as the car backed down the drive and then were gone leaving me shaking by the rumpled bed frank didnt come back i tried to sleep but found myself lying rigid in the cold bed mentally reliving the argument listening for the crunch of his tires in the drive at last i got up and dressed left a note for bree and went out myself the hospital hadnt called but i might as well go and have a look at my patient it was better than tossing and turning all night and to be honest i would not have minded had frank come home to find me gone the streets were slick as butter black ice gleaming in the streetlights the yellow phosphor glow lit whorls of falling snow within an hour the ice that lined the streets would be concealed beneath fresh powder and twice as perilous to travel the only consolation was that there was no one on the streets at am to be imperiled no one but me that is inside the hospital the usual warm stuffy institutional smell wrapped itself round me like a blanket of familiarity shutting out the snowfilled black night outside hes okay the nurse said to me softly as though a raised voice might disturb the sleeping man all the vitals are stable and the counts okay no bleeding i could see that it was true the patients face was pale but with a faint undertone of pink like the veining in a white rose petal and the pulse in the hollow of his throat was strong and regular i let out the deep breath i hadnt realized i was holding thats good i said very good the nurse smiled warmly at me and i had to resist the impulse to lean against him and dissolve the hospital surroundings suddenly seemed like my only refuge there was no point in going home i checked briefly on my remaining patients and went down to the cafeteria it still smelled like a boarding school but i sat down with a cup of coffee and sipped it slowly wondering what i would tell bree it might have been a halfhour later when one of the er nurses hurried through the swinging doors and stopped dead at the sight of me then she came on quite slowly i knew at once i had seen doctors and nurses deliver the news of death too often to mistake the signs very calmly feeling nothing whatever i set down the almost full cup realizing as i did so that for the rest of my life i would remember that there was a chip in the rim and that the b of the gold lettering on the side was almost worn away said you were here identification in his walletpolice saidsnow on black ice a skiddoa the nurse was talking babbling as i strode through the bright white halls not looking at her seeing the faces of the nurses at the station turn toward me in slow motion not knowing but seeing from a glance at me that something final had happened he was on a gurney in one of the emergency room cubicles a spare anonymous space there was an ambulance parked outsideperhaps the one that had brought him here the double doors at the end of the corridor were open to the icy dawn the ambulances red light was pulsing like an artery bathing the corridor in blood i touched him briefly his flesh had the inert plastic feel of the recently dead so at odds with the lifelike appearance there was no wound visible any damage was hidden beneath the blanket that covered him his throat was smooth and brown no pulse moved in its hollow i stood there my hand on the motionless curve of his chest looking at him as i had not looked for some time a strong and delicate profile sensitive lips and a chiseled nose and jaw a handsome man despite the lines that cut deep beside his mouth lines of disappointment and unspoken anger lines that even the relaxation of death could not wipe away i stood quite still listening i could hear the wail of a new ambulance approaching voices in the corridor the squeak of gurney wheels the crackle of a police radio and the soft hum of a fluorescent light somewhere i realized with a start that i was listening for frank expectingwhat that his ghost would be hovering still nearby anxious to complete our unfinished business i closed my eyes to shut out the disturbing sight of that motionless profile going red and white and red in turn as the light throbbed through the open doors frank i said softly to the unsettled icy air if youre still close enough to hear mei did love you once i did then joe was there pushing through the crowded corridor face anxious over his green scrub suit he had come straight from surgery there was a small spray of blood across the lenses of his glasses a smear of it on his chest claire he said god claire and then i started to shake in ten years he had never called me anything but jane or lj if he was using my name it must be real my hand showed startlingly white in joes dark grasp then red in the pulsing light and then i had turned to him solid as a tree trunk rested my head on his shoulder andfor the first timewept for frank i leaned my face against the bedroom window of the house on furey street it was hot and humid on this blue september evening filled with the sound of crickets and lawn sprinklers what i saw though was the uncompromising black and white of that winters night two years beforeblack ice and the white of hospital linen and then the blurring of all judgments in the pale gray dawn my eyes blurred now remembering the anonymous bustle in the corridor and the pulsing red light of the ambulance that had washed the silent cubicle in bloody light as i wept for frank now i wept for him for the last time knowing even as the tears slid down my cheeks that we had parted once and for all twentyodd years before on the crest of a green scottish hill my weeping done i rose and laid a hand on the smooth blue coverlet gently rounded over the pillow on the leftfranks side goodbye my dear i whispered and went out to sleep downstairs away from the ghosts it was the doorbell that woke me in the morning from my makeshift bed on the sofa telegram mama the messenger said trying not to stare at my nightgown those small yellow envelopes have probably been responsible for more heart attacks than anything besides fatty bacon for breakfast my own heart squeezed like a fist then went on beating in a heavy uncomfortable manner i tipped the messenger and carried the telegram down the hall it seemed important not to open it until i had reached the relative safety of the bathroom as though it were an explosive device that must be defused under water my fingers shook and fumbled as i opened it sitting on the edge of the tub my back pressed against the tiled wall for reinforcement it was a brief messageof course a scot would be thrifty with words i thought absurdly have found him stop it read will you come back query roger i folded the telegram neatly and put it back into its envelope i sat there and stared at it for quite a long time then i stood up and went to dress diagnosis joe abernathy was seated at his desk frowning at a small rectangle of pale cardboard he held in both hands whats that i said sitting on the edge of his desk without ceremony a business card he handed the card to me looking at once amused and irritated it was a pale gray laidfinish card expensive stock fastidiously printed in an elegant serif type muhammad ishmael shabazz iii the center line read with address and phone number below lenny i asked laughing muhammad ishmael shabazz the third uhhuh amusement seemed to be getting the upper hand the gold tooth flashed briefly as he took the card back he says hes not going to take a white mans name no slave name hes going to reclaim his african heritage he said sardonically all right i say i ask him you gonna go round with a bone through your nose next thing its not enough hes got his hair out to herehe gestured fluffing his hands on either side of his own closecropped headand hes going round in a thing down to his knees looks like his sister made it in home ec class no lennyexcuse me muhammadhes got to be african all the way joe waved a hand out the window at his privileged vista over the park i tell him look around man you see any lions this look like africa to you he leaned back in his padded chair stretching out his legs he shook his head in resignation theres no talkin to a boy that age true i said but whats this third about a reluctant gleam of gold answered me well he was talking all about his lost tradition and his missing history and all he says how am i going to hold my head up facetoface with all these guys i meet at yale named cadwallader iv and sewell lodge jr and i dont even know my own grandaddys name i dont know where i come from joe snorted i told him you want to know where you come from kid look in the mirror wasnt the mayflower huh he picked up the card again a reluctant grin on his face so he says if hes taking back his heritage why not take it back all the way if his grandaddy wouldnt give him a name hell give his grandaddy one and the only trouble with that he said looking up at me under a cocked brow is that it kind of leaves me man in the middle now i have to be muhammad ishmael shabazz junior so lenny can be a proud africanamerican he thrust himself back from the desk chin on his chest staring balefully at the pale gray card youre lucky lj he said at least bree isnt giving you grief about who her granddaddy was all you have to worry about is will she be doing dope and getting pregnant by some draft dodger who takes off for canada i laughed with more than a touch of irony thats what you think i told him yeah he cocked an interested eyebrow at me then took off his goldrimmed glasses and wiped them on the end of his tie so how was scotland he asked eyeing me bree like it shes still there i said looking for her history joe was opening his mouth to say something when a tentative knock on the door interrupted him dr abernathy a plump young man in a polo shirt peered doubtfully into the office leaning over the top of a large cardboard box he held clutched to his substantial abdomen call me ishmael joe said genially what the young mans mouth hung slightly open and he glanced at me in bewilderment mingled with hope are you dr abernathy no i said he is when he puts his mind to it i rose from the desk brushing down my skirts ill leave you to your appointment joe but if you have time later no stay a minute l j he interrupted rising he took the box from the young man then shook his hand formally youd be mr thompson john wicklow called to tell me youd be coming pleased to meet you horace thompson yes the young man said blinking slightly i brought er a specimen he waved vaguely at the cardboard box yes thats right id be happy to look at it for you but i think dr randall here might be of assistance too he glanced at me the glint of mischief in his eyes i just want to see can you do it to a dead person l j do what to a dead i began when he reached into the opened box and carefully lifted out a skull oh pretty he said in delight turning the object gently to and fro pretty was not the first adjective that struck me the skull was stained and greatly discolored the bone gone a deep streaky brown joe carried it to the window and held it in the light his thumbs gently stroking the small bony ridges over the eye sockets pretty lady he said softly talking as much to the skull as to me or horace thompson fullgrown mature maybe late forties middle fifties do you have the legs he asked turning abruptly to the plump young man yeah right here horace thompson assured him reaching into the box we have the whole body in fact horace thompson was probably someone from the coroners office i thought sometimes they brought bodies to joe that had been found in the countryside badly deteriorated for an expert opinion as to the cause of death this one looked considerably deteriorated here dr randall joe leaned over and carefully placed the skull in my hands tell me whether this lady was in good health while i check her legs me im not a forensic scientist still i glanced automatically down it was either an old specimen or had been weathered extensively the bone was smooth with a gloss that fresh specimens never had stained and discolored by the leaching of pigments from the earth oh all right i turned the skull slowly in my hands watching the bones naming them each in my mind as i saw them the smooth arch of the parietals fused to the declivity of the temporal with the small ridge where the jaw muscle originated the jutting projection that meshed itself with the maxillary into the graceful curve of the squamosal arch she had had lovely cheekbones high and broad the upper jaw had most of its teethstraight and white deep eyes the scooped bone at the back of the orbits was dark with shadow even by tilting the skull to the side i couldnt get light to illuminate the whole cavity the skull felt light in my hands the bone fragile i stroked her brow and my hand ran upward and down behind the occiput my fingers seeking the dark hole at the base the foremen magnum where all the messages of the nervous system pass to and from the busy brain then i held it close against my stomach eyes closed and felt the shifting sadness filling the cavity of the skull like running water and an odd faint senseof surprise someone killed her i said she didnt want to die i opened my eyes to find horace thompson staring at me his own eyes wide in his round pale face i handed him the skull very gingerly where did you find her i asked mr thompson exchanged glances with joe then looked back at me both eyebrows still high shes from a cave in the caribbean he said there were a lot of artifacts with her we think shes maybe between a hundredfifty and two hundred years old shes what joe was grinning broadly enjoying his joke our friend mr thompson here is from the anthropology department at harvard he said his friend wicklow knows me asked me would i have a look at this skeleton to tell them what i could about it the nerve of you i said indignantly i thought she was some unidentified body the coroners office dragged in well shes unidentified joe pointed out and certainly liable to stay that way he rooted about in the cardboard box like a terrier the end flap said pictsweet corn now what have we got here he said and very carefully drew out a plastic sack containing a jumble of vertebrae she was in pieces when we got her horace explained oh de headbone connected to deneckbone joe sang softly laying out the vertebrae along the edge of the desk his stubby fingers darted skillfully among the bones nudging them into alignment de neckbone connected to debackbone dont pay any attention to him i told horace youll just encourage him now hearde wordof de lawd he finished triumphantly jesus christ l j youre somethin else look here horace thompson and i bent obediently over the line of spiky vertebral bones the wide body of the axis had a deep gouge the posterior zygapophysis had broken clean off and the fracture plane went completely through the centrum of the bone a broken neck thompson asked peering interestedly yeah but more than that i think joes finger moved over the line of the fracture plane see here the bones not just cracked its gone right there somebody tried to cut this ladys head clean off with a dull blade he concluded with relish horace thompson was looking at me queerly how did you know shed been killed dr randall he asked i could feel the blood rising in my face i dont know i said ishefelt like it thats all really he blinked a few times but didnt press me further how odd she does it all the time joe informed him squinting at the femur he was measuring with a pair of calipers mostly on live people though best diagnostician i ever saw he set down the calipers and picked up a small plastic ruler a cave you said we think it was aer secret slave burial mr thompson explained blushing and i suddenly realized why he had seemed so abashed when he realized which of us was the dr abernathy he had been sent to see joe shot him a sudden sharp glance but then bent back to his work he kept humming dem dry bones faintly to himself as he measured the pelvic inlet then went back to the legs this time concentrating on the tibia finally he straightened up shaking his head not a slave he said horace blinked but she must have been he said the things we found with hera clear african influence no joe said flatly he tapped the long femur where it rested on his desk his fingernail clicked on the dry bone she wasnt black you can tell that from bones horace thompson was visibly agitated but i thoughtthat paper by jensen i meantheories about racial physical differenceslargely exploded he blushed scarlet unable to finish oh theyre there said joe very dryly indeed if you want to think blacks and whites are equal under the skin be my guest but it aint scientifically so he turned and pulled a book from the shelf behind him tables of skeletal variance the title read take a look at this joe invited you can see the differences in a lot of bones but especially in the leg bones blacks have a completely different femurtotibia ratio than whites do and that ladyhe pointed to the skeleton on his deskwas white caucasian no question about it oh horace thompson murmured well ill have to thinki meanit was very kind of you to look at her for me er thank you he added with an awkward little bow we silently watched him bundle his bones back into the pictsweet box and then he was gone pausing at the door to give us both another brief bob of the head joe gave a short laugh as the door closed behind him want to bet he takes her down to rutgers for a second opinion academics dont give up theories easily i said shrugging i lived with one long enough to know that joe snorted again so you did well now that weve got mr thompson and his dead white lady sorted out what can i do for you l j i took a deep breath and turned to face him i need an honest opinion from somebody i can depend on to be objective no i amended i take that back i need an opinion and thendepending on the opinionmaybe a favor no problem joe assured me especially the opinion my specialty opinions he rocked back in his chair unfolded his goldrimmed glasses and set them firmly atop his broad nose then he folded his hands across his chest fingers steepled and nodded at me shoot am i sexually attractive i demanded his eyes always reminded me of coffee drops with their warm goldenbrown color now they went completely round enhancing the resemblance then they narrowed but he didnt answer immediately he looked me over carefully head to toe its a trick question right he said i give you an answer and one of those womens libbers jumps out from behind the door yells sexist pig and hits me over the head with a sign that says castrate male chauvinists huh no i assured him a sexist male chauvinist answer is basically what i want oh okay as long as were straight then he resumed his perusal squinting closely as i stood up straight skinny white broad with too much hair but a great ass he said at last nice tits too he added with a cordial nod that what you want to know yes i said relaxing my rigid posture thats exactly what i wanted to know it isnt the sort of question you can ask just anybody he pursed his lips in a silent whistle then threw back his head and roared with delight lady jane youve got you a man i felt the blood rising in my cheeks but tried to keep my dignity i dont know maybe just maybe maybe hell jesus christ on a piece of toast l j its about time kindly quit cackling i said lowering myself into his visitors chair it doesnt become a man of your years and station my years oho he said peering shrewdly at me through the glasses hes younger than you thats what youre worried about not a lot i said the blush beginning to recede but i havent seen him in twenty years youre the only person i know whos known me for a long time have i changed terribly since we met i looked at him straight on demanding honesty he looked at me took off his glasses and squinted then replaced them no he said you wouldnt though unless you got fat i wouldnt nah ever been to your high school reunion i didnt go to a high school his sketchy brows flicked upward no well i have and i tell you what lj you see all these people you havent seen for twenty years and theres this split second when you meet somebody you used to know when you think my god hes changed and then all of a sudden he hasntits just like the twenty years werent there i meanhe rubbed his head vigorously struggling for meaningyou see theyve got some gray and some lines and maybe they arent just the same as they were but two minutes past that shock and you dont see it anymore theyre just the same people they always were and you have to make yourself stand back a ways to see that they arent eighteen anymore now if people get fat he said meditatively they change some its harder to see who they were because the faces change but youhe squinted at me againyoure never going to be fat you dont have the genes for it i suppose not i said i looked down at my hands clasped together in my lap slender wristbones at least i wasnt fat yet my rings gleamed in the autumn sun from the window is it brees daddy he asked softly i jerked my head up and stared at him how the hell did you know that i said he smiled slightly ive known bree how long ten years at least he shook his head shes got a lot of you in her l j but ive never seen anything of frank daddys got red hair huh he asked and hes one big son of a bitch or everything i learned in genetics was a damn lie yes i said and felt a kind of delirious excitement at that simple admission until i had told bree herself and roger about jamie i had said nothing about him for twenty years the joy of suddenly being able to talk freely about him was intoxicating yes hes big and redhaired and hes scottish i said making joes eyes go round once more and brees in scotland now i nodded bree is where the favor comes in two hours later i left the hospital for the last time leaving behind me a letter of resignation addressed to the hospital board all the necessary documents for the handling of my property until brianna should be of age and another one to be executed at that time turning everything over to her as i drove out of the parking lot i experienced a feeling of mingled panic regret and elation i was on my way qed inverness october i found the deed of sasine rogers face was flushed with excitement he had hardly been able to contain himself waiting with open impatience at the train station in inverness while brianna hugged me and my bags were retrieved he had barely got us stuffed into his tiny morris and the cars ignition started before blurting out his news what for lallybroch i leaned over the seat back between him and brianna in order to hear him over the noise of the motor yes the one jamieyour jamiewrote deeding the property to his nephew the younger jamie its at the manse brianna put in twisting to look at me we were afraid to bring it with us roger had to sign his name in blood to get it out of the spa collection her fair skin was pinkened by excitement and the chilly day raindrops in her ruddy hair it was always a shock to me to see her again after an absencemothers always think their children beautiful but bree really was i smiled at her glowing with affection tinged with panic could i really be thinking of leaving her mistaking the smile for one of pleasure in the news she went on gripping the back of the seat in excitement and youll never guess what else we found what you found roger corrected squeezing her knee with one hand as he negotiated the tiny orange car through a roundabout she gave him a quick glance and a reciprocal touch with an air of intimacy about it that set off my maternal alarm bells on the spot like that already was it i seemed to feel franks shade glaring accusingly over my shoulder well at least roger wasnt black i coughed and said really what is it they exchanged a glance and grinned widely at each other wait and see mama said bree with irritating smugness see she said twenty minutes later as i bent over the desk in the manses study on the battered surface of the late reverend wakefields desk lay a sheaf of yellowed papers foxed and browned at the edges they were carefully enclosed in protective plastic covers now but obviously had been carelessly used at one time the edges were tattered one sheet was torn roughly in half and all the sheets had notes and annotations scribbled in the margins and inserted in the text this was obviously someones rough draftof something its the text of an article roger told me shuffling through a pile of huge folio volumes that lay on the sofa it was published in a sort of journal called forresters put out by a printer called alexander malcolm in edinburgh in i swallowed my shirtwaist dress feeling suddenly too tight under the arms was almost twenty years past the time when i had left jamie i stared at the scrawling letters browned with age they were written by someone of difficult penmanship here cramped and there sprawling with exaggerated loops on g and y perhaps the writing of a lefthanded man who wrote most painfully with his right hand see heres the published version roger brought the opened folio to the desk and laid it before me pointing see the date its and it matches this handwritten manuscript almost exactly only a few of the marginal notes arent included yes i said and the deed of sasine here it is brianna fumbled hastily in the top drawer and pulled out a much crumpled paper likewise encased in protective plastic protection here was even more after the fact than with the manuscript the paper was rainspattered filthy and torn many of the words blurred beyond recognition but the three signatures at the bottom still showed plainly by my hand read the difficult writing here executed with such care that only the exaggerated loop of the y showed its kinship with the careless manuscript james alexander malcolm mackenzie fraser and below the two lines where the witnesses had signed in a thin fine script murtagh fitzgibbons fraser and below that in my own large round hand claire beauchamp fraser i sat down quite suddenly putting my hand over the document instinctively as though to deny its reality thats it isnt it said roger quietly his outward composure was belied by his hands trembling slightly as he lifted the stack of manuscript pages to set them next to the deed you signed it proof positiveif we needed it he added with a quick glance at bree she shook her head letting her hair fall down to hide her face they didnt need it either of them the vanishing of geilie duncan through the stones five months before had been all the evidence anyone could need as to the truth of my story still having it all laid out in black and white was rather staggering i took my hand away and looked again at the deed and then at the handwritten manuscript is it the same mama bree bent anxiously over the pages her hair brushing softly against my hand the article wasnt signedor it was but with a pseudonym she smiled briefly the author signed himself qed it looked the same to us but we arent either of us handwriting experts and we didnt want to give these to an expert until youd seen them i think so i felt breathless but quite certain at the same time with an upwelling of incredulous joy yes im almost sure jamie wrote this qed indeed i had an absurd urge to tear the manuscript pages out of their plastic shrouds and clutch them in my hands to feel the ink and paper he had touched the certain evidence that he had survived theres more internal evidence rogers voice betrayed his pride see there its an article against the excise act of advocating the repeal of the restrictions on export of liquor from the scottish highlands to england here it ishis racing finger stopped suddenly on a phrasefor as has been known for ages past freedom and whisky gang tegither see how hes put that scottish dialect phrase in quotes he got it from somewhere else he got it from me i said softly i told him thatwhen he was setting out to steal prince charless port i remembered roger nodded eyes shining with excitement but its a quote from burns i said frowning suddenly perhaps the writer got it therewasnt burns alive then he was said bree smugly forestalling roger but robert burns was six years old in and jamie would be fortyfour suddenly it all seemed real he was alivehad been alive i corrected myself trying to keep my emotions in check i laid my fingers flat against the manuscript pages trembling and if i said and had to stop to swallow again and if time goes on in parallel as we think it does roger stopped too looking at me then his eyes shifted to brianna she had gone quite pale but both lips and eyes were steady and her fingers were warm when she touched my hand then you can go back mama she said softly you can find him the plastic hangers rattled against the steel tubing of the dress rack as i thumbed my way slowly through the available selection can i be helpin ye at all miss the salesgirl peered up at me like a helpful pekingese blueringed eyes barely visible through bangs that brushed the top of her nose have you got any more of these oldfashioned sorts of dresses i gestured at the rack before me thick with examples of the current crazelacedbodiced longskirted dresses in gingham cotton and velveteen the salesgirls mouth was caked so thickly that i expected the white lipstick to crack when she smiled but it didnt oh aye she said got a new lot o the jessica gutenburgs in just today arent they the grooviest these oldstyle gowns she ran an admiring finger over a brown velvet sleeve then whirled on her ballet flats and pointed toward the center of the store just there aye where it says on the sign the sign stuck on the top of a circular rack said capture the charm of the eighteenth century in large white letters across the top just below in curlicue script was the signature jessica gutenburg reflecting on the basic improbability of anyone actually being named jessica gutenburg i waded through the contents of the rack pausing at a truly stunning number in cream velvet with satin inserts and a good deal of lace look lovely on that would the pekingese was back pug nose sniffing hopefully for a sale maybe so i said but not very practical youd get filthy just walking out of the store i pushed the white dress away with some regret proceeding to the next size ten oh i just love the red ones the girl clasped her hands in ecstasy at the brilliant garnet fabric so do i i murmured but we dont want to look too garish wouldnt do to be taken for a prostitute would it the peke gave me a startled look through the thickets then decided i was joking and giggled appreciatively now that one she said decisively reaching past me thats perfect that is thats your color here actually it was almost perfect floorlength with threequarter sleeves edged with lace a deep tawny gold with shimmers of brown and amber and sherry in the heavy silk i lifted it carefully off the rack and held it up to examine it a trifle fancy but it might do the construction seemed halfway decent no loose threads or unraveling seams the machinemade lace on the bodice was just tacked on but that would be easy enough to reinforce want to try it on the dressing rooms are just over there the peke was frisking about near my elbow encouraged by my interest taking a quick look at the price tag i could see why she must work on commission i took a deep breath at the figure which would cover a months rent on a london flat but then shrugged after all what did i need money for still i hesitated i dont know i said doubtfully it is lovely but oh dont worry a bit about its being too young for you the pekingese reassured me earnestly you dont look a day over twentyfive wellmaybe thirty she concluded lamely after a quick glance at my face thanks i said dryly i wasnt worried about that though i dont suppose you have any without zippers do you zippers her small round face went quite blank beneath the makeup ermno dont think we do well not to worry i said taking the dress over my arm and turning toward the dressing room if i go through with this zippers will be the least of it all hallows eve two golden guineas six sovereigns twentythree shillings eighteen florins ninepence ten halfpence andtwelve farthings roger dropped the last coin on the tinkling pile then dug into his shirt pocket lean face absorbed as he searched oh here he brought out a small plastic bag and carefully poured a handful of tiny copper coins into a pile alongside the other money doits he explained the smallest denomination of scottish coinage of the time i got as many as i could because thats likely what youd use most of the time you wouldnt use the large coins unless you had to buy a horse or something i know i picked up a couple of sovereigns and tilted them in my hand letting them clink together they were heavygold coins nearly an inch in diameter it had taken roger and bree four days in london going from one rarecoin dealer to the next to assemble the small fortune gleaming in the lamplight before me you know its funny these coins are worth a lot more now than their face value i said picking up a golden guinea but in terms of what theyll buy they were worth then just about as much as now this is six months income for a small farmer i was forgetting roger said that you know all this already what things were worth and how they were sold its easy to forget i said eyes still on the money from the corner of my vision i saw bree draw suddenly close to roger and his hand go out to her automatically i took a deep breath and looked up from the tiny heaps of gold and silver well thats that shall we go and have some dinner dinnerat one of the pubs on river streetwas a largely silent affair claire and brianna sat side by side on the banquette with roger opposite they barely looked at each other while they ate but roger could see the frequent small touches the tiny nudges of shoulder and hip the brushing of fingers that went on how would he manage he wondered to himself if it were his choice or his parent separation came to all families but most often it was death that intervened to sever the ties between parent and child it was the element of choice here that made it so difficultnot that it could ever be easy he thought forking in a mouthful of hot shepherds pie as they rose to leave after supper he laid a hand on claires arm just for the sake of nothing he said will you try something for me i expect so she said smiling what is it he nodded at the door close your eyes and step out of the door when youre outside open them then come in and tell me whats the first thing you saw her mouth twitched with amusement all right well hope the first thing i see isnt a policeman or youll have to come bail me out of jail for being drunk and disorderly so long as it isnt a duck claire gave him a queer look but obediently turned toward the door of the pub and closed her eyes brianna watched her mother disappear through the door hand extended to the paneling of the entry to keep her bearings she turned to roger copper eyebrows raised what are you up to roger ducks nothing he said eyes still fixed on the empty entrance its just an old custom samhainhalloween you knowthats one of the feasts when it was customary to try to divine the future and one of the ways of divination was to walk to the end of the house and then step outside with your eyes closed the first thing you see when you open them is an omen for the near future ducks are bad omens depends what theyre doing he said absently still watching the entry if they have their heads under their wings thats death whats keeping her maybe wed better go see brianna said nervously i dont expect there are a lot of sleeping ducks in downtown inverness but with the river so close just as they reached the door though its stainedglass window darkened and it swung open to reveal claire looking mildly flustered youll never believe whats the first thing i saw she said laughing as she saw them not a duck with its head under its wing asked brianna anxiously no her mother said giving her a puzzled look a policeman i turned to the right and ran smack into him he was coming toward you then roger felt inexplicably relieved well he was until i ran into him she said then we waltzed round the pavement a bit clutching each other she laughed looking flushed and pretty with her brownsherry eyes sparkling in the amber pub lights why thats good luck roger said smiling to see a man coming toward you on samhain means youll find what you seek does it her eyes rested on his quizzical then her face lit with a sudden smile wonderful lets go home and celebrate shall we the anxious constraint that had lain on them over dinner seemed suddenly to have vanished to be replaced with a sort of manic excitement and they laughed and joked on the trip back to the manse where they drank toasts to past and futureloch minneaig scotch for claire and roger cocacola for briannaand talked excitedly about the plans for the next day brianna had insisted on carving a pumpkin into a jackolantern which sat on the sideboard grinning benevolently on the proceedings youve got the money now roger said for the tenth time and your cloak brianna chimed in yes yes yes claire said impatiently everything i needor everything i can manage at least she amended she paused then impulsively reached out and took both bree and roger by the hand thank you both she said squeezing their hands her eyes shone moist and her voice was suddenly husky thank you i cant say what i feel i cant butoh my dears i will miss you then she and bree were in each others arms claires head tucked into her daughters neck the both of them hugged tight as though simple force could somehow express the depth of feeling between them then they broke apart eyes wet and claire laid a hand on her daughters cheek id better go up now she whispered there are things to do still ill see you in the morning baby she rose on tiptoe to plant a kiss on her daughters nose then turned and hurried from the room after her mothers exit brianna sat down again with her glass of coke and heaved a deep sigh she didnt speak but sat looking into the fire turning the glass slowly between her hands roger busied himself setting the room to rights for the night closing the windows tidying the desk putting away the reference books he had used to help claire prepare for her journey he paused by the jackolantern but it looked so jolly with the candlelight streaming from its slanted eyes and jagged mouth that he couldnt bring himself to blow it out i shouldnt think its likely to set anything on fire he remarked shall we leave it there was no answer when he glanced at brianna he found her sitting still as stone eyes fixed on the hearth she hadnt heard him he sat down beside her and took her hand she might be able to come back he said gently we dont know brianna shook her head slowly not taking her eyes from the leaping flames i dont think so she said softly she told you what it was like she may not even make it through long fingers drummed restlessly on a denimed thigh roger glanced at the door to be sure that claire was safely upstairs then sat down on the sofa next to brianna she belongs with him bree he said can ye not see it when she speaks of him i see it i know she needs him the full lower lip trembled slightly buti need her briannas hands clenched suddenly tight on her knees and she bent forward as though trying to contain some sudden pain roger stroked her hair marveling at the softness of the glowing strands that slid through his fingers he wanted to take her into his arms as much for the feel of her as to offer comfort but she was rigid and unresponsive youre grown bree he said softly you live on your own now dont you you may love her but you dont need her anymorenot the way you did when you were small has she no right to her own joy yes butroger you dont understand she burst out she pressed her lips tight together and swallowed hard then turned to him eyes dark with distress shes all thats left roger the only one who really knows me she and daddyfrankshe corrected herselfthey were the ones who knew me from the beginning the ones who saw me learn to walk and were proud of me when i did something good in school and who she broke off and the tears overflowed leaving gleaming tracks in the firelight this sounds really dumb she said with sudden violence really really dumb but its she groped helpless then sprang to her feet unable to stay still its likethere are all these things i dont even know she said pacing with quick angry steps do you think i remember what i looked like learning to walk or what the first word i said was no but mama does and thats so stupid because what difference does it make it doesnt make any difference at all but its important it matters because she thought it was andoh roger if shes gone there wont be a soul left in the world who cares what im like or thinks im special not because of anything but just because im me shes the only person in the world who really really cares i was born and if shes gone she stood still on the hearthrug hands clenched at her sides and mouth twisted with the effort to control herself tears wet on her cheeks then her shoulders slumped and the tension went out of her tall figure and thats just really dumb and selfish she said in a quietly reasonable tone and you dont understand and you think im awful no roger said quietly i think maybe not he stood and came behind her putting his arms around her waist urging her to lean back against him she resisted at first stiff in his arms but then yielded to the need for physical comfort and relaxed his chin propped on her shoulder head tilted to touch her own i never realized he said not til now dye remember all those boxes in the garage which ones she said with a sniffling attempt at a laugh there are hundreds the ones that say roger on them he gave her a slight squeeze and brought his arms up crisscrossed on her chest holding her snug against himself theyre full of my parents old clobber he said pictures and letters and baby clothes and books and old bits of rubbish the reverend packed them up when he took me to live with him treated them just like his most precious historical documentsdoubleboxing and mothproofing and all that he rocked slowly back and forth swaying from side to side carrying her with him as he watched the fire over her shoulder i asked him once why he bothered to keep themi didnt want any of it didnt care but he said wed keep it just the same it was my history he saidand everyone needs a history brianna sighed and her body seemed to relax still further joining him in his rhythmic halfunconscious sway did you ever look inside them he shook his head it isnt important whats in them he said only that theyre there he let go of her then and stepped back so that she turned to face him her face was blotched and her long elegant nose a little swollen youre wrong you know he said softly and held out his hand to her it isnt only your mother who cares brianna had gone to bed long since but roger sat on in the study watching the flames die down in the hearth halloween had always seemed to him a restless night alive with waking spirits tonight was even more so with the knowledge of what would happen in the morning the jackolantern on the desk grinned in anticipation filling the room with the homely scent of baking pies the sound of a footfall on the stair roused him from his thoughts he had thought it might be brianna unable to sleep but the visitor was claire i thought you might still be awake she said she was in her nightdress a pale glimmer of white satin against the dark hallway he smiled and stretched out a hand inviting her in no i never could sleep on all hallows not after all the stories my father told me i always thought i could hear ghosts talking outside my window she smiled coming into the firelight and what did they say seest thou this great gray head with jaws which have no meat roger quoted you know the story the little tailor who spent the night in a haunted church and met the hungry ghost i do i think if id heard that outside my window id have spent the rest of the night hiding under the bedclothes oh i usually did roger assured her though once when i was seven or so i got up my nerve stood up on the bed and peed on the windowsillthe reverend had just told me that pissing on the doorposts is supposed to keep a ghost from coming in the house claire laughed delightedly the firelight dancing in her eyes did it work well it would have worked better had the window been open roger said but the ghosts didnt come in no they laughed together and then one of the small awkward silences that had punctuated the evening fell between them the sudden realization of enormity gaping beneath the tightrope of conversation claire sat beside him watching the fire her hands moving restlessly among the folds of her gown the light winked from her wedding rings silver and gold in sparks of fire ill take care of her you know roger said quietly at last you do know that dont you claire nodded not looking at him i know she said softly he could see the tears caught trembling at the edge of her lashes glowing with firelight she fumbled in the pocket of her gown and drew out a long white envelope youll think me a dreadful coward she said and i am but ii honestly dont think i can do itsay goodbye to bree i mean she stopped to bring her voice under control and then held out the envelope to him i wrote it all down for hereverything i could will you roger took the envelope it was warm from resting next to her body from some obscure feeling that it must not be allowed to grow cold before it reached her daughter he thrust it into his own breast pocket feeling the crackle of paper as the envelope bent yes he said hearing his own voice thicken then youll go early she said taking a deep breath before dawn ive arranged for a car to pick me up her hands twisted together in her lap if i she bit her lip then looked at roger pleadingly i dont know you see she said i dont know whether i can do it im very much afraid afraid to go afraid not to go justafraid i would be too he held out his hand and she took it he held it for a long time feeling the pulse in her wrist light and fast against his fingers after a long time she squeezed his hand gently and let go thank you roger she said for everything she leaned over and kissed him lightly on the lips then she rose and went out a white ghost in the darkness of the hall borne on the halloween wind roger sat on for some time alone feeling her touch still warm on his skin the jackolantern was nearly burned out the smell of candle wax rose strongly in the restless air and the pagan gods looked out for the last time through eyes of guttering flame craigh na dun the early morning air was cold and misty and i was glad of the cloak it had been twenty years since id worn one but with the sorts of things people wore nowadays the inverness tailor whod made it for me had not found an order for a woolen cloak with a hood at all odd i kept my eyes on the path the crest of the hill had been invisible wreathed in mist when the car had left me on the road below here the driver had said peering dubiously out of his window at the deserted countryside sure mum yes id said halfchoked with terror this is the place aye he looked dubious in spite of the large note i put in his hand dye want me to wait mum or to come later to fetch ye back i was sorely tempted to say yes after all what if i lost my nerve at the moment my grip on that slippery substance seemed remarkably feeble no i said swallowing no that wont be necessary if i couldnt do it i would just have to walk back to inverness that was all or perhaps roger and brianna would come i thought that would be worse to be ignominiously retrieved or would it be a relief the granite pebbles rolled beneath my feet and a clod of dirt fell in a small rushing shower dislodged by my passage i couldnt possibly really be doing this i thought the weight of the money in my reinforced pocket swung against my thigh the heavy certainty of gold and silver a reminder of reality i was doing it i couldnt thoughts of bree as i had seen her late last night peacefully asleep in her bed assaulted me the tendrils of remembered horror reached out from the hilltop above as i began to sense the nearness of the stones screaming chaos the feeling of being torn in pieces i couldnt i couldnt but i kept on climbing palms sweating my feet moving as though no longer under my control it was full dawn by the time i reached the top of the hill the mist lay below and the stones stood clear and dark against a crystal sky the sight of them left me wetpalmed with apprehension but i walked forward and passed into the circle they were standing on the grass in front of the cleft stone facing each other brianna heard my footsteps and whirled around to face me i stared at her speechless with astonishment she was wearing a jessica gutenburg dress very much like the one i had on except that hers was a vivid lime green with plastic jewels stitched across the bosom thats a perfectly horrible color for you i said its the only one they had in a size sixteen she answered calmly what in the name of goodness are you doing here i demanded recovering some remnant of coherence we came to see you off she said and a hint of a smile flickered on her lips i looked at roger who shrugged slightly and gave me a lopsided smile of his own oh yes well i said the stone stood behind brianna twice the height of a man i could look through the footwide crack and see the faint morning sun shining on the grass outside the circle youre going she said firmly or i am you are you out of your mind no she glanced at the cleft stone and swallowed it might have been the limegreen dress that made her face look chalkwhite i can do itgo through i mean i know i can when geilie duncan went through the stones i heard them roger did too she glanced at him as though for reassurance then fixed her gaze firmly on me i dont know whether i could find jamie fraser or not maybe only you can but if you wont try then i will my mouth opened but i couldnt find anything to say dont you see mama he has to knowhas to know he did it he did what he meant to for us her lips quivered and she pressed them together for a minute we owe it to him mama she said softly somebody has to find him and tell him her hand touched my face briefly tell him i was born oh bree i said my voice so choked i could barely speak oh bree she was holding my hands tight between her own squeezing hard he gave you to me she said so low i could hardly hear her now i have to give you back to him mama the eyes that were so like jamies looked down at me blurred by tears if you find him she whispered when you find my fathergive him this she bent and kissed me fiercely gently then straightened and turned me toward the stone go mama she said breathless i love you go from the corner of my eye i saw roger move toward her i took one step and then another i heard a sound a faint roaring i took the last step and the world disappeared part six edinburgh a malcolm printer my first coherent thought was its raining this must be scotland my second thought was that this observation was no great improvement over the random images jumbling around inside my head banging into each other and setting off small synaptic explosions of irrelevance i opened one eye with some difficulty the lid was stuck shut and my entire face felt cold and puffy like a submerged corpses i shuddered faintly at the thought the slight movement making me aware of the sodden fabric all around me it was certainly raininga soft steady drum of rain that raised a faint mist of droplets above the green moor i sat up feeling like a hippopotamus emerging from a bog and promptly fell over backward i blinked and closed my eyes against the downpour some small sense of who i wasand where i waswas beginning to come back to me bree her face emerged suddenly into memory with a jolt that made me gasp as though id been punched in the stomach jagged images of loss and the rip of separation pulled at me a faint echo of the chaos in the stone passage jamie there it was the anchor point to which i had clung my single hold on sanity i breathed slow and deep hands folded over my pounding heart summoning jamies face for a moment i thought i had lost him and then it came clear and bold in my minds eye once again i struggled upright and this time stayed propped by my outstretched hands yes certainly it was scotland it could hardly by anything else of course but it was also the scotland of the past at least i hoped it was the past it wasnt the scotland id left at any rate the trees and bushes grew in different patterns there was a patch of maple saplings just below me that hadnt been there when id climbed the hillwhen that morning two days ago i had no idea how much time had passed since i had entered the standing stones or how long i had lain unconscious on the hillside below the circle quite a while judging from the sogginess of my clothing i was soaked through to the skin and small chilly rivulets ran down my sides under my gown one numbed cheek was beginning to tingle putting my hand to it i could feel a pattern of incised bumps i looked down and saw a layer of fallen rowan berries gleaming red and black among the grass very appropriate i thought vaguely amused i had fallen down under a rowanthe highland protection against witchcraft and enchantment i grasped the smooth trunk of the rowan tree and laboriously hauled myself to my feet still holding onto the tree for support i looked to the northeast the rain had faded the horizon to a gray invisibility but i knew that inverness lay in that direction no more than an hours trip by car along modern roads the road existed i could see the outline of a rough track that led along the base of the hill a dark silvery line in the gleaming green wetness of the moor plants however fortyodd miles on foot was a far cry from the journey by car that had brought me here i was beginning to feel somewhat better standing up the weakness in my limbs was fading along with the feeling of chaos and disruption in my mind it had been as bad as id feared this passage perhaps worse i could feel the terrible presence of the stones above me and shuddered my skin prickling with cold i was alive though alive and with a small feeling of certainty like a tiny glowing sun beneath my ribs he was here i knew it now though i hadnt known it when i threw myself between the stones that had been a leap of faith but i had cast out my thought of jamie like a lifeline tossed into a raging torrentand the line had tightened in my grasp and pulled me free i was wet cold and felt battered as though i had been washing about in the surf against a rocky shore but i was here and somewhere in this strange country of the past was the man i had come to find the memories of grief and terror were receding as i realized that my die was cast i could not go back a return trip would almost surely be fatal as i realized that i was likely here to stay all hesitations and terrors were superseded by a strange calm almost exultant i could not go back there was nothing to do but go forwardto find him cursing my carelessness in not having thought to tell the tailor to make my cloak with a waterproof layer between fabric and lining i pulled the watersoaked garment closer even wet the wool held some warmth if i began to move i would grow warmer a quick pat reassured me that my bundle of sandwiches had made the trip with me that was good the thought of walking forty miles on an empty stomach was a daunting one with luck i wouldnt have to i might find a village or a house that had a horse i could buy but if not i was prepared my plan was to go to invernessby whatever means offered itselfand there take a public coach to edinburgh there was no telling where jamie was at the moment he might be in edinburgh where his article had been published but he might easily be somewhere else if i could not find him there i could go to lallybroch his home surely his family would know where he wasif any of them were left the sudden thought chilled me and i shivered i thought of a small bookstore that i passed every morning on my way from the parking lot to the hospital they had been having a sale on posters i had seen the display of psychedelic examples when i left joes office for the last time today is the first day of the rest of your life said one poster above an illustration of a foolishlooking chick absurdly poking its head out of an eggshell in the other window another poster showed a caterpillar inching its way up a flower stalk above the stalk soared a brilliantly colored butterfly and below was the motto a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step the most irritating thing about clichés i decided was how frequently they were true i let go of the rowan tree and started down the hill toward my future it was a long jolting ride from inverness to edinburgh crammed cheek by jowl into a large coach with two other ladies the small and whiny son of one of the ladies and four gentlemen of varying sizes and dispositions mr graham a small and vivacious gentleman of advanced years who was seated next to me was wearing a bag of camphor and asafoetida about his neck to the eyewatering discomfort of the rest of the coach capital for dispelling the evil humors of influenza he explained to me waving the bag gently under my nose like a censer i have worn this daily through the autumn and winter months and havent been sick a day in nearly thirty years amazing i said politely trying to hold my breath i didnt doubt it the fumes probably kept everyone at such a distance that germs couldnt reach him the effects on the little boy didnt seem nearly so beneficial after a number of loud and injudicious remarks about the smell in the coach master georgie had been muffled in his mothers bosom from which he now peeped looking rather green i kept a close eye on him as well as on the chamber pot beneath the seat opposite in case quick action involving a conjunction of the two should be called for i gathered that the chamber pot was for use in inclement weather or other emergency as normally the ladies modesty required stops every hour or so at which point the passengers would scatter into the roadside vegetation like a covey of quail even those who did not require relief of bladder or bowels seeking some relief from the stench of mr grahams asafoetida bag after one or two changes mr graham found his place beside me superseded by mr wallace a plump young lawyer returning to edinburgh after seeing to the disposition of the estate of an elderly relative in inverness as he explained to me i didnt find the details of his legal practice nearly as fascinating as he did but under the circumstances his evident attraction to me was mildly reassuring and i passed several hours in playing with him upon a small chess set that he produced from a pocket and laid upon his knee my attention was distracted both from the discomforts of the journey and the intricacies of chess by anticipation of what i might find in edinburgh a malcolm the name kept running through my mind like an anthem of hope a malcolm it had to be jamie it simply had to james alexander malcolm mackenzie fraser considering the way the highland rebels were treated after culloden it would be very reasonable for him to use an assumed name in a place like edinburgh roger wakefield had explained to me particularly himhe was a convicted traitor after all made rather a habit of it too it looks like he had added critically looking over the scrawled manuscript of the antitax diatribe for the times this is bloody near sedition yes that sounds like jamie i had said dryly but my heart had leapt at the sight of that distinctively untidy scrawl with its boldly worded sentiments my jamie i touched the small hard rectangle in my skirt pocket wondering how long it would be before we reached edinburgh the weather kept unseasonably fine with no more than the occasional drizzle to hinder our passage and we completed the journey in less than two days stopping four times to change horses and refresh ourselves at posthouse taverns the coach debouched into a yard at the back of boyds whitehorse tavern near the foot of the royal mile in edinburgh the passengers emerged into the watery sunshine like newly hatched chrysalids rumpled of wing and jerky in movement unaccustomed to mobility after the dimness of the coach even the cloudy gray light of edinburgh seemed blinding i had pins and needles in my feet from so long sitting but hurried nonetheless hoping to escape from the courtyard while my erstwhile companions were busy with the retrieval of their belongings no such luck mr wallace caught up with me near the street mrs fraser he said might i beg the pleasure of accompanying you to your destination you will surely require some assistance in the removal of your luggage he looked over his shoulder toward the coach where the ostlers were heaving the bags and portmanteaux apparently at random into the crowd to the accompaniment of incoherent grunts and shouts er i said thank you but ier im leaving my luggage in charge of the landlord mymy i groped frantically my husbands servant will come fetch it later his plump face fell slightly at the word husband but he rallied gallantly taking my hand and bowing low over it i quite see may i express my profound appreciation for the pleasure of your company on our journey then mrs fraser and perhaps we shall meet again he straightened up surveying the crowd that eddied past us is your husband meeting you i should be delighted to make his acquaintance while mr wallaces interest in me had been rather flattering it was rapidly becoming a nuisance no i shall be joining him later i said so nice to have met you mr wallace ill hope to see you again sometime i shook mr wallaces hand enthusiastically which disconcerted him enough for me to slither off through the throng of passengers ostlers and food sellers i didnt dare pause near the coachyard for fear he would come out after me i turned and darted up the slope of the royal mile moving as quickly as my voluminous skirts would allow jostling and bumping my way through the crowd i had had the luck to pick a market day for my arrival and i was soon lost to sight from the coachyard among the luckenbooths and oyster sellers who lined the street panting like an escaped pickpocket i stopped for breath halfway up the hill there was a public fountain here and i sat down on the rim to catch my breath i was here really here edinburgh sloped up behind me to the glowering heights of edinburgh castle and down before me to the gracious majesty of holyrood palace at the foot of the city the last time i had stood by this fountain bonnie prince charlie had been addressing the gathered citizenry of edinburgh inspiring them with the sight of his royal presence he had bounded exuberantly from the rim to the carved center finial of the fountain one foot in the basin clinging to one of the spouting heads for support shouting on to england the crowd had roared pleased at this show of youthful high spirits and athletic prowess i would myself have been more impressed had i not noticed that the water in the fountain had been turned off in anticipation of the gesture i wondered where charlie was now he had gone back to italy after culloden i supposed there to live whatever life was possible for royalty in permanent exile what he was doing i neither knew nor cared he had passed from the pages of history and from my life as well leaving wreck and ruin in his wake it remained to be seen what might be salvaged now i was very hungry i had had nothing to eat since a hasty breakfast of rough parritch and boiled mutton made soon after dawn at a posthouse in dundaff i had one last sandwich remaining in my pocket but had been reluctant to eat it in the coach under the curious gaze of my fellow travelers i pulled it out and carefully unwrapped it peanut butter and jelly on white bread it was considerably the worse for wear with the purple stains of the jelly seeping through the limp bread and the whole thing mashed into a flattened wodge it was delicious i ate it carefully savoring the rich oily taste of the peanut butter how many mornings had i slathered peanut butter on bread making sandwiches for briannas school lunches firmly suppressing the thought i examined the passersby for distraction they did look somewhat different from their modern equivalents both men and women tended to be shorter and the signs of poor nutrition were evident still there was an overwhelming familiarity to themthese were people i knew scots and english for the most part and hearing the rich burring babble of voices in the street after so many years of the flat nasal tones of boston i had quite an extraordinary feeling of coming home i swallowed the last rich sweet bite of my old life and crumpled the wrapper in my hand i glanced around but no one was looking in my direction i opened my hand and let the bit of plastic film fall surreptitiously to the ground wadded up it rolled a few inches on the cobbles crinkling and unfolding itself as though alive the light wind caught it and the small transparent sheet took sudden wing scudding over the gray stones like a leaf the draft of a set of passing wheels sucked it under a draymans cart it winked once with reflected light and was gone disappearing without notice from the passersby i wondered whether my own anachronistic presence would cause as little harm you are dithering beauchamp i said to myself time to get on i took a deep breath and stood up excuse me i said catching the sleeve of a passing bakers boy im looking for a printera mr malcolm alexander malcolm a feeling of mingled dread and excitement gurgled through my middle what if there was no printshop run by alexander malcolm in edinburgh there was though the boys face screwed up in thought and then relaxed oh aye mumjust down the way and to your left carfax close and hitching his loaves up under his arm with a nod he plunged back into the crowded street carfax close i edged my way back into the crowd pressing close to the buildings to avoid the occasional shower of slops that splattered into the street from the windows high above there were several thousand people in edinburgh and the sewage from all of them was running down the gutters of the cobbled street depending on gravity and the frequent rain to keep the city habitable the low dark opening to carfax close yawned just ahead across the expanse of the royal mile i stopped dead looking at it my heart beating hard enough to be heard a yard away had anyone been listening it wasnt raining but was just about to and the dampness in the air made my hair curl i pushed it off my forehead tidying it as best i could without a mirror then i caught sight of a large plateglass window up ahead and hurried forward the glass was misty with condensation but provided a dim reflection in which my face looked flushed and wideeyed but otherwise presentable my hair however had seized the opportunity to curl madly in all directions and was writhing out of its hairpins in excellent imitation of medusas locks i yanked the pins out impatiently and began to twist up my curls there was a woman inside the shop leaning across the counter there were three small children with her and i watched with half an eye as she turned from her business to address them impatiently swatting with her reticule at the middle one a boy who was fiddling with several stalks of fresh anise that stood in a pail of water on the floor it was an apothecarys shop glancing up i saw the name haugh above the door and felt a thrill of recognition i had bought herbs here during the brief time i had lived in edinburgh the decor of the window had been augmented sometime since by the addition of a large jar of colored water in which floated something vaguely humanoid a fetal pig or perhaps an infant baboon it had leering flattened features that pressed against the rounded side of the jar in a disconcerting fashion well at least i look better than you i muttered shoving in a recalcitrant pin i looked better than the woman inside too i thought her business concluded she was stuffing her purchase into the bag she carried her thin face frowning as she did so she had the rather pasty look of a city dweller and her skin was deeply lined with sharp creases running from nose to mouth and a furrowed forehead deil tak ye ye wee ratten she was saying crossly to the little boy as they all clattered out of the shop together have i no told ye time and again to keep yer paws in yer pockets excuse me i stepped forward interrupting impelled by a sudden irresistible curiosity aye distracted from maternal remonstration she looked blankly at me up close she looked even more harried the corners of her mouth were pinched and her lips folded inno doubt because of missing teeth i couldnt help admiring your children i said with as much pretense of admiration as i could manage on short notice i beamed kindly at them such pretty babies tell me how old are they her jaw dropped confirming the absence of several teeth she blinked at me then said oh well thats maist kind o ye mum ahmaisri here is ten she said nodding at the eldest girl who was in the act of wiping her nose on her sleeve joeys eighttak yer finger out o yer nose ye clattie imp she hissed then turned and proudly patted her youngest on the head and wee pollys just turned six this may really i gazed at the woman affecting astonishment you scarcely look old enough to have children of that age you must have married very young she preened slightly smirking och no not so young as all that why i was all o nineteen when maisri was born amazing i said meaning it i dug in my pocket and offered the children each a penny which they took with shy bobs of thanks good day to youand congratulations on your lovely family i said to the woman and walked away with a smile and a wave nineteen when the eldest was born and maisri was ten now she was twentynine and i blessed by good nutrition hygiene and dentistry not worn down by multiple pregnancies and hard physical labor looked a good deal younger than she i took a deep breath pushed back my hair and marched into the shadows of carfax close it was a longish winding close and the printshop was at the foot there were thriving businesses and tenements on either side but i had no attention to spare for anything beyond the neat white sign that hung by the door a malcolm printer and bookseller it said and beneath this books calling cards pamphlets broadsheets letters etc i stretched out my hand and touched the black letters of the name a malcolm alexander malcolm james alexander malcolm mackenzie fraser perhaps another minute and i would lose my nerve i shoved open the door and walked in there was a broad counter across the front of the room with an open flap in it and a rack to one side that held several trays of type posters and notices of all sorts were tacked up on the opposite wall samples no doubt the door into the back room was open showing the bulky angular frame of a printing press bent over it his back turned to me was jamie is that you geordie he asked not turning around he was dressed in shirt and breeches and had a small tool of some kind in his hand with which he was doing something to the innards of the press took ye long enough did ye get the it isnt geordie i said my voice was higher than usual its me i said claire he straightened up very slowly he wore his hair long a thick tail of a deep rich auburn sparked with copper i had time to see that the neat ribbon that tied it back was green and then he turned around he stared at me without speaking a tremor ran down the muscular throat as he swallowed but still he didnt say anything it was the same broad goodhumored face dark blue eyes aslant the high flat cheekbones of a viking long mouth curling at the ends as though always on the verge of smiling the lines surrounding eyes and mouth were deeper of course the nose had changed just a bit the knifeedge bridge was slightly thickened near the base by the ridge of an old healed fracture it made him look fiercer i thought but lessened that air of aloof reserve and lent his appearance a new rough charm i walked through the flap in the counter seeing nothing but that unblinking stare i cleared my throat when did you break your nose the corners of the wide mouth lifted slightly about three minutes after i last saw yesassenach there was a hesitation almost a question in the name there was no more than a foot between us i reached out tentatively and touched the tiny line of the break where the bone pressed white against the bronze of his skin he flinched backward as though an electric spark had arced between us and the calm expression shattered youre real he whispered i had thought him pale already now all vestiges of color drained from his face his eyes rolled up and he slumped to the floor in a shower of papers and oddments that had been sitting on the presshe fell rather gracefully for such a large man i thought abstractedly it was only a faint his eyelids were beginning to flutter by the time i knelt beside him and loosened the stock at his throat i had no doubts at all by now but still i looked automatically as i pulled the heavy linen away it was there of course the small triangular scar just above the collarbone left by the knife of captain jonathan randall esquire of his majestys eighth dragoons his normal healthy color was returning i sat crosslegged on the floor and hoisted his head onto my thigh his hair felt thick and soft in my hand his eyes opened that bad is it i said smiling down at him with the same words he had used to me on the day of our wedding holding my head in his lap twentyodd years before that bad and worse sassenach he answered mouth twitching with something almost a smile he sat up abruptly staring at me god in heaven you are real so are you i lifted my chin to look up at him i ththought you were dead i had meant to speak lightly but my voice betrayed me the tears spilled down my cheeks only to soak into the rough cloth of his shirt as he pulled me hard against him i shook so that it was some time before i realized that he was shaking too and for the same reason i dont know how long we sat there on the dusty floor crying in each others arms with the longing of twenty years spilling down our faces his fingers twined hard in my hair pulling it loose so that it tumbled down my neck the dislodged pins cascaded over my shoulders and pinged on the floor like pellets of hail my own fingers were clasped around his forearm digging into the linen as though i were afraid he would disappear unless physically restrained as though gripped by the same fear he suddenly grasped me by the shoulders and held me away from him staring desperately into my face he put his hand to my cheek and traced the bones over and over again oblivious to my tears and to my abundantly running nose i sniffed loudly which seemed to bring him to his senses for he let go and groped hastily in his sleeve for a handkerchief which he used clumsily to swab first my face then his own give me that i grabbed the erratically waving swatch of cloth and blew my nose firmly now you i handed him the cloth and watched as he blew his nose with a noise like a strangled goose i giggled undone with emotion he smiled too knuckling the tears away from his eyes unable to stop staring at me suddenly i couldnt bear not to be touching him i lunged at him and he got his arms up just in time to catch me i squeezed until i could hear his ribs crack and felt his hands roughly caressing my back as he said my name over and over at last i could let go and sat back a little he glanced down at the floor between his legs frowning did you lose something i asked surprised he looked up and smiled a little shyly i was afraid id lost hold altogether and pissed myself but its all right ive just sat on the alepot sure enough a pool of aromatic brown liquid was spreading slowly beneath him with a squeak of alarm i scrambled to my feet and helped him up after trying vainly to assess the damage behind he shrugged and unfastened his breeches he pushed the tight fabric down over his haunches then stopped and looked at me blushing slightly its all right i said feeling a rich blush stain my own cheeks were married i cast my eyes down nonetheless feeling a little breathless at least i suppose we are he stared at me for a long moment then a smile curved his wide soft mouth aye we are he said kicking free of the stained breeches he stepped toward me i stretched out a hand toward him as much to stop as to welcome him i wanted more than anything to touch him again but was unaccountably shy after so long how were we to start again he felt the constraint of mingled shyness and intimacy as well stopping a few inches from me he took my hand he hesitated for a moment then bent his head over it his lips barely brushing my knuckles his fingers touched the silver ring and stopped there holding the metal lightly between thumb and forefinger i never took it off i blurted it seemed important he should know that he squeezed my hand lightly but didnt let go i want he stopped and swallowed still holding my hand his fingers found and touched the silver ring once more i want verra much to kiss you he said softly may i do that the tears were barely dammed two more welled up and overflowed i felt them full and round roll down my cheeks yes i whispered he drew me slowly close to him holding our linked hands just under his breast i havena done this for a verra long time he said i saw the hope and the fear dark in the blue of his eyes i took the gift and gave it back to him neither have i i said softly his hands cupped my face with exquisite gentleness and he set his mouth on mine i didnt know quite what i had been expecting a reprise of the pounding fury that had accompanied our final parting i had remembered that so often lived it over in memory helpless to change the outcome the halfrough timeless hours of mutual possession in the darkness of our marriage bed i had longed for that wakened often sweating and trembling from the memory of it but we were strangers now barely touching each seeking the way toward joining slowly tentatively seeking and giving unspoken permission with our silent lips my eyes were closed and i knew without looking that jamies were as well we were quite simply afraid to look at each other without raising his head he began to stroke me lightly feeling my bones through my clothes familiarizing himself again with the terrain of my body at last his hand traveled down my arm and caught my right hand his fingers traced my hand until they found the ring again and circled it feeling the interlaced silver of the highland pattern polished with long wear but still distinct his lips moved from mine across my cheeks and eyes i gently stroked his back feeling through his shirt the marks i couldnt see the remnants of old scars like my ring worn but still distinct ive seen ye so many times he said his voice whispering warm in my ear youve come to me so often when i dreamed sometimes when i lay in fever when i was so afraid and so lonely i knew i must die when i needed you i would always see ye smiling with your hair curling up about your face but ye never spoke and ye never touched me i can touch you now i reached up and drew my hand gently down his temple his ear the cheek and jaw that i could see my hand went to the nape of his neck under the clubbed bronze hair and he raised his head at last and cupped my face between his hands love glowing strong in the dark blue eyes dinna be afraid he said softly theres the two of us now we might have gone on standing there gazing at each other indefinitely had the shop bell over the door not rung i let go of jamie and looked around sharply to see a small wiry man with coarse dark hair standing in the door mouth agape holding a small parcel in one hand oh there ye are geordie whats kept ye jamie said geordie said nothing but his eyes traveled dubiously over his employer standing barelegged in his shirt in the middle of the shop his breeches shoes and stockings discarded on the floor and me in his arms with my gown all crumpled and my hair coming down geordies narrow face creased into a censorious frown i quit he said in the rich tones of the west highlands the printings one thingim wi ye there and yell no think otherwisebut im free church and my daddy before me and my grandsire before him workin for a papist is one thingthe popes coins as good as any ayebut workin for an immoral papist is another do as ye like wi your own soul man but if its come to orgies in the shop its come too far thats what i say i quit he placed the package precisely in the center of the counter spun on his heel and stalked toward the door outside the town clock on the tolbooth began to strike geordie turned in the doorway to glare accusingly at us and it not even noon yet he said the shop door slammed behind him jamie stared after him for a moment then sank slowly down onto the floor again laughing so hard the tears came to his eyes and its not even noon yet he repeated wiping the tears off his cheeks oh god geordie he rocked back and forth grasping his knees with both hands i couldnt help laughing myself though i was rather worried i didnt mean to cause you trouble i said will he come back do you think he sniffed and wiped his face carelessly on the tail of his shirt oh aye he lives just across the way in wickham wynd ill go and see him in a bit andand explain he said he looked at me realization dawning and added god knows how it looked for a minute as though he might start laughing again but he mastered the impulse and stood up have you got another pair of breeches i asked picking up the discarded ones and draping them across the counter to dry aye i haveupstairs wait a bit though he snaked a long arm into the cupboard beneath the counter and came out with a neatly lettered notice that said gone out attaching this to the outside of the door and firmly bolting the inside he turned to me will ye step upstairs wi me he said he crooked an arm invitingly eyes sparkling if ye dinna think it immoral why not i said the impulse to explode in laughter was just below the surface sparkling in my blood like champagne were married arent we the upstairs was divided into two rooms one on either side of the landing and a small privy closet just off the landing itself the back room was plainly devoted to storage for the printing business the door was propped open and i could see wooden crates filled with books towering bundles of pamphlets neatly tied with twine barrels of alcohol and powdered ink and a jumble of oddlooking hardware that i assumed must be spare parts for a printing press the front room was spare as a monks cell there was a chest of drawers with a pottery candlestick on it a washstand a stool and a narrow cot little more than a camp bed i let out my breath when i saw it only then realizing that i had been holding it he slept alone a quick glance around confirmed that there was no sign of a feminine presence in the room and my heart began to beat with a normal rhythm again plainly no one lived here but jamie he had pushed aside the curtain that blocked off a corner of the room and the row of pegs revealed there supported no more than a couple of shirts a coat and long waistcoat in sober gray a gray wool cloak and the spare pair of breeches he had come to fetch he had his back turned to me as he tucked in his shirt and fastened the new breeches but i could see the selfconsciousness in the tense line of his shoulders i could feel a similar tension in the back of my own neck given a moment to recover from the shock of seeing each other we were both stricken now with shyness i saw his shoulders straighten and then he turned around to face me the hysterical laughter had left us and the tears though his face still showed the marks of so much sudden feeling and i knew mine did too its verra fine to see ye claire he said softly i thought i neverwell he shrugged slightly as though to ease the tightness of the linen shirt across his shoulders he swallowed then met my eyes directly the child he said everything he felt was evident on his face urgent hope desperate fear and the struggle to contain both i smiled at him and put out my hand come here i had thought long and hard about what i might bring with me should my journey through the stones succeed given my previous brush with accusations of witchcraft i had been very careful but there was one thing i had had to bring no matter what the consequences might be if anyone saw them i pulled him down to sit beside me on the cot and pulled out of my pocket the small rectangular package i had done up with such care in boston i undid its waterproof wrapping and thrust its contents into his hands there i said he took them from me gingerly like one handling an unknown and possibly dangerous substance his big hands framed the photographs for a moment holding them confined briannas round newborn face was oblivious between his fingers tiny fists curled on her blanket slanted eyes closed in the new exhaustion of existence her small mouth slightly open in sleep i looked up at his face it was absolutely blank with shock he held the pictures close to his chest unmoving wideeyed and staring as though he had just been transfixed by a crossbow bolt through the heartas i supposed he had your daughter sent you this i said i turned his blank face toward me and gently kissed him on the mouth that broke the trance he blinked and his face came to life again myshe his voice was hoarse with shock daughter my daughter sheknows she does look at the rest i slid the first picture from his grasp revealing the snapshot of brianna uproariously festooned with the icing of her first birthday cake a fourtoothed smile of fiendish triumph on her face as she waved a new plush rabbit overhead jamie made a small inarticulate sound and his fingers loosened i took the small stack of photographs from him and gave them back one at a time brianna at two stubby in her snowsuit cheeks round and flushed as apples feathery hair wisping from under her hood bree at four hair a smooth bellshaped gleam as she sat one ankle propped on the opposite knee as she smiled for the photographer proper and poised in a white pinafore at five in proud possession of her first lunchbox waiting to board the school bus to kindergarten she wouldnt let me go with her she wanted to go alone shes very bbrave not afraid of anything i felt halfchoked as i explained displayed pointed to the changing images that fell from his hands and slid down to the floor as he began to snatch each new picture oh god he said at the picture of bree at ten sitting on the kitchen floor with her arms around smoky the big newfoundland that one was in color her hair a brilliant shimmer against the dogs shiny black coat his hands were shaking so badly that he couldnt hold the pictures anymore i had to show him the last fewbree fullgrown laughing at a string of fish shed caught standing at a window in secretive contemplation redfaced and tousled leaning on the handle of the ax she had been using to split kindling these showed her face in all the moods i could capture always that face longnosed and widemouthed with those high broad flat viking cheekbones and slanted eyesa finerboned more delicate version of her fathers of the man who sat on the cot beside me mouth working wordlessly and the tears running soundless down his own cheeks he splayed a hand out over the photographs trembling fingers not quite touching the shiny surfaces and then he turned and leaned toward me slowly with the improbable grace of a tall tree falling he buried his face in my shoulder and went very quietly and thoroughly to pieces i held him to my breast arms tight around the broad shaking shoulders and my own tears fell on his hair making small dark patches in the ruddy waves i pressed my cheek against the top of his head and murmured small incoherent things to him as though he were brianna i thought to myself that perhaps it was like surgeryeven when an operation is done to repair existing damage the healing still is painful her name he raised his face at last wiping his nose on the back of his hand he picked up the pictures again gently as though they might disintegrate at his touch what did ye name her brianna i said proudly brianna he said frowning at the pictures what an awful name for a wee lassie i started back as though struck it is not awful i snapped its a beautiful name and besides you told me to name her that what do you mean its an awful name i told ye to name her that he blinked you most certainly did when wewhen wethe last time i saw you i pressed my lips tightly together so i wouldnt cry again after a moment i had mastered my feelings enough to add you told me to name the baby for your father his name was brian wasnt it aye it was a smile seemed to be struggling for dominance of the other emotions on his face aye he said aye youre right i did its onlywell i thought it would be a boy is all and youre sorry she wasnt i glared at him and began snatching up the scattered photographs his hands on my arms stopped me no he said no im not sorry of course not his mouth twitched slightly but i willna deny shes the hell of a shock sassenach so are you i sat still for a moment looking at him i had had months to prepare myself for this and still my knees felt weak and my stomach was clenched in knots he had been taken completely unawares by my appearance little wonder if he was reeling a bit under the impact i expect i am are you sorry i came i asked i swallowed dodo you want me to go his hands clamped my arms so tightly that i let out a small yelp realizing that he was hurting me he loosened his grip but kept a firm hold nonetheless his face had gone quite pale at the suggestion he took a deep breath and let it out no he said with an approximation of calmness i dont i he broke off abruptly jaw clamped no he said again very definitely his hand slid down to take hold of mine and with the other he reached down to pick up the photographs he laid them on his knee looking at them with head bent so i couldnt see his face brianna he said softly ye say it wrong sassenach her name is brianna he said it with an odd highland lilt so that the first syllable was accented the second barely pronounced breeanah breeanah i said amused he nodded eyes still fixed on the pictures brianna he said its a beautiful name glad you like it i said he glanced up then and met my eyes with a smile hidden in the corner of his long mouth tell me about her one forefinger traced the pudgy features of the baby in the snowsuit what was she like as a wee lassie what did she first say when she learned to speak his hand drew me closer and i nestled close to him he was big and solid and smelled of clean linen and ink with a warm male scent that was as exciting to me as it was familiar dog i said that was her first word the second one was no the smile widened across his face aye they all learn that one fast shell like dogs then he fanned the pictures out like cards searching out the one with smoky thats a lovely dog with her there what sort is that a newfoundland i bent forward to thumb through the pictures theres another one here with a puppy a friend of mine gave her the dim gray daylight had begun to fade and the rain had been pattering on the roof for some time before our talk was interrupted by a fierce subterranean growl emanating from below the lacetrimmed bodice of my jessica gutenburg it had been a long time since the peanut butter sandwich hungry sassenach jamie asked rather unnecessarily i thought well yes now that you mention it do you still keep food in the top drawer when we were first married i had developed the habit of keeping small bits of food on hand to supply his constant appetite and the top drawer of any chest of drawers where we lived generally provided a selection of rolls small cakes or bits of cheese he laughed and stretched aye i do theres no much there just now though but a couple of stale bannocks better i take ye down to the tavern and the look of happiness engendered by perusing the photographs of brianna faded to be replaced by a look of alarm he glanced quickly at the window where a soft purplish color was beginning to replace the pale gray and the look of alarm deepened the tavern christ ive forgotten mr willoughby he was on his feet and groping in the chest for fresh stockings before i could say anything coming out with the stockings in one hand and two bannocks in the other he tossed the latter into my lap and sat down on the stool hastily yanking on the former whos mr willoughby i bit into a bannock scattering crumbs damn he said more to himself than me i said id come for him at noon but it went out o my head entirely it must be four oclock by now it is i heard the clock strike a little while ago damn he repeated thrusting his feet into a pair of pewterbuckled shoes he rose snatched his coat from the peg and then paused at the door youll come wi me he asked anxiously i licked my fingers and rose pulling my cloak around me wild horses couldnt stop me i assured him house of joy who is mr willoughby i inquired as we paused under the arch of carfax close to peer out at the cobbled street erhes an associate of mine jamie replied with a wary glance at me best put up your hood its pouring it was in fact raining quite hard sheets of water fell from the arch overhead and gurgled down the gutters cleansing the streets of sewage and rubbish i took a deep breath of the damp clean air feeling exhilarated by the wildness of the evening and the closeness of jamie tall and powerful by my side i had found him i had found him and whatever unknowns life now held they didnt seem to matter i felt reckless and indestructible i took his hand and squeezed it he looked down and smiled at me squeezing back where are we going to the worlds end the roar of the water made conversation difficult without further speech jamie took me by the elbow to help me across the cobbles and we plunged down the steep incline of the royal mile luckily the tavern called the worlds end was no more than a hundred yards away hard as the rain was the shoulders of my cloak were scarcely more than dampened when we ducked beneath the low lintel and into the narrow entryhall the main room was crowded warm and smoky a snug refuge from the storm outside there were a few women seated on the benches that ran along the walls but most of the patrons were men here and there was a man in the wellkept dress of a merchant but most men with homes to go to were in them at this hour the tavern hosted a mix of soldiers wharf rats laborers and apprentices with here and there the odd drunkard for variety heads looked up at our appearance and there were shouts of greeting and a general shuffling and pushing to make room at one of the long tables clearly jamie was wellknown in the worlds end a few curious glances came my way but no one said anything i kept my cloak pulled close around me and followed jamie through the crush of the tavern nay mistress well no be stayin he said to the young barmaid who bustled forward with an eager smile ive only come for himself the girl rolled her eyes oh aye and no before time either mithers put him doon the stair aye im late jamie said apologetically i hadbusiness that kept me the girl looked curiously at me but then shrugged and dimpled at jamie och its no trouble sir harry took him doon a stoup of brandy and weve heard little more of him since brandy eh jamie sounded resigned still awake is he he reached into the pocket of his coat and brought out a small leather pouch from which he extracted several coins which he dropped into the girls outstretched hand i expect so she said cheerfully pocketing the money i heard him singin a whiles since thankee sir with a nod jamie ducked under the lintel at the back of the room motioning me to follow a tiny barrelceilinged kitchen lay behind the main taproom with a huge kettle of what looked like oyster stew simmering in the hearth it smelled delicious and i could feel my mouth starting to water at the rich aroma i hoped we could do our business with mr willoughby over supper a fat woman in a grimy bodice and skirt knelt by the hearth stuffing billets of wood into the fire she glanced up at jamie and nodded but made no move to get up he lifted a hand in response and headed for a small wooden door in the corner he lifted the bolt and swung the door open to reveal a dark stairway leading down apparently into the bowels of the earth a light flickered somewhere far below as though elves were mining diamonds beneath the tavern jamies shoulders filled the narrow stairwell obstructing my view of whatever lay below us when he stepped out into the open space below i could see heavy oak rafters and a row of huge casks standing on a long plank set on hurdles against the stone wall only a single torch burned at the foot of the stair the cellar was shadowy and its cavelike depths seemed quite deserted i listened but didnt hear anything but the muffled racket of the tavern upstairs certainly no singing are you sure hes down here i bent to peer beneath the row of casks wondering whether perhaps the bibulous mr willoughby had been overcome with an excess of brandy and sought some secluded spot to sleep it off oh aye jamie sounded grim but resigned the wee buggers hiding i expect he knows i dinna like it when he drinks in public houses i raised an eyebrow at this but he merely strode into the shadows muttering under his breath the cellar stretched some way and i could hear him shuffling cautiously in the dark long after i lost sight of him left in the circle of torchlight near the stairs i looked around with interest besides the row of casks there were a number of wooden crates stacked near the center of the room against an odd little chunk of wall that stood by itself rising some five feet out of the cellar floor running back into the darkness i had heard of this feature of the tavern when we had stayed in edinburgh twenty years before with his highness prince charles but what with one thing and another i had never actually seen it before it was the remnant of a wall constructed by the city fathers of edinburgh following the disastrous battle of flodden field in concludingwith some justicethat no good was likely to come of association with the english to the south they had built a wall defining both the city limits and the limit of the civilized world of scotland hence the worlds end and the name had stuck through several versions of the tavern that had eventually been built upon the remnants of the old scots wishful thinking damned little bugger jamie emerged from the shadows a cobweb stuck in his hair and a frown on his face he must be back of the wall turning he put his hands to his mouth and shouted something it sounded like incomprehensible gibberishnot even like gaelic i dug a finger dubiously into one ear wondering whether the trip through the stones had deranged my hearing a sudden movement caught the corner of my eye causing me to look up just in time to see a ball of brilliant blue fly off the top of the ancient wall and smack jamie squarely between the shoulderblades he hit the cellar floor with a frightful thump and i dashed toward his fallen body jamie are you all right the prone figure made a number of coarse remarks in gaelic and sat up slowly rubbing his forehead which had struck the stone floor a glancing blow the blue ball meanwhile had resolved itself into the figure of a very small chinese who was giggling in unhinged delight sallow round face shining with glee and brandy mr willoughby i presume i said to this apparition keeping a wary eye out for further tricks he appeared to recognize his name for he grinned and nodded madly at me his eyes creased to gleaming slits he pointed to himself said something in chinese and then sprang into the air and executed several backflips in rapid succession bobbing up on his feet in beaming triumph at the end bloody flea jamie got up wiping the skinned palms of his hands gingerly on his coat with a quick snatch he caught hold of the chinamans collar and jerked him off his feet come on he said parking the little man on the stairway and prodding him firmly in the back we need to be going and quick now in response the little blueclad figure promptly sagged into limpness looking like a bag of laundry resting on the step hes all right when hes sober jamie explained apologetically to me as he hoisted the chinese over one shoulder but he really shouldna drink brandy hes a terrible sot so i see where on earth did you get him fascinated i followed jamie up the stairs watching mr willoughbys pigtail swing back and forth like a metronome across the felted gray wool of jamies cloak on the docks but before he could explain further the door above opened and we were back in the taverns kitchen the stout proprietor saw us emerge and came toward us her fat cheeks puffed with disapproval now mr malcolm she began frowning ye ken verra weel as youre welcome here and yell ken as weel that im no a fussy woman such not bein a convenient attitude when maintainin a public hoose but ive telt ye before yon wee yellow mannie is no aye yeve mentioned it mrs patterson jamie interrupted he dug in his pocket and came up with a coin which he handed to the stout publican with a bow and your forbearance is much appreciated it willna happen again i hope he added under his breath he placed his hat on his head bowed again to mrs patterson and ducked under the low lintel into the main tavern our reentry caused another stir but a negative one this time people fell silent or muttered halfheard curses under their breath i gathered that mr willoughby was perhaps not this locals most popular patron jamie edged his way through the crowd which gave way reluctantly i followed as best i could trying not to meet anyones eyes and trying not to breathe unused as i was to the unhygienic miasma of the eighteenth century the stench of so many unwashed bodies in a small space was nearly overwhelming near the door though we met trouble in the person of a buxom young woman whose dress was a notch above the sober drab of the landlady and her daughter her neckline was a notch lower and i hadnt much trouble in guessing her principal occupation absorbed in flirtatious conversation with a couple of apprentice lads when we emerged from the kitchen she looked up as we passed and sprang to her feet with a piercing scream knocking over a cup of ale in the process its him she screeched pointing a wavering finger at jamie the foul fiend her eyes seemed to have trouble focusing i gathered that the spilled ale wasnt her first of the evening early as it was her companions stared at jamie with interest the more so when the young lady advanced stabbing her finger in the air like one leading a chorus him the wee poolie i telt ye ofhim that did the disgustin thing to me i joined the rest of the crowd in looking at jamie with interest but quickly realized as did they that the young woman was not talking to him but rather to his burden ye neffit qurd she yelled addressing her remarks to the seat of mr willoughbys bluesilk trousers hiddiepyke slug this spectacle of maidenly distress was rousing her companions one a tall burly lad stood up fists clenched and leaned on the table eyes gleaming with ale and aggro shim aye shall i knivvle him for ye maggie dinna try laddie jamie advised him shortly shifting his burden for better balance drink your drink and well be gone oh aye and youre the little keds pimpmaster are ye the lad sneered unbecomingly his flushed face turning in my direction at least your other whores no yellowles ha a look at her he flung out a paw and grabbed the edge of my cloak revealing the low bodice of the jessica gutenburg looks pink enough to me said his friend with obvious approval is she like it all over before i could move he snatched at the bodice catching the edge of the lace not designed for the rigors of eighteenthcentury life the flimsy fabric ripped halfway down the side exposing quite a lot of pink leave off ye whoreson jamie swung about eyes blazing free fist doubled in threat who ye miscallin ye skraeshankit skoot the first youth unable to get out from behind the table leapt on top of it and launched himself at jamie who neatly sidestepped the lad allowing him to crash facefirst into the wall jamie took one giant step toward the table brought his fist down hard on top of the other apprentices head making the lads jaw go slack then grabbed me by the hand and dragged me out the door come on he said grunting as he shifted the chinamans slippery form for a better grip theyll be after us any moment they were i could hear the shouting as the more boisterous elements poured out of the tavern into the street behind us jamie took the first opening off the royal mile into a narrow dark wynd and we splashed through mud and unidentifiable slops ducked through an archway and down another twisting alleyway that seemed to lead through the bowels of edinburgh dark walls flashed past and splintered wooden doors and then we were round a corner in a small courtyard where we paused for breath whaton earthdid he do i gasped i couldnt imagine what the little chinese could have done to a strapping young wench like the recent maggie from all appearances she could have squashed him like a fly well its the feet ye ken jamie explained with a glance of resigned irritation at mr willoughby feet i glanced involuntarily at the tiny chinese mans feet neat miniatures shod in feltsoled black satin not his jamie said catching my glance the womens what women i asked well so far its only been whores he said glancing through the archway in search of pursuit but ye canna tell what he may try no judgment he explained briefly hes a heathen i see i said though so far i didnt what there they are a shout at the far end of the alley interrupted my question damn i thought theyd give it up come on this way we were off once more down an alley back onto the royal mile a few steps down the hill and back into a close i could hear shouts and cries behind us on the main street but jamie grasped my arm and jerked me after him through an open doorway into a yard full of casks bundles and crates he looked frantically about then heaved mr willoughbys limp body into a large barrel filled with rubbish pausing only long enough to drop a piece of canvas on the chineses head for concealment he dragged me behind a wagon loaded with crates and pulled me down beside him i was gasping from the unaccustomed exertion and my heart was racing from the adrenaline of fear jamies face was flushed with cold and exercise and his hair was sticking up in several directions but he was scarcely breathing hard do you do this sort of thing all the time i asked pressing a hand to my bosom in a vain effort to make my heart slow down not exactly he said peering warily over the top of the wagon in search of pursuit the echo of pounding feet came faintly then disappeared and everything was quiet save for the patter of rain on the boxes above us theyve gone past wed best stay here a bit to make sure though he lifted down a crate for me to sit on procured another for himself and sat down sighing pushing the loose hair out of his face with one hand he gave me a lopsided smile im sorry sassenach i didna think it would be quite so eventful i finished for him i smiled back and pulled out a handkerchief to wipe a drop of moisture from the end of my nose its all right i glanced at the large barrel where stirrings and rustlings indicated that mr willoughby was returning to a more or less conscious state erhow do you know about the feet he told me hes a taste for the drink ye ken he explained with a glance at the barrel where his colleague lay concealed and when hes taken a drop too much he starts talkin about womens feet and all the horrible things he wants to do wi them what sort of horrible things can you do with a foot i was fascinated surely the possibilities are limited no they arent jamie said grimly but it isna something i want to be talking about in the public street a faint singsong came from the depths of the barrel behind us it was hard to tell amid the natural inflections of the language but i thought mr willoughby was asking a question of some sort shut up ye wee poutworm jamie said rudely another word and ill walk on your damn face myself see how ye like that there was a highpitched giggle and the barrel fell silent he wants someone to walk on his face i asked aye you jamie said briefly he shrugged apologetically and his cheeks flushed a deeper red i hadna time to tell him who ye were does he speak english oh aye in a way but not many people understand him when he does i mostly talk to him in chinee i stared at him you speak chinese he shrugged tilting his head with a faint smile well i speak chinee about as well as mr willoughby speaks english but then he hasna got all that much choice in who he talks to so he puts up wi me my heart showed signs of returning to normal and i leaned back against the wagon bed my hood farther forward against the drizzle where on earth did he get a name like willoughby i asked while i was curious about the chinese i was even more curious about what a respectable edinburgh printer was doing with one but i felt a certain hesitance in prying into jamies life freshly returned from the supposed deador its equivalenti could hardly demand to know all the details of his life on the spot jamie rubbed a hand across his nose aye well its only that his real names yi tien cho he says it means leans against heaven too hard for the local scots to pronounce knowing the insular nature of most scots i wasnt surprised that they were disinclined to venture into strange linguistic waters jamie with his gift for tongues was a genetic anomaly he smiled teeth a white gleam in the gathering darkness well its no that so much its only if ye say his name just a wee bit off like it sounds verra much like a coarse word in gaelic i thought willoughby would maybe do better i see i thought perhaps under the circumstances i shouldnt ask just what the indelicate gaelic word was i glanced over my shoulder but the coast seemed clear jamie caught the gesture and rose nodding aye we can go now the lads will ha gone back to the tavern by now wont we have to pass by the worlds end on the way back to the printshop i asked dubiously or is there a back way it was full dark by now and the thought of stumbling through the middens and muddy back passages of edinburgh was unappealing ahno we willna be going to the printshop i couldnt see his face but there seemed a certain reserve in his manner perhaps he had a residence somewhere else in the city i felt a certain hollowness at the prospect the room above the printshop was very clearly a monks cell but perhaps he had an entire house somewhere elsewith a family in it there had been no time for any but the most essential exchange of information at the printshop i had no way of knowing what he had done over the last twenty years or what he might now be doing still he had plainly been gladto say the leastto see me and the air of frowning consideration he now bore might well have to do with his inebriated associate rather than with me he bent over the barrel saying something in scotsaccented chinese this was one of the odder sounds i had ever heard rather like the squeaks of a bagpipe tuning up i thought vastly entertained by the performance whatever hed said mr willoughby replied to it volubly interrupting himself with giggles and snorts at last the little chinese climbed out of the barrel his diminutive figure silhouetted by the light of a distant lantern in the alleyway he sprang down with fair agility and promptly prostrated himself on the ground before me bearing in mind what jamie had told me about the feet i took a quick step back but jamie laid a reassuring hand on my arm nay its all right sassenach he said hes only makin amends for his disrespect to ye earlier oh well i looked dubiously at mr willoughby who was gabbling something to the ground under his face at a loss for the proper etiquette i stooped down and patted him on the head evidently that was all right for he leapt to his feet and bowed to me several times until jamie told him impatiently to stop and we made our way back to the royal mile the building jamie led us to was discreetly hidden down a small close just above the kirk of the canongate perhaps a quartermile above holyrood palace i saw the lanterns mounted by the gates of the palace below and shivered slightly at the sight we had lived with charles stuart in the palace for nearly five weeks in the early victorious phase of his short career jamies uncle colum mackenzie had died there the door opened to jamies knock and all thoughts of the past vanished the woman who stood peering out at us candle in hand was petite darkhaired and elegant seeing jamie she drew him in with a glad cry and kissed his cheek in greeting my insides squeezed tight as a fist but then relaxed again as i heard him greet her as madame jeanne not what one would call a wifenor yet i hoped a mistress still there was something about the woman that made me uneasy she was clearly french though she spoke english wellnot so odd edinburgh was a seaport and a fairly cosmopolitan city she was dressed soberly but richly in heavy silk cut with a flair but she wore a good deal more rouge and powder than the average scotswoman what disturbed me was the way she was looking at mefrowning with a palpable air of distaste monsieur fraser she said touching jamie on the shoulder with a possessive air that i didnt like at all if i might have a word in private with you jamie handing his cloak to the maid who came to fetch it took a quick look at me and read the situation at once of course madame jeanne he said courteously reaching out a hand to draw me forward but firstallow me to introduce my wife madame fraser my heart stopped beating for a moment then resumed with a force that i was sure was audible to everyone in the small entry hall jamies eyes met mine and he smiled the grip of his fingers tightening on my arm yourwife i couldnt tell whether astonishment or horror was more pronounced on madame jeannes face but monsieur fraseryou bring her here i thoughta womanwell enough but to insult our own jeune filles is not goodbut thena wife her mouth hung open unbecomingly displaying several decayed molars then she shook herself suddenly back into an attitude of flustered poise and inclined her head to me with an attempt at graciousness bonsoirmadame likewise im sure i said politely is my room ready madame jamie said without waiting for an answer he turned toward the stair taking me with him we shall be spending the night he glanced back at mr willoughby who had come in with us he had sat down at once on the floor where he sat dripping rain a dreamy expression on his small flat face er jamie made a small questioning motion toward mr willoughby his eyebrows raised at madame jeanne she stared at the little chinese for a moment as though wondering where he had come from then returned to herself clapped her hands briskly for the maid see if mademoiselle josie is at liberty if you please pauline she said and then fetch up hot water and fresh towels for monsieur fraser and hiswife she spoke the word with a sort of stunned amazement as though she still didnt quite believe it oh and one more thing if you would be so kind madame jamie leaned over the banister smiling down at her my wife will require a fresh gown she has had an unfortunate accident to her wardrobe if you could provide something suitable by morning thank you madame jeanne bonsoir i didnt speak as i followed him up four flights of winding stairs to the top of the house i was much too busy thinking my mind in a whirl pimpmaster the lad in the pub had called him but surely that was only an epithetsuch a thing was absolutely impossible for the jamie fraser i had known it was impossible i corrected myself looking up at the broad shoulders under the dark gray serge coat but for this man i didnt know quite what i had been expecting but the room was quite ordinary small and cleanthough that was extraordinary come to think of itfurnished with a stool a simple bed and chest of drawers upon which stood a basin and ewer and a clay candlestick with a beeswax candle which jamie lighted from the taper he had carried up he shucked off his wet coat and draped it carelessly on the stool then sat down on the bed to remove his wet shoes god he said im starving i hope the cooks not gone to bed yet jamie i said take off your cloak sassenach he said noticing me still standing against the door youre soaked yes wellyes i swallowed then went on theres justerjamie why have you got a regular room in a brothel i burst out he rubbed his chin looking mildly embarrassed im sorry sassenach he said i know it wasna right to bring ye here but it was the only place i could think of where we might get your dress mended at short notice besides finding a hot supper and then i had to put mr willoughby where he wouldna get in more trouble and as we had to come here anywaywellhe glanced at the bedits a good deal more comfortable than my cot at the printshop but perhaps it was a poor idea we can leave if ye feel its not i dont mind about that i interrupted the question iswhy have you got a room in a brothel are you such a good customer that a customer he stared up at me eyebrows raised here god sassenach what dye think i am damned if i know i said thats why im asking are you going to answer my question he stared at his stockinged feet for a moment wiggling his toes on the floorboard at last he looked up at me and answered calmly i suppose so im not a customer of jeannes but shes a customer of mineand a good one she keeps a room for me because im often abroad late on business and id as soon have a place i can come to where i can have food and a bed at any hour and privacy the room is part of my arrangement with her i had been holding my breath now i let out about half of it all right i said then i suppose the next question is what business has the owner of a brothel got with a printer the absurd thought that perhaps he printed advertising circulars for madame jeanne flitted through my brain to be instantly dismissed well he said slowly no i dinna think thats the question its not no with one fluid move he was off the bed and standing in front of me close enough for me to have to look up into his face i had a sudden urge to take a step backward but didnt largely because there wasnt room the question is sassenach why have ye come back he said softly thats a hell of a question to ask me my palms pressed flat against the rough wood of the door why do you think i came back damn you i dinna ken the soft scottish voice was cool but even in the dim light i could see the pulse throbbing in the open throat of his shirt did ye come to be my wife again or only to bring me word of my daughter as though he sensed that his nearness unnerved me he turned away suddenly moving toward the window where the shutters creaked in the wind you are the mother of my childfor that alone i owe ye my soulfor the knowledge that my life hasna been in vainthat my child is safe he turned again to face me blue eyes intent but it has been a time sassenach since you and i were one youll have had your lifethenand i have had mine here youll know nothing of what ive done or been did ye come now because ye wanted toor because ye felt ye must my throat felt tight but i met his eyes i came now because beforei thought you were dead i thought youd died at culloden his eyes dropped to the windowsill where he picked at a splinter aye i see he said softly welli meant to be dead he smiled without humor eyes intent on the splinter i tried hard enough he looked up at me again how did ye find out i hadna died or where i was come to that i had help a young historian named roger wakefield found the records he tracked you to edinburgh and when i saw a malcolm i knewi thoughtit might be you i ended lamely time enough for the details later aye i see and then ye came but stillwhy i stared at him without speaking for a moment as though he felt the need of air or perhaps only for something to do he fumbled with the latch of the shutters and thrust them halfway open flooding the room with the sound of rushing water and the cold fresh smell of rain are you trying to tell me you dont want me to stay i said finally because if soi mean i know youll have a life nowmaybe you haveother ties with unnaturally acute senses i could hear the small sounds of activity throughout the house below even above the rush of the storm and the pounding of my own heart my palms were damp and i wiped them surreptitiously against my skirt he turned from the window to stare at me christ he said not want ye his face was pale now and his eyes unnaturally bright i have burned for you for twenty years sassenach he said softly do ye not know that jesus the breeze stirred the loose wisps of hair around his face and he brushed them back impatiently but im no the man ye knew twenty years past am i he turned away with a gesture of frustration we know each other now less than we did when we wed do you want me to go the blood was pounding thickly in my ears no he swung quickly toward me and gripped my shoulder tightly making me pull back involuntarily no he said more quietly i dinna want ye to go i told ye so and i meant it buti must know he bent his head toward me his face alive with troubled question do ye want me he whispered sassenach will ye take meand risk the man that i am for the sake of the man ye knew i felt a great wave of relief mingled with fear it ran from his hand on my shoulder to the tips of my toes weakening my joints its a lot too late to ask that i said and reached to touch his cheek where the rough beard was starting to show it was soft under my fingers like stiff plush because ive already risked everything i had but whoever you are now jamie fraseryes yes i do want you the light of the candle flame glowed blue in his eyes as he held out his hands to me and i stepped wordless into his embrace i rested my face against his chest marveling at the feel of him in my arms so big so solid and warm real after the years of longing for a ghost i could not touch disentangling himself after a moment he looked down at me and touched my cheek very gently he smiled slightly youve the devils own courage aye but then ye always did i tried to smile at him but my lips trembled what about you how do you know what im like you dont know what ive been doing for the last twenty years either i might be a horrible person for all you know the smile on his lips moved into his eyes lighting them with humor i suppose ye might at that but dye know sassenachi dinna think i care i stood looking at him for another minute then heaved a deep sigh that popped a few more stitches in my gown neither do i it seemed absurd to be shy with him but shy i was the adventures of the evening and his words to me had opened up the chasm of realitythose twenty unshared years that gaped between us and the unknown future that lay beyond now we had come to the place where we would begin to know each other again and discover whether we were in fact the same two who had once existed as one fleshand whether we might be one again a knock at the door broke the tension it was a small servingmaid with a tray of supper she bobbed shyly to me smiled at jamie and laid both suppercold meat hot broth and warm oatbread with butterand the fire with a quick and practiced hand then left us with a murmured good een to ye we ate slowly talking carefully only of neutral things i told him how i had made my way from craigh na dun to inverness and made him laugh with stories of mr graham and master georgie he in turn told me about mr willoughby how he had found the little chinese halfstarved and dead drunk lying behind a row of casks on the docks at burntisland one of the shipping ports near edinburgh we said nothing much of ourselves but as we ate i became increasingly conscious of his body watching his fine long hands as he poured wine and cut meat seeing the twist of his powerful torso under his shirt and the graceful line of neck and shoulder as he stooped to retrieve a fallen napkin once or twice i thought i saw his gaze linger on me in the same waya sort of hesitant aviditybut he quickly glanced away each time hooding his eyes so that i could not tell what he saw or felt as the supper concluded the same thought was uppermost in both our minds it could scarcely be otherwise considering the place in which we found ourselves a tremor of mingled fear and anticipation shot through me at last he drained his wineglass set it down and met my eyes directly will ye he stopped the flush deepening on his features but met my eyes swallowed once and went on will ye come to bed wi me then i mean he hurried on its cold and were both damp and and there arent any chairs i finished for him all right i pulled my hand loose from his and turned toward the bed feeling a queer mix of excitement and hesitance that made my breath come short he pulled off his breeches and stockings quickly then glanced at me im sorry sassenach i should have thought yed need help wi your laces so he didnt undress women often i thought before i could stop myself and my lips curved in a smile at the thought well its not laces i murmured but if youd give a hand in the back there i laid aside my cloak and turned my back to him lifting my hair to expose the neck of the dress there was a puzzled silence then i felt a finger sliding slowly down the groove of my backbone whats that he said sounding startled its called a zipper i said smiling though he couldnt see me see the little tab at the top just take hold of that and pull it straight down the zipper teeth parted with a muted ripping noise and the remnants of jessica gutenburg sagged free i pulled my arms out of the sleeves and let the dress drop heavily around my feet turning to face jamie before i lost my nerve he jerked back startled by this sudden chrysalisshedding then he blinked and stared at me i stood in front of him in nothing but my shoes and gartered rosesilk stockings i had an overwhelming urge to snatch the dress back up but i resisted it i stiffened my spine raised my chin and waited he didnt say a word his eyes gleamed in the candlelight as he moved his head slightly but he still had that trick of hiding all his thoughts behind an inscrutable mask will you bloody say something i demanded at last in a voice that shook only a little his mouth opened but no words came out he shook his head slowly from side to side jesus he whispered at last claireyou are the most beautiful woman i have ever seen you i said with conviction are losing your eyesight its probably glaucoma youre too young for cataracts he laughed at that a little unsteadily and then i saw that he was in fact blindedhis eyes shone with moisture even as he smiled he blinked hard and held out his hand i he said with equal conviction ha got eyes like a hawk and always did come here to me a little reluctantly i took his hand and stepped out of the inadequate shelter of the remains of my dress he drew me gently in to stand between his knees as he sat on the bed then he kissed me softly once on each breast and laid his head between them his breath coming warm on my bare skin your breast is like ivory he said softly the word almost breest in the highland scots that always grew broad when he was truly moved his hand rose to cup one breast his fingers tanned into darkness against my own pale glow only to see them sae full and sae roundchrist i could lay my head here forever but to touch ye my sassenachyou wi your skin like white velvet and the sweet long lines of your body he paused and i could feel the working of his throat muscles as he swallowed his hand moving slowly down the curving slope of waist and hip the swell and taper of buttock and thigh dear god he said still softly i couldna look at ye sassenach and keep my hands from you nor have ye near me and not want ye he lifted his head then and planted a kiss over my heart then let his hand float down the gentle curve of my belly lightly tracing the small marks left there by briannas birth youreally dont mind i said hesitantly brushing my own fingers over my stomach he smiled up at me with something halfrueful in his expression he hesitated for a moment then drew up the hem of his shirt do you he asked the scar ran from midthigh nearly to his groin an eightinch length of twisted whitish tissue i couldnt repress a gasp at its appearance and dropped to my knees beside him i laid my cheek on his thigh holding tight to his leg as though i would keep him nowas i had not been able to keep him then i could feel the slow deep pulse of the blood through his femoral artery under my fingersa bare inch away from the ugly gully of that twisting scar it doesna fright ye nor sicken ye sassenach he asked laying a hand on my hair i lifted my head and stared up at him of course not aye well he reached to touch my stomach his eyes holding mine and if ye bear the scars of your own battles sassenach he said softly they dinna trouble me either he lifted me to the bed beside him then and leaned to kiss me i kicked off my shoes and curled my legs up feeling the warmth of him through his shirt my hands found the button at the throat fumbling to open it i want to see you well its no much to see sassenach he said with an uncertain laugh but whatever it is its yoursif ye want it he pulled the shirt over his head and tossed it on the floor then leaned back on the palms of his hands displaying his body i didnt know quite what i had been expecting in fact the sight of his naked body took my breath away he was still tall of course and beautifully made the long bones of his body sleek with muscle elegant with strength he glowed in the candlelight as though the light came from within him he had changed of course but the change was subtle as though he had been put into an oven and baked to a hard finish he looked as though both muscle and skin had drawn in just a bit grown closer to the bone so he was more tightly knit he had never seemed gawky but the last hint of boyish looseness had vanished his skin had darkened slightly to a pale gold burned to bronze on face and throat paling down the length of his body to a pure white tinged with blue veins in the hollow of his thighs his pubic hair stood out in a ferocious auburn bush and it was quite obvious that he had not been lying he did want me and very badly my eyes met his and his mouth quirked suddenly i did say once i would be honest with ye sassenach i laughed feeling tears sting my eyes at the same time a rush of confused emotion surging up in me so did i i reached toward him hesitant and he took my hand the strength and warmth of it were startling and i jerked slightly then i tightened my grasp and he rose to his feet facing me we stood still then awkwardly hesitating we were intensely aware of each otherhow could we not be it was quite a small room and the available atmosphere was completely filled with a charge like static electricity almost strong enough to be visible i had a feeling of emptybellied terror like the sort you get at the top of a roller coaster are you as scared as i am i finally said sounding hoarse to my own ears he looked me over carefully and raised one eyebrow i dinna think i can be he said youre covered wi gooseflesh are ye scairt sassenach or only cold both i said and he laughed get in then he said he released my hand and bent to turn back the quilt i didnt stop shaking when he slid under the quilt beside me though the heat of his body was a physical shock god youre not cold i blurted i turned toward him and the warmth of him shimmered against my skin from head to toes instinctively drawn i pressed close against him shivering i could feel my nipples tight and hard against his chest and the sudden shock of his naked skin against my own he laughed a little uncertainly no im not i suppose i must be afraid aye his arms came around me gently and i touched his chest feeling hundreds of tiny goose bumps spring up under my fingertips among the ruddy curling hairs when we were afraid of each other before i whispered on our wedding nightyou held my hands you said it would be easier if we touched he made a small sound as my fingertip found his nipple aye i did he said sounding breathless lord touch me like that again his hands tightened suddenly holding me against him touch me he said again softly and let me touch you my sassenach his hand cupped me stroking touching and my breast lay taut and heavy in his palm i went on trembling but now he was doing it too when we wed he whispered his breath warm against my cheek and i saw ye there so bonny in your white dressi couldna think of anything but when wed be alone and i could undo your laces and have ye naked next to me in the bed do you want me now i whispered and kissed the sunburned flesh in the hollow above his collarbone his skin was faintly salty to the taste and his hair smelled of woodsmoke and pungent maleness he didnt answer but moved abruptly so i felt the hardness of him stiff against my belly it was terror as much as desire that pressed me close against him i wanted him all right my breasts ached and my belly was tight with it the unaccustomed rush of arousal slippery between my legs opening me for him but as strong as lust was the desire simply to be taken to have him master me quell my doubts in a moment of rough usage take me hard and swiftly enough to make me forget myself i could feel the urge to do it tremble in the hands that cupped my buttocks in the involuntary jerk of his hips brought up short as he stopped himself do it i thought in an agony of apprehension for gods sake do it now and dont be gentle i couldnt say it i saw the need of it on his face but he couldnt say it either it was both too soon and too late for such words between us but we had shared another language and my body still recalled it i pressed my hips against him sharply grasping his the curves of his buttocks clenched hard under my hands i turned my face upward urgent to be kissed at the same moment that he bent abruptly to kiss me my nose hit his forehead with a sickening crunch my eyes watered profusely as i rolled away from him clutching my face ow christ have i hurt ye claire blinking away the tears i could see his face hovering anxiously over me no i said stupidly my nose is broken though i think no it isnt he said gently feeling the bridge of my nose when ye break your nose it makes a nasty crunching sound and ye bleed like a pig its all right i felt gingerly beneath my nostrils but he was right i wasnt bleeding the pain had receded quickly too as i realized that i also realized that he was lying on me my legs sprawled wide beneath him his cock just touching me no more than a hairsbreadth from the moment of decision i saw the realization dawn in his eyes as well neither of us moved barely breathing then his chest swelled as he took a deep breath reached and took both my wrists in one hand he pulled them up over my head and held me there my body arched taut and helpless under him give me your mouth sassenach he said softly and bent to me his head blotted out the candlelight and i saw nothing but a dim glow and the darkness of his flesh as his mouth touched mine gently brushing then pressing warm and i opened to him with a little gasp his tongue seeking mine i bit his lip and he drew back a little startled jamie i said against his lips my own breath warm between us jamie that was all i could say but my hips jerked against him and jerked again urging violence i turned my head and fastened my teeth in the flesh of his shoulder he made a small sound deep in his throat and came into me hard i was tight as any virgin and cried out arching under him dont stop i said for gods sake dont stop his body heard me and answered in the same language his grasp of my wrists tightening as he plunged hard into me the force of it reaching my womb with each stroke then he let go of my wrists and halffell on me the weight of him pinning me to the bed as he reached under holding my hips hard keeping me immobile i whimpered and writhed against him and he bit my neck be still he said in my ear i was still only because i couldnt move we lay pressed tight together shuddering i could feel the pounding against my ribs but didnt know whether it was my heart or his then he moved in me very slightly a question of the flesh it was enough i convulsed in answer held helpless under him and felt the spasms of my release stroke him stroke him seize and release him urging him to join me he reared up on both hands back arched and head thrown back eyes closed and breathing hard then very slowly he bent his head forward and opened his eyes he looked down at me with unutterable tenderness and the candlelight gleamed briefly on the wetness on his cheek maybe sweat or maybe tears oh claire he whispered oh god claire and his release began deep inside me without his moving shivering through his body so that his arms trembled the ruddy hairs quivering in the dim light and he dropped his head with a sound like a sob his hair hiding his face as he spilled himself each jerk and pulse of his flesh between my legs rousing an echo in my own when it was over he held himself over me still as stone for a long moment then very gently he lowered himself pressed his head against mine and lay as if dead i stirred at last from a deep contented stupor lifting my hand to lay it over the spot where his pulse beat slow and strong just at the base of his breastbone its like bicycle riding i expect i said my head rested peacefully in the curve of his shoulder my hand idly playing with the redgold curls that sprang up in thickets across his chest did you know youve got lots more hairs on your chest than you used to no he said drowsily i dinna usually count them have byesickles got lots of hair then it caught me by surprise and i laughed no i said i just meant that we seemed to recall what to do all right jamie opened one eye and looked down at me consideringly it would take a real daftie to forget that sassenach he said i may be lacking practice but i havena lost all my faculties yet we were still for a long time aware of each others breathing sensitive to each small twitch and shifting of position we fitted well together my head curled into the hollow of his shoulder the territory of his body warm under my hand both strange and familiar awaiting rediscovery the building was a solid one and the sound of the storm outside drowned most noises from within but now and then the sounds of feet or voices were dimly audible below us a low masculine laugh or the higher voice of a woman raised in professional flirtation hearing it jamie stirred a little uncomfortably i should maybe have taken ye to a tavern he said its only its all right i assured him though i must say of all the places id imagined being with you again i somehow never thought of a brothel i hesitated not wanting to pry but curiosity got the best of me youerdont own this place do you jamie he pulled back a little staring down at me me god in heaven sassenach what dye think i am well i dont know do i i pointed out with some asperity the first thing you do when i find you is faint and as soon as ive got you back on your feet you get me assaulted in a pub and chased through edinburgh in company with a deviant chinese ending up in a brothelwhose madam seems to be on awfully familiar terms with you i might add the tips of his ears had gone pink and he seemed to be struggling between laughter and indignation you then take off your clothes announce that youre a terrible person with a depraved past and take me to bed what did you expect me to think laughter won out well im no a saint sassenach he said but im no a pimp either glad to hear it i said there was a momentary pause and then i said do you mean to tell me what you are or shall i go on running down the disreputable possibilities until i come close oh aye he said entertained by this suggestion whats your best guess i looked him over carefully he lay at ease amid the tumbled sheets one arm behind his head grinning at me well id bet my shift youre not a printer i said the grin widened why not i poked him rudely in the ribs youre much too fit most men in their forties have begun to go soft round the middle and you havent a spare ounce on you thats mostly because i havena got anyone to cook for me he said ruefully if you ate in taverns all the time ye wouldna be fat either luckily it looks as though ye eat regularly he patted my bottom familiarly and then ducked laughing as i slapped at his hand dont try to distract me i said resuming my dignity at any rate you didnt get muscles like that slaving over a printing press ever tried to work one sassenach he raised a derisive eyebrow no i furrowed my brow in thought i dont suppose youve taken up highway robbery no he said the grin widening guess again embezzlement no well likely not kidnapping for ransom i said and began to tick other possibilities off on my fingers petty thievery no piracy no you couldnt possibly unless youve got over being seasick usury hardly i dropped my hand and stared at him you were a traitor when i last knew you but that scarcely seems a good way of making a living oh im still a traitor he assured me i just havena been convicted lately lately i spent several years in prison for treason sassenach he said rather grimly for the rising but that was some time back yes i knew that his eyes widened ye knew that that and a bit more i said ill tell you later but putting that all aside for the present and returning to the point at issuewhat do you do for a living these days im a printer he said grinning widely and a traitor and a traitor he confirmed nodding ive been arrested for sedition six times in the last two years and had my premises seized twice but the court wasna able to prove anything and what happens to you if they do prove it one of these times oh he said airily waving his free hand in the air the pillory earnailing flogging imprisonment transportation that sort of thing likely not hanging what a relief i said dryly i felt a trifle hollow i hadnt even tried to imagine what his life might be like if i found him now that i had i was a little taken aback i did warn ye he said the teasing was gone now and the dark blue eyes were serious and watchful you did i said and took a deep breath do ye want to leave now he spoke casually enough but i saw his fingers clench and tighten on a fold of the quilt so that the knuckles stood out white against the sunbronzed skin no i said i smiled at him as best i could manage i didnt come back just to make love with you once i came to be with youif youll have me i ended a little hesitantly if ill have you he let out the breath he had been holding and sat up to face me crosslegged on the bed he reached out and took my hands engulfing them between his own icanna even say what i felt when i touched you today sassenach and knew ye to be real he said his eyes traveled over me and i felt the heat of him yearning and my own heat melting toward him to find you againand then to lose ye he stopped throat working as he swallowed i touched his face tracing the fine clean line of cheekbone and jaw you wont lose me i said not ever again i smiled smoothing back the thick ruff of ruddy hair behind his ear not even if i find out youve been committing bigamy and public drunkenness he jerked sharply at that and i dropped my hand startled what is it well he said and stopped he pursed his lips and glanced at me quickly its just just what is there something else you havent told me well printing seditious pamphlets isna all that profitable he said in explanation i dont suppose so i said my heart starting to speed up again at the prospect of further revelations what else have you been doing well its just that i do a wee bit of smuggling he said apologetically on the side like a smuggler i stared smuggling what well whisky mostly but rum now and then and a fair bit of french wine and cambric so thats it i said the pieces of the puzzle all settled into placemr willoughby the edinburgh docks and the riddle of our present surroundings thats what your connection is with this placewhat you meant by saying madame jeanne is a customer thats it he nodded it works verra well we store the liquor in one of the cellars below when it comes in from france some of it we sell directly to jeanne some she keeps for us until we can ship it on um and as part of the arrangements i said delicately you er the blue eyes narrowed at me the answer to what youre thinking sassenach is no he said very firmly oh is it i said feeling extremely pleased mind reader are you and what am i thinking you were wondering do i take out my price in trade sometimes aye he lifted one brow at me well i was i admitted not that its any of my business oh isnt it then he raised both ruddy brows and took me by both shoulders leaning toward me is it he said a moment later he sounded a little breathless yes i said sounding equally breathless and you dont i dont come here he wrapped his arms around me and pulled me close the bodys memory is different from the minds when i thought and wondered and worried i was clumsy and awkward fumbling my way without the interference of conscious thought my body knew him and answered him at once in tune as though his touch had left me moments before and not years i was more afraid this time than on our wedding night i murmured my eyes fixed on the slow strong pulsebeat in the hollow of his throat were ye then his arm shifted and tightened round me do i frighten ye sassenach no i put my fingers on the tiny pulse breathing the deep musk of his effort its onlythe first timei didnt think it would be forever i meant to go then he snorted faintly the sweat gleaming lightly in the small hollow in the center of his chest and ye did go and came again he said youre here theres no more that matters than that i raised myself slightly to look at him his eyes were closed slanted and catlike his lashes that striking color i remembered so well because i had seen it so often deep auburn at the tips fading to a red so pale as nearly to be blond at the roots what did you think the first time we lay together i asked the dark blue eyes opened slowly and rested on me it has always been forever for me sassenach he said simply sometime later we fell asleep entwined with the sound of the rain falling soft against the shutters mingling with the muffled sounds of commerce below it was a restless night too tired to stay awake a moment longer i was too happy to fall soundly asleep perhaps i was afraid he would vanish if i slept perhaps he felt the same we lay close together not awake but too aware of each other to sleep deeply i felt every small twitch of his muscles every movement of his breathing and knew he was likewise aware of me halfdozing we turned and moved together always touching in a sleepy slowmotion ballet learning again in silence the language of our bodies somewhere in the deep quiet hours of the night he turned to me without a word and i to him and we made love to each other in a slow unspeaking tenderness that left us lying still at last in possession of each others secrets soft as a moth flying in the dark my hand skimmed his leg and found the thin deep runnel of the scar my fingers traced its invisible length and paused with the barest of touches at its end wordlessly asking how his breathing changed with a sigh and his hand lay over mine culloden he said the whispered word an evocation of tragedy death futility and the terrible parting that had taken me from him ill never leave you i whispered not again his head turned on the pillow his features lost in darkness and his lips brushed mine light as the touch of an insects wing he turned onto his back shifting me next to him his hand resting heavy on the curve of my thigh keeping me close sometime later i felt him shift again and turn the bedclothes back a little way a cool draft played across my forearm the tiny hairs prickled upright and then flattened beneath the warmth of his touch i opened my eyes to find him turned on his side absorbed in the sight of my hand it lay still on the quilt a carved white thing all the bones and tendons chalked in gray as the room began its imperceptible shift from night to day draw her for me he whispered head bent as he gently traced the shapes of my fingers long and ghostly beneath the darkness of his own touch what has she of you of me can ye tell me are her hands like yours claire or mine draw her for me let me see her he laid his own hand down beside my own it was his good hand the fingers straight and flatjointed the nails clipped short square and clean like mine i said my voice was low and hoarse with waking barely loud enough to register above the drumming of the rain outside the house beneath was silent i raised the fingers of my immobile hand an inch in illustration she has long slim hands like minebut bigger than mine broad across the backs and a deep curve at the outside near the wristlike that like yours she has a pulse just there where you do i touched the spot where a vein crossed the curve of his radius just where the wrist joins the hand he was so still i could feel his heartbeat under my fingertip her nails are like yours square not oval like mine but she has the crooked little finger on her right hand that i have i said lifting it my mother had it too uncle lambert told me my own mother had died when i was five i had no clear memory of her but thought of her whenever i saw my own hand unexpectedly caught in a moment of grace like this one i laid the hand with the crooked finger on his then lifted it to his face she has this line i said softly tracing the bold sweep from temple to cheek your eyes exactly and those lashes and brows a fraser nose her mouth is more like mine with a full bottom lip but its wide like yours a pointed chin like mine but stronger shes a big girlnearly six feet tall i felt his start of astonishment and nudged him gently knee to knee she has long legs like yours but very feminine and has she that small blue vein just there his hand touched my own face thumb tender in the hollow of my temple and ears like tiny wings sassenach she always complained about her earssaid they stuck out i said feeling the tears sting my eyes as brianna came suddenly to life between us theyre pierced you dont mind do you i said talking fast to keep the tears at bay frank did he said it looked cheap and she shouldnt but she wanted to do it and i let her when she was sixteen mine were it didnt seem right to say she couldnt when i did and her friends all did and i didntdidnt want ye were right he said interrupting the flow of halfhysterical words ye did fine he repeated softly but firmly holding me close ye were a wonderful mother i know it i was crying again quite soundlessly shaking against him he held me gently stroking my back and murmuring ye did well he kept saying ye did right and after a little while i stopped crying ye gave me a child mo nighean donn he said softly into the cloud of my hair we are together for always she is safe and we will live forever now you and i he kissed me very lightly and laid his head upon the pillow next to me brianna he whispered in that odd highland way that made her name his own he sighed deeply and in an instant was asleep in another i fell asleep myself my last sight his wide sweet mouth relaxed in sleep halfsmiling whores brunch from years of answering the twin calls of motherhood and medicine i had developed the ability to wake from even the soundest sleep at once and completely i woke so now immediately aware of the worn linen sheets around me the dripping of the eaves outside and the warm scent of jamies body mingling with the cold sweet air that breathed through the crack of the shutters above me jamie himself was not in bed without reaching out or opening my eyes i knew that the space beside me was empty he was close by though there was a sound of stealthy movement and a faint scraping noise nearby i turned my head on the pillow and opened my eyes the room was filled with a gray light that washed the color from everything but left the pale lines of his body clear in the dimness he stood out against the darkness of the room solid as ivory vivid as though he were etched upon the air he was naked his back turned to me as he stood in front of the chamber pot he had just pulled from its resting place beneath the washstand i admired the squared roundness of his buttocks the small muscular hollow that dented each one and their pale vulnerability the groove of his backbone springing in a deep smooth curve from hips to shoulders as he moved slightly the light caught the faint silver shine of the scars on his back and the breath caught in my throat he turned around then face calm and faintly abstracted he saw me watching him and looked slightly startled i smiled but stayed silent unable to think of anything to say i kept looking at him though and he at me the same smile upon his lips without speaking he moved toward me and sat on the bed the mattress shifting under his weight he laid his hand open on the quilt and i put my own into it without hesitation sleep well i asked idiotically a grin broadened across his face no he said did you no i could feel the heat of him even at this distance in spite of the chilly room arent you cold no we fell quiet again but could not take our eyes away from each other i looked him over carefully in the strengthening light comparing memory to reality a narrow blade of early sun knifed through the shutters crack lighting a lock of hair like polished bronze gilding the curve of his shoulder the smooth flat slope of his belly he seemed slightly larger than i had remembered and one hell of a lot more immediate youre bigger than i remembered i ventured he tilted his head looking down at me in amusement youre a wee bit smaller i think his hand engulfed mine fingers delicately circling the bones of my wrist my mouth was dry i swallowed and licked my lips a long time ago you asked me if i knew what it was between us i said his eyes rested on mine so dark a blue as to be nearly black in a light like this i remember he said softly his fingers tightened briefly on mine what it iswhen i touch you when ye lie wi me i said i didnt know i didna ken either the smile had faded a bit but was still there lurking in the corners of his mouth i still dont i said but and stopped to clear my throat but its still there he finished for me and the smile moved from his lips lighting his eyes aye it was i was still as aware of him as i might have been of a lighted stick of dynamite in my immediate vicinity but the feeling between us had changed we had fallen asleep as one flesh linked by the love of the child we had made and had waked as two peoplebound by something different yes is iti mean its not just because of brianna do you think the pressure on my fingers increased do i want ye because youre the mother of my child he raised one ruddy eyebrow in incredulity well no not that im no grateful he added hastily butno he bent his head to look down at me intently and the sun lit the narrow bridge of his nose and sparked in his lashes no he said i think i could watch ye for hours sassenach to see how you have changed or how yere the same just to see a wee thing like the curve of your chinhe touched my jaw gently letting his hand slide up to cup my head thumb stroking my earlobeor your ears and the bittie holes for your earbobs those are all the same just as they were your hairi called ye mo nighean donn dye recall my brown one his voice was little more than a whisper his fingers threading my curls between them i expect thats changed a bit i said i hadnt gone gray but there were paler streaks where my normal light brown had faded to a softer gold and here and there the glint of a single silver strand like beechwood in the rain he said smiling and smoothing a lock with one forefinger and the drops coming down from the leaves across the bark i reached out and stroked his thigh touching the long scar that ran down it i wish i could have been there to take care of you i said softly it was the most horrible thing i ever didleaving you knowingthat you meant to be killed i could hardly bear to speak the word well i tried hard enough he said with a wry grimace that made me laugh in spite of my emotion it wasna my fault i didna succeed he glanced dispassionately at the long thick scar that ran down his thigh not the fault of the sassenach wi the bayonet either i heaved myself up on one elbow squinting at the scar a bayonet did that aye well it festered ye see he explained i know we found the journal of the lord melton who sent you home from the battlefield he didnt think youd make it my hand tightened on his knee as though to reassure myself that he was in fact here before me alive he snorted well i damn nearly didnt i was all but dead when they pulled me out of the wagon at lallybroch his face darkened with memory god sometimes i wake up in the night dreaming of that wagon it was two days journey and i was fevered or chilled or both together i was covered wi hay and the ends of it sticking in my eyes and my ears and through my shirt and fleas hopping all through it and eating me alive and my leg killing me at every jolt in the road it was a verra bumpy road too he added broodingly it sounds horrible i said feeling the word quite inadequate he snorted briefly aye i only stood it by imagining what id do to melton if i ever met him again to get back at him for not shooting me i laughed again and he glanced down at me a wry smile on his lips im not laughing because its funny i said gulping a little im laughing because otherwise ill cry and i dont want tonot now when its over aye i know he squeezed my hand i took a deep breath ii didnt look back i didnt think i could stand to find outwhat happened i bit my lip the admission seemed a betrayal it wasnt that i triedthat i wantedto forget i said groping clumsily for words i couldnt forget you you shouldnt think that not ever but i dinna fash yourself sassenach he interrupted he patted my hand gently i ken what ye mean i try not to look back myself come to that but if i had i said staring down at the smooth grain of the linen if i hadi might have found you sooner the words hung in the air between us like an accusation a reminder of the bitter years of loss and separation finally he sighed deeply and put a finger under my chin lifting my face to his and if ye had he said would ye have left the lassie there without her mother or come to me in the time after culloden when i couldna care for ye but only watch ye suffer wi the rest and feel the guilt of bringing ye to such a fate maybe see ye die of the hunger and sickness and know id killed ye he raised one eyebrow in question then shook his head no i told ye to go and i told ye to forget shall i blame ye for doing as i said sassenach no but we might have had more time i said we might have he stopped me by the simple expedient of bending and putting his mouth on mine it was warm and very soft and the stubble of his face was faintly scratchy on my skin after a moment he released me the light was growing putting color in his face his skin glowed bronze sparked with the copper of his beard he took a deep breath aye we might but to think of thatwe cannot his eyes met mine steadily searching i canna look back sassenach and live he said simply if we have no more than last night and this moment it is enough not for me it isnt i said and he laughed greedy wee thing are ye no yes i said the tension broken i returned my attention to the scar on his leg to keep away for the moment from the painful contemplation of lost time and opportunity you were telling me how you got that so i was he rocked back a little squinting down at the thin white line down the top of his thigh well it was jennymy sister ye ken i did indeed remember jenny half her brothers size and dark as he was blazing fair but a match and more for him in stubbornness she said she wasna going to let me die he said with a rueful smile and she didnt my opinion didna seem to have anything to do wi the matter so she didna bother to ask me that sounds like jenny i felt a small glow of comfort at the thought of my sisterinlaw jamie hadnt been alone as i feared then jenny murray would have fought the devil himself to save her brotherand evidently had she dosed me for the fever and put poultices on my leg to draw the poison but nothing worked and it only got worse it swelled and stank and then began to go black and rotten so they thought they must take the leg off if i was to live he recounted this quite matteroffactly but i felt a little faint at the thought obviously they didnt i said why not jamie scratched his nose and rubbed a hand back through his hair wiping the wild spill of it out of his eyes well that was ian he said he wouldna let her do it he said he kent well enough what it was like to live wi one leg and while he didna mind it so much himself he thought i wouldna like toall things considered he added with a wave of the hand and a glance at me that encompassed everythingthe loss of the battle of the war of me of home and livelihoodof all the things of his normal life i thought ian might well have been right so instead jenny made three of the tenants come to sit on me and hold me still and then she slit my leg to the bone wi a kitchen knife and washed the wound wi boiling water he said casually jesus h christ i blurted shocked into horror he smiled faintly at my expression aye well it worked i swallowed heavily tasting bile jesus id think youd have been a cripple for life well she cleansed it as best she could and stitched it up she said she wasna going to let me die and she wasna going to have me be a cripple and she wasna going to have me lie about all the day feelin sorry for myself and he shrugged resigned by the time she finished tellin me all the things she wouldna let me do it seemed the only thing left to me was to get well i echoed his laugh and his smile broadened at the memory once i could get up she made ian take me outside after dark and make me walk lord we must ha been a sight ian wi his wooden leg and me wi my stick limping up and down the road like a pair of lame cranes i laughed again but had to blink back tears i could see all too well the two tall limping figures struggling stubbornly against darkness and pain leaning on each other for support you lived in a cave for a time didnt you we found the story of it his eyebrows went up in surprise a story about it about me ye mean youre a famous highland legend i told him dryly or you will be at least for living in a cave he looked halfpleased halfembarrassed well thats a foolish thing to make a story about aye arranging to have yourself betrayed to the english for the price on your head was maybe a little more dramatic i said still more dryly taking rather a risk there werent you the end of his nose was pink and he looked somewhat abashed well he said awkwardly i didna think prison would be verra dreadful and everything considered i spoke as calmly as i could but i wanted to shake him suddenly and ridiculously furious with him in retrospect prison my arse you knew perfectly well you might have been hanged didnt you and you bloody did it anyway i had to do something he said shrugging and if the english were fool enough to pay good money for my lousy carcasswell theres nay law against takin advantage of fools is there one corner of his mouth quirked up and i was torn between the urge to kiss him and the urge to slap him i did neither but sat up in bed and began combing the tangles out of my hair with my fingers id say its open to question who the fool was i said not looking at him but even so you should know that your daughters very proud of you she is he sounded thunderstruck and i looked up at him laughing despite my irritation well of course she is youre a bloody hero arent you he went quite red in the face at this and stood up looking thoroughly disconcerted me no he rubbed a hand through his hair his habit when thinking or disturbed in his mind no i mean he said slowly i wasna heroic at all about it it was onlyi couldna bear it any longer to see them all starving i mean and not be able to care for themjenny and ian and the children all the tenants and their families he looked helplessly down at me i really didna care if the english hanged me or not he said i didna think they would because of what yed told me but even if id known for sure it meant thati would ha done it sassenach and not minded but it wasna braverynot at all he threw up his hands in frustration turning away there was nothing else i could do i see i said softly after a moment i understand he was standing by the chiffonier still naked and at this he turned halfround to face me do ye then his face was serious i know you jamie fraser i spoke with more certainty than i had felt at any time since the moment i stepped through the rock do ye then he asked again but a faint smile shadowed his mouth i think so the smile on his lips widened and he opened his mouth to reply before he could speak though there was a knock upon the chamber door i started as though i had touched a hot stove jamie laughed and bent to pat my hip as he went to the door i expect its the chambermaid with our breakfast sassenach not the constable and we are marrit aye one eyebrow rose quizzically even so shouldnt you put something on i asked as he reached for the doorknob he glanced down at himself i shouldna think its likely to come as a shock to anyone in this house sassenach but to honor your sensibilities he grinned at me and taking a linen towel from the washstand wrapped it casually about his loins before pulling open the door i caught sight of a tall male figure standing in the hall and promptly pulled the bedclothes over my head this was a reaction of pure panic for if it had been the edinburgh constable or one of his minions i could scarcely expect much protection from a couple of quilts but then the visitor spoke and i was glad that i was safely out of sight for the moment jamie the voice sounded rather startled despite the fact that i had not heard it in twenty years i recognized it at once rolling over i surreptitiously lifted a corner of the quilt and peeked out beneath it well of course its me jamie was saying rather testily have ye no got eyes man he pulled his brotherinlaw ian into the room and shut the door i see well enough its you ian said with a note of sharpness i just didna ken whether to believe my eyes his smooth brown hair showed threads of gray and his face bore the lines of a good many years hard work but joe abernathy had been right with his first words the new vision merged with the old and this was the ian murray i had known before i came here because the lad at the printshop said yed no been there last night and this was the address jenny sends your letters to he was saying he looked round the room with wide suspicious eyes as though expecting something to leap out from behind the armoire then his gaze flicked back to his brotherinlaw who was making a perfunctory effort to secure his makeshift loincloth i never thought to find ye in a kittlehoosie jamie he said i wasna sure when thethe lady answered the door downstairs but then its no what ye think ian jamie said shortly oh its not aye and jenny worrying that yed make yourself ill living without a woman so long ian snorted ill tell her she needna concern herself wi your welfare and wheres my son then down the hall with another o the harlots your son jamies surprise was evident which one ian stared at jamie the anger on his long halfhomely face fading into alarm ye havena got him wee ians not here young ian christ man dye think id bring a fourteenyearold lad into a brothel ian opened his mouth then shut it and sat down on the stool tell ye the truth jamie i canna say what yed do anymore he said levelly he looked up at his brotherinlaw jaw set once i could but not now and what the hell dye mean by that i could see the angry flush rising in jamies face ian glanced at the bed and away again the red flush didnt recede from jamies face but i saw a small quiver at the corner of his mouth he bowed elaborately to his brotherinlaw your pardon ian i was forgettin my manners allow me to introduce ye to my companion he stepped to the side of the bed and pulled back the quilts no ian cried jumping to his feet and looking frantically at the floor the wardrobe anywhere but at the bed what will ye no give your regards to my wife ian jamie said wife forgetting to look away ian goggled at jamie in horror yeve marrit a whore he croaked i wouldnt call it that exactly i said hearing my voice ian jerked his head in my direction hullo i said waving cheerily at him from my nest of bedclothes been a long time hasnt it id always thought the descriptions of what people did when seeing ghosts rather exaggerated but had been forced to revise my opinions in light of the responses i had been getting since my return to the past jamie had fainted dead away and if ians hair was not literally standing on end he assuredly looked as though he had been scared out of his wits eyes bugging out he opened and closed his mouth making a small gobbling noise that seemed to entertain jamie quite a lot thatll teach ye to go about thinkin the worst of my character he said with apparent satisfaction taking pity on his quivering brotherinlaw jamie poured out a tot of brandy and handed him the glass judge not and yell no be judged eh i thought ian was going to spill the drink on his breeches but he managed to get the glass to his mouth and swallow what he wheezed eyes watering as he stared at me how its a long story i said with a glance at jamie he nodded briefly we had had other things to think about in the last twentyfour hours besides how to explain me to people and under the circumstances i rather thought explanations could wait i dont believe i know young ian is he missing i asked politely ian nodded mechanically not taking his eyes off me he stole away from home last friday week he said sounding rather dazed left a note that hed gone to his uncle he took another swig of brandy coughed and blinked several times then wiped his eyes and sat up straighter looking at me itll no be the first time ye see he said to me he seemed to be regaining his selfconfidence seeing that i appeared to be flesh and blood and showed no signs either of getting out of bed or of putting my head under my arm and strolling round without it in the accepted fashion of highland ghosts jamie sat down on the bed next to me taking my hand in his ive not seen young ian since i sent him home wi fergus six months ago he said he was beginning to look as worried as ian youre sure he said he was coming to me well he hasna got any other uncles that i know of ian said rather acerbically he tossed back the rest of the brandy and set the cup down fergus i interrupted is fergus all right then i felt a surge of joy at the mention of the french orphan whom jamie had once hired in paris as a pickpocket and brought back to scotland as a servant lad distracted from his thoughts jamie looked down at me oh aye fergus is a bonny man now a bit changed of course a shadow seemed to cross his face but it cleared as he smiled pressing my hand hell be fair daft at seein you once more sassenach uninterested in fergus ian had risen and was pacing back and forth across the polished plank floor he didna take a horse he muttered so hed have nothing anyone would rob him for he swung round to jamie how did ye come last time ye brought the lad here by the land round the firth or did ye cross by boat jamie rubbed his chin frowning as he thought i didna come to lallybroch for him he and fergus crossed through the carryarrick pass and met me just above loch laggan then we came down through struan and weem andaye now i remember we didna want to cross the campbell lands so we came to the east and crossed the forth at donibristle dye think hed do that again ian asked if its the only way he knows jamie shook his head doubtfully he might but he kens the coast is dangerous ian resumed his pacing hands clasped behind his back i beat him til he could barely stand let alone sit the last time he ran off ian said shaking his head his lips were tight and i gathered that young ian was perhaps rather a trial to his father yed think the wee fool would think better o such tricks aye jamie snorted but not without sympathy did a thrashing ever stop you from doing anything youd set your mind on ian stopped his pacing and sat down on the stool again sighing no he said frankly but i expect it was some relief to my father his face cracked into a reluctant smile as jamie laughed hell be all right jamie declared confidently he stood up and let the towel drop to the floor as he reached for his breeches ill go and put about the word for him if hes in edinburgh well hear of it by nightfall ian cast a glance at me in the bed and stood up hastily ill go wi ye i thought i saw a shadow of doubt flicker across jamies face but then he nodded and pulled the shirt over his head all right he said as his head popped through the slit he frowned at me im afraid yell have to stay here sassenach he said i suppose i will i said dryly seeing that i havent any clothes the maid who brought our supper had removed my dress and no replacement had as yet appeared ians feathery brows shot up to his hairline but jamie merely nodded ill tell jeanne on the way out he said he frowned slightly thinking it may be some time sassenach there are thingswell ive business to take care of he squeezed my hand his expression softening as he looked at me i dinna want to leave ye he said softly but i must youll stay here until i come again dont worry i assured him waving a hand at the linen towel he had just discarded im not likely to go anywhere in that the thud of their feet retreated down the hall and faded into the sounds of the stirring house the brothel was rising late and languid by the stern scottish standards of edinburgh below me i could hear the occasional slow muffled thump the clatter of shutters thrust open nearby a cry of gardyloo and a second later the splash of slops flung out to land on the street far below voices somewhere far down the hall a brief inaudible exchange and the closing of a door the building itself seemed to stretch and sigh with a creaking of timbers and a squeaking of stairs and a sudden puff of coalsmelling warm air came out from the back of the cold hearth the exhalation of a fire lit on some lower floor sharing my chimney i relaxed into the pillows feeling drowsy and heavily content i was slightly and pleasantly sore in several unaccustomed places and while i had been reluctant to see jamie go there was no denying that it was nice to be alone for a bit to mull things over i felt much like one who has been handed a sealed casket containing a longlost treasure i could feel the satisfying weight and the shape of it and know the great joy of its possession but still did not know exactly what was contained therein i was dying to know everything he had done and said and thought and been through all the days between us i had of course known that if he had survived culloden he would have a lifeand knowing what i did of jamie fraser it was unlikely to be a simple one but knowing that and being confronted with the reality of it were two different things he had been fixed in my memory for so long glowing but static like an insect frozen in amber and then had come rogers brief historical sightings like peeks through a keyhole separate pictures like punctuations alterations adjustments of memory each showing the dragonflys wings raised or lowered at a different angle like the single frames of a motion picture now time had begun to run again for us and the dragonfly was in flight before me flickering from place to place so i saw little more yet than the glitter of its wings there were so many questions neither of us had had a chance to ask yetwhat of his family at lallybroch his sister jenny and her children obviously ian was alive and well wooden leg notwithstandingbut had the rest of the family and the tenants of the estate survived the destruction of the highlands if they had why was jamie here in edinburgh and if they were alivewhat would we tell them about my sudden reappearance i bit my lip wondering whether there was any explanationshort of the truthwhich might make sense it might depend on what jamie had told them when i disappeared after culloden there had seemed no need to concoct a reason for my vanishing at the time it would simply be assumed that i had perished in the aftermath of the rising one more of the nameless corpses lying starved on the rocks or slaughtered in a leafless glen well wed manage that when we came to it i supposed i was more curious just now about the extent and the danger of jamies less legitimate activities smuggling and sedition was it i was aware that smuggling was nearly as honorable a profession in the scottish highlands as cattlestealing had been twenty years before and might be conducted with relatively little risk sedition was something else and seemed like an occupation of dubious safety for a convicted exjacobite traitor that i supposed was the reason for his assumed nameor one reason at any rate disturbed and excited as i had been when we arrived at the brothel the night before i had noticed that madame jeanne referred to him by his own name so presumably he smuggled under his own identity but carried out his publishing activitieslegal and illegalas alex malcolm i had seen heard and felt enough during the all too brief hours of the night to be fairly sure that the jamie fraser i had known still existed how many other men he might be now remained to be seen there was a tentative rap at the door interrupting my thoughts breakfast i thought and not before time i was ravenous come in i called and sat up in bed pulling up the pillows to lean against the door opened very slowly and after quite a long pause a head poked its way through the opening much in the manner of a snail emerging from its shell after a hailstorm it was topped with an illcut shag of dark brown hair so thick that the cropped edges stuck out like a shelf above a pair of large ears the face beneath was long and bony rather pleasantly homely save for a pair of beautiful brown eyes soft and huge as a deers that rested on me with a mingled expression of interest and hesitancy the head and i regarded each other for a moment are you mr malcolmswoman it asked i suppose you could say so i replied cautiously this was obviously not the chambermaid with my breakfast neither was it likely to be one of the other employees of the establishment being evidently male though very young he seemed vaguely familiar though i was sure i hadnt seen him before i pulled the sheet a bit higher over my breasts and who are you i inquired the head thought this over for some time and finally answered with equal caution ian murray ian murray i shot up straight rescuing the sheet at the last moment come in here i said peremptorily if youre who i think you are why arent you where youre supposed to be and what are you doing here the face looked rather alarmed and showed signs of withdrawal stop i called and put a leg out of bed to pursue him the big brown eyes widened at the sight of my bare limb and he froze come in i said slowly i withdrew the leg beneath the quilts and equally slowly he followed it into the room he was tall and gangly as a fledgling stork with perhaps nine stone spread sparsely over a sixfoot frame now that i knew who he was the resemblance to his father was clear he had his mothers pale skin though which blushed furiously red as it occurred to him suddenly that he was standing next to a bed containing a naked woman ierwas looking for myfor mr malcolm i mean he murmured staring fixedly at the floorboards by his feet if you mean your uncle jamie hes not here i said no no i suppose not he seemed unable to think of anything to add to this but remained staring at the floor one foot twisted awkwardly to the side as though he were about to draw it up under him like the wading bird he so much resembled do ye ken where he began lifting his eyes then as he caught a glimpse of me lowered them blushed again and fell silent hes looking for you i said with your father i added they left here not half an hour ago his head snapped up on its skinny neck goggling my father he gasped my father was here ye know him why yes i said without thinking ive known ian for quite a long time he might be jamies nephew but he hadnt jamies trick of inscrutability everything he thought showed on his face and i could easily trace the progression of his expressions raw shock at learning of his fathers presence in edinburgh then a sort of awestruck horror at the revelation of his fathers longstanding acquaintance with what appeared to be a woman of a certain occupation and finally the beginnings of angry absorption as the young man began an immediate revision of his opinions of his fathers character er i said mildly alarmed it isnt what you think i mean your father and iits really your uncle and i i mean i was trying to figure out how to explain the situation to him without getting into even deeper waters when he whirled on his heel and started for the door wait a minute i said he stopped but didnt turn around his wellscrubbed ears stood out like tiny wings the morning light illuminating their delicate pinkness how old are you i asked he turned around to face me with a certain painful dignity ill be fifteen in three weeks he said the red was creeping up his cheeks again dinna worry im old enough to knowwhat sort of place this is i mean he jerked his head toward me in an attempt at a courtly bow meaning no offense to ye mistress if uncle jamiei mean i he groped for suitable words failed to find any and finally blurted verra pleased to meet ye mum turned and bolted through the door which shut hard enough to rattle in its frame i fell back against the pillows torn between amusement and alarm i did wonder what the elder ian was going to say to his son when they metand vice versa as long as i was wondering i wondered what had brought the younger ian here in search of jamie evidently he knew where his uncle was likely to be found yet judging from his diffident attitude he had never before ventured into the brothel had he extracted the information from geordie at the printshop that seemed unlikely and yet if he hadntthen that meant he had learned of his uncles connection with this place from some other source and the most likely source was jamie himself but in that case i reasoned jamie likely already knew that his nephew was in edinburgh so why pretend he hadnt seen the boy ian was jamies oldest friend they had grown up together if whatever jamie was up to was worth the cost of deceiving his brotherinlaw it was something serious i had got no further with my musings when there came another knock on the door come in i said smoothing out the quilts in anticipation of the breakfast tray to be placed thereon when the door opened i had directed my attention at a spot about five feet above the floor where i expected the chambermaids head to materialize upon the last opening of the door i had had to adjust my vision upward a foot to accommodate the appearance of young ian this time i was obliged to drop it what in the bloody hell are you doing here i demanded as the diminutive figure of mr willoughby entered on hands and knees i sat up and hastily tucked my feet underneath me pulling not only sheet but quilts well up around my shoulders in answer the chinese advanced to within a foot of the bed then let his head fall to the floor with a loud clunk he raised it and repeated the process with great deliberation making a horrid sound like a melon being cleaved with an ax stop that i exclaimed as he prepared to do it a third time thousand apology he explained sitting up on his heels and blinking at me he was quite a bit the worse for wear and the dark red mark where his forehead had smacked the floor didnt add anything to his appearance i trusted he didnt mean hed been going to hit his head on the floor a thousand times but i wasnt sure he obviously had the hell of a hangover for him to have attempted it even once was impressive thats quite all right i said edging cautiously back against the wall theres nothing to apologize for yes apology he insisted tseimi saying wife lady being most honorable first wife not stinking whore thanks a lot i said tseimi you mean jamie jamie fraser the little man nodded to the obvious detriment of his head he clutched it with both hands and closed his eyes which promptly disappeared into the creases of his cheeks tseimi he affirmed eyes still closed tseimi saying apology to most honored first wife yi tien cho most humble servant he bowed deeply still holding onto his head yi tien cho he added opening his eyes and tapping his chest to indicate that that was his name in case i should be confusing him with any other humble servants in the vicinity thats quite all right i said er pleased to meet you evidently heartened by this he slid bonelessly onto his face prostrating himself before me yi tien cho ladys servant he said first wife please to walk on humble servant if like ha i said coldly ive heard about you walk on you eh not bloody likely a slit of gleaming black eye showed and he giggled so irrepressibly that i couldnt help laughing myself he sat up again smoothing down the spikes of dirtstiffened black hair that sprang porcupinelike from his skull i wash first wifes feet he offered grinning widely certainly not i said if you really want to do something helpful go and tell someone to bring me breakfast no wait a minute i said changing my mind first tell me where you met jamie if you dont mind i added to be polite he sat back on his heels head bobbing slightly docks he said two year ago i come china long way no food hiding barrel he explained reaching his arms in a circle to demonstrate his means of transportation a stowaway trade ship he nodded on docks here stealing food stealing brandy one night getting stinking drunk very cold to sleep die soon but tseimi find he jabbed a thumb at his chest once more tseimis humble servant humble servant first wife he bowed to me swaying alarmingly in the process but came upright again without mishap brandy seems to be your downfall i observed im sorry i havent anything to give you for your head i dont have any medicines with me at the moment oh not worry he assured me i having healthy balls how nice for you i said trying to decide whether he was gearing up for another attempt on my feet or merely still too drunk to distinguish basic anatomy or perhaps there was some connection in chinese philosophy between the wellbeing of head and testicles just in case i looked round for something that might be used as a weapon in case he showed a disposition to begin burrowing under the bedclothes instead he reached into the depths of one baggy bluesilk sleeve and with the air of a conjuror drew out a small white silk bag he upended this and two balls dropped out into his palm they were larger than marbles and smaller than baseballs about the size in fact of the average testicle a good deal harder though being apparently made of some kind of polished stone greenish in color healthy balls mr willoughby explained rolling them together in his palm they made a pleasant clicking noise streaked jade from canton he said best kind of healthy balls really i said fascinated and theyre medicinalgood for you thats what youre saying he nodded vigorously then stopped abruptly with a faint moan after a pause he spread out his hand and rolled the balls to and fro keeping them in movement with a dextrous circling of his fingers all body one part hand all parts he said he poked a finger toward his open palm touching delicately here and there between the smooth green spheres head there stomach there liver there he said balls make all good well i suppose theyre as portable as alkaseltzer i said possibly it was the reference to stomach that caused my own to emit a loud growl at this point first wife wanting food mr willoughby observed shrewdly very astute of you i said yes i do want food do you suppose you could go and tell someone he dumped the healthy balls back into their bag at once and springing to his feet bowed deeply humble servant go now he said and went crashing rather heavily into the door post on his way out this was becoming ridiculous i thought i harbored substantial doubt as to whether mr willoughbys visit would result in food hed be lucky to make it to the bottom of the stair without falling on his head if i was any judge of his condition rather than go on sitting here in the nude receiving random deputations from the outside world i thought it time to take steps rising and carefully wrapping a quilt around my body i took a few out into the corridor the upper floor seemed deserted aside from the room i had left there were only two other doors up here glancing up i could see unadorned rafters overhead we were in the attic then chances were that the other rooms here were occupied by servants who were presumably now employed downstairs i could hear faint noises drifting up the stairwell something else drifted up as wellthe scent of frying sausage a loud gustatory rumble informed me that my stomach hadnt missed this and furthermore that my innards considered the consumption of one peanut butter sandwich and one bowl of soup in one twentyfourhour period a wholly inadequate level of nutrition i tucked the ends of the quilt in sarongfashion just above my breasts and picking up my trailing skirts followed the scent of food downstairs the smelland the clinking clattering sloshing noises of a number of people eatingwere coming from a closed door on the first floor above ground level i pushed it open and found myself at the end of a long room equipped as a refectory the table was surrounded by twentyodd women a few gowned for day but most of them in a state of dishabille that made my quilt modest by comparison a woman near the end of the table caught sight of me hovering in the doorway and beckoned companionably sliding over to make room for me on the end of the long bench youll be the new lass aye she said looking me over with interest youre a wee bit older than madame usually takes onshe likes em no more than five and twenty youre no bad at all though she assured me hastily im sure youll do fine good skin and a pretty face observed the darkhaired lady across from us sizing me up with the detached air of one appraising horseflesh and nice bubbies what i can see she lifted her chin slightly peering across the table at what could be seen of my cleavage madame doesna like us to take the kivvers off the beds my original acquaintance said reprovingly ye should wear your shift if ye havena something pretty to show yourself in yet aye be careful with the quilt advised the darkhaired girl still scrutinizing me madamell dock your wages an ye get spots on the bedclothes whats your name my dearie a short rather plump girl with a round friendly face leaned past the dark girls elbow to smile at me here were all chatterin at ye and not welcomed ye proper at all im dorcas this is peggyshe jerked a thumb at the darkhaired girl then pointed across the table to the fairhaired woman beside meand thats mollie my name is claire i said smiling and hitching the quilt a bit higher in selfconsciousness i wasnt sure how to correct their impression that i was madame jeannes newest recruit for the moment that seemed less important than getting some breakfast apparently divining my need the friendly dorcas reached to the sideboard behind her passed me a wooden plate and shoved a large dish of sausages in my direction the food was wellcooked and would have been good in any case starved as i was it was ambrosial a hell of a lot better than the hospital cafeterias breakfasts i observed to myself taking another ladle of fried potatoes had a rough one for your first aye millie next to me nodded at my bosom glancing down i was mortified to see a large red patch peeking above the edge of my quilt i couldnt see my neck but the direction of millies interested gaze made it clear that the small tingling sensations there were evidence of further bitemarks your nose is a wee bit puffed too peggy said frowning at me critically she reached across the table to touch it disregarding the fact that the gesture caused her flimsy wrap to fall open to the waist slap ye did he if they get too rough ye should call out ye know madame doesna allow the customers to mistreat usgive a good screech and bruno will be in there in a moment bruno i said a little faintly the porter dorcas explained busily spooning eggs into her mouth big as a bearthats why we call him bruno whats his name really she asked the table at large horace theobald corrected millie she turned to call to a servingmaid at the end of the room janie will ye fetch in more ale the new lassies had none yet aye peggys right she said turning back to me she wasnt at all pretty but had a nicely shaped mouth and a pleasant expression if ye get a man likes to play a bit rough thats one thingand dont sic bruno on a good customer or therell be hell to pay and youll do the paying but if ye think ye might really be damaged then just give a good skelloch brunos never far away during the night oh heres the ale she added taking a big pewter mug from the servingmaid and plonking it in front of me shes no damaged dorcas said having completed her survey of the visible aspects of my person a bit sore between the legs though aye she said shrewdly grinning at me ooh look shes blushing said mollie giggling with delight ooh you are a fresh one arent ye i took a deep gulp of the ale it was dark rich and extremely welcome as much for the width of the cup rim that hid my face as for its taste never mind mollie patted my arm kindly after breakfast ill show ye where the tubs are ye can soak your parts in warm water and theyll be good as new by tonight be sure to show her where the jars are too put in dorcas sweet herbs she explained to me put them in the water before ye sit in it madame likes us to smell sweet eef ze men want to lie wiz a feesh zey would go to ze docks eet ees more cheap peggy intoned in what was patently meant to be an imitation of madame jeanne the table erupted in giggles which were rapidly quelled by the sudden appearance of madame herself who entered through a door at the end of the room madame jeanne was frowning in a worried fashion and seemed too preoccupied to notice the smothered hilarity tsk murmured mollie seeing the proprietor an early customer i hate it when they come in the middle o breakfast she grumbled stop ye digesting your food proper it does ye neednt worry mollie its clairell have to take him peggy said tossing her dark plait out of the way newest lass takes the ones no one wants she informed me stick your finger up his bum dorcas advised me that brings em off faster than anything ill save ye a bannock for after if ye like erthanks i said just then madame jeannes eye lit upon me and her mouth dropped open in a horrified o what are you doing here she hissed rushing up to grab me by the arm eating i said in no mood to be snatched at i detached my arm from her grasp and picked up my ale cup merde she said did no one bring you food this morning no i said nor yet clothes i gestured at the quilt which was in imminent danger of falling off nez de cleopatre she said violently she stood up and glanced around the room eyes flashing daggers i will have the worthless scum of a maid flayed for this a thousand apologies madame thats quite all right i said graciously aware of the looks of astonishment on the faces of my breakfast companions ive had a wonderful meal nice to have met you all ladies i said rising and doing my best to bow graciously while clutching my quilt now madameabout my gown amid madame jeannes agitated protestations of apology and reiterated hopes that i would not find it necessary to tell monsieur fraser that i had been exposed to an undesirable intimacy with the working members of the establishment i made my clumsy way up two more flights of stairs and into a small room draped with hanging garments in various stages of completion with bolts of cloth stacked here and there in the corners of the chamber a moment please madame jeanne said and with a deep bow left me to the company of a dressmakers dummy with a large number of pins protruding from its stuffed bosom apparently this was where the costuming of the inmates took place i walked around the room quilt trailing and observed several flimsy silk wrappers under construction together with a couple of elaborate gowns with very low necks and a number of rather imaginative variations on the basic shift and camisole i removed one shift from its hook and put it on it was made of fine cotton with a low gathered neck and embroidery in the form of multiple hands that curled enticingly under the bosom and down the sides of the waist spreading out into a rakish caress atop the hips it hadnt been hemmed but was otherwise complete and gave me a great deal more freedom of movement than had the quilt i could hear voices in the next room where madame was apparently haranguing brunoor so i deduced the identity of the male rumble i do not care what the miserable girls sister has done she was saying do you not realize that the wife of monsieur jamie was left naked and starving are you sure shes his wife the deep male voice asked i had heard so had i but if he says this woman is his wife i am not disposed to argue nestce pas madame sounded impatient now as to this wretched madeleine its not her fault madame bruno broke in have you not heard the news this morningabout the fiend madame gave a small gasp no not another yes madame brunos voice was grim no more than a few doors awayabove the green owl tavern the girl was madeleines sister the priest brought the news just before breakfast so you can see yes i see madame sounded a little breathless yes of course of course was itthe same her voice quivered with distaste yes madame a hatchet or a big knife of some sort he lowered his voice as people do when recounting horrid things the priest told me that her head had been completely severed her body was near the door of her room and her headhis voice dropped even lower almost to a whisperher head was sitting on the mantelpiece looking into the room the landlord swooned when he found her a heavy thud from the next room suggested that madame jeanne had done likewise gooseflesh rippled up my arms and my own knees felt a trifle watery i was beginning to agree with jamies fear that his installing me in a house of prostitution had been injudicious at any rate i was now clad if not entirely dressed and i went into the room next door to find madame jeanne in semirecline on the sofa of a small parlor with a burly unhappylooking man sitting on the hassock near her feet madame started up at the sight of me madame fraser oh i am so sorry i did not mean to leave you waiting but i have had she hesitated looking for some delicate expression some distressing news id say so i said whats this about a fiend you heard she was already pale now her complexion went a few shades whiter and she wrung her hands what will he say he will be furious she moaned who i asked jamie or the fiend your husband she said she looked about the parlor distracted when he hears that his wife has been so shamefully neglected mistaken for a fille de joie and exposed toto i really dont think hell mind i said but i would like to hear about the fiend you would brunos heavy eyebrows rose he was a big man with sloping shoulders and long arms that made him look rather like a gorilla a resemblance enhanced by a low brow and a receding chin he looked eminently suited to the role of bouncer in a brothel well he hesitated glancing at madame jeanne for guidance but the proprietor caught sight of the small enameled clock on the mantelpiece and jumped to her feet with an exclamation of shock crottin she exclaimed i must go and with no more than a perfunctory wave in my direction she sped from the room leaving bruno and me looking after her in surprise oh he said recovering himself thats right it was coming at ten oclock it was a quarterpast ten by the enamel clock whatever it was i hoped it would wait fiend i prompted like most people bruno was only too willing to reveal all the gory details once past a pro forma demur for the sake of social delicacy the edinburgh fiend wasas i had deduced from the conversation thus fara murderer like an earlyday jack the ripper he specialized in women of easy virtue whom he killed with blows from a heavybladed instrument in some cases the bodies had been dismembered or otherwise interfered with as bruno said in lowered voice the killingseight in allhad occurred at intervals over the last two years with one exception the women had been killed in their own rooms most lived alonetwo had been killed in brothels hence madames agitation i supposed what was the exception i asked bruno crossed himself a nun he whispered the words evidently still a shock to him a french sister of mercy the sister coming ashore at edinburgh with a group of nuns bound for london had been abducted from the docks without any of her companions noticing her absence in the confusion by the time she was discovered in one of edinburghs wynds after nightfall it was far too late raped i asked with clinical interest bruno eyed me with considerable suspicion i do not know he said formally he rose heavily to his feet his simian shoulders drooping with fatigue i supposed he had been on duty all night it must be his bedtime now if you will excuse me madame he said with remote formality and went out i sat back on the small velvet sofa feeling mildly dazed somehow i hadnt realized that quite so much went on in brothels in the daytime there was a sudden loud hammering at the door it didnt sound like knocking but as though someone really were using a metalheaded hammer to demand admittance i got to my feet to answer the summons but without further warning the door burst open and a slender imperious figure strode into the room speaking french in an accent so pronounced and an attitude so furious that i could not follow it all are you looking for madame jeanne i managed to put in seizing a small pause when he stopped to draw breath for more invective the visitor was a young man of about thirty slightly built and strikingly handsome with thick black hair and brows he glared at me under these and as he got a good look at me an extraordinary change went across his face the brows rose his black eyes grew huge and his face went white milady he exclaimed and flung himself on his knees embracing me about the thighs as he pressed his face into the cotton shift at crotch level let go i exclaimed shoving at his shoulders to detach him i dont work here let go i say milady he was repeating in tones of rapture milady you have come back a miracle god has restored you he looked up at me smiling as tears streamed down his face he had large white perfect teeth suddenly memory stirred and shifted showing me the outlines of an urchins face beneath the mans bold visage fergus i said fergus is that really you get up for gods sakelet me see you he rose to his feet but didnt pause to let me inspect him he gathered me into a ribcracking hug and i clutched him in return pounding his back in the excitement of seeing him again he had been ten or so when i last saw him just before culloden now he was a man and the stubble of his beard rasped against my cheek i thought i was seeing a ghost he exclaimed it is really you then yes its me i assured him you have seen milord he asked excitedly he knows you are here yes oh he blinked and stepped back half a pace as something occurred to him butbut what about he paused clearly confused what about what there ye are what in the name of god are ye doing up here fergus jamies tall figure loomed suddenly in the doorway his eyes widened at the sight of me in my embroidered shift where are your clothes he asked never mind he said then waving his hand impatiently as i opened my mouth to answer i havena time just now come along fergus theres eighteen ankers of brandy in the alleyway and the excisemen on my heels and with a thunder of boots on the wooden staircase they were gone leaving me alone once more i wasnt sure whether i should join the party downstairs or not but curiosity got the better of discretion after a quick visit to the sewing room in search of more extensive covering i made my way down a large shawl halfembroidered with hollyhocks flung round my shoulders i had gathered only a vague impression of the layout of the house the night before but the street noises that filtered through the windows made it clear which side of the building faced the high street i assumed the alleyway to which jamie had referred must be on the other side but wasnt sure the houses of edinburgh were frequently constructed with odd little wings and twisting walls to take advantage of every inch of space i paused on the large landing at the foot of the stairs listening for the sound of rolling casks as a guide as i stood there i felt a sudden draft on my bare feet and turned to see a man standing in the open doorway from the kitchen he seemed as surprised as i but after blinking at me he smiled and stepped forward to grip me by the elbow and a good morning to you my dear i didnt expect to find any of you ladies up and about so early in the morning well you know what they say about early to bed and early to rise i said trying to extricate my elbow he laughed showing rather badly stained teeth in a narrow jaw no what do they say about it well its something they say in america come to think of it i replied suddenly realizing that benjamin franklin even if currently publishing probably didnt have a wide readership in edinburgh got a wit about you chuckie he said with a slight smile send you down as a decoy did she no who i said the madam he said glancing around where is she i have no idea i said let go instead he tightened his grip so that his fingers dug uncomfortably into the muscles of my upper arm he leaned closer whispering in my ear with a gust of stale tobacco fumes theres a reward you know he murmured confidentially a percentage of the value of the seized contraband no one would need to know but you and me he flicked one finger gently under my breast making the nipple stand up under the thin cotton what dye say chuck i stared at him the excisemen are on my heels jamie had said this must be one then an officer of the crown charged with the prevention of smuggling and the apprehension of smugglers what had jamie said the pillory transportation flogging imprisonment earnailing waving an airy hand as though such penalties were the equivalent of a traffic ticket whatever are you talking about i said trying to sound puzzled and for the last time let go of me he couldnt be alone i thought how many others were there around the building yes please let go said a voice behind me i saw the excisemans eyes widen as he glanced over my shoulder mr willoughby stood on the second stair in rumpled blue silk a large pistol gripped in both hands he bobbed his head politely at the excise officer not stinking whore he explained blinking owlishly honorable wife the exciseman clearly startled by the unexpected appearance of a chinese gawked from me to mr willoughby and back again wife he said disbelievingly you say shes your wife mr willoughby clearly catching only the salient word nodded pleasantly wife he said again please letting go his eyes were mere bloodshot slits and it was apparent to me if not to the exciseman that his blood was still approximately proof the exciseman pulled me toward himself and scowled at mr willoughby now listen here he began he got no further for mr willoughby evidently assuming that he had given fair warning raised the pistol and pulled the trigger there was a loud crack an even louder shriek which must have been mine and the landing was filled with a cloud of gray powdersmoke the exciseman staggered back against the paneling a look of intense surprise on his face and a spreading rosette of blood on the breast of his coat moving by reflex i leapt forward and grasped the man under the arms easing him gently down to the floorboards of the landing there was a flurry of noise from above as the inhabitants of the house crowded chattering and exclaiming onto the upper landing attracted by the shot bounding footsteps came up the lower stairs two at a time fergus burst through what must be the cellar door a pistol in his hand milady he gasped catching sight of me sitting in the corner with the excisemans body sprawled across my lap what have you done me i said indignantly i havent done anything its jamies pet chinaman i nodded briefly toward the stair where mr willoughby the pistol dropped unregarded by his feet had sat down on the step and was now regarding the scene below with a benign and bloodshot eye fergus said something in french that was too colloquial to translate but sounded highly uncomplimentary to mr willoughby he strode across the landing and reached out a hand to grasp the little chinamans shoulderor so i assumed until i saw that the arm he extended did not end in a hand but in a hook of gleaming dark metal fergus i was so shocked at the sight that i stopped my attempts to stanch the excisemans wound with my shawl whatwhat i said incoherently what he said glancing at me then following the direction of my gaze said oh that and shrugged the english dont worry about it milady we havent time you canaille get downstairs he jerked mr willoughby off the stairs dragged him to the cellar door and shoved him through it with a callous disregard for safety i could hear a series of bumps suggesting that the chinese was rolling downstairs his acrobatic skills having temporarily deserted him but had no time to worry about it fergus squatted next to me and lifted the excisemans head by the hair how many companions are with you he demanded tell me quickly cochon or i slit your throat from the evident signs this was a superfluous threat the mans eyes were already glazing over with considerable effort the corners of his mouth drew back in a smile ill seeyouburninhell he whispered and with a last convulsion that fixed the smile in a hideous rictus upon his face he coughed up a startling quantity of bright red foamy blood and died in my lap more feet were coming up the stairs at a high rate of speed jamie charged through the cellar door and barely stopped himself before stepping on the excise officers trailing legs his eyes traveled up the bodys length and rested on my face with horrified amazement what have ye done sassenach he demanded not herthe yellow pox fergus put in saving me the trouble he thrust the pistol into his belt and offered me his real hand come milady you must get downstairs jamie forestalled him bending over me as he jerked his head in the direction of the front hall ill manage here he said guard the front fergus the usual signal and keep your pistol hidden unless theres need fergus nodded and vanished at once through the door to the hall jamie had succeeded in bundling the corpse awkwardly in the shawl he lifted it off me and i scrambled to my feet greatly relieved to be rid of it in spite of the blood and other objectionable substances soaking the front of my shift ooh i think hes dead an awestruck voice floated down from above and i looked up to see a dozen prostitutes peering down like cherubim from on high get back to your rooms jamie barked there was a chorus of frightened squeals and they scattered like pigeons jamie glanced around the landing for traces of the incident but luckily there were nonethe shawl and i had caught everything come on he said the stairs were dim and the cellar at the foot pitchblack i stopped at the bottom waiting for jamie the exciseman had not been lightly built and jamie was breathing hard when he reached me across to the far side he said gasping a false wall hold my arm with the door above shut i couldnt see a thing luckily jamie seemed able to steer by radar he led me unerringly past large objects that i bumped in passing and finally came to a halt i could smell damp stone and putting out a hand felt a rough wall before me jamie said something loudly in gaelic apparently it was the celtic equivalent of open sesame for there was a short silence then a grating noise and a faint glowing line appeared in the darkness before me the line widened into a slit and a section of the wall swung out revealing a small doorway made of a wooden framework upon which cut stones were mounted so as to look like part of the wall the concealed cellar was a large room at least thirty feet long several figures were moving about and the air was ripely suffocating with the smell of brandy jamie dumped the body unceremoniously in a corner then turned to me god sassenach are ye all right the cellar seemed to be lighted with candles dotted here and there in the dimness i could just see his face skin drawn tight across his cheekbones im a little cold i said trying not to let my teeth chatter my shift is soaked with blood otherwise im all right i think jeanne he turned and called toward the far end of the cellar and one of the figures came toward us resolving itself into a very worriedlooking madam he explained the situation in a few words causing the worried expression to grow considerably worse horreur she said killed on my premises with witnesses aye im afraid so jamie sounded calm ill manage about it but in the meantime ye must go up he might not have been alone youll know what to do his voice held a tone of calm assurance and he squeezed her arm the touch seemed to calm heri hoped that was why he had done itand she turned to leave oh and jeanne jamie called after her when ye come back can ye bring down some clothes for my wife if her gowns not ready i think daphne is maybe the right size clothes madame jeanne squinted into the shadows where i stood i helpfully stepped out into the light displaying the results of my encounter with the exciseman madame jeanne blinked once or twice crossed herself and turned without a word to disappear through the concealed doorway which swung to behind her with a muffled thud i was beginning to shake as much with reaction as with the cold accustomed as i was to emergency blood and even sudden death the events of the morning had been more than a little harrowing it was like a bad saturday night in the emergency room come along sassenach jamie said putting a hand gently on the small of my back well get ye washed his touch worked on me as well as it had on madame jeanne i felt instantly better if still apprehensive washed in what brandy he gave a slight laugh at that no water i can offer ye a bathtub but im afraid it will be cold it was extremely cold whwhwhere did this water come from i asked shivering off a glacier the water gushed out of a pipe set in the wall normally kept plugged with an insanitarylooking wad of rags wrapped to form a rough seal around the chunk of wood that served as a plug i pulled my hand out of the chilly stream and wiped it on the shift which was too far gone for anything to make much difference jamie shook his head as he maneuvered the big wooden tub closer to the spout off the roof he answered theres a rainwater cistern up there the guttering pipe runs down the side of the building and the cistern pipe is hidden inside it he looked absurdly proud of himself and i laughed quite an arrangement i said what do you use the water for to cut the liquor he explained he gestured at the far side of the room where the shadowy figures were working with notable industry among a large array of casks and tubs it comes in a hundred and eighty degrees above proof we mix it here wi pure water and recask it for sale to the taverns he shoved the rough plug back into the pipe and bent to pull the big tub across the stone floor here well take it out of the way theyll be needing the water one of the men was in fact standing by with a small cask clasped in his arms with no more than a curious glance at me he nodded to jamie and thrust the cask beneath the stream of water behind a hastily arranged screen of empty barrels i peered dubiously down into the depths of my makeshift tub a single candle burned in a puddle of wax nearby glimmering off the surface of the water and making it look black and bottomless i stripped off shivering violently thinking that the comforts of hot water and modern plumbing had seemed a hell of a lot easier to renounce when they were close at hand jamie groped in his sleeve and pulled out a large handkerchief at which he squinted dubiously aye well its maybe cleaner than your shift he said shrugging he handed it to me then excused himself to oversee operations at the other end of the room the water was freezing and so was the cellar and as i gingerly sponged myself the icy trickles running down my stomach and thighs brought on small fits of shivering thoughts of what might be happening overhead did little to ease my feelings of chilly apprehension presumably we were safe enough for the moment so long as the false cellar wall deceived any searching excisemen but if the wall failed to hide us our position was all but hopeless there appeared to be no way out of this room but by the door in the false walland if that wall were breached we would not only be caught redhanded in possession of quite a lot of contraband brandy but also in custody of the body of a murdered kings officer and surely the disappearance of that officer would provoke an intensive search i had visions of excisemen combing the brothel questioning and threatening the women emerging with complete descriptions of myself jamie and mr willoughby as well as several eyewitness accounts of the murder involuntarily i glanced at the far corner where the dead man lay beneath his bloodstained shroud covered with pink and yellow hollyhocks the chinaman was nowhere to be seen having apparently passed out behind the ankers of brandy here sassenach drink this your teeth are chattering so youre like to bite through your tongue jamie had reappeared by my seal hole like a st bernard dog bearing a firkin of brandy ththanks i had to drop the washcloth and use both hands to steady the wooden cup so it wouldnt clack against my teeth but the brandy helped it dropped like a flaming coal into the pit of my stomach and sent small curling tendrils of warmth through my frigid extremities as i sipped oh god thats better i said stopping long enough to gasp for breath is this the uncut version no that would likely kill ye this is maybe a little stronger than what we sell though finish up and put something on then ye can have a bit more jamie took the cup from my hand and gave me back the handkerchief washcloth as i hurriedly finished my chilly ablutions i watched him from the corner of my eye he was frowning as he gazed at me clearly deep in thought i had imagined that his life was complicated it hadnt escaped me that my presence was undoubtedly complicating it a good bit more i would have given a lot to know what he was thinking what are you thinking about jamie i said watching him sidelong as i swabbed the last of the smudges from my thighs the water swirled around my calves disturbed by my movements and the candlelight lit the waves with sparks as though the dark blood i had washed from my body now glowed once more live and red in the water the frown vanished momentarily as his eyes cleared and fixed on my face i am thinking that youre verra beautiful sassenach he said softly maybe if one has a taste for gooseflesh on a large scale i said tartly stepping out of the tub and reaching for the cup he grinned suddenly at me teeth flashing white in the dimness of the cellar oh aye he said well youre speaking to the only man in scotland who has a terrible cockstand at sight of a plucked chicken i spluttered in my brandy and choked halfhysterical from tension and terror jamie quickly shrugged out of his coat and wrapped the garment around me hugging me close against him as i shivered and coughed and gasped makes it hard to pass a poulterers stall and stay decent he murmured in my ear briskly rubbing my back through the fabric hush sassenach hush now itll be fine i clung to him shaking im sorry i said im all right its my fault though mr willoughby shot the exciseman because he thought he was making indecent advances to me jamie snorted that doesna make it your fault sassenach he said dryly and for what its worth its no the first time the chinamans done something foolish either when hes drink taken hell do anything and never mind how mad it is suddenly jamies expression changed as he realized what i had said he stared down at me eyes wide did ye say exciseman sassenach yes why he didnt answer but let go my shoulders and whirled on his heel snatching the candle off the cask in passing rather than be left in the dark i followed him to the corner where the corpse lay under its shawl hold this jamie thrust the candle unceremoniously into my hand and knelt by the shrouded figure pulling back the stained fabric that covered the face i had seen quite a few dead bodies the sight was no shock but it still wasnt pleasant the eyes had rolled up beneath halfclosed lids which did nothing to help the generally ghastly effect jamie frowned at the dead face dropjawed and waxy in the candlelight and muttered something under his breath whats wrong i asked i had thought i would never be warm again but jamies coat was not only thick and wellmade it held the remnants of his own considerable body heat i was still cold but the shivering had eased this isna an exciseman jamie said still frowning i know all the riding officers in the district and the superintending officers too but ive no seen this fellow before with some distaste he turned back the sodden flap of the coat and groped inside he felt about gingerly but thoroughly inside the mans clothing emerging at last with a small penknife and a small booklet bound in red paper new testament i read with some astonishment jamie nodded looking up at me with one brow raised exciseman or no it seems a peculiar thing to bring with ye to a kittlehoosie he wiped the little booklet on the shawl then drew the folds of fabric quite gently back over the face and rose to his feet shaking his head thats the only thing in his pockets any customs inspector or exciseman must carry his warrant upon his person at all times for otherwise hes no authority to carry out a search of premises or seize goods he glanced up eyebrows raised why did ye think he was an exciseman i hugged the folds of jamies coat around myself trying to remember what the man had said to me on the landing he asked me whether i was a decoy and where the madam was then he said that there was a rewarda percentage of seized contraband thats what he saidand that no one would know but him and me and youd said there were excisemen after you i added so naturally i thought he was one then mr willoughby turned up and things rather went to pot jamie nodded still looking puzzled aye well i havena got any idea who he is but its a good thing that he isna an exciseman i thought at first something had come verra badly unstuck but its likely all right unstuck he smiled briefly ive an arrangement with the superintending customs officer for the district sassenach i gaped at him arrangement he shrugged well bribery then if ye like to be straight out about it he sounded faintly irritated no doubt thats standard business procedure i said trying to sound tactful one corner of his mouth twitched slightly aye it is well in any case theres an understanding as ye might say between sir percival turner and myself and to find him sending excise officers into this place would worry me considerably all right i said slowly mentally juggling all the halfunderstood events of the morning and trying to make a pattern of them but in that case what did you mean by telling fergus the excisemen were on your heels and why has everyone been racing round like chickens with their heads off oh that he smiled briefly and took my arm turning me away from the corpse at our feet well its an arrangement as i said and part of it is that sir percival must satisfy his own masters in london by seizing sufficient amounts of contraband now and again so we see to it that hes given the opportunity wally and the lads brought down two wagonloads from the coast one of the best brandy and the other filled with spiled casks and the punked wine topped off with a few ankers of cheap swill just to give it all flavor i met them just outside the city this morning as we planned and then we drove the wagons in takin care to attract the attention of the riding officer who just happened to be passing with a small number of dragoons they came along and we led them a canty chase through the alleyways until the time for me and the good tubs to part company wi wally and his load of swill wally jumped off his wagon then and made awa and i drove like hell down here wi two or three dragoons following just for show like looks well in a report ye ken he grinned at me quoting the smugglers escaped in spite of industrious pursuit but his majestys valiant soldiers succeeded in capturing an entire wagonload of spirits valued at sixty pounds ten shillings youll know the sort of thing i expect so i said then it was you and the good liquor that was arriving at ten madame jeanne said aye he said frowning she was meant to have the cellar door open and the ramp in place at ten sharpwe havena got long to get everything unloaded she was bloody late this morning i had to circle round twice to keep from bringing the dragoons straight to the door she was a bit distracted i said remembering suddenly about the fiend i told jamie about the murder at the green owl and he grimaced crossing himself poor lass he said i shuddered briefly at the memory of brunos description and moved closer to jamie who put an arm about my shoulders he kissed me absently on the forehead glancing again at the shawlcovered shape on the ground well whoever he was if he wasna an exciseman there are likely no more of them upstairs we should be able to get out of here soon thats good jamies coat covered me to the knees but i felt the covert glances cast from the far end of the room at my bare calves and was all too uncomfortably aware that i was naked under it will we be going back to the printshop what with one thing and another i didnt think i wanted to take advantage of madame jeannes hospitality any longer than necessary maybe for a bit ill have to think jamies tone was abstracted and i could see that his brow was furrowed in thought with a brief hug he released me and began to walk about the cellar staring meditatively at the stones underfoot erwhat did you do with ian he glanced up looking blank then his face cleared oh ian i left him making inquiries at the taverns above the market cross ill need to remember to meet him later he muttered as though making a note to himself i met young ian by the way i said conversationally jamie looked startled he came here he did looking for youabout a quarter of an hour after you left in fact thank god for small mercies he rubbed a hand through his hair looking simultaneously amused and worried id have had the devil of a time explaining to ian what his son was doing here you know what he was doing here i asked curiously no i dont he was supposed to beah well let it be i canna be worrit about it just now he relapsed into thought emerging momentarily to ask did young ian say where he was going when he left ye i shook my head gathering the coat around myself and he nodded sighed and took up his slow pacing once more i sat down on an upturned tub and watched him in spite of the general atmosphere of discomfort and danger i felt absurdly happy simply to be near him feeling that there was little i could do to help the situation at present i settled myself with the coat wrapped round me and abandoned myself to the momentary pleasure of looking at himsomething i had had no chance to do in the tumult of events in spite of his preoccupation he moved with the surefooted grace of a swordsman a man so aware of his body as to be able to forget it entirely the men by the casks worked by torchlight it gleamed on his hair as he turned lighting it like a tigers fur with stripes of gold and dark i caught the faint twitch as two fingers of his right hand flickered together against the fabric of his breeches and felt a strange little lurch of recognition in the gesture i had seen him do that a thousand times as he was thinking and seeing it now again felt as though all the time that had passed in our separation was no more than the rising and setting of a single sun as though catching my thought he paused in his strolling and smiled at me youll be warm enough sassenach he asked no but it doesnt matter i got off my tub and went to join him in his peregrinations slipping a hand through his arm making any progress with the thinking he laughed ruefully no im thinking of maybe half a dozen things together and half of them things i canna do anything about like whether young ians where he should be i stared up at him where he should be where do you think he should be he should be at the printshop jamie said with some emphasis but he should ha been with wally this morning and he wasnt with wally you mean you knew he wasnt at home when his father came looking for him this morning he rubbed his nose with a finger looking at once irritated and amused oh aye id promised young ian i wouldna say anything to his da though until hed a chance to explain himself not that an explanation is likely to save his arse he added young ian had as his father said come to join his uncle in edinburgh without the preliminary bother of asking his parents leave jamie had discovered this dereliction fairly quickly but had not wanted to send his nephew alone back to lallybroch and had not yet had time to escort him personally its not that he canna look out for himself jamie explained amusement winning in the struggle of expressions on his face hes a nice capable lad its justwell ye ken how things just happen around some folk without them seeming to have anything much to do wi it now that you mention it yes i said wryly im one of them he laughed out loud at that god youre right sassenach maybe thats why i like young ian so well he minds me of you he reminded me a bit of you i said jamie snorted briefly god jenny will maim me and she hears her baby sons been loitering about a house of ill repute i hope the wee bugger has the sense to keep his mouth shut once hes home i hope he gets home i said thinking of the gawky almostfifteenyearold i had seen that morning adrift in an edinburgh filled with prostitutes excisemen smugglers and hatchetwielding fiends at least he isnt a girl i added thinking of this last item the fiend doesnt seem to have a taste for young boys aye well there are plenty of others who have jamie said sourly between young ian and you sassenach i shall be lucky if my hairs not gone white by the time we get out of this stinking cellar me i said in surprise you dont need to worry about me i dont he dropped my arm and rounded on me glaring i dinna need to worry about ye is that what ye said christ i leave ye safely in bed waiting for your breakfast and not an hour later i find ye downstairs in your shift clutching a corpse to your bosom and now youre standing in front of me bare as an egg with fifteen men over there wondering who in hell ye areand how dye think im going to explain ye to them sassenach tell me that eh he shoved a hand through his hair in exasperation sweet bleeding jesus and ive to go up the coast in two days without fail but i canna leave ye in edinburgh not wi fiends creepin about with hatchets and half the people whove seen ye thinking youre a prostitute andand the lacing around his pigtail broke abruptly under the pressure and his hair fluffed out round his head like a lions mane i laughed he glared for a moment longer but then a reluctant grin made its way slowly through the frown aye well he said resigned i suppose ill manage i suppose you will i said and stood on tiptoe to brush his hair back behind his ears working on the same principle that causes magnets of opposing polarities to snap together when placed in close proximitry he bent his head and kissed me i had forgotten he said a moment later forgotten what his back was warm through the thin shirt everything he spoke very softly mouth against my hair joy fear fear most of all his hand came up and smoothed my curls away from his nose i havena been afraid for a verra long time sassenach he whispered but now i think i am for there is something to be lost now i drew back a little to look up at him his arms were locked tight around my waist his eyes dark as bottomless water in the dimness then his face changed and he kissed me quickly on the forehead come along sassenach he said taking me by the arm ill tell the men youre my wife the rest of it will just have to bide up in flames the dress was a trifle lowercut than necessary and a bit tight in the bosom but on the whole not a bad fit and how did you know daphne would be the right size i asked spooning up my soup i said i didna bed wi the lasses jamie replied circumspectly i never said i didna look at them he blinked at me like a large red owlsome congenital tic made him incapable of closing one eye in a winkand i laughed that gown becomes ye a good deal more than it did daphne though he cast a glance of general approval at my bosom and waved at a servingmaid carrying a platter of fresh bannocks moubrays tavern was doing a thriving dinner business several cuts above the snug smoky atmosphere to be found in the worlds end and similar serious drinking establishments moubrays was a large and elegant place with an outside stair that ran up to the second floor where a commodious dining room accommodated the appetites of edinburghs prosperous tradesmen and public officials who are you at the moment i asked i heard madame jeanne call you monsieur fraserare you fraser in public though he shook his head and broke a bannock into his soup bowl no at the moment im sawney malcolm printer and publisher sawney thats a nickname for alexander is it i should have thought sandy was more like it especially considering your hair not that his hair was sandycolored in the least i reflected looking at it it was like brees hairvery thick with a slight wave to it and all the colors of red and gold mixed copper and cinnamon auburn and amber red and roan and rufous all mingled together i felt a sudden wave of longing for bree at the same time i longed to untie jamies hair from its formal plait and run my hands up under it to feel the solid curve of his skull and the soft strands tangled in my fingers i could still recall the tickle of it spilling loose and rich across my breasts in the morning light my breath coming a little short i bent my head to my oyster stew jamie appeared not to have noticed he added a large pat of butter to his bowl shaking his head as he did so sawneys what they say in the highlands he informed me and in the isles too sandys more what yed hear in the lowlandsor from an ignorant sassenach he lifted one eyebrow at me smiling and raised a spoonful of the rich fragrant stew to his mouth all right i said i suppose more to the point thoughwho am i he had noticed after all i felt one large foot nudge mine and he smiled at me over the rim of his cup youre my wife sassenach he said gruffly always no matter who i may beyoure my wife i could feel the flush of pleasure rise in my face and see the memories of the night before reflected in his own the tips of his ears were faintly pink you dont suppose theres too much pepper in this stew i asked swallowing another spoonful are you sure jamie aye he said aye im sure he amended and no the peppers fine i like a wee bit of pepper the foot moved slightly against mine the toe of his shoe barely brushing my ankle so im mrs malcolm i said trying out the name on my tongue the mere fact of saying mrs gave me an absurd little thrill like a new bride involuntarily i glanced down at the silver ring on my right fourth finger jamie caught the glance and raised his cup to me to mrs malcolm he said softly and the breathless feeling came back he set down the cup and took my hand his own was big and so warm that a general feeling of glowing heat spread rapidly through my fingers i could feel the silver ring separate from my flesh its metal heated by his touch to have and to hold he said smiling from this day forward i said not caring in the least that we were attracting interested glances from the other diners jamie bent his head and pressed his lips against the back of my hand an action that turned the interested glances into frank stares a clergyman was seated across the room he glared at us and said something to his companions who turned round to stare one was a small elderly man the other i was surprised to see was mr wallace my companion from the inverness coach there are private rooms upstairs jamie murmured blue eyes dancing over my knuckles and i lost interest in mr wallace how interesting i said you havent finished your stew damn the stew here comes the servingmaid with the ale devil take her sharp white teeth closed gently on my knuckle making me jerk slightly in my seat people are watching you let them and i trust theyve a fine day for it his tongue flicked gently between my fingers theres a man in a green coat coming this way to hell jamie began when the shadow of the visitor fell upon the table a good day to you mr malcolm said the visitor bowing politely i trust i do not intrude you do said jamie straightening up but keeping his grip on my hand he turned a cool gaze on the newcomer i think i do not know ye sir the gentleman an englishman of maybe thirtyfive quietly dressed bowed again not intimidated by this marked lack of hospitality i have not had the pleasure of your acquaintance as yet sir he said deferentially my master however bade me greet you and inquire whether youand your companionmight be so agreeable as to take a little wine with him the tiny pause before the word companion was barely discernible but jamie caught it his eyes narrowed my wife and i he said with precisely the same sort of pause before wife are otherwise engaged at the moment should your master wish to speak wi me it is sir percival turner who sends to ask sir the secretaryfor so he must beput in quickly wellbred as he was he couldnt resist a tiny flick of one eyebrow as one who uses a name he expects to conjure with indeed said jamie dryly well with all respect to sir percival i am preoccupied at present if you will convey him my regrets he bowed with a politeness so pointed as to come within a hair of rudeness and turned his back on the secretary that gentleman stood for a moment his mouth slightly open then pivoted smartly on his heel and made his way through the scatter of tables to a door on the far side of the dining room where was i jamie demanded oh ayeto hell wi gentlemen in green coats now about these private rooms how are you going to explain me to people i asked he raised one eyebrow explain what he looked me up and down why must i make excuses for ye youre no missing any limbs youre not poxed hunchbacked toothless or lame you know what i mean i said kicking him lightly under the table the lady sitting near the wall nudged her companion and widened her eyes disapprovingly at us i smiled nonchalantly at them aye i do he said grinning however what wi mr willoughbys activities this morning and one thing and another i havena had much chance to think about the matter perhaps ill just say my dear fellow so you are married capital news simply capital my deepest congratulations and may i bedare i hope to bethe first to extend my felicitations and best wishes to your lady a small elderly gentleman in a tidy wig leaned heavily on a goldknobbed stick beaming genially at us both it was the little gentleman who had been sitting with mr wallace and the clergyman you will pardon the minor discourtesy of my sending johnson to fetch you earlier i am sure he said deprecatingly it is only that my wretched infirmity prevents rapid movement as you see jamie had risen to his feet at the appearance of the visitor and with a polite gesture now drew out a chair youll join us sir percival he said oh no no indeed shouldnt dream of intruding on your new happiness my dear sir truly i had no idea still protesting gracefully he sank down into the proffered chair wincing as he extended his foot beneath the table i am a martyr to gout my dear he confided leaning close enough for me to smell his foul oldmans breath beneath the wintergreen that spiced his linen he didnt look corrupt i thoughtbreath notwithstandingbut then appearances could be deceiving it was only about four hours since i had been mistaken for a prostitute making the best of it jamie called for wine and accepted sir percivals continued effusions with some grace it is rather fortunate that i should have encountered you here my dear fellow the elderly gentleman said breaking off his flowery compliments at last he laid a small manicured hand on jamies sleeve i had something particular to say to you in fact i had sent a note to the printshop but my messenger failed to find you there ah jamie cocked an eyebrow in question yes sir percival went on i believe you had spoken to mesome weeks ago i scarce recall the occasionof your intention to travel north on business a matter of a new press or something of the sort sir percival had quite a sweet face i thought handsomely patrician despite his years with large guileless blue eyes aye thats so jamie agreed courteously i am invited by mr mcleod of perth to see a new style of letterpress hes recently put in use quite sir percival paused to remove a snuffbox from his pocket a pretty thing enameled in green and gold with cherubs on the lid i really should not advise a trip to the north just now he said opening the box and concentrating on its contents really i should not the weather is like to be inclement at this season i am sure it would not suit mrs malcolm smiling at me like an elderly angel he inhaled a large pinch of snuff and paused linen handkerchief at the ready jamie sipped at his wine his face blandly composed i am grateful for your advice sir percival he said youll perhaps have received word from your agents of recent storms to the north sir percival sneezed a small neat sound like a mouse with a cold he was rather like a white mouse altogether i thought seeing him dab daintily at his pointed pink nose quite he said again putting away the kerchief and blinking benevolently at jamie no i wouldas a particular friend with your welfare at heartmost strongly advise that you remain in edinburgh after all he added turning the beam of his benevolence on me you surely have an inducement to remain comfortably at home now do you not and now my dear young people i am afraid i must take my leave i must not detain you any longer from what must be your wedding breakfast with a little assistance from the hovering johnson sir percival got up and tottered off his goldknobbed stick taptapping on the floor he seems a nice old gent i remarked when i was sure he was far enough away not to hear me jamie snorted rotten as a wormriddled board he said he picked up his glass and drained it yed think otherwise he said meditatively putting it down and staring after the wizened figure now cautiously negotiating the head of the stairs a man as close as sir percival is to judgment day i mean yed think fear o the devil would prevent him but not a bit i suppose hes like everyone else i said cynically most people think theyre going to live forever jamie laughed his exuberant spirits returning with a rush aye thats true he said he pushed my wineglass toward me and now youre here sassenach im convinced of it drink up mo nighean donn and well go upstairs post coitum omne animalium triste est i remarked with my eyes closed there was no response from the warm heavy weight on my chest save the gentle sigh of his breathing after a moment though i felt a sort of subterranean vibration which i interpreted as amusement thats a verra peculiar sentiment sassenach jamie said his voice blurred with drowsiness not your own i hope no i stroked the damp bright hair back from his forehead and he turned his face into the curve of my shoulder with a small contented snuffle the private rooms at moubrays left a bit to be desired in the way of amorous accommodation still the sofa at least offered a padded horizontal surface which if you came right down to it was all that was necessary while i had decided that i was not past wanting to commit passionate acts after all i was still too old to want to commit them on the bare floorboards i dont know who said itsome ancient philosopher or other it was quoted in one of my medical textbooks in the chapter on the human reproductive system the vibration made itself audible as a small chuckle yed seem to have applied yourself to your lessons to good purpose sassenach he said his hand passed down my side and wormed its way slowly underneath to cup my bottom he sighed with contentment squeezing slightly i canna think when i have felt less triste he said me either i said tracing the whorl of the small cowlick that lifted the hair from the center of his forehead thats what made me think of iti rather wondered what led the ancient philosopher to that conclusion i suppose it depends on the sorts of animaliae hed been fornicating with jamie observed maybe it was just that none o them took to him but he must ha tried a fair number to make such a sweeping statement he held tighter to his anchor as the tide of my laughter bounced him gently up and down mind ye dogs sometimes do look a trifle sheepish when theyve done wi mating he said mm and how do sheep look then aye well female sheep just go on lookin like sheepnot havin a great deal of choice in the matter ye ken oh and what do the male sheep look like oh they look fair depraved let their tongues hang out drooling and their eyes roll back while they make disgusting noises like most male animals aye i could feel the curve of his grin against my shoulder he squeezed again and i pulled gently on the ear closest to hand i didnt notice your tongue hanging out ye werena noticing your eyes were closed i didnt hear any disgusting noises either well i couldna just think of any on the spur of the moment he admitted perhaps ill do better next time we laughed softly together and then were quiet listening to each other breathe jamie i said softly at last smoothing the back of his head i dont think ive ever been so happy he rolled to one side shifting his weight carefully so as not to squash me and lifted himself to lie facetoface with me nor me my sassenach he said and kissed me very lightly but lingering so that i had time just to close my lips in a tiny bite on the fullness of his lower lip its no just the bedding ye ken he said drawing back a little at last his eyes looked down at me a soft deep blue like the warm tropic sea no i said touching his cheek it isnt to have ye with me againto talk wi youto know i can say anything not guard my words or hide my thoughtsgod sassenach he said the lord knows i am lustcrazed as a lad and i canna keep my hands from youor anything else he added wryly but i would count that all well lost had i no more than the pleasure of havin ye by me and to tell ye all my heart it was lonely without you i whispered so lonely and me he said he looked down long lashes hiding his eyes and hesitated for a moment i willna say that i have lived a monk he said quietly when i had towhen i felt that i must or go mad i laid my fingers against his lips to stop him neither did i i said frank his own hand pressed gently against my mouth both dumb we looked at each other and i could feel the smile growing behind my hand and my own under his to match it i took my hand away it doesna signify he said he took his hand off my mouth no i said it doesnt matter i traced the line of his lips with my finger so tell me all your heart i said if theres time he glanced at the window to gauge the lightwe were to meet ian at the print shop at five oclock to check the progress of the search for young ianand then rolled carefully off me theres two hours at least before we must go sit up and put your clothes on and ill have them bring some wine and biscuits this sounded wonderful i seemed to have been starving ever since i found him i sat up and began to rummage through the pile of discarded clothes on the floor looking for the set of stays the lownecked gown required im no ways sad but i do maybe feel a bit ashamed jamie observed wriggling long slender toes into a silk stocking or i should at least why is that well here i am in paradise so to speak wi you and wine and biscuits while ians out tramping the pavements and worrying for his son are you worried about young ian i asked concentrating on my laces he frowned slightly pulling on the other stocking not so much worried for him as afraid he may not turn up before tomorrow what happens tomorrow i asked and then belatedly recalled the encounter with sir percival turner oh your trip to the norththat was supposed to be tomorrow he nodded aye theres a rendezvous set at mullins cove tomorrow being the dark of the moon a lugger from france wi a load of wine and cambric and sir percival was warning you not to make that rendezvous so it seems whats happened i canna say though i expect ill find out could be as theres a visiting customs officer in the district or hes had word of some activity on the coast there that has nothing to do wi us but could interfere he shrugged and finished his last garter he spread out his hands upon his knees then palm up and slowly curled the fingers inward the left curled at once into a fist compact and neat a blunt instrument ready for battle the fingers of his right hand curled more slowly the middle finger was crooked and would not lie along the second the fourth finger would not curl at all but stuck out straight holding the little finger at an awkward angle beside it he looked from his hands to me smiling dye remember the night when ye set my hand sometimes in my more horrible moments that night was one to rememberonly because it couldnt be forgotten against all odds i had rescued him from wentworth prison and a death sentencebut not in time to prevent his being cruelly tortured and abused by black jack randall i picked up his right hand and transferred it to my own knee he let it lie there warm heavy and inert and didnt object as i felt each finger pulling gently to stretch the tendons and twisting to see the range of motion in the joints my first orthopedic surgery that was i said wryly have ye done a great many things like that since he asked curiously looking down at me yes a few im a surgeonbut it doesnt mean then what it means now i added hastily surgeons in my time dont pull teeth and let blood theyre more like whats meant now by the word physiciana doctor with training in all the fields of medicine but with a specialty special are ye well yeve always been that he said grinning the crippled fingers slid into my palm and his thumb stroked my knuckles what is it a surgeon does thats special then i frowned trying to think of the right phrasing well as best i can put ita surgeon tries to effect healingby means of a knife his long mouth curled upward at the notion a nice contradiction that but it suits ye sassenach it does i said startled he nodded never taking his eyes off my face i could see him studying me closely and wondered selfconsciously what i must look like flushed from lovemaking with my hair in wild disorder ye havena been lovelier sassenach he said smile growing wider as i reached up to smooth my hair he caught my hand and kissed it gently leave your curls be no he said holding my hands trapped while he looked me over no a knife is verra much what you are now i think of it a cleverworked scabbard and most gorgeous to see sassenachhe traced the line of my lips with a finger provoking a smilebut tempered steel for a coreand a wicked sharp edge i do think wicked i said surprised not heartless i dont mean he assured me his eyes rested on my face intent and curious a smile touched his lips no never that but you can be ruthless strong sassenach when the need is on ye i smiled a little wryly i can i said i have seen that in ye before aye his voice grew softer and his grasp on my hand tightened but now i think ye have it much more than when ye were younger youll have needed it often since no i realized quite suddenly why he saw so clearly what frank had never seen at all you have it too i said and youve needed it often unconsciously my fingers touched the jagged scar that crossed his middle finger twisting the distal joints he nodded i have wondered he said so low i could scarcely hear him wondered often if i could call that edge to my service and sheathe it safe again for i have seen a great many men grow hard in that calling and their steel decay to dull iron and i have wondered often was i master in my soul or did i become the slave of my own blade i have thought again and again he went on looking down at our linked handsthat i had drawn my blade too often and spent so long in the service of strife that i wasna fit any longer for human intercourse my lips twitched with the urge to make a remark but i bit them instead he saw it and smiled a little wryly i didna think i should ever laugh again in a womans bed sassenach he said or even come to a woman save as a brute blind with need a note of bitterness came into his voice i lifted his hand and kissed the small scar on the back of it i cant see you as a brute i said i meant it lightly but his face softened as he looked at me and he answered seriously i know that sassenach and it is that ye canna see me so that gives me hope for i amand know itand yet perhaps he trailed off watching me intently you have thatthe strength ye have it and your soul as well so perhaps my own may be saved i had no notion what to say to this and said nothing for a while but only held his hand caressing the twisted fingers and the large hard knuckles it was a warriors handbut he was not a warrior now i turned the hand over and smoothed it on my knee palm up slowly i traced the deep lines and rising hillocks and the tiny letter c at the base of his thumb the brand that marked him mine i knew an old lady in the highlands once who said the lines in your hand dont predict your life they reflect it is that so then his fingers twitched slightly but his palm lay still and open i dont know she said youre born with the lines of your handwith a lifebut then the lines change with the things you do and the person you are i knew nothing about palmistry but i could see one deep line that ran from wrist to midpalm forking several times i think that might be the one they call a lifeline i said see all the forks i suppose that would mean youd changed your life a lot made a lot of choices he snorted briefly but with amusement rather than derision oh aye well thats safe enough to say he peered into his palm leaning over my knee i suppose the first fork would be when i met jack randall and the second when i wed yousee theyre close together there so they are i ran my finger slowly along the line making his fingers twitch slightly as it tickled and culloden maybe would be another perhaps but he did not wish to talk of culloden his own finger moved on and when i went to prison and came back again and came to edinburgh and became a printer i stopped and looked up at him brows raised how on earth did you come to be a printer its the last thing i would have thought of oh that his mouth widened in a smile wellit was an accident aye to start with he had only been looking for a business that would help to conceal and facilitate the smuggling possessed of a sizable sum from a recent profitable venture he had determined to purchase a business whose normal operations involved a large wagon and team of horses and some discreet premises that could be used for the temporary storage of goods in transit carting suggested itself but was rejected precisely because the operations of that business made its practitioners subject to more or less constant scrutiny from the customs likewise the ownership of a tavern or inn while superficially desirable because of the large quantities of supplies brought in was too vulnerable in its legitimate operation to hide an illegitimate one tax collectors and customs agents hung about taverns like fleas on a fat dog i thought of printing when i went to a place to have some notices made up he explained as i was waiting to put in my order i saw the wagon come rumbling up all loaded wi boxes of paper and casks of alcohol for the ink powder and i thought by god thats it for excisemen would never be troubling a place like that it was only after purchasing the shop in carfax close hiring geordie to run the press and actually beginning to fill orders for posters pamphlets folios and books that the other possibilities of his new business had occurred to him it was a man named tom gage he explained he loosed his hand from my grasp growing eager in the telling gesturing and rubbing his hands through his hair as he talked disheveling himself with enthusiasm he brought in small orders for this or thatinnocent stuff all of itbut often and stayed to talk over it taking trouble to talk to me as well as to geordie though he must have seen i knew less about the business than he did himself he smiled at me wryly i didna ken much about printing sassenach but i do ken men it was obvious that gage was exploring the sympathies of alexander malcolm hearing the faint sibilance of jamies highland speech he had prodded delicately mentioning this acquaintance and that whose jacobite sympathies had led them into trouble after the rising picking up the threads of mutual acquaintance skillfully directing the conversation stalking his prey until at last the amused prey had bluntly told him to bring what he wanted made no kings man would hear of it and he trusted you it wasnt a question the only man who had ever trusted jamie fraser in error was charles stuartand in that case the error was jamies he did and so an association was begun strictly business in the beginning but deepening into friendship as time went on jamie had printed all the materials generated by gages small group of radical political writersfrom publicly acknowledged articles to anonymous broadsheets and pamphlets filled with material incriminating enough to get the authors summarily jailed or hanged wed go to the tavern down the street and talk after the printing was done i met a few of toms friends and finally tom said i should write a small piece myself i laughed and told him that with my hand by the time id penned anything that could be read wed all be deadof old age not hanging i was standing by the press as we were talking setting the type wi my left hand not even thinking he just stared at me and then he started to laugh he pointed at the tray and at my hand and went on laughing til he had to sit down on the floor to stop he stretched out his arms in front of him flexing his hands and studying them dispassionately he curled one hand into a fist and bent it slowly up toward his face making the muscles of his arm ripple and swell under the linen im hale enough he said and with luck may be so for a good many years yetbut not forever sassenach i ha fought wi sword and dirk many times but to every warrior comes the day when his strength will fail him he shook his head and stretched out a hand toward his coat which lay on the floor i took these that day wi tom gage to remind me of it he said he took my hand and put into it the things he had taken from his pocket they were cool and hard to the touch small heavy oblongs of lead i didnt need to feel the incised ends to know what the letters on the type slugs were qed i said the english took my sword and dirk away he said softly his finger touched the slugs that lay in my palm but tom gage put a weapon into my hands again and i think i shall not lay it down we walked arm in arm down the cobbled slope of the royal mile at a quarter to five suffused with a glow engendered by several bowls of wellpeppered oyster stew and a bottle of wine shared at intervals during our private communications the city glowed all around us as though sharing our happiness edinburgh lay under a haze that would soon thicken to rain again but for now the light of the setting sun hung gold and pink and red in the clouds and shone in the wet patina of the cobbled street so that the gray stones of the buildings softened and streamed with reflected light echoing the glow that warmed my cheeks and shone in jamies eyes when he looked at me drifting down the street in this state of softheaded selfabsorption it was several minutes before i noticed anything amiss a man impatient of our meandering progress stepped briskly around us and then came to a dead stop just in front of me making me trip on the wet stones and throw a shoe he flung up his head and stared skyward for a moment then hurried off down the street not running but walking as fast as he could go whats the matter with him i said stooping to retrieve my shoe suddenly i noticed that all around us folk were stopping staring up and then starting to rush down the street what do you think i began but when i turned to jamie he too was staring intently upward i looked up too and it took only a moment to see that the red glow in the clouds above was a good deal deeper than the general color of the sunset sky and seemed to flicker in an uneasy fashion most uncharacteristic of sunsets fire he said god i think its in leith wynd at the same moment someone farther down the street raised the cry of fire and as though this official diagnosis had given them leave to run at last the hurrying figures below broke loose and cascaded down the street like a herd of lemmings anxious to fling themselves into the pyre a few saner souls ran upwards past us also shouting fire but presumably with the intent of alerting whatever passed for a fire department jamie was already in motion tugging me along as i hopped awkwardly on one foot rather than stop i kicked the other shoe off and followed him slipping and stubbing my toes on the cold wet cobbles as i ran the fire was not in leith wynd but next door in carfax close the mouth of the close was choked with excited onlookers shoving and craning in an effort to see shouting incoherent questions at one another the smell of smoke struck hot and pungent through the damp evening air and waves of crackling heat beat against my face as i ducked into the close jamie didnt hesitate but plunged into the crowd making a path by main force i pressed close behind him before the human waves could close again and elbowed my way through unable to see anything but jamies broad back ahead of me then we popped out in the front of the crowd and i could see all too well dense clouds of gray smoke rolled out of both the printshops lower windows and i could hear a whispering crackling noise that rose above the noise of the spectators as though the fire were talking to itself my press with a cry of anguish jamie darted up the front step and kicked in the door a cloud of smoke rolled out of the open doorway and engulfed him like a hungry beast i caught a brief glimpse of him staggering from the impact of the smoke then he dropped to his knees and crawled into the building inspired by this example several men from the crowd ran up the steps of the printshop and likewise disappeared into the smokefilled interior the heat was so intense that i felt my skirts blow against my legs with the wind of it and wondered how the men could stand it there inside a fresh outbreak of shouting in the crowd behind me announced the arrival of the town guard armed with buckets obviously accustomed to this task the men flung off their winered uniform coats and began at once to attack the fire smashing the windows and flinging pails of water through them with a fierce abandon meanwhile the crowd swelled its noise augmented by a constant cascade of pattering feet down the many staircases of the close as families on the upper floors of the surrounding buildings hastily ushered hordes of excited children down to safety i couldnt think that the efforts of the bucket brigade valiant as they were would have much effect on what was obviously a fire well underway i was edging back and forth on the pavement trying vainly to see anything moving within when the lead man in the bucket line uttered a startled cry and leaped back just in time to avoid being crowned by a tray of lead type that whizzed through the broken window and landed on the cobbles with a crash scattering slugs in all directions two or three urchins wriggled through the crowd and snatched at the slugs only to be cuffed and driven off by indignant neighbors one plump lady in a kertch and apron darted forward risking life and limb and took custody of the heavy typetray dragging it back to the curb where she crouched protectively over it like a hen on a nest before her companions could scoop up the fallen type though they were driven back by a hail of objects that rained from both windows more type trays roller bars inking pads and bottles of ink which broke on the pavement leaving big spidery blotches that ran into the puddles spilled by the fire fighters encouraged by the draft from the open door and windows the voice of the fire had grown from a whisper into a selfsatisfied chuckling roar prevented from flinging water through the windows by the rain of objects being thrown out of them the leader of the town guard shouted to his men and holding a soaked handkerchief over his nose ducked and ran into the building followed by a halfdozen of his fellows the line quickly reformed full buckets coming hand to hand round the corner from the nearest pump and up the stoop excited lads snatching the empty buckets that bounced down the step to race back with them to the pump for refilling edinburgh is a stone city but with so many buildings crammed cheek by jowl all equipped with multiple hearths and chimneys fire must be still a frequent occurrence evidently so for a fresh commotion behind me betokened the belated arrival of the fire engine the waves of people parted like the red sea to allow passage of the engine drawn by a team of men rather than horses which could not have negotiated the tight quarters of the wynds the engine was a marvel of brass glowing like a coal itself in the reflected flames the heat was becoming more intense i could feel my lungs dry and labor with each gulp of hot air and was terrified for jamie how long could he breathe in that hellish fog of smoke and heat let alone the danger of the flames themselves jesus mary and joseph ian forcing his way through the crowd despite his wooden leg had appeared suddenly by my elbow he grabbed my arm to keep his balance as another rain of objects forced the people around us back again wheres jamie he shouted in my ear in there i bellowed back pointing there was a sudden bustle and commotion at the door of the printshop with a confused shouting that rose even over the sound of the fire several sets of legs appeared shuffling to and fro beneath the emergent plume of smoke that billowed from the door six men emerged jamie among them staggering under the weight of a huge piece of bulky machineryjamies precious printing press they eased it down the step and pushed it well into the crowd then turned back to the printshop too late for any more rescue maneuvers there was a crash from inside a fresh blast of heat that sent the crowd scuttling backward and suddenly the windows of the upper story were lit with dancing flames inside a small stream of men issued from the building coughing and choking some of them crawling blackened with soot and dampened with the sweat of their efforts the engine crew pumped madly but the thick stream of water from their hose made not the slightest impression on the fire ians hand clamped down on my arm like the jaws of a trap ian he shrieked loud enough to be heard above the noises of crowd and fire alike i looked up in the direction of his gaze and saw a wraithlike shape at the secondstory window it seemed to struggle briefly with the sash and then to fall back or be enveloped in the smoke my heart leapt into my mouth there was no telling whether the shape was indeed young ian but it was certainly a human form ian had lost no time in gaping but was stumping toward the door of the printshop with all the speed his leg would allow wait i shouted running after him jamie was leaning on the printing press chest heaving as he tried to catch his breath and thank his assistants at the same time jamie i snatched at his sleeve ruthlessly jerking him away from a redfaced barber who kept excitedly wiping sooty hands on his apron leaving long black streaks among the smears of dried soap and the spots of blood up there i shouted pointing young ians upstairs jamie stepped back swiping a sleeve across his blackened face and stared wildly at the upper windows nothing was to be seen but the roiling shimmer of the fire against the panes ian was struggling in the hands of several neighbors who sought to prevent his entering the shop no man ye canna go in the guard captain cried trying to grasp ians flailing hands the staircase has fallen and the roof will go next despite his stringy build and the handicap of his leg ian was tall and vigorous and the feeble grasp of his wellmeaning town guard captorsmostly retired pensioners from the highland regimentswas no match for his mountainhardened strength reinforced as it was by parental desperation slowly but surely the whole confused mass jerked by inches up the steps of the printshop as ian dragged his wouldbe rescuers with him toward the flames i felt jamie draw breath gulping air as deep as he could with his seared lungs and then he was up the steps as well and had ian round the waist dragging him back come down man he shouted hoarsely yell no managethe stair is gone he glanced round saw me and thrust ian bodily backward offbalance and staggering into my arms hold him he shouted over the roar of the flames ill fetch down the lad with that he turned and dashed up the steps of the adjoining building pushing his way through the patrons of the groundfloor chocolate shop who had emerged onto the pavement to gawk at the excitement pewter cups still clutched in their hands following jamies example i locked my arms tight around ians waist and didnt let go he made an abortive attempt to follow jamie but then stopped and stood rigid in my arms his heart beating wildly just under my cheek dont worry i said pointlessly hell do it hell get him out he will i know he will ian didnt answermight not have heardbut stood still and stiff as a statue in my grasp breath coming harshly with a sound like a sob when i released my hold on his waist he didnt move or turn but when i stood beside him he snatched my hand and held it hard my bones would have ground together had i not been squeezing back just as hard it was no more than a minute before the window above the chocolate shop opened and jamies head and shoulders appeared red hair glowing like a stray tongue of flame escaped from the main fire he climbed out onto the sill and cautiously turned squatting until he faced the building rising to his stockinged feet he grasped the gutter of the roof overhead and pulled slowly raising himself by the strength of his arms long toes scrabbling for a grip in the crevices between the mortared stones of the housefront with a grunt audible even over the sound of fire and crowd he eeled over the edge of the roof and disappeared behind the gable a shorter man could not have managed neither could ian with his wooden leg i heard ian say something under his breath a prayer i thought but when i glanced at him his jaw was clenched face set in lines of fear what in hell is he going to do up there i thought and was unaware that i had spoken aloud until the barber shading his eyes next to me replied theres a trapdoor built in the roof o the printshop maam nay doubt mr malcolm means to gain access to the upper story so is it his prentice up there dye know no ian snapped hearing this its my son the barber shrank back before ians glare murmuring oh aye just so sir just so and crossing himself a shout from the crowd grew into a roar as two figures appeared on the roof of the chocolate shop and ian dropped my hand springing forward jamie had his arm round young ian who was bent and reeling from the smoke he had swallowed it was reasonably obvious that neither of them was going to be able to negotiate a return through the adjoining building in his present condition just then jamie spotted ian below cupping his hand around his mouth he bellowed rope rope there was the town guard had come equipped ian snatched the coil from an approaching guardsman leaving that worthy blinking in indignation and turned to face the house i caught the gleam of jamies teeth as he grinned down at his brotherinlaw and the look of answering wryness on ians face how many times had they thrown a rope between them to raise hay to the barn loft or bind a load to the wagon for carrying the crowd fell back from the whirl of ians arm and the heavy coil flew up in a smooth parabola unwinding as it went landing on jamies outstretched arm with the precision of a bumblebee lighting on a flower jamie hauled in the dangling tail and disappeared momentarily to anchor the rope about the base of the buildings chimney a few precarious moments work and the two smokeblackened figures had come to a safe landing on the pavement below young ian rope slung under his arms and round his chest stood upright for a moment then as the tension of the rope slackened his knees buckled and he slid into a gangling heap on the cobbles are ye all right a bhalaich speak to me ian fell to his knees beside his son anxiously trying to unknot the rope round young ians chest while simultaneously trying to lift up the lads lolling head jamie was leaning against the railing of the chocolate shop black in the face and coughing his lungs out but otherwise apparently unharmed i sat down on the boys other side and took his head on my lap i wasnt sure whether to laugh or cry at the sight of him when i had seen him in the morning he had been an appealinglooking lad if no great beauty with something of his fathers homely goodnatured looks now at evening the thick hair over one side of his forehead had been singed to a bleached red stubble and his eyebrows and lashes had been burned off entirely the skin beneath was the sootsmeared bright pink of a suckling pig just off the spit i felt for a pulse in the spindly neck and found it reassuringly strong his breathing was hoarse and irregular and no wonder i hoped the lining of his lungs had not been burned he coughed long and rackingly and the thin body convulsed on my lap is he all right ians hands instinctively grabbed his son beneath the armpits and sat him up his head wobbled to and fro and he pitched forward into my arms i think so i cant tell for sure the boy was still coughing but not fully conscious i held him against my shoulder like an enormous baby patting his back futilely as he retched and gagged is he all right this time it was jamie squatting breathless alongside me his voice was so hoarse i wouldnt have recognized it roughened as it was by smoke i think so what about you you look like malcolm x i said peering at him over young ians heaving shoulder i do he put a hand to his face looking startled then grinned reassuringly nay i canna say how i look but im no an exmalcolm yet only a wee bit singed round the edges get back get back the guard captain was at my side gray beard bristling with anxiety plucking at my sleeve move yourself maam the roofs going sure enough as we scrambled to safety the roof of the printshop fell in and an awed sound rose from the watching crowd as an enormous fountain of sparks whirled skyward brilliant against the darkening sky as though heaven resented this intrusion the spume of fiery ash was answered by the first pattering of raindrops plopping heavily on the cobbles all around us the edinburghians who surely ought to have been accustomed to rain by now made noises of consternation and began to scuttle back into the surrounding buildings like a herd of cockroaches leaving nature to complete the fire engines work a moment later ian and i were alone with young ian jamie having dispensed money liberally to the guard and other assistants and having arranged for his press and its fittings to be housed in the barbers storeroom trudged wearily toward us hows the lad he asked wiping a hand down his face the rain had begun to come down more heavily and the effect on his sootblackened countenance was picturesque in the extreme ian looked at him and for the first time the anger worry and fear faded somewhat from his countenance he gave jamie a lopsided smile he doesna look a great deal better than ye do yourself manbut i think hell do now give us a hand aye murmuring small gaelic endearments suitable for babies ian bent over his son who was by this time sitting up groggily on the curbstone swaying to and fro like a heron in a high wind by the time we reached madame jeannes establishment young ian could walk though still supported on either side by his father and uncle bruno who opened the door blinked incredulously at the sight and then swung the door open laughing so hard he could barely close it after us i had to admit that we were nothing much to look at wet through and streaming with rain jamie and i were both barefoot and jamies clothes were in rags singed and torn and covered with streaks of soot ians dark hair straggled in his eyes making him look like a drowned rat with a wooden leg young ian though was the focus of attention as multiple heads came popping out of the drawing room in response to the noise bruno was making with his singed hair swollen red face beaky nose and lashless blinking eyes he strongly resembled the fledgling young of some exotic bird speciesa newly hatched flamingo perhaps his face could scarcely grow redder but the back of his neck flamed crimson as the sound of feminine giggles followed us up the stairs safely ensconced in the small upstairs sitting room with the door closed ian turned to face his hapless offspring going to live are ye ye wee bugger he demanded aye sir young ian replied in a dismal croak looking rather as though he wished the answer were no good his father said grimly dye want to explain yourself or shall i just belt hell out of ye now and save us both time ye canna thrash someone whos just had his eyebrows burnt off ian jamie protested hoarsely pouring out a glass of porter from the decanter on the table it wouldna be humane he grinned at his nephew and handed him the glass which the boy clutched with alacrity aye well perhaps not ian agreed surveying his son one corner of his mouth twitched young ian was a pitiable sight he was also an extremely funny one that doesna mean ye arent going to get your arse blistered later mind he warned the boy and thats besides whatever your mother means to do to ye when she sees ye again but for now lad take your ease not noticeably reassured by the magnanimous tone of this last statement young ian didnt answer but sought refuge in the depths of his glass of porter i took my own glass with a good deal of pleasure i had realized belatedly just why the citizens of edinburgh reacted to rain with such repugnance once one was wet through it was the devil to get dry again in the damp confines of a stone house with no change of clothes and no heat available but a small hearthfire i plucked the damp bodice away from my breasts caught young ians interested glance and decided regretfully that i really couldnt take it off with the boy in the room jamie seemed to have been corrupting the lad to quite a sufficient extent already i gulped the porter instead feeling the rich flavor purl warmingly through my innards dye feel well enough to talk a bit lad jamie sat down opposite his nephew next to ian on the hassock ayei think so young ian croaked cautiously he cleared his throat like a bullfrog and repeated more firmly aye i can good well then first how did ye come to be in the printshop and then how did it come to be on fire young ian pondered that one for a minute then took another gulp of his porter for courage and said i set it jamie and ian both sat up straight at that i could see jamie revising his opinion as to the advisability of thrashing people without eyebrows but he mastered his temper with an obvious effort and said merely why the boy took another gulp of porter coughed and drank again apparently trying to decide what to say well he began uncertainly there was a man and came to a dead stop a man jamie prompted patiently when his nephew showed signs of having become suddenly deaf and dumb what man young ian clutched his glass in both hands looking deeply unhappy answer your uncle this minute clot ian said sharply or ill take ye across my knee and tan ye right here with a mixture of similar threats and promptings the two men managed to extract a more or less coherent story from the boy young ian had been at the tavern at kerse that morning where he had been told to meet wally who would come down from the rendezvous with the wagons of brandy there to load the punked casks and spoiled wine to be used as subterfuge told ian asked sharply who told ye i did jamie said before young ian could speak he waved a hand at his brotherinlaw urging silence aye i kent he was here well talk about it later ian if ye please its important we know what happened today ian glared at jamie and opened his mouth to disagree then shut it with a snap he nodded to his son to go on i was hungry ye see young ian said when are ye not his father and uncle said together in perfect unison they looked at each other snorted with sudden laughter and the strained atmosphere in the room eased slightly so ye went into the tavern to have a bite jamie said thats all right lad no harm done and what happened while ye were there that it transpired was where he had seen the man a small rattylooking fellow with a seamans pigtail and a blind eye talking to the landlord he was askin for you uncle jamie young ian said growing easier in his speech with repeated applications of porter by your own name jamie started looking surprised jamie fraser ye mean young ian nodded sipping aye but he knew your other name as welljamie roy i mean jamie roy ian turned a puzzled glance on his brotherinlaw who shrugged impatiently its how im known on the docks christ ian ye know what i do aye i do but i didna ken the wee laddie was helpin ye to do it ians thin lips pressed tight together and he turned his attention back to his son go on lad i willna interrupt ye again the seaman had asked the tavernkeeper how best an old seadog down on his luck and looking for employment might find one jamie fraser who was known to have a use for able men the landlord pleading ignorance of that name the seaman had leaned closer pushed a coin across the table and in a lowered voice asked whether the name jamie roy was more familiar the landlord remaining deaf as an adder the seaman had soon left the tavern with young ian right behind him i thought as how maybe it would be good to know who he was and what he meant the lad explained blinking ye might have thought to leave word wi the publican for wally jamie said still thats neither here nor there where did he go down the road at a brisk walk but not so brisk that a healthy boy could not follow at a careful distance an accomplished walker the seaman had made his way into edinburgh a distance of some five miles in less than an hour and arrived at last at the green owl tavern followed by young ian near wilted with thirst from the walk i started at the name but didnt say anything not wanting to interrupt the story it was terrible crowded the lad reported something happened in the morning and everyone was talking of itbut they shut up whenever they saw me anyway it was the same there he paused to cough and clear his throat the seaman ordered drinkbrandythen asked the landlord was he acquainted wi a supplier of brandy named jamie roy or jamie fraser did he then jamie murmured his gaze was intent on his nephew but i could see the thoughts working behind his high forehead making a small crease between his thick brows the man had gone methodically from tavern to tavern dogged by his faithful shadow and in each establishment had ordered brandy and repeated his question he must have a rare head to be drinkin that much brandy ian remarked young ian shook his head he didna drink it he only smelt it his father clicked his tongue at such a scandalous waste of good spirit but jamies red brows climbed still higher did he taste any of it he asked sharply aye at the dog and gun and again at the blue boar he had nay more than a wee taste though and then left the glass untouched he didna drink at all at the other places and we went to five o them before he trailed off and took another drink jamies face underwent an astonishing transformation from an expression of frowning puzzlement his face went completely blank and then resolved itself into an expression of revelation is that so now he said softly to himself indeed his attention came back to his nephew and then what happened lad young ian was beginning to look unhappy again he gulped the tremor visible all the way down his skinny neck well it was a terrible long way from kerse to edinburgh he began and a terrible dry walk too his father and uncle exchanged jaundiced glances ye drank too much jamie said resigned well i didna ken he was going to so many taverns now did i young ian cried in selfdefense going pink in the ears no of course not lad jamie said kindly smothering the beginning of ians more censorious remarks how long did ye last until midway down the royal mile it turned out where young ian overcome by the cumulation of early rising a fivemile walk and the effects of something like two quarts of ale had dozed off in a corner waking an hour later to find his quarry long gone so i came here he explained i thought as how uncle jamie should know about it but he wasna here the boy glanced at me and his ears grew still pinker and just why did ye think he should be here ian favored his offspring with a gimlet eye which then swiveled to his brotherinlaw the simmering anger ian had been holding in check since the morning suddenly erupted the filthy gall of ye jamie fraser takin my son to a bawdy house a fine one you are to talk da young ian was on his feet swaying a bit but with his big bony hands clenched at his sides me and what dye mean by that ye wee gomerel ian cried his eyes going wide with outrage i mean youre a damned hypocrite his son shouted hoarsely preachin to me and michael about purity and keepin to one woman and all the time yere slinkin about the city sniffin after whores what ians face had gone entirely purple i looked in some alarm to jamie who appeared to be finding something funny in the present situation youre aagoddamned whited sepulchre young ian came up with the simile triumphantly then paused as though trying to think of another to equal it his mouth opened though nothing emerged but a soft belch that boy is rather drunk i said to jamie he picked up the decanter of porter eyed the level within and set it down youre right he said i should ha noticed sooner but its hard to tell scorched as he is the elder ian wasnt drunk but his expression strongly resembled his offsprings what with the suffused countenance popping eyes and straining neck cords what the bloody stinking hell dye mean by that ye whelp he shouted he moved menacingly toward young ian who took an involuntary step backward and sat down quite suddenly as his calves met the edge of the sofa her he said startled into monosyllables he pointed at me to make it clear her you deceivin my mam wi this filthy whore thats what i mean ian fetched his son a clout over the ear that knocked him sprawling on the sofa ye great clot he said scandalized a fine way to speak o your auntie claire to say nothing o me and your mam aunt young ian gawped at me from the cushions looking so like a nestling begging for food that i burst out laughing despite myself you left before i could introduce myself this morning i said but youre dead he said stupidly not yet i assured him unless ive caught pneumonia from sitting here in a damp dress his eyes had grown perfectly round as he stared at me now a fugitive gleam of excitement came into them some o the auld women at lallybroch say ye were a wisewomana white lady or maybe even a fairy when uncle jamie came home from culloden without ye they said as how yed maybe gone back to the fairies where ye maybe came from is that true dye live in a dun i exchanged a glance with jamie who rolled his eyes toward the ceiling no i said ier i she escaped to france after culloden ian broke in suddenly with great firmness she thought your uncle jamie was killed in the battle so she went to her kin in france shed been one of prince tearlachs particular friendsshe couldna come back to scotland after the war without puttin herself in sore danger but then she heard of your uncle and as soon as she kent that her husband wasna deid after all she took ship at once and came to find him young ians mouth hung open slightly so did mine er yes i said closing it thats what happened the lad turned large shining eyes from me to his uncle so yeve come back to him he said happily god thats romantic the tension of the moment was broken ian hesitated but his eyes softened as he looked from jamie to me aye he said and smiled reluctantly aye i suppose it is i didna expect to be doing this for him for a good two or three years yet jamie remarked holding his nephews head with an expert hand as young ian retched painfully into the spittoon i was holding aye well hes always been forward ian answered resignedly learnt to walk before he could stand and was forever tumblin into the fire or the washpot or the pigpen or the cowbyre he patted the skinny heaving back there lad let it come a little more and the lad was deposited in a wilted heap on the sofa there to recover from the effects of smoke emotion and too much porter under the censoriously mingled gaze of uncle and father wheres that damn tea i sent for jamie reached impatiently for the bell but i stopped him the brothels domestic arrangements were evidently still disarranged from the excitements of the morning dont bother i said ill go down and fetch it i scooped up the spittoon and carried it out with me at arms length hearing ian say behind me in a reasonable tone of voice look fool i found my way to the kitchen with no difficulty and obtained the necessary supplies i hoped jamie and ian would give the boy a few minutes respite not only for his own sake but so that i would miss nothing of his story i had clearly missed something when i returned to the small sitting room an air of constraint hung over the room like a cloud and young ian glanced up and then quickly away to avoid my eye jamie was his usual imperturbable self but the elder ian looked almost as flushed and uneasy as his son he hurried forward to take the tray from me murmuring thanks but would not meet my eye i raised one eyebrow at jamie who gave me a slight smile and a shrug i shrugged back and picked up one of the bowls on the tray bread and milk i said handing it to young ian who at once looked happier hot tea i said handing the pot to his father whisky i said handing the bottle to jamie and cold tea for the burns i whisked the lid off the last bowl in which a number of napkins were soaking in cold tea cold tea jamies ruddy brows lifted did the cook have no butter you dont put butter on burns i told him aloe juice or the juice of a plantain or plantago but the cook didnt have any of that cold tea is the best we could manage i poulticed young ians blistered hands and forearms and blotted his scarlet face gently with the teasoaked napkins while jamie and ian did the honors with teapot and whisky bottle after which we all sat down somewhat restored to hear the rest of ians story well he began i walked about the city for a bit tryin to think what best to do and finally my head cleared a bit and i reasoned that if the man id been following was goin from tavern to tavern down the high street if i went to the other end and started up the street i could maybe find him that way that was a bright thought jamie said and ian nodded approvingly the frown lifting a bit from his face did ye find him young ian nodded slurping a bit i did then running down the royal mile nearly to the palace of holyrood at the foot he had toiled his way painstakingly up the street stopping at each tavern to inquire for the man with the pigtail and one eye there was no word of his quarry anywhere below the canongate and he was beginning to despair of his idea when suddenly he had seen the man himself sitting in the taproom of the holyrood brewery presumably this stop was for respite rather than information for the seaman was sitting at his ease drinking beer young ian had darted behind a hogshead in the yard and remained there watching until at length the man rose paid his score and made his leisurely way outside he didna go to any more taverns the boy reported wiping a stray drop of milk off his chin he went straight to carfax close to the printshop jamie said something in gaelic under his breath did he and what then well he found the shop shut up of course when he saw the door was locked he looked careful like up at the windows as though he was maybe thinking of breaking in but then i saw him look about at all the folk coming and goingit was a busy time of day wi all the folk coming to the chocolate shop so he stood on the stoop a moment thinking and then he set off back up the closei had to duck into the tailors shop on the corner so as not to be seen the man had paused at the entrance of the close then making up his mind had turned to the right gone down a few paces and disappeared into a small alley i kent as how the alley led up to the court at the back of the close young ian explained so i saw at once what he meant to be doing theres a wee court at the back of the close jamie explained seeing my puzzled look its for rubbish and deliveries and suchbut theres a back door out of the printshop opens onto it young ian nodded putting down his empty bowl aye i thought it must be that he meant to get into the place and i thought of the new pamphlets jesus jamie said he looked a little pale pamphlets ian raised his brows at jamie what kind of pamphlets the new printing for mr gage young ian explained ian still looked as blank as i felt politics jamie said bluntly an argument for repeal of the last stamp actwith an exhortation to civil oppositionby violence if necessary five thousand of them freshprinted stacked in the back room gage was to come round and get them in the morning tomorrow jesus ian said he had gone even paler than jamie at whom he stared in a sort of mingled horror and awe have ye gone straight out o your mind he inquired you wi not an inch on your back unscarred wi the ink scarce dry on your pardon for treason youre mixed up wi tom gage and his seditious society and got my son involved as well his voice had been rising throughout and now he sprang to his feet fists clenched how could ye do such a thing jamiehow have we not suffered enough for your actions jenny and me all through the war and afterchrist id think youd have your fill of prisons and blood and violence i have jamie said shortly im no part of gages group but my business is printing aye he paid for those pamphlets ian threw up his hands in a gesture of vast irritation oh aye and that will mean a great deal when the crowns agents arrest ye and take ye to london to be hangit if those things were to be found on your premises struck by a sudden thought he stopped and turned to his son oh that was it he asked ye kent what those pamphlets werethats why ye set them on fire young ian nodded solemn as a young owl i couldna move them in time he said not five thousand the manthe seamanhed broke out the back window and he was reachin in for the doorlatch ian whirled back to face jamie damn you he said violently damn ye for a reckless harebrained fool jamie fraser first the jacobites and now this jamie had flushed up at once at ians words and his face grew darker at this am i to blame for charles stuart he said his eyes flashed angrily and he set his teacup down with a thump that sloshed tea and whisky over the polished tabletop did i not try all i could to stop the wee fool did i not give up everything in that fighteverything ian my land my freedom my wifeto try to save us all he glanced at me briefly as he spoke and i caught one very small quick glimpse of just what the last twenty years had cost him he turned back to ian his brows lowering as he went on voice growing hard and as for what ive cost your familywhat have ye profited ian lallybroch belongs to wee james now no to your son not mine ian flinched at that i never asked he began no ye didnt im no accusing ye for gods sake but the facts therelallybrochs no mine anymore is it my father left it to me and i cared for it as best i couldtook care o the land and the tenantsand ye helped me ian his voice softened a bit i couldna have managed without you and jenny i dinna begrudge deeding it to young jamieit had to be done but still he turned away for a moment head bowed broad shoulders knotted tight beneath the linen of his shirt i was afraid to move or speak but i caught young ians eye filled with infinite distress i put a hand on his skinny shoulder for mutual reassurance and felt the steady pounding of the pulse in the tender flesh above his collarbone he set his big bony paw on my hand and held on tight jamie turned back to his brotherinlaw struggling to keep his voice and temper under control i swear to ye ian i didna let the lad be put in danger i kept him out of the way so much as i possibly coulddidna let the shoremen see him or let him go out on the boats wi fergus hard as he begged me he glanced at young ian and his expression changed to an odd mixture of affection and irritation i didna ask him to come to me ian and i told him he must go home again ye didna make him go though did you the angry color was fading from ians face but his soft brown eyes were still narrow and bright with fury and ye didna send word either for gods sake jamie jenny hasna slept at night anytime this month jamies lips pressed tight no he said letting the words escape one at a time no i didnt i he glanced at the boy again and shrugged uncomfortably as though his shirt had grown suddenly too tight no he said again i meant to take him home myself hes old enough to travel by himself ian said shortly he got here alone no aye it wasna that jamie turned aside restlessly picking up a teacup and rolling it to and fro between his palms no i meant to take him so that i could ask your permissionyours and jennysfor the lad to come live wi me for a time ian uttered a short sarcastic laugh oh aye give our permission for him to be hangit or transported alongside you eh the anger flashed across jamies features again as he looked up from the cup in his hands ye know i wouldna let any harm come to him he said for christs sake ian i care for the lad as though he were my own son and well ye ken it too ians breath was coming fast i could hear it from my place behind the sofa oh i ken it well enough he said staring hard into jamies face but hes not your son aye hes mine jamie stared back for a long moment then reached out and gently set the teacup back on the table aye he said quietly he is ian stood for a moment breathing hard then wiped a hand carelessly across his forehead pushing back the thick dark hair well then he said he took one or two deep breaths and turned to his son come along then he said ive a room at hallidays young ians bony fingers tightened on mine his throat worked but he didnt move to rise from his seat no da he said his voice quivered and he blinked hard not to cry im no going wi ye ians face went quite pale with a deep red patch over the angular cheekbones as though someone had slapped him hard on both cheeks is that so he said young ian nodded swallowing iill go wi ye in the morning da ill go home wi ye but not now ian looked at his son for a long moment without speaking then his shoulders slumped and all the tension went out of his body i see he said quietly well then well without another word he turned and left closing the door very carefully behind him i could hear the awkward thump of his wooden leg on each step as he made his way down the stair there was a brief sound of shuffling as he reached the bottom then brunos voice in farewell and the thud of the main door shutting and then there was no sound in the room but the hiss of the hearthfire behind me the boys shoulder was shaking under my hand and he was holding tighter than ever to my fingers crying without making a sound jamie came slowly to sit beside him his face full of troubled helplessness ian oh wee ian he said christ laddie ye shouldna have done that i had to ian gasped and gave a sudden snuffle and i realized that he had been holding his breath he turned a scorched countenance on his uncle raw features contorted in anguish i didna want to hurt da he said i didnt jamie patted his knee absently i know laddie he said but to say such a thing to him i couldna tell him though and i had to tell you uncle jamie jamie glanced up suddenly alert at his nephews tone tell me tell me what the man the man wi the pigtail what about him young ian licked his lips steeling himself i think i kilt him he whispered startled jamie glanced at me then back at young ian how he asked welli lied a bit ian began voice trembling the tears were still welling in his eyes but he brushed them aside when i went into the printshopi had the key ye gave methe man was already inside the seaman had been in the backmost room of the shop where the stacks of newly printed orders were kept along with the stocks of fresh ink the blotting papers used to clean the press and the small forge where worn slugs were melted down and recast into fresh type he was taking some o the pamphlets from the stack and putting them inside his jacket ian said gulping when i saw him i screeched at him to put them back and he whirled round at me wi a pistol in his hand the pistol had discharged scaring young ian badly but the ball had gone wild little daunted the seaman had rushed at the boy raising the pistol to club him instead there was no time to run or to think he said he had let go my hand by now and his fingers twisted together upon his knee i reached out for the first thing to hand and threw it the first thing to hand had been the leaddipper the longhandled copper ladle used to pour molten lead from the melting pot into the casting molds the forge had been still alight though wellbanked and while the melting pot held no more than a small puddle the scalding drops of lead had flown from the dipper into the seamans face god how he screamed a strong shudder ran through young ians slender frame and i came round the end of the sofa to sit next to him and take both his hands the seaman had reeled backward clawing at his face and upset the small forge knocking live coals everywhere that was what started the fire the boy said i tried to beat it out but it caught the edge of the fresh paper and all of a sudden something went whoosh in my face and it was as though the whole room was alight the barrels of ink i suppose jamie said as though to himself the powders dissolved in alcohol the sliding piles of flaming paper fell between young ian and the back door a wall of flame that billowed black smoke and threatened to collapse upon him the seaman blinded and screaming like a banshee had been on his hands and knees between the boy and the door into the front room of the printshop and safety ii couldna bear to touch him to push him out o the way he said shuddering again losing his head completely he had run up the stairs instead but then found himself trapped as the flames racing through the back room and drawing up the stair like a chimney rapidly filled the upper room with blinding smoke did ye not think to climb out the trapdoor onto the roof jamie asked young ian shook his head miserably i didna ken it was there why was it there i asked curiously jamie gave me the flicker of a smile in case of need its a foolish fox has but one exit to his bolthole though i must say it wasna fire i was thinking of when i had it made he shook his head ridding himself of the distraction but ye think the man didna escape the fire he asked i dinna see how he could young ian answered beginning to sniffle again and if hes dead then i killed him i couldna tell da i was a mmurmur he was crying again too hard to get the word out youre no a murderer ian jamie said firmly he patted his nephews shaking shoulder stop now its all rightye havena done wrong laddie ye havent dye hear the boy gulped and nodded but couldnt stop crying or shaking at last i put my arms around him turned him and pulled his head down onto my shoulder patting his back and making the sort of small soothing noises one makes to little children he felt very odd in my arms nearly as big as a fullgrown man but with fine light bones and so little flesh on them that it was like holding a skeleton he was talking into the depths of my bosom his voice so disjointed by emotion and muffled by fabric that it was difficult to make out the words mortal sin he seemed to be saying damned to hellcouldna tell daafraidcanna go home ever jamie raised his brows at me but i only shrugged helplessly smoothing the thick bushy hair on the back of the boys head at last jamie leaned forward took him firmly by the shoulders and sat him up look ye ian he said no looklook at me by dint of supreme effort the boy straightened his drooping neck and fixed brimming redrimmed eyes on his uncles face now then jamie took hold of his nephews hands and squeezed them lightly firstits no a sin to kill a man thats trying to kill you the church allows ye to kill if ye must in defense of yourself your family or your country so ye havena committed mortal sin and youre no damned im not young ian sniffed mightily and mopped at his face with a sleeve no youre not jamie let the hint of a smile show in his eyes well go together and call on father hayes in the morning and yell make your confession and be absolved then but hell tell ye the same as i have oh the syllable held profound relief and young ians scrawny shoulders rose perceptibly as though a burden had rolled off of them jamie patted his nephews knee again for the second thing ye needna fear telling your father no young ian had accepted jamies word on the state of his soul without hesitation but sounded profoundly dubious about this secular opinion well ill not say hell no be upset jamie added fairly in fact i expect it will turn the rest of his hair white on the spot but hell understand he isna going to cast ye out or disown ye if thats what youre scairt of you think hell understand young ian looked at jamie with eyes in which hope battled with doubt ii didna think hehas my da ever killed a man he asked suddenly jamie blinked taken aback by the question well he said slowly i supposei mean hes fought in battle but ito tell ye the truth ian i dinna ken he looked a little helplessly at his nephew its no the sort of thing men talk much about aye except sometimes soldiers when theyre deep in drink young ian nodded absorbing this and sniffed again with a horrid gurgling noise jamie groping hastily in his sleeve for a handkerchief looked up suddenly struck by a thought thats why ye said ye must tell me but not your da because ye knew ive killed men before his nephew nodded searching jamies face with troubled trusting eyes aye i thoughti thought yed know what to do ah jamie drew a deep breath and exchanged a glance with me well his shoulders braced and broadened and i could see him accept the burden young ian had laid down he sighed what ye do he said is first to ask yourself if ye had a choice you didnt so put your mind at ease then ye go to confession if ye can if not say a good act of contritionthats good enough when its no a mortal sin ye harbor no fault mind he said earnestly but the contrition is because ye greatly regret the necessity that fell on ye it does sometimes and theres no preventing it and then say a prayer for the soul of the one youve killed he went on that he may find rest and not haunt ye ye ken the prayer called soul peace use that one if ye have leisure to think of it in a battle when there is no time use soul leadingbe this soul on thine arm o christ thou king of the city of heaven amen be this soul on thine arm o christ thou king of the city of heaven amen young ian repeated under his breath he nodded slowly aye all right and then jamie reached out and touched his nephews cheek with great gentleness then ye live with it laddie he said softly thats all virtues guardian you think the man young ian followed has something to do with sir percivals warning i lifted a cover on the supper tray that had just been delivered and sniffed appreciatively it seemed a very long time since moubrays stew jamie nodded picking up a sort of hot stuffed roll i should be surprised if he had not he said dryly while theres likely more than one man willing to do me harm i canna think it likely that gangs o them are roaming about edinburgh he took a bite and chewed industriously shaking his head nay thats clear enough and nothing to be greatly worrit over its not i took a small bite of my own roll then a bigger one this is delicious what is it jamie lowered the roll he had been about to take a bite of and squinted at it pigeon minced wi truffles he said and stuffed it into his mouth whole no he said and paused to swallow no he said again more clearly thats likely just a matter of a rival smuggler there are two gangs that ive had a wee bit of difficulty with now and then he waved a hand scattering crumbs and reached for another roll the way the man behavedsmellin the brandy but seldom tasting ithe may be a dégustateur de vin someone that can tell from a sniff where a wine was made and from a taste which year it was bottled a verra valuable fellow he added thoughtfully and a choice hound to set on my trail wine had come along with the supper i poured out a glass and passed it under my own nose he could track youyou personallythrough the brandy i asked curiously more or less youll remember my cousin jared of course i do you mean hes still alive after the slaughter of culloden and the erosions of its aftermath it was wonderfully heartening to hear that jared a wealthy scottish émigré with a prosperous wine business in paris was still among the quick and not the dead i expect theyll have to head him up in a cask and toss him into the seine to get rid of him jamie said teeth gleaming white in his sootstained countenance aye hes not only alive but enjoying it where dye think i get the french brandy i bring into scotland the obvious answer was france but i refrained from saying so jared i suppose i said instead jamie nodded mouth full of another roll hey he leaned forward and snatched the plate out from under the tentative reach of young ians skinny fingers youre no supposed to be eating rich stuff like that when your wames curdled he said frowning and chewing he swallowed and licked his lips ill call for more bread and milk for ye but uncle said young ian looking longingly at the savory rolls im awfully hungry purged by confession the boy had recovered his spirits considerably and evidently his appetite as well jamie looked at his nephew and sighed aye well ye swear youre no going to vomit on me no uncle young ian said meekly all right then jamie shoved the plate in the boys direction and returned to his explanation jared sends me mostly the secondquality bottling from his own vineyards in the moselle keepin the first quality for sale in france where they can tell the difference so the stuff you bring into scotland is identifiable he shrugged reaching for the wine only to a nez a dégustateur that is but the fact is that wee ian here saw the man taste the wine at the dog and gun and at the blue boar and those are the two taverns on the high street that buy brandy from me exclusively several others buy from me but from others as well in any case as i say im none so concerned at havin someone look for jamie roy at a tavern he lifted his wineglass and passed it under his own nose by reflex made a slight unconscious face and drank no he said lowering the glass what worries me is that the man should have found his way to the printshop for ive taken considerable pains to make sure that the folk who see jamie roy on the docks at burntisland are not the same ones who pass the time o day in the high street with mr alec malcolm the printer i knitted my brows trying to work it out but sir percival called you malcolm and he knows youre a smuggler i protested jamie nodded patiently half the men in the ports near edinburgh are smugglers sassenach he said aye sir percival kens fine im a smuggler but he doesna ken im jamie roylet alone james fraser he thinks i bring in bolts of undeclared silk and velvet from hollandbecause thats what i pay him in he smiled wryly i trade brandy for them to the tailor on the corner sir percivals an eye for fine cloth and his lady even more but he doesna ken ive to do wi the liquorlet alone how muchor hed be wanting a great deal more than the odd bit of lace and yardage ill tell ye could one of the tavern owners have told the seaman about you surely theyve seen you he ruffled a hand through his hair as he did when thinking making a few short hairs on the crown stand up in a whorl of tiny spikes aye theyve seen me he said slowly but only as a customer fergus handles the business dealings wi the tavernsand fergus is careful never to go near the printshop he always meets me here in private he gave me a crooked grin no one questions a mans reasons for visiting a brothel aye could that be it i asked struck by a sudden thought any man can come here without question could the seaman young ian followed have seen you hereyou and fergus or heard your description from one of the girls after all youre not the most inconspicuous man ive ever seen he wasnt either while there might be any number of redheaded men in edinburgh few of them towered to jamies height and fewer still strode the streets with the unconscious arrogance of a disarmed warrior thats a verra useful thought sassenach he said giving me a nod it will be easy enough to find out whether a pigtailed seaman with one eye has been here recently ill have jeanne ask among her lassies he stood up and stretched rackingly his hands nearly touching the wooden rafters and then sassenach perhaps well go to bed aye he lowered his arms and blinked at me with a smile what wi one thing and another its been the bloody hell of a day no it has rather i said smiling back jeanne summoned for instructions arrived together with fergus who opened the door for the madam with the easy familiarity of a brother or cousin little wonder if he felt at home i supposed he had been born in a paris brothel and spent the first ten years of his life there sleeping in a cupboard beneath the stairs when not making a living by picking pockets on the street the brandy is gone he reported to jamie i have sold it to macalpineat a small sacrifice in price i regret milord i thought a quick sale the best better to have it off the premises jamie said nodding what have ye done wi the body fergus smiled briefly his lean face and dark forelock lending him a distinctly piratical air our intruder also has gone to macalpines tavern milordsuitably disguised as what i demanded the pirates grin turned on me fergus had turned out a very handsome man the disfigurement of his hook notwithstanding as a cask of crème de menthe milady he said i do not suppose anyone has drunk crème de menthe in edinburgh any time in the last hundred years observed madame jeanne the heathen scots are not accustomed to the use of civilized liqueurs i have never seen a customer here take anything beyond whisky beer or brandywine exactly madame fergus said nodding we do not want mr macalpines tapmen broaching the cask do we surely somebodys going to look in that cask sooner or later i said not to be indelicate but exactly milady fergus said with a respectful bow to me though crème de menthe has a very high content of alcohol the taverns cellar is but a temporary resting place on our unknown friends journey to his eternal rest he goes to the docks tomorrow and thence to somewhere quite far away it is only that i did not want him cluttering up madame jeannes premises in the meantime jeanne addressed a remark in french to st agnes that i didnt quite catch but then shrugged and turned to go i will make inquiries of les filles concerning this seaman tomorrow monsieur when they are at leisure for now for now speaking of leisure fergus interrupted might mademoiselle sophie find herself unemployed this evening the madam favored him with a look of ironic amusement since she saw you come in mon petit saucisse i expect that she has kept herself available she glanced at young ian slouched against the cushions like a scarecrow from which all the straw stuffing has been removed and will i find a place for the young gentleman to sleep oh aye jamie looked consideringly at his nephew i suppose ye can lay a pallet in my room oh no young ian blurted youll want to be alone wi your wife will ye not uncle what jamie stared at him uncomprehendingly well i mean young ian hesitated glancing at me and then hastily away i mean nay doubt youll be wanting toermmphm a highlander born he managed to infuse this last noise with an amazing wealth of implied indelicacy jamie rubbed his knuckles hard across his upper lip well thats verra thoughtful of ye ian he said his voice quivered slightly with the effort of not laughing and im flattered that ye have such a high opinion of my virility as to think im capable of anything but sleeping in bed after a day like this but i think perhaps i can forgo the satisfaction of my carnal desires for one nightfond as i am of your auntie he added giving me a faint grin but bruno tells me the establishment is not busy tonight fergus put in glancing round in some bewilderment why does the boy not because hes no but fourteen for gods sake jamie said scandalized almost fifteen young ian corrected sitting up and looking interested well that is certainly sufficient fergus said with a glance at madame jeanne for confirmation your brothers were no older when i first brought them here and they acquitted themselves honorably you what jamie goggled at his protégé well someone had to fergus said with slight impatience normally a boys fatherbut of course le monsieur is notmeaning no disrespect to your esteemed father of course he added with a nod to young ian who nodded back like a mechanical toy but it is a matter for experienced judgment you understand nowhe turned to madame jeanne with the air of a gourmand consulting the wine stewarddorcas do you think or penelope no no she said shaking her head decidedly it should be the second mary absolutely the small one oh with the yellow hair yes i think you are right fergus said approvingly fetch her then jeanne was off before jamie could manage more than a strangled croak in protest butbutthe lad canna he began yes i can young ian said at least i think i can it wasnt possible for his face to grow any redder but his ears were crimson with excitement the traumatic events of the day completely forgotten but itsthat is to sayi canna be letting ye jamie broke off and stood glaring at his nephew for a long moment finally he threw his hands up in the air in exasperated defeat and what am i to say to your mother he demanded as the door opened behind him framed in the door stood a very short young girl plump and soft as a partridge in her blue silk chemise her round sweet face beaming beneath a loose cloud of yellow hair at the sight of her young ian froze scarcely breathing when at last he must draw breath or die he drew it and turned to jamie with a smile of surpassing sweetness he said well uncle jamie if i were youhis voice soared up in a sudden alarming soprano and he stopped clearing his throat before resuming in a respectable baritonei wouldna tell her good night to ye auntie he said and walked purposefully forward i canna decide whether i must kill fergus or thank him jamie was sitting on the bed in our attic room slowly unbuttoning his shirt i laid the damp dress over the stool and knelt down in front of him to unbuckle the knee buckles of his breeches i suppose he was trying to do his best for young ian ayein his bloody immoral french way jamie reached back to untie the lace that held his hair back he had not plaited it again when we left moubrays and it fell soft and loose on his shoulders framing the broad cheekbones and long straight nose so that he looked like one of the fiercer italian angels of the renaissance was it the archangel michael who drove adam and eve out of the garden of eden i asked stripping off his stockings he gave a slight chuckle do i strike ye soas the guardian o virtue and fergus as the wicked serpent his hands came under my elbows as he bent to lift me up get up sassenach ye shouldna be on your knees serving me youve had rather a time of it today yourself i answered making him stand up with me even if you didnt have to kill anyone there were large blisters on his hands and while he had wiped away most of the soot there was still a streak down the side of his jaw mm my hands went around his waist to help with the waistband of his breeches but he held them there resting his cheek for a moment against the top of my head i wasna quite honest wi the lad ye ken he said no i thought you did wonderfully with him he felt better after he talked to you at least aye i hope so and may be the prayers and such will helpthey canna hurt him at least but i didna tell him everything what else is there i tilted up my face to his touching his lips softly with my own he smelled of smoke and sweat what a man most often does when hes soulsick wi killing is to find a woman sassenach he answered softly his own if he can another if he must for she can do what he cannotand heal him my fingers found the lacing of his fly it came loose with a tug thats why you let him go with the second mary he shrugged and stepping back a pace pushed the breeches down and off i couldna stop him and i think perhaps i was right to let him young as he is he smiled crookedly at me at least hell not be fashing and fretting himself over that seaman tonight i dont imagine so and what about you i pulled the chemise off over my head me he stared down at me eyebrows raised the grimy linen shirt hanging loose upon his shoulders i glanced behind him at the bed yes you havent killed anyone but do you want tommphm i met his gaze raising my own brows in question the smile broadened across his face and any resemblance to michael stern guardian of virtue vanished he lifted one shoulder then the other and let them fall and the shirt slid down his arms to the floor i expect i do he said but youll be gentle wi me aye cullodens last victim in the morning i saw jamie and ian off on their pious errand and then set off myself stopping to purchase a large wicker basket from a vendor in the street it was time i began to equip myself again with whatever i could find in the way of medical supplies after the events of the preceding day i was beginning to fear i would have need of them before long haughs apothecary shop hadnt changed at all through english occupation scottish rising and the stuarts fall and my heart rose in delight as i stepped through the door into the rich familiar smells of hartshorn peppermint almond oil and anise the man behind the counter was haugh but a much younger haugh than the middleaged man i had dealt with twenty years before when i had patronized this shop for tidbits of military intelligence as well as for nostrums and herbs the younger haugh did not know me of course but went courteously about the business of finding the herbs i wanted among the neatly ranged jars on his shelves a good many were commonrosemary tansy marigoldbut a few on my list made the young haughs ginger eyebrows rise and his lips purse in thoughtfulness as he looked over the jars there was another customer in the shop hovering near the counter where tonics were dispensed and compounds ground to order he strode back and forth hands clasped behind his back obviously impatient after a moment he came up to the counter how long he snapped at mr haughs back i canna just say reverend the apothecarys voice was apologetic louisa did say as twould need to be boiled the only reply to this was a snort and the man tall and narrowshouldered in black resumed his pacing glancing from time to time at the doorway to the back room where the invisible louisa was presumably at work the man looked slightly familiar but i had no time to think where i had seen him before mr haugh was squinting dubiously at the list i had given him aconite now he muttered aconite and what might that be i wonder well its poison for one thing i said mr haughs mouth dropped open momentarily its a medicine too i assured him but you have to be careful in the use of it externally its good for rheumatism but a very tiny amount taken by mouth will lower the rate of the pulse good for some kinds of heart trouble really mr haugh said blinking he turned to his shelves looking rather helpless er do ye ken what it smells like maybe taking this for invitation i came round the counter and began to sort through the jars they were all carefully labeled but the labels of some were clearly old the ink faded and the paper peeling at the edges im afraid im none so canny wi the medicines as my da yet young mr haugh was saying at my elbow hed taught me a good bit but then he passed on a year ago and theres things here as i dinna ken the use of im afraid well that ones good for cough i said taking down a jar of elecampane with a glance at the impatient reverend who had taken out a handkerchief and was wheezing asthmatically into it particularly stickysounding coughs i frowned at the crowded shelves everything was dusted and immaculate but evidently not filed according either to alphabetical or botanical order had old mr haugh merely remembered where things were or had he a system of some kind i closed my eyes and tried to remember the last time i had been in the shop to my surprise the image came back easily i had come for foxglove then to make the infusions for alex randall younger brother of black jack randalland franks sixtimes greatgrandfather poor boy he had been dead now twenty years though he had lived long enough to sire a son i felt a twinge of curiosity at the thought of that son and of his mother who had been my friend but i forced my mind away from them back to the image of mr haugh standing on tiptoe to reach up to his shelves over near the righthand side there sure enough my hand rested near the jar labeled foxglove to one side of it was a jar labeled horsetail to the other lily of the valley root i hesitated looking at them running over in my mind the possible uses of those herbs cardiac herbs all of them if aconite was to be found it would be close by then it was i found it quickly in a jar labeled auld wives huid be careful with it i handed the jar gingerly to mr haugh even a bit of it will make your skin go numb perhaps id better have a glass bottle for it most of the herbs id bought had been wrapped up in squares of gauze or twisted in screws of paper but the young mr haugh nodded and carried the jar of aconite into the back room held at arms length as though he expected it to explode in his face yed seem to know a good deal more about the medicines than the lad said a deep hoarse voice behind me well ive somewhat more experience than he has likely i turned to find the minister leaning on the counter watching me under thick brows with pale blue eyes i realized with a start where i had seen him in moubrays the day before he gave no sign of recognizing me perhaps because my cloak covered daphnes dress i had noticed that many men took relatively little notice of the face of a woman en décolletage though it seemed a regrettable habit in a clergyman he cleared his throat mmphm and dye ken what to do for a nervous complaint then what sort of nervous complaint he pursed his lips and frowned as though unsure whether to trust me the upper lip came to a slight point like an owls beak but the lower was thick and pendulous welltis a complicated case but to speak generally nowhe eyed me carefullywhat would ye give for a sort offit epileptic seizure where the person falls down and twitches he shook his head showing a reddened band about his neck where the high white stock had chafed it no a different kind of fit screaming and staring screaming and staring not at once ye ken he added hastily first the one and then the otheror rather roundabout first shell do naught but stare for days on end not speaking and then of a sudden shell scream fit to wake the deid that sounds very trying it did if he had a wife so afflicted it could easily explain the deep lines of strain that bracketed his mouth and eyes and the blue circles of exhaustion beneath his eyes i tapped a finger on the counter considering i dont know id have to see the patient the ministers tongue touched his lower lip perhapswould ye be willing maybe to come and see her it isnt far he added rather stiffly pleading didnt come naturally to him but the urgency of his request communicated itself despite the stiffness of his figure i cant just now i told him i have to meet my husband but perhaps this afternoon two oclock he said promptly hendersons in carrubbers close campbell is the name the reverend archibald campbell before i could say yes or no the curtain between the front room and the back twitched aside and mr haugh appeared with two bottles one of which he handed to each of us the reverend eyed his with suspicion as he groped in his pocket for a coin weel and theres your price he said ungraciously slapping it on the counter and well hope as youve given me the right one and no the ladys poison the curtain rustled again and a woman looked out after the departing form of the minister good riddance she remarked happence for an hours work and insult on the top of it the lord might ha chosen better is all i can say do you know him i asked curious whether louisa might have any helpful information about the afflicted wife not to say i ken him weel no louisa said staring at me in frank curiosity hes one o they free church meenisters as is always rantin on the corner by the market cross tellin folk as their behaviors of nay consequence at all and all thats needful for salvation is that they shall come to grips wi jesuslike as if our lord was to be a fairday wrestler she sniffed disdainfully at this heretical viewpoint crossing herself against contamination im surprised the likes of the reverend campbell should come in our shop hearin what he thinks o papists by and large her eyes sharpened at me but youll maybe be free church yoursel maam meanin no offense to ye if so no im a catholicer a papist too i assured her i was only wondering whether you knew anything about the reverends wife and her condition louisa shook her head turning to deal with a new customer nay ive neer seen the lady but whatevers the matter with her she added frowning after the departed reverend im sure that livin wi him doesna improve it any the weather was chill but clear and only a faint hint of smoke lingered in the rectory garden as a reminder of the fire jamie and i sat on a bench against the wall absorbing the pale winter sunshine as we waited for young ian to finish his confession did you tell ian that load of rubbish he gave young ian yesterday about where id been all this time oh aye he said ians a good deal too canny to believe it but its a likely enough story and hes too good a friend to insist on the truth i suppose it will do for general consumption i agreed but shouldnt you have told it to sir percival instead of letting him think we were newlyweds he shook his head decidedly och no for the one thing sir percival has no notion of my real name though ill lay a years takings he knows it isna malcolm i dinna want him to be thinking of me and culloden together by any means and for another a story like the one i gave ian would cause the devil of a lot more talk than the news that the printers taken a wife oh what a tangled web we weave i intoned when first we practice to deceive he gave me a quick blue glance and the corner of his mouth lifted slightly it gets a bit easier with practice sassenach he said try living wi me for a time and yell find yourself spinning silk out of your arse easy as sh er easy as kissmyhand i burst out laughing i want to see you do that i said you already have he stood up and craned his neck trying to see over the wall into the rectory garden young ians being the devil of a time he remarked sitting down again how can a lad not yet fifteen have that much to confess after the day and night he had yesterday i suppose it depends how much detail father hayes wants to hear i said with a vivid recollection of my breakfast with the prostitutes has he been in there all this time er no the tips of jamies ears grew slightly pinker in the morning light i er i had to go first as an example ye ken no wonder it took some time i said teasing how long has it been since youve been to confession i told father hayes it was six months and was it no but i supposed if he was going to shrive me for thieving assault and profane language he might as well shrive me for lying too what no fornication or impure thoughts certainly not he said austerely ye can think any manner of horrible things without sin and its to do wi your wife its only if youre thinking it about other ladies its impure i had no idea i was coming back to save your soul i said primly but its nice to be useful he laughed bent and kissed me thoroughly i wonder if that counts as an indulgence he said pausing for breath it ought to no it does a great deal more to keep a man from the fires of hell than saying the rosary does speaking of which he added digging into his pocket and coming out with a rather chewedlooking wooden rosary remind me that i must say my penance sometime today i was about to start on it when ye came up how many hail marys are you supposed to say i asked fingering the beads the chewed appearance wasnt illusion there were definite small toothmarks on most of the beads i met a jew last year he said ignoring the question a natural philosopher whod sailed round the world six times he told me that in both the musselman faith and the jewish teachings it was considered an act of virtue for a man and his wife to lie wi each other i wonder if that has anything to do wi both jews and musselmen being circumcised he added thoughtfully i never thought to ask him thatthough perhaps he would ha found it indelicate to say i shouldnt think a foreskin more or less would impair the virtue i assured him oh good he said and kissed me once more what happened to your rosary i asked picking up the string where it had fallen on the grass it looks like the rats have been at it not rats he said bairns what bairns oh any that might be about he shrugged tucking the beads back in his pocket young jamie has three now and maggie and kitty two each wee michaels just married but his wifes breeding the sun was behind him darkening his face so that his teeth flashed suddenly white when he smiled ye didna ken ye were a greataunt seven times over aye a greataunt i said staggered well im a greatuncle he said cheerfully and i havena found it a terrible trial except for having my beads gnawed when the weans are cutting teeththat and bein expected to answer to nunkie a lot sometimes twenty years seemed like an instant and sometimes it seemed like a very long time indeed erthere isnt a feminine equivalent of nunkie i hope oh no he assured me theyll all call ye greatauntie claire and treat ye wi the utmost respect thanks a lot i muttered with visions of the hospitals geriatric wing fresh in my mind jamie laughed and with a lightness of heart no doubt engendered by being newly freed from sin grasped me around the waist and lifted me onto his lap ive never before seen a greatauntie wi a lovely plump arse like that he said with approval bouncing me slightly on his knees his breath tickled the back of my neck as he leaned forward i let out a small shriek as his teeth closed lightly on my ear are ye all right auntie said young ians voice just behind us full of concern jamie started convulsively nearly unshipping me from his lap then tightened his hold on my waist oh aye he said its just your auntie saw a spider where said young ian peering interestedly over the bench up there jamie rose standing me on my feet and pointed to the lime tree wheresure enoughthe web of an orb weaver stretched across the crook of two branches sparkling with damp the weaver herself sat in the center round as a cherry wearing a gaudy pattern of green and yellow on her back i was telling your auntie jamie said as young ian examined the web in lashless fascination about a jew i met a natural philosopher hed made a study of spiders it seems in fact he was in edinburgh to deliver a learned paper to the royal society in spite of being a jew really did he tell ye a lot about spiders young ian asked eagerly a lot more than i cared to know jamie informed his nephew there are times and places for talkin of spiders that lay eggs in caterpillars so the young hatch out and devour the poor beast while its still alive but during supper isna one of them he did say one thing i thought verra interesting though he added squinting at the web he blew gently on it and the spider scuttled briskly into hiding he said that spiders spin two kinds of silk and if ye have a lensand can make the spider sit still for it i supposeye can see the two places where the silk comes out spinnerets he called them in any case the one kind of silk is sticky and if a wee bug touches it hes done for but the other kind is dry silk like the sort yed embroider with but finer the orb weaver was advancing cautiously toward the center of her web again see where she walks jamie pointed to the web anchored by a number of spokes supporting the intricate netlike whorl the spokes there those are spun of the dry silk so the spider can walk over it herself wi no trouble but the rest o the web is the sticky kind of silkor mostly soand if ye watch a spider careful for quite a long time youll see that she goes only on the dry strands for if she walked on the sticky stuff shed be stuck herself is that so ian breathed reverently on the web watching intently as the spider moved away along her nonskid road to safety i suppose theres a moral there for web weavers jamie observed to me sotto voce be sure ye know which of your strands are sticky i suppose it helps even more if you have the kind of luck that will conjure up a handy spider when you need one i said dryly he laughed and took my arm thats not luck sassenach he told me its watchfulness ian are ye coming oh aye young ian abandoned the web with obvious reluctance and followed us to the kirkyard gate oh uncle jamie i meant to ask can i borrow your rosary he said as we emerged onto the cobbles of the royal mile the priest told me i must say five decades for my penance and thats too many to keep count of on my fingers surely jamie stopped and fished in his pocket for the rosary be sure to give it back though young ian grinned aye i reckon youll be needing it yourself uncle jamie the priest told me he was verra wicked young ian confided to me with a lashless wink and told me not to be like him mmphm jamie glanced up and down the road gauging the speed of an approaching handcart edging its way down the steep incline freshly shaved that morning his cheeks had a rosy glow about them how many decades of the rosary are you supposed to say as penance i asked curiously eightyfive he muttered the rosiness of his freshly shaved cheeks deepened young ians mouth dropped open in awe how long has it been since ye went to confession uncle he asked a long time jamie said tersely come on jamie had an appointment after dinner to meet with a mr harding representative of the hand in hand assurance society which had insured the premises of the printshop to inspect the ashy remains with him and verify the loss i willna need ye laddie he said reassuringly to young ian who looked less than enthusiastic about the notion of revisiting the scene of his adventures you go wi your auntie to see this madwoman i canna tell how ye do it he added to me raising one brow youre in the city less than two days and all the afflicted folk for miles about are clutching at your hems hardly all of them i said dryly its only one woman after all and i havent even seen her yet aye well at least madness isna catchingi hope he kissed me briefly then turned to go clapping young ian companionably on the shoulder look after your auntie ian young ian paused for a moment looking after the tall form of his departing uncle do you want to go with him ian i asked i can manage alone if you oh no auntie he turned back to me looking rather abashed i dinna want to go at all its onlyi was wonderingwell what if theyfind anything in the ashes a body you mean i said bluntly i had realized of course that the distinct possibility that jamie and mr harding would find the body of the oneeyed seaman was the reason jamie had told ian to accompany me the boy nodded looking ill at ease his skin had faded to a sort of rosy tan but was still too dark to show any paleness due to emotion i dont know i said if the fire was a very hot one there may be nothing much left to find but dont worry about it i touched his arm in reassurance your uncle will know what to do aye thats so his face brightened full of faith in his uncles ability to handle any situation whatever i smiled when i saw his expression then realized with a small start of surprise that i had that faith too be it drunken chinese corrupt customs agents or mr harding of the hand in hand assurance society i hadnt any doubt that jamie would manage come on then i said as the bell in the canongate kirk began to ring its just on two now despite his visit to father hayes ian had retained a certain air of dreamy bliss which returned to him now and there was little conversation as we made our way up the slope of the royal mile to hendersons lodging house in carrubbers close it was a quiet hotel but luxurious by edinburgh standards with a patterned carpet on the stairs and colored glass in the street window it seemed rather rich surroundings for a free church minister but then i knew little about free churchmen perhaps they took no vow of poverty as the catholic clergy did showed up to the third floor by a young boy we found the door opened to us at once by a heavyset woman wearing an apron and a worried expression i thought she might be in her midtwenties though she had already lost several of her front teeth youll be the lady as the reverend said would call she asked her expression lightened a bit at my nod and she swung the door wider mr campbells had to go oot the noo she said in a broad lowland accent but he said as how hed be most obliged to hae yer advice regardin his sister mum sister not wife well ill do my best i said may i see miss campbell leaving ian to his memories in the sitting room i accompanied the woman who introduced herself as nellie cowden to the back bedroom miss campbell was as advertised staring her pale blue eyes were wide open but didnt seem to be looking at anythingcertainly not at me she sat in the sort of wide low chair called a nursing chair with her back to the fire the room was dim and the backlighting made her features indistinct except for the unblinking eyes seen closer to her features were still indistinct she had a soft round face undistinguished by any apparent bone structure and babyfine brown hair neatly brushed her nose was small and snub her chin double and her mouth hung pinkly open so slack as to obscure its natural lines miss campbell i said cautiously there was no response from the plump figure in the chair her eyes did blink i saw though much less frequently than normal shell nae answer ye whilst shes in this state nellie cowden said behind me she shook her head wiping her hands upon her apron nay not a word how long has she been like this i picked up a limp pudgy hand and felt for the pulse it was there slow and quite strong oh for twa days so far this time becoming interested miss cowden leaned forward peering into her charges face usually she stays like that for a week or morethirteen days is the longest shes done it moving slowlythough miss campbell seemed unlikely to be alarmedi began to examine the unresisting figure meanwhile asking questions of her attendant miss margaret campbell was thirtyseven miss cowden told me the only relative of the reverend archibald campbell with whom she had lived for the past twenty years since the death of their parents what starts her doing this do you know miss cowden shook her head no tellin mum nothin seems to start it one minute shell be lookin aboot talkin and laughin eatin her dinner like the sweet child she is and the nextwheesht she snapped her fingers then for effect leaned forward and snapped them again deliberately just under miss campbells nose see she said i could hae six men wi trumpets pass through the room and shed pay it nay more mind i was reasonably sure that miss campbells trouble was mental not physical but i made a complete examination anywayor as complete as could be managed without undressing that clumsy inert form its when she comes oot of it thats the worst though miss cowden assured me squatting next to me as i knelt on the floor to check miss campbells plantar reflexes her feet loosed from shoes and stockings were damp and smelled musty i drew a fingernail firmly down the sole of each foot in turn checking for a babinski reflex that might indicate the presence of a brain lesion nothing though her toes curled under in normal startlement what happens then is that the screaming the reverend mentioned i rose to my feet will you bring me a lighted candle please oh aye the screamin miss cowden hastened to oblige lighting a wax taper from the fire she do shriek somethin awful then on and on til shes worn herself oot then shell fall asleepsleep the clock around she willand wake as though nothin had happened and shes quite all right when she wakes i asked i moved the candle flame slowly back and forth a few inches before the patients eyes the pupils shrank in automatic response to the light but the irises stayed fixed not following the flame my hand itched for the solid handle of an ophthalmoscope to examine the retinas but no such luck well not to say all right miss cowden said slowly i turned from the patient to look at her and she shrugged massive shoulders powerful under the linen of her blouse shes saft in the heid puir dear she said matteroffactly has been for nigh on twenty year you havent been taking care of her all that time surely oh no mr campbell had a woman as cared for her where they lived in burntisland but the woman was none so young and didna wish to leave her home so when the reverend made up his mind to take up the missionary societys offer and to take his sister wi him to the west indieswhy he advertised for a strong woman o good character who wouldna mind travel to be an abigail for herand here i am miss cowden gave me a gaptoothed smile in testimony to her own virtues the west indies hes planning to take miss campbell on a ship to the west indies i was staggered i knew just enough of sailing conditions to think that any such trip would be a major ordeal to a woman in good health this womanbut then i reconsidered all things concerned margaret campbell might endure such a trip better than a normal womanat least if she remained in her trance he thought as the change of climate might be good for her miss cowden was explaining get her away from scotland and all the dreadful memories ought to ha done it long since is what i say what sort of dreadful memories i asked i could see by the gleam in miss cowdens eye that she was only too ready to tell me i had finished the examination by this time and concluded that there was little physically wrong with miss campbell save inactivity and poor diet but there was the chance that something in her history might suggest some treatment weel she began sidling toward the table where a decanter and several glasses stood on a tray its only what tilly lawson told me her as looked after miss campbell for sae long but she did swear it was the truth and her a godly woman if yed care to take a drop of cordial mum for the sake o the reverends hospitality the chair miss campbell sat on was the only one in the room so miss cowden and i perched inelegantly on the bed side by side and watched the silent figure before us as we sipped our blackberry cordial and she told me margaret campbells story margaret campbell had been born in burntisland no more than five miles from edinburgh across the firth of forth at the time of the when charles stuart had marched into edinburgh to reclaim his fathers throne she had been seventeen her father was a royalist o course and her brother in a government regiment marching north to put down the wicked rebels said miss cowden taking a tiny sip of the cordial to make it last but not miss margaret nay she was for the bonnie prince and the hielan men that followed him one in particular though miss cowden did not know his name but a fine man he must have been for miss margaret stole away from her home to meet him and told him all the bits of information that she gleaned from listening to her father and his friends and from her brothers letters home but then had come falkirk a victory but a costly one followed by retreat rumor had attended the flight of the princes army to the north and not a soul doubted but that their flight led to destruction miss margaret desperate at the rumors left her home at dead of night in the cold march spring and went to find the man she loved now here the account had been uncertainwhether it was that she had found the man and he had spurned her or that she had not found him in time and been forced to turn back from culloden moorbut in any case turn back she did and the day after the battle she had fallen into the hands of a band of english soldiers dreadful what they did to her miss cowden said lowering her voice as though the figure in the chair could hear dreadful the english soldiers blind with the lust of the hunt and the kill pursuing the fugitives of culloden had not stopped to ask her name or the sympathies of her family they had known by her speech that she was a scot and that knowledge had been enough they had left her for dead in a ditch half full of freezing water and only the fortuitous presence of a family of tinkers hiding in the nearby brambles for fear of the soldiers had saved her i canna help but think it a pity they did save her unchristian thing it is to say miss cowden whispered if not the puir lamb might ha slippit her earthly bonds and gone happy to god but as it is she gestured clumsily at the silent figure and drank down the last drops of her cordial margaret had lived but did not speak somewhat recovered but silent she traveled with the tinkers moving south with them to avoid the pillaging of the highlands that took place in the wake of culloden and then one day sitting in the yard of a pothouse holding the tin to collect coppers as the tinkers busked and sang she had been found by her brother who had stopped with his campbell regiment to refresh themselves on the way back to their quarters at edinburgh she kent him and him her and the shock o their meeting gave her back her voice but not her mind puir thing he took her home o course but she was always as though she was in the pastsometime before she met the hielan man her father was dead then from the influenza and tilly lawson said as the shock o seeing her like that kilt her mother but could be as that were the influenza too for there was a great deal of it about that year the whole affair had left archibald campbell deeply embittered against both highland scots and the english army and he had resigned his commission with his parents dead he found himself middling welltodo but the sole support of his damaged sister he couldna marry miss cowden explained for what woman would have him and shewith a nod toward the firewas thrown into the bargain in his difficulties he had turned to god and become a minister unable to leave his sister or to bear the confinement of the family house at burntisland with her he had purchased a coach hired a woman to look after margaret and begun to make brief journeys into the surrounding countryside to preach often taking her with him in his preaching he had found success and this year had been asked by the society of presbyterian missionaries if he would undertake his longest journey yet to the west indies there to organize churches and appoint elders on the colonies of barbados and jamaica prayer had given him his answer and he had sold the family property in burntisland and moved his sister to edinburgh while he made preparations for the journey i glanced once more at the figure by the fire the heated air from the hearth stirred the skirts about her feet but beyond that small movement she might have been a statue well i said with a sigh theres not a great deal i can do for her im afraid but ill give you some prescriptionsreceipts i meanto have made up at the apothecarys before you go if they didnt help they couldnt hurt i reflected as i copied down the short lists of ingredients chamomile hops rue tansy and verbena with a strong pinch of peppermint for a soothing tonic tea of rose hips to help correct the slight nutritional deficiency i had notedspongy bleeding gums and a pale bloated look about the face once you reach the indies i said handing miss cowden the paper you must see that she eats a great deal of fruitoranges grapefruit and lemons particularly you should do the same i added causing a look of profound suspicion to flit across the maids wide face i doubted she ate any vegetable matter beyond the occasional onion or potato save her daily parritch the reverend campbell had not returned and i saw no real reason to wait for him bidding miss campbell adieu i pulled open the door of the bedroom to find young ian standing on the other side of it oh he said startled i was just comin to find ye auntie its nearly halfpast three and uncle jamie said jamie the voice came from behind me from the chair beside the fire miss cowden and i whirled to find miss campbell sitting bolt upright eyes still wide but focused now they were focused on the doorway and as young ian stepped inside miss campbell began to scream rather unsettled by the encounter with miss campbell young ian and i made our way thankfully back to the refuge of the brothel where we were greeted matteroffactly by bruno and taken to the rear parlor there we found jamie and fergus deep in conversation true we do not trust sir percival fergus was saying but in this case what point is there to his telling you of an ambush save that such an ambush is in fact to occur damned if i ken why jamie said frankly leaning back and stretching in his chair and that being so we do as ye say conclude that theres meant to be an ambush by the excisemen two days he said that would be mullens cove then catching sight of me and ian he halfrose motioning us to take seats will it be the rocks below balcarres then fergus asked jamie frowned in thought the two stiff fingers of his right hand drumming slowly on the tabletop no he said at last let it be arbroath the wee cove under the abbey there just to be sure aye all right fergus pushed back the halfempty plate of oatcakes from which he had been refreshing himself and rose i shall spread the word milord arbroath in four days with a nod to me he swirled his cloak about his shoulders and went out is it the smuggling uncle young ian asked eagerly is there a french lugger coming he picked up an oatcake and bit into it scattering crumbs over the table jamies eyes were still abstracted thinking but they cleared as he glanced sharply at his nephew aye it is and you young ian are having nothing to do with it but i could help the boy protested youll need someone to hold the mules at least after all your da said to you and me yesterday wee ian jamie raised his brows christ yeve a short memory lad ian looked mildly abashed at this and took another oatcake to cover his confusion seeing him momentarily silent i took the opportunity to ask my own questions youre going to arbroath to meet a french ship thats bringing in smuggled liquor i asked you dont think thats dangerous after sir percivals warning jamie glanced at me with one brow still raised but answered patiently enough no sir percival was warning me that the rendezvous in two days time is known that was to take place at mullens cove ive an arrangement wi jared and his captains though if a rendezvous canna be kept for some reason the lugger will stand offshore and come in again the next nightbut to a different place and theres a third fallback as well should the second meeting not come off but if sir percival knows the first rendezvous wont he know the others too i persisted jamie shook his head and poured out a cup of wine he quirked a brow at me to ask whether i wanted any and upon my shaking my head sipped it himself no he said the rendezvous points are arranged in sets of three between me and jared sent by sealed letter inside a packet addressed to jeanne here once ive read the letter i burn it the men wholl help meet the lugger will all know the first point of coursei suppose one o them will have let something slip he added frowning into his cup but no onenot even ferguskens the other two points unless we need to make use of one and when we do all the men ken well enough to guard their tongues but then its bound to be safe uncle young ian burst out please let me come ill keep well back out o the way he promised jamie gave his nephew a slightly jaundiced look aye ye will he said youll come wi me to arbroath but you and your auntie will stay at the inn on the road above the abbey until weve finished ive got to take the laddie home to lallybroch claire he explained turning to me and mend things as best i can with his parents the elder ian had left hallidays that morning before jamie and young ian arrived leaving no message but presumably bound for home ye willna mind the journey i wouldna ask it and you just over your travel from invernesshis eyes met mine with a small conspiratorial smilebut i must take him back as soon as may be i dont mind at all i assured him it will be good to see jenny and the rest of your family again but uncle young ian blurted what about be still jamie snapped that will be all from you laddie not another word aye young ian looked wounded but took another oatcake and inserted it into his mouth in a marked manner signifying his intention to remain completely silent jamie relaxed then and smiled at me well and how was your visit to the madwoman very interesting i said jamie do you know any people named campbell not above three or four hundred of them he said a smile twitching his long mouth had ye a particular campbell in mind a couple of them i told him the story of archibald campbell and his sister margaret as related to me by nellie cowden he shook his head at the tale and sighed for the first time he looked truly older his face tightened and lined by memory its no the worst tale ive heard of the things that happened after culloden he said but i dinna thinkwait he stopped and looked at me eyes narrowed in thought margaret campbell margaret would she be a bonny wee lassperhaps the size o the second mary and wi soft brown hair like a wrens feather and a verra sweet face she probably was twenty years ago i said thinking of that still plump figure sitting by the fire why do you know her after all aye i think i do his brow was furrowed in thought and he looked down at the table drawing a random line through the spilled crumbs aye if im right she was ewan camerons sweetheart youll mind ewan of course ewan had been a tall handsome joker of a man who had worked with jamie at holyrood gathering bits of intelligence that filtered through from england whats become of ewan or should i not ask i said seeing the shadow come over jamies face the english shot him he said quietly two days after culloden he closed his eyes for a moment then opened them and smiled tiredly at me well then may god bless the reverend archie campbell id heard of him a time or two during the rising he was a bold soldier folk said and a brave oneand i suppose hell need to be now poor man he sat a moment longer then stood up with decision aye well theres a great deal to be done before we leave edinburgh ian youll find the list of the printshop customers upstairs on the table fetch it down to me and ill mark off for ye the ones with orders outstanding ye must go to see each one and offer back their money unless they choose to wait until ive found new premises and laid in new stockthat might take as much as two months though tell them he patted his coat where something made a small jingling sound luckily the assurance money will pay back the customers and have a bit left over speaking of whichhe turned and smiled at meyour job sassenach is to find a dressmaker who will manage ye a decent gown in two days time for i expect daphne would like her dress back and i canna take ye home to lallybroch naked rendezvous the chief entertainment of the ride north to arbroath was watching the conflict of wills between jamie and young ian i knew from long experience that stubbornness was one of the major components of a frasers character ian seemed not unduly handicapped in that respect though only half a fraser either the murrays were no slouches with regard to stubbornness or the fraser genes were strong ones having had the opportunity to observe brianna at close range for many years i had my own opinion about that but kept quiet merely enjoying the spectacle of jamie having for once met his match by the time we passed balfour he was wearing a distinctly hunted look this contest between immovable object and irresistible force continued until early evening of the fourth day when we reached arbroath to find that the inn where jamie had intended to leave ian and myself no longer existed no more than a tumbleddown stone wall and one or two charred roofbeams remained to mark the spot otherwise the road was deserted for miles in either direction jamie looked at the heap of stones in silence for some time it was reasonably obvious that he could not just leave us in the middle of a desolate muddy road ian wise enough not to press the advantage kept also silent though his skinny frame fairly vibrated with eagerness all right then jamie said at last resigned yell come but only so far as the cliffs edge iandye hear youll take care of your auntie i hear uncle jamie young ian replied with deceptive meekness i caught jamies wry glance though and understood that if ian was to take care of auntie auntie was also to take care of ian i hid a smile nodding obediently the rest of the men were timely arriving at the rendezvous point on the cliffside just after dark a couple of the men seemed vaguely familiar but most were just muffled shapes it was two days past the dark of the moon but the tiny sliver rising over the horizon made conditions here little more illuminating than those obtaining in the brothels cellars no introductions were made the men greeting jamie with unintelligible mutters and grunts there was one unmistakable figure though a large muledrawn wagon appeared rattling its way down the road driven by fergus and a diminutive object that could only be mr willoughby whom i had not seen since he had shot the mysterious man on the stairs of the brothel he hasnt a pistol with him tonight i hope i murmured to jamie who he said squinting into the gathering gloom oh the chinee no none of them have before i could ask why not he had gone forward to help back the wagon around ready to make a getaway toward edinburgh so soon as the contraband should be loaded young ian pressed his way forward and i mindful of my job as custodian followed him mr willoughby stood on tiptoe to reach into the back of the wagon emerging with an oddlooking lantern fitted with a pierced metal top and sliding metal sides is that a dark lantern i asked fascinated aye it is said young ian importantly ye keep the slides shut until we see the signal out at sea he reached for the lantern here give it me ill take iti ken the signal mr willoughby merely shook his head pulling the lantern out of young ians grasp too tall too young he said tseimi say so he added as though that settled the matter once and for all what young ian was indignant what dye mean too tall and too young ye wee he means said a level voice behind us that whoevers holding the lantern is a bonny target should we have visitors mr willoughby kindly takes the risk of it because hes the smallest man among us youre tall enough to see against the sky wee ian and young enough to have nay sense yet stay out o the way aye jamie gave his nephew a light cuff over the ear and passed by to kneel on the rocks by mr willoughby he said something lowvoiced in chinese and there was the ghost of a laugh from the chinaman mr willoughby opened the side of the lantern holding it conveniently to jamies cupped hands a sharp click repeated twice and i caught the flicker of sparks struck from a flint it was a wild piece of coastnot surprising most of scotlands coast was wild and rockyand i wondered how and where the french ship would anchor there was no natural bay only a curving of the coastline behind a jutting cliff that sheltered this spot from observation from the road dark as it was i could see the white lines of the surf purling in across the small halfmoon beach no smooth tourist beach thissmall pockets of sand lay ruffled and churned between heaps of seaweed and pebbles and juts of rock not an easy footing for men carrying casks but convenient to the crevices in the surrounding rocks where the casks could be hidden another black figure loomed up suddenly beside me everyones settled sir it said softly up in the rocks good joey a sudden flare lit jamies profile intent on the newly caught wick he held his breath as the flame steadied and grew taking up oil from the lanterns reservoir then let it out with a sigh as he gently closed the metal slide fine then he said standing up he glanced up at the cliff to the south observing the stars over it and said nearly nine oclock theyll be in soon mind ye joeyno ones to move til i call out aye aye sir the casual tone of the answer made it apparent that this was a customary exchange and joey was plainly surprised when jamie gripped his arm be sure of it jamie said tell them all againno one moves til i give the word aye sir joey said again but this time with more respect he faded back into the night making no sound on the rocks is something wrong i asked pitching my voice barely loud enough to be heard over the breakers though the beach and cliffs were evidently deserted the dark setting and the secretive conduct of my companions compelled caution jamie shook his head briefly hed been right about young ian i thoughthis own dark silhouette was clear against the paler black of the sky behind him i dinna ken he hesitated for a moment then said tell me sassenachdye smell anything surprised i obligingly took a deep sniff held it for a moment and let it out i smelled any number of things including rotted seaweed the thick smell of burning oil from the dark lantern and the pungent body odor of young ian standing close beside me sweating with a mix of excitement and fear nothing odd i dont think i said do you the silhouettes shoulders rose and dropped in a shrug not now a moment ago i could ha sworn i smelt gunpowder i dinna smell anything young ian said his voice broke from excitement and he hastily cleared his throat embarrassed willie macleod and alec hays searched the rocks they didna find any sign of excisemen aye well jamies voice sounded uneasy he turned to young ian grasping him by the shoulder ian youre to take charge of your auntie now the two of ye get back of the gorse bushes there keep well away from the wagon if anything should happen the beginnings of young ians protest were cut off apparently by a tightening of jamies hand for the boy jerked back with a small grunt rubbing his shoulder if anything should happen jamie continued with emphasis youre to take your auntie and go straight home to lallybroch dinna linger but i said uncle young ian said do it said jamie in tones of steel and turned aside the discussion concluded young ian was grim on the trip up the cliff trail but did as he was told dutifully escorting me some distance past the gorse bushes and finding a small promontory where we might see out some way over the water we can see from here he whispered unnecessarily we could indeed the rocks fell away in a shallow bowl beneath us a broken cup filled with darkness the light of the water spilling from the broken edge where the sea hissed in once i caught a tiny movement as a metal buckle caught the faint light but for the most part the ten men below were completely invisible i squinted trying to pick out the location of mr willoughby with his lantern but saw no sign of light and concluded that he must be standing behind the lantern shielding it from sight from the cliff young ian stiffened suddenly next to me someones coming he whispered quick get behind me stepping courageously out in front of me he plunged a hand under his shirt into the band of his breeches and withdrew a pistol dark as it was i could see the faint gleam of starlight along the barrel he braced himself peering into the dark slightly hunched over the gun with both hands clamped on the weapon dont shoot for gods sake i hissed in his ear i didnt dare grab his arm for fear of setting off the pistol but was terrified lest he make any noise that might attract attention to the men below id be obliged if yed heed your auntie ian came jamies soft ironic tones from the blackness below the cliff edge id as soon not have ye blow my head off aye ian lowered the pistol shoulders slumping with what might have been a sigh either of relief or disappointment the gorse bushes quivered and then jamie was before us brushing gorse prickles from the sleeve of his coat did no one tell ye not to come armed jamies voice was mild with no more than a note of academic interest its a hanging offense to draw a weapon against an officer of the kings customs he explained turning to me none o the men are armed even wi so much as a fish knife in case theyre taken aye well fergus said they wouldna hang me because my beards not grown yet ian said awkwardly id only be transported he said there was a soft hiss as jamie drew in his breath through his teeth in exasperation oh aye and im sure your mother will be verra pleased to hear yeve been shipped off to the colonies even if fergus was right he put out his hand give me that fool where did ye get it anyway he asked turning the pistol over in his hand already primed too i knew i smelt gunpowder lucky ye didna blow your cock off carrying it in your breeches before young ian could answer i interrupted pointing out to sea look the french ship was little more than a blot on the face of the sea but its sails shone pale in the glimmer of starlight a twomasted ketch it glided slowly past the cliff and stood off silent as one of the scattered clouds behind it jamie was not watching the ship but looking downward toward a point where the rock face broke in a tumble of boulders just above the sand looking where he was looking i could just make out a tiny prickle of light mr willoughby with the lantern there was a brief flash of light that glistened across the wet rocks and was gone young ians hand was tense on my arm we waited breaths held to the count of thirty ians hand squeezed my arm just as another flash lit the foam on the sand what was that i said what jamie wasnt looking at me but out at the ship on the shore when the light flashed i thought i saw something halfburied in the sand it looked like the third flash came and a moment later an answering light shone from the shipa blue lantern an eerie dot that hung from the mast doubling itself in reflection in the dark water below i forgot the glimpse of what appeared to be a rumpled heap of clothing carelessly buried in the sand in the excitement of watching the ship some movement was evident now and a faint splash reached our ears as something was thrown over the side the tides coming in jamie muttered in my ear the ankers float the current will carry them ashore in a few minutes that solved the problem of the ships anchorageit didnt need one but how then was the payment made i was about to ask when there was a sudden shout and all hell broke loose below jamie thrust his way at once through the gorse bushes followed in short order by me and young ian little could be seen distinctly but there was a considerable turmoil taking place on the sandy beach dark shapes were stumbling and rolling over the sand to the accompaniment of shouting i caught the words halt in the kings name and my blood froze excisemen young ian had caught it too jamie said something crude in gaelic then threw back his head and shouted himself his voice carrying easily across the beach below éirich illean he bellowed suas am bearrach is teich then he turned to young ian and me go he said the noise suddenly increased as the clatter of falling rocks joined the shouting suddenly a dark figure shot out of the gorse by my feet and made off through the dark at high speed another followed a few feet away a highpitched scream came from the dark below high enough to be heard over the other noises thats willoughby young ian exclaimed theyve got him ignoring jamies order to go we both crowded forward to peer through the screen of gorse the darklantern had fallen atilt and the slide had come open shooting a beam of light like a spotlight over the beach where the shallow graves in which the customs men had buried themselves gaped in the sand black figures swayed and struggled and shouted through the wet heaps of seaweed a dim glow of light around the lantern was sufficient to show two figures clasped together the smaller kicking wildly as it was lifted off its feet ill get him young ian sprang forward only to be pulled up with a jerk as jamie caught him by the collar do as youre told and see my wife safe gasping for breath young ian turned to me but i wasnt going anywhere and set my feet firmly in the dirt resisting his tug on my arm ignoring us both jamie turned and ran along the clifftop stopping several yards away i could see him clearly in silhouette against the sky as he dropped to one knee and readied the pistol bracing it on his forearm to sight downward the sound of the shot was no more than a small cracking noise lost amid the tumult the result of it though was spectacular the lantern exploded in a shower of burning oil abruptly darkening the beach and silencing the shouting the silence was broken within seconds by a howl of mingled pain and indignation my eyes momentarily blinded by the flash of the lantern adapted quickly and i saw another glowthe light of several small flames which seemed to be moving erratically up and down as my night vision cleared i saw that the flames rose from the coat sleeve of a man who was dancing up and down as he howled beating ineffectually at the fire started by the burning oil that had splashed him the gorse bushes quivered violently as jamie plunged over the cliffside and was lost to view below jamie roused by my cry young ian yanked harder pulling me half off my feet and forcibly dragging me away from the cliff come on auntie theyll be up here next thing this was undeniably true i could hear the shouts on the beach coming closer as the men swarmed up the rocks i picked up my skirts and went following the boy as fast as we could go through the rough marrowgrass of the clifftop i didnt know where we were going but young ian seemed to he had taken off his coat and the white of his shirt was easily visible before me floating like a ghost through the thickets of alder and birch that grew farther inland where are we i panted coming up alongside him when he slowed at the bank of a tiny stream the road to arbroaths just ahead he said he was breathing heavily and a dark smudge of mud showed down the side of his shirt itll be easier going in a moment are ye all right auntie shall i carry ye across i politely declined this gallant offer privately noting that i undoubtedly weighed as much as he did i took off my shoes and stockings and splashed my way kneedeep across the streamlet feeling icy mud well up between my toes i was shivering violently when i emerged and did accept ians offer of his coatexcited as he was and heated by the exercise he was clearly in no need of it i was chilled not only by the water and the cold november wind but by fear of what might be happening behind us we emerged panting onto the road the wind blowing cold in our faces my nose and lips were numb in no time and my hair blew loose behind me heavy on my neck its an ill wind that blows nobody good though it carried the sound of voices to us moments before we would have walked into them any signal from the cliff a deep male voice asked ian stopped so abruptly in his tracks that i bumped into him not yet came the reply i thought i heard a bit of shouting that way but then the wind turned well get up that tree again then heavyarse the first voice said impatiently if any o the whoresons get past the beach well nibble em here better us get the headmoney than the buggers on the beach its cold grumbled the second voice out in the open where the wind gnaws your bones wish wed drawn the watch at the abbeyat least it would be warm there young ians hand was clutching my upper arm tight enough to leave bruises i pulled trying to loosen his grip but he paid no attention aye but less chance o catching the big fish the first voice said ah and what i might do with fifty pound awright said the second voice resigned though how were to see red hair in the dark ive no notion just lay em by the heels oakie well look at their heads later young ian was finally roused from his trance by my tugging and stumbled after me off the road and into the bushes what do they mean by the watch at the abbey i demanded as soon as i thought we were out of earshot of the watchers on the road do you know young ians dark thatch bobbed up and down i think so auntie it must be arbroath abbey thats the meeting point aye meeting point if something should go wrong he explained then its every man for himself all to meet at the abbey as soon as they can well it couldnt go more wrong i observed what was it your uncle shouted when the customs men popped up young ian had halfturned to listen for pursuit from the roadnow the pale oval of his face turned back to me ohhe said up lads over the cliff and run sound advice i said dryly so if they followed it most of the men may have gotten away except uncle jamie and mr willoughby young ian was running one hand nervously through his hair it reminded me forcibly of jamie and i wished he would stop yes i took a deep breath well theres nothing we can do about them just now the other men thoughif theyre headed for the abbey aye he broke in thats what i was tryin to decide ought i do as uncle jamie said and take ye to lallybroch or had i best try to get to the abbey quick and warn the others as they come get to the abbey i said as fast as you can well buti shouldna like to leave ye out here by yourself auntie and uncle jamie said theres a time to follow orders young ian and a time to think for yourself i said firmly tactfully ignoring the fact that i was in fact doing the thinking for him does this road lead to the abbey aye it does no more than a mile and a quarter already he was shifting to and fro on the balls of his feet eager to be gone good you cut round the road and head for the abbey ill walk straight along the road and see if i can distract the excisemen until youre safely past ill meet you at the abbey oh waityoud best take your coat i surrendered the coat reluctantly besides being loath to part with its warmth it felt like giving up my last link with a friendly human presence once young ian was away i would be completely alone in the cold dark of the scottish night ian i held his arm to keep him a moment longer aye be careful wont you on impulse i stood on tiptoe and kissed his cold cheek i was near enough to see his brows arch in surprise he smiled and then he was gone an alder branch snapping back into place behind him it was very cold the only sounds were the whish of the wind through the bushes and the distant murmur of the surf i pulled the woolen shawl tightly round my shoulders shivering and headed back toward the road ought i to make a noise i wondered if not i might be attacked without warning since the waiting men might hear my footsteps but couldnt see that i wasnt an escaping smuggler on the other hand if i strolled through singing a jaunty tune to indicate that i was a harmless woman they might just lie hidden in silence not wanting to give away their presenceand giving away their presence was exactly what i had in mind i bent and picked up a rock from the side of the road then feeling even colder than before i stepped out onto the road and walked straight on without a word smugglers moon the wind was high enough to keep the trees and bushes in a constant stir masking the sound of my footsteps on the roadand those of anyone who might be stalking me too less than a fortnight past the feast of samhain it was the sort of wild night that made one easily believe that spirits and evil might well be abroad it wasnt a spirit that grabbed me suddenly from behind hand clamped tight across my mouth had i not been prepared for just such an eventuality i would have been startled senseless as it was my heart gave a great leap and i jerked convulsively in my captors grasp he had grabbed me from the left pinning my left arm tight against my side his right hand over my mouth my right arm was free though i drove the heel of my shoe into his kneecap buckling his leg and then taking advantage of his momentary stagger leaned forward and smashed backward at his head with the rock in my hand it was of necessity a glancing blow but it struck hard enough that he grunted with surprise and his grip loosened i kicked and squirmed and as his hand slipped across my mouth i got my teeth onto a finger and bit down as hard as i could the maxillary muscles run from the sagittal crest at the top of the skull to an insertion on the mandible i thought dimly recalling the description from greys anatomy this gives the jaw and teeth considerable crushing power in fact the average human jaw is capable of exerting over three hundred pounds of force i didnt know whether i was bettering the average but i was undeniably having an effect my assailant was thrashing frantically to and fro in a futile effort to dislodge the death grip i had on his finger his hold on my arm had loosened in the struggle and he was forced to lower me as soon as my feet touched the dirt once more i let go of his hand whirled about and gave him as hearty a root in the stones with my knee as i could manage given my skirts kicking men in the testicles is vastly overrated as a means of defense that is to say it does workand spectacularly wellbut its a more difficult maneuver to carry out than one might think particularly when one is wearing heavy skirts men are extremely careful of those particular appendages and thoroughly wary of any attempt on them in this case though my attacker was off guard his legs wide apart to keep his balance and i caught him fairly he made a hideous wheezing noise like a strangled rabbit and doubled up in the roadway is that you sassenach the words were hissed out of the darkness to my left i leaped like a startled gazelle and uttered an involuntary scream for the second time within as many minutes a hand clapped itself over my mouth for gods sake sassenach jamie muttered in my ear its me i didnt bite him though i was strongly tempted to i know i said through my teeth when he released me whos the other fellow that grabbed me though fergus i expect the amorphous dark shape moved away a few feet and seemed to be prodding another shape that lay on the road moaning faintly is it you fergus he whispered receiving a sort of choked noise in response he bent and hauled the second shape to its feet dont talk i urged them in a whisper there are excisemen just ahead is that so said jamie in a normal voice theyre no verra curious about the noise were making are they he paused as though waiting for an answer but no sound came but the low keening of the wind through the alders he laid a hand on my arm and shouted into the night macleod raeburn aye roy said a mildly testy voice in the shrubbery were here innes too and meldrum is it aye its me shuffling and talking in low voices more shapes emerged from the bushes and trees four five six jamie counted where are hays and the gordons i saw hays go intae the water one of the shapes volunteered hell ha gone awa round the point likely the gordons and kennedy did too i didna hear anything as though theyd been taken well enough jamie said now then sassenach whats this about excisemen given the nonappearance of oakie and his companion i was beginning to feel rather foolish but i recounted what ian and i had heard aye jamie sounded interested can ye stand yet fergus ye can good lad well then perhaps well have a look meldrum have ye a flint about ye a few moments later a small torch struggling to stay alight in his hand he strode down the road and around the bend the smugglers and i waited in tense silence ready either to run or to rush to his assistance but there were no noises of ambush after what seemed like an eternity jamies voice floated back along the road come along then he said sounding calm and collected he was standing in the middle of the road near a large alder the torchlight fell round him in a flickering circle and at first i saw nothing but jamie then there was a gasp from the man beside me and a choked sound of horror from another another face appeared dimly lit hanging in the air just behind jamies left shoulder a horrible congested face black in the torchlight that robbed everything of color with bulging eyes and tongue protruding the hair fair as dry straw rose stirring in the wind i felt a fresh scream rise in my throat and choked it off ye were right sassenach jamie said there was an exciseman he tossed something to the ground where it landed with a small plop a warrant he said nodding toward the object his name was thomas oakie will any of ye ken him not like he is now a voice muttered behind me christ his mither wouldna ken him there was a general mutter of negation with a nervous shuffling of feet clearly everyone was as anxious to get away from the place as i was all right then jamie stopped the retreat with a jerk of his head the cargos lost so therell be no shares aye will anyone need money for the present he reached for his pocket i can provide enough to live on for a bitfor i doubt well be workin the coast for a time one or two of the men reluctantly advanced within clear sight of the thing hanging from the tree to receive their money but the rest of the smugglers melted quietly away into the night within a few minutes only fergusstill white but standing on his ownjamie and i were left jesu fergus whispered looking up at the hanged man who will have done it i didor so i expect the tale will be told aye jamie gazed upward his face harsh in the sputtering torchlight well no tarry longer shall we what about ian i said suddenly remembering the boy he went to the abbey to warn you he did jamies voice sharpened i came from that direction and didna meet him which way did he go sassenach that way i said pointing fergus made a small sound that might have been laughter the abbeys the other way jamie said sounding amused come on then well catch him up when he realizes his mistake and comes back wait said fergus holding up a hand there was a cautious rustling in the shrubbery and young ians voice said uncle jamie aye ian his uncle said dryly its me the boy emerged from the bushes leaves stuck in his hair eyes wide with excitement i saw the light and thought i must come back to see that auntie claire was all right he explained uncle jamie ye mustna linger about wi a torchthere are excisemen about jamie put an arm about his nephews shoulders and turned him before he should notice the thing hanging from the alder tree dinna trouble yourself ian he said evenly theyve gone swinging the torch through the wet shrubbery he extinguished it with a hiss lets go he said his voice calm in the dark mr willoughbys down the road wi the horses well be in the highlands by dawn part seven home again the prodigals return it was a fourday journey on horseback to lallybroch from arbroath and there was little conversation for most of it both young ian and jamie were preoccupied presumably for different reasons for myself i was kept busy wondering not only about the recent past but about the immediate future ian must have told jamies sister jenny about me how would she take my reappearance jenny murray had been the nearest thing i had ever had to a sister and by far the closest woman friend of my life owing to circumstance most of my close friends in the last fifteen years had been men there were no other female doctors and the natural gulf between nursing staff and medical staff prevented more than casual acquaintance with other women working at the hospital as for the women in franks circle the departmental secretaries and university wives more than any of that though was the knowledge that of all the people in the world jenny was the one who might love jamie fraser as muchif not morethan i did i was eager to see jenny again but could not help wondering how she would take the story of my supposed escape to france and my apparent desertion of her brother the horses had to follow each other in single file down the narrow track my own bay slowed obligingly as jamies chestnut paused then turned aside at his urging into a clearing halfhidden by an overhang of alder branches a gray stone cliff rose up at the edge of the clearing its cracks and bumps and ridges so furred with moss and lichen that it looked like the face of an ancient man all spotted with whiskers and freckled with warts young ian slid down from his pony with a sigh of relief we had been in the saddle since dawn oof he said frankly rubbing his backside ive gone all numb so have i i said doing the same i suppose its better than being saddlesore though unaccustomed to riding for long stretches both young ian and i had suffered considerably during the first two days of the journey in fact too stiff to dismount by myself the first night i had had to be ignominiously hoisted off my horse and carried into the inn by jamie much to his amusement how does uncle jamie do it ian asked me his arse must be made of leather not to look at i replied absently wheres he gone though the chestnut already hobbled was nibbling at the grass under an oak to one side of the clearing but of jamie himself there was no sign young ian and i looked blankly at each other i shrugged and went over to the cliff face where a trickle of water ran down the rock i cupped my hands beneath it and drank grateful for the cold liquid sliding down my dry throat in spite of the autumn air that reddened my cheeks and numbed my nose this tiny glen clearing invisible from the road was characteristic of most of the highland scenery i thought deceptively barren and severe the crags and moors were full of secrets if you didnt know where you were going you could walk within inches of a deer a grouse or a hiding man and never know it small wonder that many of those who had taken to the heather after culloden had managed to escape their knowledge of the hidden places making them invisible to the blind eyes and clumsy feet of the pursuing english thirst slaked i turned from the cliff face and nearly ran into jamie who had appeared as though sprung out of the earth by magic he was putting his tinderbox back into the pocket of his coat and the faint smell of smoke clung to his coat he dropped a small burnt stick to the grass and ground it to dust with his foot where did you come from i said blinking at this apparition and where have you been theres a wee cave just there he explained jerking a thumb behind him i only wanted to see whether anyones been in it have they looking closely i could see the edge of the outcrop that concealed the caves entrance blending as it did with the other deep cracks in the rock face it wouldnt be visible unless you were deliberately looking for it aye they have he said his brows were slightly furrowed not in worry but as though he were thinking about something theres charcoal mixed wi the earth someones had a fire there who do you think it was i asked i stuck my head around the outcrop but saw nothing but a narrow bar of darkness a small rift in the face of the mountain it looked thoroughly uninviting i wondered whether any of his smuggling connections might have traced him all the way from the coast to lallybroch was he worried about pursuit or an ambush despite myself i looked over my shoulder but saw nothing but the alders dry leaves rustling in the autumn breeze i dinna ken he said absently a hunter i suppose there are grouse bones scattered about too jamie didnt seem perturbed by the unknown persons possible identity and i relaxed the feeling of security engendered by the highlands wrapping itself about me once more both edinburgh and the smugglers cove seemed a long way away young ian fascinated by the revelation of the invisible cave had disappeared through the crevice now he reappeared brushing a cobweb out of his hair is this like clunys cage uncle he asked eyes bright none so big ian jamie answered with a smile poor cluny would scarce fit through the entrance o this one he was a stout big fellow forbye near twice my girth he touched his chest ruefully where a button had been torn loose by squeezing through the narrow entrance whats clunys cage i asked shaking the last drops of icy water from my hands and thrusting them under my armpits to thaw out ohthats cluny macpherson jamie replied he bent his head and splashed the chilly water up into his face lifting his head he blinked the sparkling drops from his lashes and smiled at me a verra ingenious man cluny the english burnt his house and pulled down the foundation but cluny himself escaped he built himself a wee snuggery in a nearby cavern and sealed over the entrance wi willow branches all woven together and chinked wi mud folk said ye could stand three feet away and no notion that the cave was there save the smell of the smoke from clunys pipe prince charles stayed there too for a bit when he was hunted by the english young ian informed me cluny hid him for days the english bastards hunted high and low but never found his highnessor cluny either he concluded with considerable satisfaction come here and wash yourself ian jamie said with a hint of sharpness that made young ian blink ye canna face your parents covered wi filth ian sighed but obediently bent his head over the trickle of water sputtering and gasping as he splashed his face which while not strictly speaking filthy undeniably bore one or two small stains of travel i turned to jamie who stood watching his nephews ablutions with an air of abstraction did he look ahead i wondered to what promised to be an awkward meeting at lallybroch or back to edinburgh with the smoldering remains of his printshop and the dead man in the basement of the brothel or back further still to charles edward stuart and the days of the rising what do you tell your nieces and nephews about him i asked quietly under the noise of ians snorting about charles jamies gaze sharpened and focused on me i had been right then his eyes warmed slightly and the hint of a smile acknowledged the success of my mindreading but then both warmth and smile disappeared i never speak of him he said just as quietly and turned away to catch the horses three hours later we came through the last of the windswept passes and out onto the final slope that led down to lallybroch jamie in the lead drew up his horse and waited for me and young ian to come up beside him there it is he said he glanced at me smiling one eyebrow raised much changed is it i shook my head rapt from this distance the house seemed completely unchanged built of white harled stone its three stories gleamed immaculately amid its cluster of shabby outbuildings and the spread of stonedyked brown fields on the small rise behind the house stood the remains of the ancient broch the circular stone tower that gave the place its name on closer inspection i could see that the outbuildings had changed a bit jamie had told me that the english soldiery had burned the dovecote and the chapel the year after culloden and i could see the gaps where they had been a space where the wall of the kailyard had been broken through had been repaired with stone of a different color and a new shed built of stone and scrap lumber was evidently serving as a dovecote judging from the row of plump feathered bodies lined up on the rooftree enjoying the late autumn sun the rose brier planted by jamies mother ellen had grown up into a great sprawling tangle latticed to the wall of the house only now losing the last of its leaves a plume of smoke rose from the western chimney carrying away toward the south on a wind from the sea i had a sudden vision of the fire in the hearth of the sitting room its light rosy on jennys clearcut face in the evening as she sat in her chair reading aloud from a novel or book of poems while jamie and ian sat absorbed in a game of chess listening with half an ear how many evenings had we spent that way the children upstairs in their beds and me sitting at the rosewood secretary writing down receipts for medicines or doing some of the interminable domestic mending will we live here again do you think i asked jamie careful to keep any trace of longing from my voice more than any other place the house at lallybroch had been home to me but that had been a long time agoand any number of things had changed since then he paused for a long minute considering finally he shook his head gathering up the reins in his hand i canna say sassenach he said it would be pleasant buti dinna ken how things may be aye there was a small frown on his face as he looked down at the house its all right if we live in edinburghor even in franceits all right jamie i looked up into his face and touched his hand in reassurance as long as were together the faint look of worry lifted momentarily lightening his features he took my hand raised it to his lips and kissed it gently i dinna mind much else myself sassenach so long as yell stay by me we sat gazing into each others eyes until a loud selfconscious cough from behind alerted us to young ians presence scrupulously careful of our privacy he had been embarrassingly circumspect on the trip from edinburgh crashing off through the heather to a great distance when we camped and taking remarkable pains so as not inadvertently to surprise us in an indiscreet embrace jamie grinned and squeezed my hand before letting it go and turning to his nephew almost there ian he said as the boy negotiated his pony up beside us well be there well before supper if it doesna rain he added squinting under his hand to gauge the possibilities of the clouds drifting slowly over the monadhliath mountains mmphm young ian didnt sound thrilled at the prospect and i glanced at him sympathetically home is the place where when you have to go there they have to take you in i quoted young ian gave me a wry look aye thats what im afraid of auntie jamie hearing this exchange glanced back at young ian and blinked solemnlyhis own version of an encouraging wink dinna be downhearted ian remember the story o the prodigal son aye your mam will be glad to see ye safe back young ian cast him a glance of profound disillusion if ye expect its the fatted calf thats like to be kilt uncle jamie ye dinna ken my mother so well as ye think the lad sat gnawing his lower lip for a moment then drew himself up in the saddle with a deep breath best get it over aye he said will his parents really be hard on him i asked watching young ian pick his way carefully down the rocky slope jamie shrugged well theyll forgive him of course but hes like to get a rare ballocking and his backside tanned before that ill be lucky to get off wi the same he added wryly jenny and ian are no going to be verra pleased wi me either im afraid he kicked up his mount and started down the slope come along sassenach best get it over aye i wasnt sure what to expect in terms of a reception at lallybroch but in the event it was reassuring as on all previous arrivals our presence was heralded by the barking of a miscellaneous swarm of dogs who galloped out of hedge and field and kailyard yapping first with alarm and then with joy young ian dropped his reins and slid down into the furry sea of welcome dropping into a crouch to greet the dogs who leapt on him and licked his face he stood up smiling with a halfgrown puppy in his arms which he brought over to show me this is jocky he said holding up the squirming brown and white body hes mine da gave him to me nice doggie i told jocky scratching his floppy ears the dog barked and squirmed ecstatically trying to lick me and ian simultaneously youre getting covered wi dog hairs ian said a clear high voice in tones of marked disapproval looking up from the dog i saw a tall slim girl of seventeen or so rising from her seat by the side of the road well youre covered wi foxtails so there young ian retorted swinging about to address the speaker the girl tossed a headful of dark brown curls and bent to brush at her skirt which did indeed sport a number of the bushy grassheads stuck to the homespun fabric da says ye dinna deserve to have a dog she remarked running off and leaving him like ye did young ians face tightened defensively i did think o taking him he said voice cracking slightly but i didna think hed be safe in the city he hugged the dog tighter chin resting between the furry ears hes grown a bit i suppose hes been eating all right come to greet us have ye wee janet thats kind jamies voice spoke pleasantly from behind me but with a cynical note that made the girl glance up sharply and blush at the sight of him uncle jamie oh and her gaze shifted to me and she ducked her head blushing more furiously aye this is your auntie claire jamies hand was firm under my elbow as he nodded toward the girl wee janet wasna born yet last ye were here sassenach your mother will be to home i expect he said addressing janet the girl nodded wideeyed not taking her fascinated gaze from my face i leaned down from my horse and extended a hand smiling im pleased to meet you i said she stared for a long moment then suddenly remembered her manners and dropped into a curtsy she rose and took my hand gingerly as though afraid it might come off in her grasp i squeezed hers and she looked faintly reassured at finding me merely flesh and blood impleased mum she murmured are mam and da verra angry jen young ian gently put the puppy on the ground near her feet breaking her trance she glanced at her younger brother her expression of impatience tinged with some sympathy well and why wouldnt they be clotheid she said mam thought yed maybe met a boar in the wood or been taken by gypsies she scarcely slept until they found out where yed gone she added frowning at her brother ian pressed his lips tight together looking down at the ground but didnt answer she moved closer and picked disapprovingly at the damp yellow leaves adhering to the sleeves of his coat tall as she was he topped her by a good six inches gangly and rawboned next to her trim competence the resemblance between them limited to the rich darkness of their hair and a fugitive similarity of expression youre a sight ian have ye been sleepin in your clothes well of course i have he said impatiently what dye think i ran away wi a nightshirt and changed into it every night on the moor she gave a brief snort of laughter at this picture and his expression of annoyance faded a bit oh come on then gowk she said taking pity on him come into the scullery wi me and well get ye brushed and combed before mam and da see ye he glared at her then turned to look up at me with an expression of mingled bewilderment and annoyance why in the name o heaven he demanded his voice cracking with strain does everyone think bein clean will help jamie grinned at him and dismounting clapped him on the shoulder raising a small cloud of dust it canna hurt anything ian go along wi ye i think perhaps its as well if your parents havena got so many things to deal with all at onceand theyll be wanting to see your auntie first of all mmphm with a morose nod of assent young ian moved reluctantly off toward the back of the house towed by his determined sister what have ye been eating i heard her say squinting up at him as they went youve a great smudge of filth all round your mouth it isna filth its whiskers he hissed furiously under his breath with a quick backward glance to see whether jamie and i had heard this exchange his sister stopped dead peering up at him whiskers she said loudly and incredulously you come on grabbing her by the elbow he hustled her off through the kailyard gate his shoulders hunched in selfconsciousness jamie lowered his head against my thigh face buried in my skirts to the casual observer he might have been occupied in loosening the saddlebags but the casual observer couldnt have seen his shoulders shaking or felt the vibration of his soundless laughter its all right theyre gone i said a moment later gasping for breath myself from the strain of silent mirth jamie raised his face red and breathless from my skirts and used a fold of the cloth to dab his eyes whiskers you he croaked in imitation of his niece setting us both off again he shook his head gulping for air christ shes like her mother thats just what jenny said to me in just that voice when she caught me shavin for the first time i nearly cut my throat he wiped his eyes again on the back of his hand and rubbed a palm tenderly across the thick soft stubble that coated his own jaws and throat with an auburn haze do you want to go and shave yourself before we meet jenny and ian i asked but he shook his head no he said smoothing back the hair that had escaped from its lacing young ians right bein clean wont help they must have heard the dogs outside both ian and jenny were in the sitting room when we came in she on the sofa knitting woolen stockings while he stood before the fire in plain brown coat and breeks warming the backs of his legs a tray of small cakes with a bottle of homebrewed ale was set out plainly in readiness for our arrival it was a very cozy welcoming scene and i felt the tiredness of the journey drop away as we entered the room ian turned at once as we came in selfconscious but smiling but it was jenny that i looked for she was looking for me too she sat still on the couch her eyes wide turned to the door my first impression was that she was quite different the second that she had not changed at all the black curls were still there thick and lively but blanched and streaked with a deep rich silver the bones too were the samethe broad high cheekbones strong jaw and long nose that she shared with jamie it was the flickering firelight and the shadows of the gathering afternoon that gave the strange impression of change one moment deepening the lines beside her eyes and mouth til she looked like a crone the next erasing them with the ruddy glow of girlhood like a d picture in a box of cracker jack on our first meeting in the brothel ian had acted as if i were a ghost jenny did much the same now blinking slightly her mouth slightly open but not otherwise changing expression as i crossed the room toward her jamie was just behind me his hand at my elbow he squeezed it lightly as we reached the sofa then let go i felt rather as though i were being presented at court and resisted the impulse to curtsy were home jenny he said his hand rested reassuringly on my back she glanced quickly at her brother then stared at me again its you then claire her voice was soft and tentative familiar but not the strong voice of the woman i remembered yes its me i said i smiled and reached out my hands to her its good to see you jenny she took my hands lightly then her grip strengthened and she rose to her feet christ it is you she said a little breathless and suddenly the woman i had known was back dark blue eyes alive and dancing searching my face with curiosity well of course it is jamie said gruffly surely ian told ye did ye think he was lying youll scarce have changed she said ignoring her brother as she touched my face wonderingly your hairs a bit lighter but my god ye look the same her fingers were cool her hands smelled of herbs and redcurrant jam and the faint hint of ammonia and lanolin from the dyed wool she was knitting the longforgotten smell of the wool brought everything back at onceso many memories of the place and the happiness of the time i had lived hereand my eyes blurred with tears she saw it and hugged me hard her hair smooth and soft against my face she was much shorter than i fineboned and delicate to look at but still i had the feeling of being enveloped warmly supported and strongly held as though by someone larger than myself she released me after a moment and stood back halflaughing god ye even smell the same she exclaimed and i burst out laughing too ian had come up he leaned down and embraced me gently brushing his lips against my cheek he smelled faintly of dried hay and cabbage leaves with the ghost of peat smoke laid over his own deep musky scent its good to see ye back again claire he said his soft brown eyes smiled at me and the sense of homecoming deepened he stood back a little awkwardly smiling will ye eat something maybe he gestured toward the tray on the table i hesitated a moment but jamie moved toward it with alacrity a drop wouldna come amiss ian thank ye kindly he said youll have some claire glasses were filled the biscuits passed and small spoken pleasantries murmured through mouthfuls as we sat down around the fire despite the outward cordiality i was strongly aware of an underlying tension not all of it to do with my sudden reappearance jamie seated beside me on the oak settle took no more than a sip of his ale and the oatcake sat untasted on his knee i knew he hadnt accepted the refreshments out of hunger but in order to mask the fact that neither his sister nor his brotherinlaw had offered him a welcoming embrace i caught a quick glance passing between ian and jenny and a longer stare unreadable exchanged between jenny and jamie a stranger here in more ways than one i kept my own eyes cast down observing under the shelter of my lashes jamie sat to my left i could feel the tiny movement between us as the two stiff fingers of his right hand drummed their small tattoo against his thigh the conversation what there was of it petered out and the room fell into an uncomfortable silence through the faint hissing of the peat fire i could hear a few distant thumps in the direction of the kitchen but nothing like the sounds i remembered in this house of constant activity and bustling movement feet always pounding on the stair and the shouts of children and squalling of babies splitting the air in the nursery overhead how are all of your children i asked jenny to break the silence she started and i realized that i had inadvertently asked the wrong question oh theyre well enough she replied hesitantly all verra bonny and the grandchildren too she added breaking into a sudden smile at the thought of them theyve mostly gone to young jamies house ian put in answering my real question his wifes had a new babe just the week past so the three girls have gone to help a bit and michaels up in inverness just now to fetch down some things come in from france another glance flicked across the room this one between ian and jamie i felt the small tilt of jamies head and saw ians notquitenod in response and what in hell was that about i wondered there were so many invisible crosscurrents of emotion in the room that i had a sudden impulse to stand up and call the meeting to order just to break the tension apparently jamie felt the same he cleared his throat looking directly at ian and addressed the main point on the agenda saying weve brought the lad home with us ian took a deep breath his long homely face hardening slightly have ye then the thin layer of pleasantry spread over the occasion vanished suddenly like morning dew i could feel jamie beside me tensing slightly as he prepared to defend his nephew as best he might hes a good lad ian he said is he so it was jenny who answered her fine black brows drawn down in a frown ye couldna tell the way he acts at home but perhaps hes different wi you jamie there was a strong note of accusation in her words and i felt jamie tense at my side its kind of ye to speak up for the lad jamie ian put in with a cool nod in his brotherinlaws direction but i think wed best hear from young ian himself if ye please will he be upstairs a muscle near jamies mouth twitched but he answered noncommittally in the scullery i expect he wanted to tidy himself a bit before seein ye his right hand slid down and pressed against my leg in warning he hadnt mentioned meeting janet and i understood she had been sent away with her siblings so that jenny and ian could deal with the matters of my appearance and their prodigal son in some privacy but had crept back unbeknownst to her parents wanting either to catch a glimpse of her notorious aunt claire or to offer succor to her brother i lowered my eyelids indicating that i understood no point in mentioning the girls presence in a situation already so fraught with tension the sound of feet and the regular thump of ians wooden leg sounded in the uncarpeted passage ian had left the room in the direction of the scullery now he returned grimly ushering young ian before him the prodigal was as presentable as soap water and razor could make him his bony jaws were reddened with scraping and the hair on his neck was clotted in wet spikes most of the dust beaten from his coat and the round neck of his shirt neatly buttoned to the collarbone there was little to be done about the singed half of his head but the other side was neatly combed he had no stock and there was a large rip in the leg of his breeks but all things considered he looked as well as someone could who expects momentarily to be shot mam he said ducking his head awkwardly in his mothers direction ian she said softly and he looked up at her clearly startled at the gentleness of her tone a slight smile curved her lips as she saw his face im glad youre safe home mo chridhe she said the boys face cleared abruptly as though he had just heard the reprieve read to the firing squad then he caught a glimpse of his fathers face and stiffened he swallowed hard and bent his head again staring hard at the floorboards mmphm ian said he sounded sternly scotch much more like the reverend campbell than the easygoing man i had known before now then i want to hear what yeve got to say for yourself laddie oh welli young ian trailed off miserably then cleared his throat and had another try wellnothing really father he murmured look at me ian said sharply his son reluctantly raised his head and looked at his father but his gaze kept flicking away as though afraid to rest very long on the stern countenance before him dye ken what ye did to your mother ian demanded disappeared and left her thinkin ye dead or hurt gone off without a word and not a smell of ye for three days until joe fraser brought down the letter ye left can ye even think what those three days were like for her either ians expression or his words seemed to have a strong effect on his errant offspring young ian bowed his head again eyes fixed on the floor aye well i thought joe would bring the letter sooner he muttered aye that letter ians face was growing more flushed as he talked gone to edinburgh it said cool as dammit he slapped a hand flat on the table with a smack that made everyone jump gone to edinburgh not a by your leave not an ill send word not a thing but dear mother i have gone to edinburgh ian young ians head snapped up eyes bright with anger thats not true i said dont worry for me and i said love ian i did did i no mother for the first time he looked at jenny appealing she had been still as a stone since her husband began to talk her face smooth and blank now her eyes softened and the hint of a curve touched her wide full mouth again ye did ian she said softly it was kind to saybut i did worry aye his eyes fell and i could see the oversized adams apple bobble in his lean throat as he swallowed im sorry mam he said so low i could scarcely hear him ii didna mean his words trailed off ending in a small shrug jenny made an impulsive movement as though to extend a hand to him but ian caught her eye and she let the hand fall to her lap the thing is ian said speaking slowly and precisely its no the first time is it ian the boy didnt answer but made a small twitching movement that might have been assent ian took a step closer to his son close as they were in height the differences between them were obvious ian was tall and lanky but firmly muscled for all that and a powerful man wooden leg or no by comparison his son seemed almost frail fledglingboned and gawky no its not as though ye had no idea what ye were doing not like wed never told ye the dangers not like wed no forbidden ye to go past broch mordhanot like ye didna ken wed worry aye ye kent all thatand ye did it anyway this merciless analysis of his behavior caused a sort of indefinite quiver like an internal squirm to go through young ian but he kept up a stubborn silence look at me laddie when im speakin to ye the boys head rose slowly he looked sullen now but resigned evidently he had been through scenes like this before and knew where they were heading im not even going to ask your uncle what yeve been doing ian said i can only hope ye werent such a fool in edinburgh as yeve been here but yeve disobeyed me outright and broken your mothers heart whatever else yeve done jenny moved again as though to speak but a brusque movement of ians hand stopped her and what did i tell ye the last time wee ian what did i say when i gave ye your whipping you tell me that ian the bones in young ians face stood out but he kept his mouth shut sealed in a stubborn line tell me ian roared slamming his hand on the table again young ian blinked in reflex and his shoulder blades drew together then apart as though he were trying to alter his size and unsure whether to grow larger or try to be smaller he swallowed hard and blinked once more ye saidye said yed skin me next time his voice broke in a ridiculous squeak on the last word and he clamped his mouth hard shut on it ian shook his head in heavy disapproval aye and i thought yed have enough sense to see there was no next time but i was wrong about that hm he breathed in heavily and let it out with a snort im fair disgusted wi ye ian and thats the truth he jerked his head toward the doorway go outside ill see ye by the gate presently there was a tense silence in the sitting room as the sound of the miscreants dragging footsteps disappeared down the passage i kept my own eyes carefully on my hands folded in my lap beside me jamie drew a slow deep breath and sat up straighter steeling himself ian jamie spoke mildly to his brotherinlaw i wish ye wouldna do that what ians brow was still furrowed with anger as he turned toward jamie thrash the lad and what have you to say about it aye jamies jaw tensed but his voice stayed calm ive nothing to say about it ianhes your son youll do as ye like but maybe youll let me speak for the way hes acted how hes acted jenny cried starting suddenly to life she might leave dealing with her son to ian but when it came to her brother no one was likely to speak for her sneakin away in the night like a thief ye mean or perhaps yell mean consorting wi criminals and risking his neck for a cask of brandy ian silenced her with a quick gesture he hesitated still frowning but then nodded abruptly at jamie giving permission consorting wi criminals like me jamie asked his sister a definite edge to his voice his eyes met hers straight on matching slits of blue dye ken where the money comes from jenny that keeps you and your bairns and everyone here in food and the roof from fallin in over your head its not from me printing up copies o the psalms in edinburgh and did i think it was she flared at him did i ask ye what ye did no ye didnt he flashed back i think yed rather not knowbut ye do know dont you and will ye blame me for what ye do its my fault that ive children and that they must eat she didnt flush red like jamie did when jenny lost her temper she went dead white with fury i could see him struggling to keep his own temper blame ye no of course i dinna blame yebut is it right for you to blame me that ian and i canna keep ye all just working the land jenny too was making an effort to subdue her rising temper no she said ye do what ye must jamie ye ken verra well i didna mean you when i said criminals but so ye mean the men who work for me i do the same things jenny if theyre criminals what am i then he glared at her eyes hot with resentment youre my brother she said shortly little pleased as i am to say so sometimes damn your eyes jamie fraser ye ken quite well i dinna mean to quarrel wi whatever ye see fit to do if ye robbed folk on the highway or kept a whorehouse in edinburgh twould be because there was no help for it that doesna mean i want ye takin my son to be part of it jamies eyes tightened slightly at the corners at the mention of whorehouses in edinburgh and he darted a quick glance of accusation at ian who shook his head he looked mildly stunned at his wifes ferocity ive said not a word he said briefly ye ken how she is jamie took a deep breath and turned back to jenny obviously determined to be reasonable aye i see that but ye canna think i would take young ian into dangergod jenny i care for him as though he were my own son aye her skepticism was pronounced so thats why ye encouraged him to run off from his home and kept him with ye wi no word to ease our minds about where he was jamie had the grace to look abashed at this aye well im sorry for that he muttered i meant to he broke off with an impatient gesture well it doesna matter what i meant i should have sent word and i didna but as for encouraging him to run off no i dinna suppose ye did ian interrupted not directly anyway the anger had faded from his long face he looked tired now and a little sad the bones in his face were more pronounced leaving him hollowcheeked in the waning afternoon light its only that the lad loves ye jamie he said quietly i see him listen when ye visit and talk of what ye do i can see his face he thinks its all excitement and adventure how ye live and a good long way from shoveling goatshit for his mothers garden he smiled briefly despite himself jamie gave his brotherinlaw a quick smile in return and a lifted shoulder well but its usual for a lad of that age to want a bit of adventure no you and i were the same whether he wants it or no he shouldna be having the sort of adventures hell get with you jenny interrupted sharply she shook her head the line between her brows growing deeper as she looked disapprovingly at her brother the good lord kens as theres a charm on your life jamie or yed ha been dead a dozen times aye well i suppose he had something in mind to preserve me for jamie glanced at me with a brief smile and his hand sought mine jenny darted a glance at me too her face unreadable then returned to the subject at hand well thats as may be she said but i canna say as the sames true for young ian her expression softened slightly as she looked at jamie i dinna ken everything about the way ye live jamiebut i ken you well enough to say its likely not the way a wee laddie should live mmphm jamie rubbed a hand over his stubbled jaw and tried again aye well thats what i mean about young ian hes carried himself like a man this last week i dinna think it right for ye to thrash him like a wee laddie ian jennys eyebrows rose graceful wings of scorn a man now is he why hes but a baby jamiehes not but fourteen despite his annoyance one side of jamies mouth curled slightly i was a man at fourteen jenny he said softly she snorted but a film of moisture shone suddenly over her eyes ye thought ye were she stood and turned away abruptly blinking aye i mind ye then she said face turned to the bookshelf she reached out a hand as though to support herself grasping the edge ye were a bonny lad jamie riding off wi dougal to your first raid and your dirk all bright on your thigh i was sixteen and i thought id never seen a sight so fair as you on your pony so straight and tall and i mind ye coming back too all covered in mud and a scratch down the side of your face from falling in brambles and dougal boasting to da how brawly yed donedriven off six kine by yourself and had a dunt on the head from the flat of a broadsword and not made a squeak about it her face once more under control she turned back from her contemplation of the books to face her brother thats what a man is aye a hint of humor stole back into jamies face as he met her gaze aye well theres maybe a bit more to it than that he said is there she said more dryly still and what will that be to be able to bed a girl or to kill a man i had always thought janet fraser had something of the sight particularly where her brother was concerned evidently the talent extended to her son as well the flush over jamies cheekbones deepened but his expression didnt change she shook her head slowly looking steadily at her brother nay young ians not a man yetbut you are jamie and ye ken the difference verra well ian who had been watching the fireworks between the two frasers with the same fascination as i had now coughed briefly be that as it may he said dryly young ians been waiting for his whipping for the last quarterhour whether or not its suitable to beat him to make him wait any longer for it is a bit cruel aye have ye really got to do it ian jamie made one last effort turning to appeal to his brotherinlaw well said ian slowly as ive told the lad hes going to be thrashed and he kens verra well hes earned it i canna just go back on my word but as for me doing itno i dinna think i will a faint gleam of humor showed in the soft brown eyes he reached into a drawer of the sideboard drew out a thick leather strap and thrust it into jamies hand you do it me jamie was horrorstruck he made a futile attempt to shove the strap back into ians hand but his brotherinlaw ignored it i canna thrash the lad oh i think ye can ian said calmly folding his arms yeve said often enough ye care for him as though he were your son he tilted his head to one side and while his expression stayed mild the brown eyes were implacable well ill tell ye jamieits no that easy to be his da best ye go and find that out now aye jamie stared at ian for a long moment then looked to his sister she raised one eyebrow staring him down you deserve it as much as he does jamie get ye gone jamies lips pressed tight together and his nostrils flared white then he whirled on his heel and was gone without speaking rapid steps sounded on the boards and a muffled slam came from the far end of the passage jenny cast a quick glance at ian a quicker one at me and then turned to the window ian and i both a good deal taller came to stand behind her the light outside was failing rapidly but there was still enough to see the wilting figure of young ian leaning dispiritedly against a wooden gate some twenty yards from the house looking around in trepidation at the sound of footsteps he saw his uncle approaching and straightened up in surprise uncle jamie his eye fell on the strap then and he straightened a bit more areare you goin to whip me it was a still evening and i could hear the sharp hiss of air through jamies teeth i suppose ill have to he said frankly but first i must apologize to ye ian to me young ian sounded mildly dazed clearly he wasnt used to having his elders think they owed him an apology especially before beating him ye dinna need to do that uncle jamie the taller figure leaned against the gate facing the smaller one head bent aye i do it was wrong of me ian to let ye stay in edinburgh and it was maybe wrong too to tell ye stories and make ye think of running away to start with i took ye to places i shouldna and might have put ye in danger and ive caused more of a moil wi your parents than maybe ye should be in by yourself im sorry for it ian and ill ask ye to forgive me oh the smaller figure rubbed a hand through his hair plainly at a loss for words wellaye of course i do uncle thank ye ian they stood in silence for a moment then young ian heaved a sigh and straightened his drooping shoulders i suppose wed best do it then i expect so jamie sounded at least as reluctant as his nephew and i heard ian next to me snort slightly whether with indignation or amusement i couldnt tell resigned young ian turned and faced the gate without hesitation jamie followed more slowly the light was nearly gone and we could see no more than the outlines of figures at this distance but we could hear clearly from our position at the window jamie was standing behind his nephew shifting uncertainly as though unsure what to do next mmphm ah what does your father its usually ten uncle young ian had shed his coat and tugged at his waist now speaking over his shoulder twelve if its pretty bad and fifteen if its really awful was this only bad would ye say or pretty bad there was a brief unwilling laugh from the boy if fathers makin you do it uncle jamie its really awful but ill settle for pretty bad yed better give me twelve there was another snort from ian at my elbow this time it was definitely amusement honest lad he murmured all right then jamie drew in his breath and pulled his arm back but was interrupted by young ian wait uncle im no quite ready och yeve got to do that jamies voice sounded a bit strangled aye father says only girls are whipped wi their skirts down young ian explained men must take it barearsed hes damn well right about that one jamie muttered his quarrel with jenny obviously still rankling ready now the necessary adjustments made the larger figure stepped back and swung there was a loud crack and jenny winced in sympathy with her son beyond a sudden intake of breath though the lad was silent and stayed so through the rest of the ordeal though i blanched a bit myself finally jamie dropped his arm and wiped his brow he held out a hand to ian slumped over the fence all right lad young ian straightened up with a little difficulty this time and pulled up his breeks aye uncle thank ye the boys voice was a little thick but calm and steady he took jamies outstretched hand to my surprise though instead of leading the boy back to the house jamie thrust the strap into ians other hand your turn he announced striding over to the gate and bending over young ian was as shocked as those of us in the house what he said stunned i said its your turn his uncle said in a firm voice i punished you now youve got to punish me i canna do that uncle young ian was as scandalized as though his uncle had suggested he commit some public indecency aye ye can said jamie straightening up to look his nephew in the eye ye heard what i said when i apologized to ye did ye no ian nodded in a dazed fashion weel then ive done wrong just as much as you and ive to pay for it too i didna like whipping you and yere no goin to like whipping me but were both goin through wi it understand aaye uncle the boy stammered all right then jamie tugged down his breeches tucked up his shirttail and bent over once more clutching the top rail he waited a second then spoke again as ian stood paralyzed strap dangling from his nerveless hand go on his voice was steel the one he used with the whisky smugglers not to obey was unthinkable ian moved timidly to do as he was ordered standing back he took a halfhearted swing there was a dull thwacking sound that one didna count jamie said firmly look man it was just as hard for me to do it to you make a proper job of it now the thin figure squared its shoulders with sudden determination and the leather whistled through the air it landed with a crack like lightning there was a startled yelp from the figure on the fence and a suppressed giggle at least half shock from jenny jamie cleared his throat aye thatll do finish it then we could hear young ian counting carefully to himself under his breath between strokes of the leather but aside from a smothered christ at number nine there was no further sound from his uncle with a general sigh of relief from inside the house jamie rose off the fence after the last stroke and tucked his shirt into his breeks he inclined his head formally to his nephew thank ye ian dropping the formality he then rubbed his backside saying in a tone of rueful admiration christ man yeve an arm on ye sove you uncle said ian matching his uncles wry tones the two figures barely visible now stood laughing and rubbing themselves for a moment jamie flung an arm about his nephews shoulders and turned him toward the house if its all the same to you ian i dinna want to have to do that again aye he said confidentially its a bargain uncle jamie a moment later the door opened at the end of the passage and with a look at each other jenny and ian turned as one to greet the returning prodigals buried treasure you look rather like a baboon i observed oh aye and whats one of those in spite of the freezing november air pouring in through the halfopen window jamie showed no signs of discomfort as he dropped his shirt onto the small pile of clothing he stretched luxuriously completely naked his joints made little popping noises as he arched his back and stretched upward fists resting easily on the smokedark beams overhead oh god it feels good not to be on a horse mm to say nothing of having a real bed to sleep in instead of wet heather i rolled over luxuriating in the warmth of the heavy quilts and the relaxation of sore muscles into the ineffable softness of the goosedown mattress dye mean to tell me whats a baboon then jamie inquired or are ye just makin observations for the pleasure of it he turned to pick up a frayed willow twig from the washstand and began to clean his teeth i smiled at the sight if i had had no other impact during my earlier sojourn in the past i had at least been instrumental in seeing that virtually all of the frasers and murrays of lallybroch retained their teeth unlike most highlandersunlike most englishmen for that matter a baboon i said enjoying the sight of his muscular back flexing as he scrubbed is a sort of very large monkey with a red behind he snorted with laughter and choked on the willow twig well he said removing it from his mouth i canna fault your observations sassenach he grinned at me showing brilliant white teeth and tossed the twig aside its been thirty years since anyone took a tawse to me he added passing his hands tenderly over the stillglowing surfaces of his rear id forgot how much it stings and here young ian was speculating that your arse was tough as saddle leather i said amused was it worth it do you think oh aye he said matteroffactly sliding into bed beside me his body was hard and cold as marble and i squeaked but didnt protest as he gathered me firmly against his chest christ youre warm he murmured come closer hm his legs insinuated themselves between mine and he cupped my bottom drawing me in he gave a sigh of pure content and i relaxed against him feeling our temperatures start to equalize through the thin cotton of the nightdress jenny had lent me the peat fire in the hearth had been lit but hadnt been able to do much yet toward dispelling the chill body heat was much more effective oh aye it was worth it he said i could have beaten young ian halfsenselesshis father has once or twiceand it would ha done nothing but make him more determined to run off once he got the chance but hell walk through hot coals before he risks havin to do something like that again he spoke with certainty and i thought he was undoubtedly right young ian looking bemused had received absolution from his parents in the form of a kiss from his mother and a swift hug from his father and then retired to his bed with a handful of cakes there no doubt to ponder the curious consequences of disobedience jamie too had been absolved with kisses and i suspected that this was more important to him than the effects of his performance on young ian at least jenny and ian arent angry with you any longer i said no its no really that they were angry so much i think its only that they dinna ken what to do wi the lad he explained theyve raised two sons already and young jamie and michael are fine lads both but both of them are more like iansoftspoke and easy in their manner young ians quiet enough but hes a great deal more like his motherand me frasers are stubborn eh i said smiling this bit of clan doctrine was one of the first things i had learned when i met jamie and nothing in my subsequent experience had suggested that it might be in error he chuckled soft and deep in his chest aye thats so young ian may look like a murray but hes a fraser born all right and its no use to shout at a stubborn man or beat him either it only makes him more set on having his way ill bear that in mind i said dryly one hand was stroking my thigh gradually inching the cotton nightdress upward jamies internal furnace had resumed its operations and his bare legs were warm and hard against mine one knee nudged gently seeking an entrance between my thighs i cupped his buttocks and squeezed gently dorcas told me that a number of gentlemen pay very well for the privilege of being smacked at the brothel she says they find itarousing jamie snorted briefly tensing his buttocks then relaxing as i stroked them lightly do they then i suppose its true if dorcas says so but i canna see it myself there are a great many more pleasant ways to get a cockstand if ye ask me on the other hand he added fairly perhaps it makes a difference if its a bonny wee lassie in her shift on the other end o the strap and not your fatheror your nephew come to that perhaps it does shall i try sometime the hollow of his throat lay just by my face sunburned and delicate showing the faint white triangle of a scar just above the wide arch of his collarbone i set my lips on the pulsebeat there and he shivered though neither of us was cold any longer no he said a little breathless his hand fumbled at the neck of my shift pulling loose the ribbons he rolled onto his back then lifting me suddenly above him as though i weighed nothing at all a flick of his finger brought the loosened chemise down over my shoulders and my nipples rose at once as the cold air struck them his eyes were more slanted than usual as he smiled up at me halflidded as a drowsing cat and the warmth of his palms encircled both breasts i said i could think of more pleasant ways aye the candle had guttered and gone out the fire on the hearth burned low and a pale november starlight shone through the misted window dim as it was my eyes were so adapted to the dark that i could pick out all the details of the room the thick white porcelain jug and basin its blue band black in the starlight the small embroidered sampler on the wall and the rumpled heap of jamies clothes on the stool by the bed jamie was clearly visible too covers thrown back chest gleaming faintly from exertion i admired the long slope of his belly where small whorls of dark auburn hair spiraled up across the pale fresh skin i couldnt keep my fingers from touching him tracing the lines of the powerfully sprung ribs that shaped his torso its so good i said dreamily so good to have a mans body to touch dye like it still then he sounded halfshy halfpleased as i fondled him his own arm came around my shoulder stroking my hair mmhm it wasnt a thing i had consciously missed but having it now reminded me of the joy of it that drowsy intimacy in which a mans body is as accessible to you as your own the strange shapes and textures of it like a sudden extension of your own limbs i ran my hand down the flat slope of his belly over the smooth jut of hipbone and the swell of muscled thigh the remnants of firelight caught the redgold fuzz on arms and legs and glowed in the auburn thicket nested between his thighs god you are a wonderful hairy creature i said even there i slid my hand down the smooth crease of his thigh and he spread his legs obligingly letting me touch the thick springy curls in the crease of his buttocks aye well no ones hunted me yet for my pelt he said comfortably his hand cupped my own rear firmly and a large thumb passed gently over the rounded surface he propped one arm behind his head and looked lazily down the length of my body youre even less worth the skinning than i am sassenach i should hope so i moved slightly to accommodate his touch as he extended his explorations enjoying the warmth of his hand on my naked back ever seen a smooth branch thats been in still water a long time he asked a finger passed lightly up my spine raising a ripple of gooseflesh in its wake there are tiny wee bubbles on it hundreds and thousands and millions of them so it looks as though its furred all about wi a silver frost his fingers brushed my ribs my arms my back and the tiny downhairs rose everywhere in the wake of his touch tingling thats what ye look like my sassenach he said almost whispering all smooth and naked dipped in silver then we lay quiet for a time listening to the drip of rain outside a cold autumn air drifted through the room mingling with the fires smoky warmth he rolled onto his side facing away from me and drew the quilts up to cover us i curled up behind him knees fitting neatly behind his own the firelight shone dully from behind me now gleaming over the smooth round of his shoulder and dimly illuminating his back i could see the faint lines of the scars that webbed his shoulders thin streaks of silver on his flesh at one time i had known those scars so intimately i could have traced them with my fingers blindfolded now there was a thin halfmoon curve i didnt know a diagonal slash that hadnt been there before the remnants of a violent past i hadnt shared i touched the halfmoon tracing its length no ones hunted you for your pelt i said softly but theyve hunted you havent they his shoulder moved slightly not quite a shrug now and then he said now i asked he breathed slowly for a moment or two before answering aye he said i think so my fingers moved down to the diagonal slash it had been a deep cut old and wellhealed as the damage was the line was sharp and clear beneath my fingertips do you know who no he was quiet for a moment then his hand closed over my own where it lay across his stomach but i maybe ken why the house was very quiet with most of the children and grandchildren gone there were only the faroff servants in their quarters behind the kitchen ian and jenny in their room at the far end of the hall and young ian somewhere upstairsall asleep we could have been alone at the end of the world both edinburgh and the smugglers cove seemed very far away do ye recall after the fall of stirling not so long before culloden when all of a sudden there was gossip from everywhere about gold being sent from france from louis yesbut he never sent it jamies words summoned up those brief frantic days of charles stuarts reckless rise and precipitous fall when rumor had been the common currency of conversation there was always gossipabout gold from france ships from spain weapons from hollandbut nothing came of most of it oh something camethough not from louisbut no one kent it then he told me then of his meeting with the dying duncan kerr and the wanderers whispered words heard in the inns attic under the watchful eye of an english officer he was fevered duncan but not crazed wi it he kent he was dying and he kent me too it was his only chance to tell someone he thought he could trustso he told me white witches and seals i repeated i must say it sounds like gibberish but you understood it well not all of it jamie admitted he rolled over to face me frowning slightly ive no notion who the white witch might be at the first i thought he meant you sassenach and my heart nearly stopped when he said it he smiled ruefully and his hand tightened on mine clasped between us i thought all at once that perhaps something had gone wrongmaybe yed not been able to go back to frank and the place ye came frommaybe yed somehow ended in france maybe ye were there right thenall kinds o fancies went through my head i wish it had been true i whispered he gave me a lopsided smile but shook his head and me in prison and brianna would be whatjust ten or so no dinna waste your time in regretting sassenach youre here now and yell never leave me again he kissed me gently on the forehead then resumed his tale i didna have any idea where the gold had come from but i kent his telling me where it was and why it was there it was prince tearlachs sent for him and the bit about the silkies he raised his head a little and nodded toward the window where the rose brier cast its shadows on the glass folk said when my mother ran away from leoch that shed gone to live wi the silkies only because the maid that saw my father when he took her said as he looked like a great silkie whod shed his skin and come to walk on the land like a man and he did jamie smiled and passed a hand through his own thick hair remembering he had hair thick as mine but a black like jet it would shine in some lights as though it was wet and he moved quick and sleekit like a seal through the water he shrugged suddenly shaking off the recollection of his father well so when duncan kerr said the name ellen i kent it was my mother he meantas a sign that he knew my name and my family kent who i was that he wasna raving no matter how it sounded and knowin that he shrugged again the englishman had told me where they found duncan near the coast there are hundreds of bittie isles and rocks all down that coast but only one place where the silkies live at the ends of the mackenzie lands off coigach so you went there aye i did he sighed deeply his free hand drifting to the hollow of my waist i wouldna have done itleft the prison i meanhad i not still thought it maybe had something to do wi you sassenach escape had been an enterprise of no great difficulty prisoners were often taken outside in small gangs to cut the peats that burned on the prisons hearths or to cut and haul stone for the ongoing work of repairing the walls for a man to whom the heather was home disappearing had been easy he had risen from his work and turned aside by a hummock of grass unfastening his breeches as though to relieve himself the guard had looked politely away and looking back a moment later beheld nothing but an empty moor holding no trace of jamie fraser see it was little trouble to slip off but men seldom did he explained none of us were from near ardsmuirand had we been there was little left for most o the men to gang to the duke of cumberlands men had done their work well as one contemporary had put it evaluating the dukes achievement later he created a desert and called it peace this modern approach to diplomacy had left some parts of the highlands all but deserted the men killed imprisoned or transported crops and houses burned the women and children turned out to starve or seek refuge elsewhere as best they might no a prisoner escaping from ardsmuir would have been truly alone without kin or clan to turn to for succor jamie had known there would be little time before the english commander realized where he must be heading and organized a party of pursuit on the other hand there were no real roads in this remote part of the kingdom and a man who knew the country was at a greater advantage on foot than were the pursuing outlanders on horseback he had made his escape in midafternoon taking his bearings by the stars he had walked through the night arriving at the coast near dawn the next day see i kent the silkies place its well known amongst the mackenzies and id been there once before wi dougal the tide had been high and the seals mostly out in the water hunting crabs and fish among the fronds of floating kelp but the dark streaks of their droppings and the indolent forms of a few idlers marked the seals three islands ranged in a line just inside the lip of a small bay guarded by a clifflike headland by jamies interpretation of duncans instructions the treasure lay on the third island the farthest away from the shore it was nearly a mile out a long swim even for a strong man and his own strength was sapped from the hard prison labor and the long walk without food he had stood on the clifftop wondering whether this was a wildgoose chase and whether the treasureif there was onewas worth the risk of his life the rock was all split and broken there when i came too close to the edge chunks would fall awa from my feet and plummet down the cliff i didna see how id ever reach the water let alone the seals isle but then i was minded what duncan said about ellens tower jamie said his eyes were open fixed not on me but on that distant shore where the crash of falling rock was lost in the smashing of the waves the tower was there a small spike of granite that stuck up no more than five feet from the tip of the headland but below that spike hidden by the rocks was a narrow crack a small chimney that ran from top to bottom of the eightyfoot cliff providing a possible passage if not an easy one for a determined man from the base of ellens tower to the third island was still over a quartermile of heaving green water undressing he had crossed himself and commending his soul to the keeping of his mother he had dived naked into the waves he made his way slowly out from the cliff floundering and choking as the waves broke over his head no place in scotland is that far from the sea but jamie had been raised inland his experience of swimming limited to the placid depths of lochs and the pools of trout streams blinded by salt and deafened by the roaring surf he had fought the waves for what seemed hours then thrust his head and shoulders free gasping for breath only to see the headland loomingnot behind as he had thought but to his right the tide was goin out and i was goin with it he said wryly i thought well thats it then im gone for i knew i could never make my way back i hadna eaten anything in two days and hadnt much strength left he ceased swimming then and simply spread himself on his back giving himself to the embrace of the sea lightheaded from hunger and effort he had closed his eyes against the light and searched his mind for the words of the old celtic prayer against drowning he paused for a moment then and was quiet for so long that i wondered whether something was wrong but at last he drew breath and said shyly i expect yell think im daft sassenach i havena told anyone about itnot even jenny buti heard my mother call me then right in the middle of praying he shrugged uncomfortable it was maybe only that id been thinking of her when i left the shore he said and yet he fell silent until i touched his face what did she say i asked quietly she said come here to me jamiecome to me laddie he drew a deep breath and let it out slowly i could hear her plain as day but i couldna see anything there was no one there not even a silkie i thought perhaps she was callin me from heavenand i was so tired i really would not ha minded dying then but i rolled myself over and struck out toward where id heard her voice i thought i would swim ten strokes and then stop again to restor to sink but on the eighth stroke the current had taken him it was just as though someone had picked me up he said sounding still surprised at the memory of it i could feel it under me and all around the water was a bit warmer than it had been and it carried me with it i didna have to do anything but paddle a bit to keep my head above water a strong curling current eddying between headland and islands it had taken him to the edge of the third islet where no more than a few strokes brought him within reach of its rocks it was a small lump of granite fissured and creviced like all the ancient rocks of scotland and slimed with seaweed and seal droppings to boot but he crawled on shore with all the thankfulness of a shipwrecked sailor for a land of palm trees and whitesand beaches he fell down upon his face on the rocky shelf and lay there grateful for breath halfdozing with exhaustion then i felt something looming over me and there was a terrible stink o dead fish he said i got up onto my knees at once and there he wasa great bull seal all sleek and wet and his black eyes starin at me no more than a yard away neither fisher nor seaman himself jamie had heard enough stories to know that bull seals were dangerous particularly when threatened by intrusions upon their territory looking at the open mouth with its fine display of sharp peglike teeth and the burly rolls of hard fat that girdled the enormous body he was not disposed to doubt it he weighed more than twenty stone sassenach he said if he wasna inclined to rip the flesh off my bones still he could ha knocked me into the sea wi one swipe or dragged me under to drown obviously he didnt though i said dryly what happened he laughed i think i was too mazed from tiredness to do anything sensible he said i just looked at him for a moment and then i said its all right its only me and what did the seal do jamie shrugged slightly he looked me over for a bit longersilkies dinna blink much did ye know that its verra unnerving to have one look at ye for longthen he gave a sort of a grunt and slid off the rock into the water left in sole possession of the tiny islet jamie had sat blankly for a time recovering his strength and then at last began a methodical search of the crevices small as the area was it took little time to find a deep split in the rock that led down to a wide hollow space a foot below the rocky surface floored with dry sand and located in the center of the island the hollow would be safe from flooding in all but the worst storms well dont keep me in suspense i said poking him in the stomach was the french gold there well it was and it wasnt sassenach he answered neatly sucking in his stomach id been expecting gold bullion thats what the rumor said that louis would send and thirty thousand pounds worth of gold bullion would make a goodsized hoard but all there was in the hollow was a box less than a foot long and a small leather pouch the box did have gold in it thoughand silver too gold and silver indeed the wooden box had contained two hundred and five coins gold ones and silver ones some as sharply cut as though newminted some with their markings worn nearly to blankness ancient coins sassenach ancient what you mean very old greek sassenach and roman verra old indeed we lay staring at each other in the dim light for a moment not speaking thats incredible i said at last its treasure all right but not not what louis would send to help feed an army no he finished for me no whoever put this treasure there it wasna louis or any of his ministers what about the bag i said suddenly remembering what was in the pouch you found stones sassenach gemstones diamonds and pearls and emeralds and sapphires not many but nicely cut and big enough he smiled a little grimly aye big enough he had sat on a rock under the dim gray sky turning the coins and the jewels over and over between his fingers stunned into bewilderment at last roused by a sensation of being watched he had looked up to find himself surrounded by a circle of curious seals the tide was out the females had come back from their fishing and twenty pairs of round black eyes surveyed him cautiously the huge black male emboldened by the presence of his harem had come back too he barked loudly darting his head threateningly from side to side and advanced on jamie sliding his threehundredpound bulk a few feet closer with each booming exclamation propelling himself with his flippers across the slick rock i thought id best leave then he said id found what i came to find after all so i put the box and the pouch back where id found themi couldna carry them ashore after all and if i didwhat then so i put them back and crawled down into the water halffrozen wi cold a few strokes from the island had taken him again into the current heading landward it was a circular current like most eddies and the gyre had carried him to the foot of the headland within half an hour where he crawled ashore dressed and fell asleep in a nest of marrow grass he paused then and i could see that while his eyes were open and fixed on me it wasnt me they saw i woke at dawn he said softly i have seen a great many dawns sassenach but never one like that one i could feel the earth turn beneath me and my own breath coming wi the breathing of the wind it was as though i had no skin nor bone but only the light of the rising sun inside me his eyes softened as he left the moor and came back to me so then the sun came up higher he said matteroffactly and when it warmed me enough to stand i got up and went inland toward the road to meet the english but why did you go back i demanded you were free you had money and and where would i spend such money as that sassenach he asked walk into a cottars hearth and offer him a gold denarius or a wee emerald he smiled at my indignation and shook his head nay he said gently i had to go back aye i could ha lived on the moor for a timehalfstarved and naked but i might have managed but they were hunting me sassenach and hunting hard for thinking that i might know where the gold was hid no cot near ardsmuir would be safe from the english so long as i was free and might be thought to seek refuge there ive seen the english hunting ye ken he added a harder note creeping into his voice yell have seen the panel in the entry hall i had one panel of the glowing oak that lined the hall below had been smashed in perhaps by a heavy boot and the crisscross scars of saber slashes marred the paneling from door to stairs we keep it so to remember he said to show to the weans and tell them when they askthis is what the english are the suppressed hate in his voice struck me low in the pit of the stomach knowing what i knew of what the english army had done in the highlands there was bloody little i could say in argument i said nothing and he continued after a moment i wouldna expose the folk near ardsmuir to that kind of attention sassenach at the word sassenach his hand squeezed mine and a small smile curved the corner of his mouth sassenach i might be to him but not english for that matter he went on were i not taken the hunt would likely come here againto lallybroch if i would risk the folk near ardsmuir i would not risk my own and even without that he stopped seeming to struggle to find words i had to go back he said slowly for the sake of the men there if for nothing else the men in the prison i said surprised were some of the lallybroch men arrested with you he shook his head the small vertical line that appeared between his brows when he thought hard was visible even by starlight no there were men there from all over the highlandsfrom every clan almost only a few men from each clanremnants and ragtag but the more in need of a chief for all that and thats what you were to them i spoke gently restraining the urge to smooth the line away with my fingers for lack of any better he said with the flicker of a smile he had come from the bosom of family and tenants from a strength that had sustained him for seven years to find a lack of hope and a loneliness that would kill a man faster than the damp and the filth and the quaking ague of the prison and so quite simply he had taken the ragtag and remnants the castoff survivors of the field of culloden and made them his own that they and he might survive the stones of ardsmuir as well reasoning charming and cajoling where he could fighting where he must he had forced them to band together to face their captors as one to put aside ancient clan rivalries and allegiances and take him as their chieftain they were mine he said softly and the having of them kept me alive but then they had been taken from him and from each otherwrenched apart and sent into indenture in a foreign land and he had not been able to save them you did your best for them but its over now i said softly we lay in each others arms in silence for a long time letting the small noises of the house wash over us different from the comfortable commercial bustle of the brothel the tiny creaks and sighing spoke of quiet and home and safety for the first time we were truly alone together removed from danger and distraction there was time now time to hear the rest of the story of the gold to hear what he had done with it to find out what had happened to the men of ardsmuir to speculate about the burning of the printshop young ians oneeyed seaman the encounter with his majestys customs on the shore by arbroath to decide what to do next and since there was time there was no need to speak of any of that now the last peat broke and fell apart on the hearth its glowing interior hissing red in the cold i snuggled closer to jamie burying my face in the side of his neck he tasted faintly of grass and sweat with a whiff of brandy he shifted his body in response bringing us together all down our naked lengths what again i murmured amused men your age arent supposed to do it again so soon his teeth nibbled gently on my earlobe well youre doing it too sassenach he pointed out and youre older than i am thats different i said gasping a little as he moved suddenly over me his shoulders blotting out the starlit window im a woman and if ye werent a woman sassenach he assured me settling to his work i wouldna be doing it either hush now i woke just past dawn to the scratching of the rose brier against the window and the muffled thump and clang of breakfast fixing in the kitchen below peering over jamies sleeping form i saw that the fire was dead out i slid out of bed quietly so as not to wake him the floorboards were icy under my feet and i reached shivering for the first available garment swathed in the folds of jamies shirt i knelt on the hearth and went about the laborious business of rekindling the fire thinking rather wistfully that i might have included a box of safety matches in the short list of items i had thought worthwhile to bring striking sparks from a flint to catch kindling does work but not usually on the first try or the second or somewhere around the dozenth attempt i was rewarded by a tiny black spot on the twist of tow i was using for kindling it grew at once and blossomed into a tiny flame i thrust it hastily but carefully beneath the little tent of twigs i had prepared to shelter the blooming flame from the cold breeze i had left the window ajar the night before to insure not being suffocated by the smokepeat fires burned hot but dully with a lot of smoke as the blackened beams overhead attested just now though i thought we could dispense with fresh airat least until i got the fire thoroughly under way the pane was rimed at the bottom with a light frost winter was not far off the air was so crisp and fresh that i paused before shutting the window breathing in great gulps of dead leaf dried apples cold earth and damp sweet grass the scene outside was perfect in its still clarity stone walls and dark pines drawn sharp as black quillstrokes against the gray overcast of the morning a movement drew my eye to the top of the hill where the rough track led to the village of broch mordha ten miles distant one by one three small highland ponies came up over the rise and started down the hill toward the farmhouse they were too far away for me to make out the faces but i could see by the billowing skirts that all three riders were women perhaps it was the girlsmaggie kitty and janetcoming back from young jamies house my own jamie would be glad to see them i pulled the shirt redolent of jamie around me against the chill deciding to take advantage of what privacy might remain to us this morning by thawing out in bed i shut the window and paused to lift several of the light peat bricks from the basket by the hearth and feed them carefully to my fledgling fire before shedding the shirt and crawling under the covers numb toes tingling with delight at the luxurious warmth jamie felt the chill of my return and rolled instinctively toward me gathering me neatly in and curling round me spoonfashion he sleepily rubbed his face against my shoulder sleep well sassenach he muttered never better i assured him snuggling my cold bottom into the warm hollow of his thighs you mmmmm he responded with a blissful groan wrapping his arms about me dreamed like a fiend what about naked women mostly he said and set his teeth gently in the flesh of my shoulder that and food his stomach rumbled softly the scent of biscuits and fried bacon in the air was faint but unmistakable so long as you dont confuse the two i said twitching my shoulder out of his reach i can tell a hawk from a handsaw when the wind sets north by norwest he assured me and a sweet plump lassie from a saltcured ham too appearances notwithstanding he grabbed my buttocks with both hands and squeezed making me yelp and kick him in the shins beast oh a beast is it he said laughing well then growling deep in his throat he dived under the quilt and proceeded to nip and nibble his way up the insides of my thighs blithely ignoring my squeaks and the hail of kicks on his back and shoulders dislodged by our struggles the quilt slid off onto the floor revealing the tousled mass of his hair flying wild over my thighs perhaps theres less difference than i thought he said his head popping up between my legs as he paused for breath he pressed my thighs flat against the mattress and grinned up at me spikes of red hair standing on end like a porcupines quills ye do taste a bit salty come to try it what do ye he was interrupted by a sudden bang as the door flew open and rebounded from the wall startled we turned to look in the doorway stood a young girl i had never seen before she was perhaps fifteen or sixteen with long flaxen hair and big blue eyes the eyes were somewhat bigger than normal and filled with an expression of horrified shock as she stared at me her gaze moved slowly from my tangled hair to my bare breasts and down the slopes of my naked body until it encountered jamie lying prone between my thighs whitefaced with a shock equal to hers daddy she said in tones of total outrage who is that woman daddy daddy i said blankly daddy jamie had turned to stone when the door opened now he shot bolt upright snatching at the fallen quilt he shoved the disheveled hair out of his face and glared at the girl what in the name of bloody hell are you doing here he demanded redbearded naked and hoarse with fury he was a formidable sight and the girl took a step backward looking uncertain then her chin firmed and she glared back at him i came with mother the effect on jamie could not have been greater had she shot him through the heart he jerked violently and all the color went out of his face it came flooding back as the sound of rapid footsteps sounded on the wooden staircase he leapt out of bed tossing the quilt hastily in my direction and grabbed his breeks he had barely pulled them on when another female figure burst into the room skidded to a halt and stood staring bugeyed at the bed its true she whirled toward jamie fists clenched against the cloak she still wore its true its the sassenach witch how could ye do such a thing to me jamie fraser be still laoghaire he snapped ive done nothing to ye i sat up against the wall clutching the quilt to my bosom and staring it was only when he spoke her name that i recognized her twentyodd years ago laoghaire mackenzie had been a slender sixteenyearold with rosepetal skin moonbeam hair and a violentand unrequitedpassion for jamie fraser evidently a few things had changed she was nearing forty and no longer slender having thickened considerably the skin was still fair but weathered and stretched plumply over cheeks flushed with anger strands of ashy hair straggled out from under her respectable white kertch the pale blue eyes were the same thoughthey turned on me again with the same expression of hatred i had seen in them long ago hes mine she hissed she stamped her foot get ye back to the hell that ye came from and leave him to me go i say as i made no move to obey she glanced wildly about in search of a weapon catching sight of the bluebanded ewer she seized it and drew back her arm to fling it at me jamie plucked it neatly from her hand set it back on the bureau and grasped her by the upper arm hard enough to make her squeal he turned her and shoved her roughly toward the door get ye downstairs he ordered ill speak wi ye presently laoghaire youll speak wi me speak wi me is it she cried face contorted she swung her free hand at him raking his face from eye to chin with her nails he grunted grabbed her other wrist and dragging her to the door pushed her out into the passage and slammed the door to and turned the key by the time he turned around again i was sitting on the edge of the bed fumbling with shaking hands as i tried to pull my stockings on i can explain it to ye claire he said i ddont think so i said my lips were numb along with the rest of me and it was hard to form words i kept my eyes fixed on my feet as i triedand failedto tie my garters listen to me he said violently bringing his fist down on the table with a crash that made me jump i jerked my head up and caught a glimpse of him towering over me with his red hair tumbled loose about his shoulders his face unshaven barechested and the raw marks of laoghaires nails down his cheek he looked like a viking raider bent on mayhem i turned away to look for my shift it was lost in the bedclothes i scrabbled about among the sheets a considerable pounding had started up on the other side of the door accompanied by shouts and shrieks as the commotion attracted the other inhabitants of the house youd best go and explain things to your daughter i said pulling the crumpled cotton over my head shes not my daughter no my head popped out of the neck of the shift and i lifted my chin to stare up at him and i suppose you arent married to laoghaire either im married to you damn it he bellowed striking his fist on the table again i dont think so i felt very cold my stiff fingers couldnt manage the lacing of the stays i threw them aside and stood up to look for my gown which was somewhere on the other side of the roombehind jamie i need my dress youre no going anywhere sassenach not until dont call me that i shrieked it surprising both of us he stared at me for a moment then nodded all right he said quietly he glanced at the door now reverberating under the force of the pounding he drew a deep breath and straightened squaring his shoulders ill go and settle things then well talk the two of us stay here sassclaire he picked up his shirt and yanked it over his head unlocking the door he stepped out into the suddenly silent corridor and closed it behind him i managed to pick up the dress then collapsed on the bed and sat shaking all over the green wool crumpled across my knees i couldnt think in a straight line my mind spun in small circles around the central fact he was married married to laoghaire and he had a family and yet he had wept for brianna oh bree i said aloud oh god bree and began to crypartly from shock partly at the thought of brianna it wasnt logical but this discovery seemed a betrayal of her as much as of meor of laoghaire the thought of laoghaire turned shock and sorrow to rage in a moment i rubbed a fold of green wool savagely across my face leaving the skin red and prickly damn him how dare he if he had married again thinking me dead that was one thing i had halfexpected halffeared it but to marry that womanthat spiteful sneaking little bitch who had tried to murder me at castle leochbut he likely didnt know that a small voice of reason in my head pointed out well he should have known i said damn him to hell how could he take her anyway the tears were rolling heedlessly down my face hot spurts of loss and fury and my nose was running i groped for a handkerchief found none and in desperation blew my nose at last on a corner of the sheet it smelled of jamie worse it smelled of the two of us and the faint musky lingerings of our pleasure there was a small tingling spot on the inside of my thigh where jamie had nipped me a few minutes before i brought the flat of my hand down hard on the spot in a vicious slap to kill the feeling liar i screamed i grabbed the pitcher laoghaire had tried to throw at me and hurled it myself it crashed against the door in an explosion of splinters i stood in the middle of the room listening it was quiet there was no sound from below no one was coming to see what had made the crash i imagined they were all much too concerned with soothing laoghaire to worry about me did they live here at lallybroch i recalled jamie taking fergus aside sending him ahead ostensibly to tell ian and jenny we were coming and presumably to warn them about me and get laoghaire out of the way before i arrived what in the name of god did jenny and ian think about this clearly they must know about laoghaireand yet they had received me last night with no sign of it on their faces but if laoghaire had been sent awaywhy did she come back even trying to think about it made my temples throb the act of violence had drained enough rage for me to be able once more to control my shaking fingers i kicked the stays into a corner and pulled the green gown over my head i had to get out of there that was the only halfcoherent thought in my head and i clung to it i had to leave i couldnt stay not with laoghaire and her daughters in the house they belonged therei didnt i managed to tie up the garters this time do up the laces of the dress fasten the multiple hooks of the overskirt and find my shoes one was under the washstand the other by the massive oak armoire where i had kicked them the night before dropping my clothes carelessly anywhere in my eagerness to crawl into the welcoming bed and nestle warmly in jamies arms i shivered the fire had gone out again and there was an icy draft from the window i felt chilled to the bone despite my clothes i wasted some time in searching for my cloak before realizing that it was downstairs i had left it in the parlor the day before i pushed my fingers through my hair but was too upset to look for a comb the strands crackled with electricity from having the woolen dress pulled over my head and i slapped irritably at the floating hairs that stuck to my face ready ready as id be at least i paused for one last look around then heard footsteps coming up the stair not fast and light like the last ones these were heavier and slow deliberate i knew without seeing him that it was jamie comingand that he wasnt anxious to see me fine i didnt want to see him either better just to leave at once without speaking what was there to say i backed away as the door opened unaware that i was moving until my legs hit the edge of the bed i lost my balance and sat down jamie paused in the doorway looking down at me he had shaved that was the first thing i noticed in echo of young ian the day before he had hastily shaved brushed his hair back and tidied himself before facing trouble he seemed to know what i was thinking the ghost of a smile passed over his face as he rubbed his freshly scraped chin dye think it will help he asked i swallowed and licked dry lips but didnt answer he sighed and answered himself no i suppose not he stepped into the room and closed the door he stood awkwardly for a moment then moved toward the bed one hand extended toward me claire dont touch me i leapt to my feet and backed away circling toward the door his hand fell to his side but he stepped in front of me blocking the way will ye no let me explain claire it seems to be a little late for that i said in what i meant to be a cold disdainful tone unfortunately my voice shook he pushed the door shut behind him ye never used to be unreasonable he said quietly and dont tell me what i used to be the tears were much too near the surface and i bit my lip to hold them back all right his face was very pale the scratches laoghaire had given him showed as three red lines livid down his cheek i dinna live with her he said she and the girls live at balriggan over near broch mordha he watched me closely but i said nothing he shrugged a little settling the shirt on his shoulders and went on it was a great mistakethe marriage between us with two children took you a while to realize didnt it i burst out his lips pressed tight together the lassies arent mine laoghaire was a widow wi the two bairns when i wed her oh it didnt make any real difference but still i felt a small wave of something like relief on briannas behalf she was the sole child of jamies heart at least even if i ive not lived wi them for some time i live in edinburgh and send money to them but you dont need to tell me i interrupted it doesnt make any difference let me by pleaseim going the thick ruddy brows drew sharply together going where back away i dont knowlet me by you arent going anywhere he said definitely you cant stop me he reached out and grabbed me by both arms aye i can he said he could i jerked furiously but couldnt budge the iron grip on my biceps let go of me this minute no i wont he glared at me eyes narrowed and i suddenly realized that calm as he might seem outwardly he was very nearly as upset as i was i saw the muscles of his throat move as he swallowed controlling himself enough to speak again i willna let ye go until ive explained to ye why what is there to explain i demanded furiously you married again what else is there the color was rising in his face the tips of his ears were already red a sure sign of impending fury and have you lived a nun for twenty years he demanded shaking me slightly have ye no i flung the word at his face and he flinched slightly no i bloody havent and i dont think youve been a monk eitheri never did then he began but i was much too furious to listen anymore you lied to me damn you i never did the skin was stretched tight over his cheekbones as it was when he was very angry indeed you did you bastard you know you did let go i kicked him sharply in the shin hard enough to numb my toes he exclaimed in pain but didnt let go instead he squeezed harder making me yelp i never said a thing to ye no you didnt but you lied anyway you let me think you werent married that there wasnt anyone that youthat you i was halfsobbing with rage gasping between words you should have told me the minute i came why in hell didnt you tell me his grip on my arms slackened and i managed to wrench myself free he took a step toward me eyes glittering with fury i wasnt afraid of him i drew back my fist and hit him in the chest why i shrieked hitting him again and again and again the sound of the blows thudding against his chest why why why because i was afraid he got hold of my wrists and threw me backward so i fell across the bed he stood over me fists clenched breathing hard i am a coward damn you i couldna tell ye for fear ye would leave me and unmanly thing that i am i thought i couldna bear that unmanly with two wives ha i really thought he would slap me he raised his arm but then his open palm clenched into a fist am i a man to want you so badly that nothing else matters to see you and know i would sacrifice honor or family or life itself to lie wi you even though yed left me you have the filthy unmitigated bleeding gall to say such a thing to me my voice was so high it came out as a thin and vicious whisper youll blame me he stopped then chest heaving as he caught his breath no no i canna blame you he turned aside blindly how could it have been your fault ye wanted to stay wi me to die with me i did the more fool i i said you sent me back you made me go and now you want to blame me for going he turned back to me eyes dark with desperation i had to send ye away i had to for the bairns sake his eyes went involuntarily to the hook where his coat hung the pictures of brianna in its pocket he took one deep quivering breath and calmed himself with a visible effort no he said much more quietly i canna regret that whatever the cost i would have given my life for her and for you if it took my heart and soul too he drew a long quivering breath mastering the passion that shook him i canna blame ye for going you blame me for coming back though he shook his head as though to clear it no god no he grabbed my hands tight between his own the strength of his grip grinding the bones together do ye know what it is to live twenty years without a heart to live half a man and accustom yourself to living in the bit thats left filling in the cracks wi what mortar comes handy do i know i echoed i struggled to loose myself to little effect yes you bloody bastard i know that what did you think id gone straight back to frank and lived happy ever after i kicked at him as hard as i could he flinched but didnt let go sometimes i hoped ye did he said speaking through clenched teeth and then sometimes i could see ithim with you day and night lyin with ye taking your body holding my child and god i could kill ye for it suddenly he dropped my hands whirled and smashed his fist through the side of the oak armoire it was an impressive blow the armoire was a sturdy piece of furniture it must have bruised his knuckles considerably but without hesitation he drove the other fist into the oak boards as well as though the shining wood were franks faceor mine feel like that about it do you i said coldly as he stepped back panting i dont even have to imagine you with laoghaireive bloody seen her i dinna care a fig for laoghaire and never have bastard i said again youd marry a woman without wanting her and then throw her aside the minute shut up he roared hold your tongue ye wicked wee bitch he slammed a fist down on the washstand glaring at me im damned the one way or the other no if i felt anything for her im a faithless womanizer and if i didnt im a heartless beast you should have told me and if i had he grabbed my hand and jerked me to my feet holding me eye to eye with him youd have turned on your heel and gone without a word and having seen ye againi tell ye i would ha done far worse than lie to keep you he pressed me tight against his body and kissed me long and hard my knees turned to water and i fought to keep my feet buttressed by the vision of laoghaires angry eyes and her voice echoing shrill in my ears hes mine this is senseless i said pulling away fury had its own intoxication but the hangover was setting in fast a black dizzy vortex my head swam so that i could hardly keep my balance i cant think straight im leaving i lurched toward the door but he caught me by the waist yanking me back he whirled me toward himself and kissed me again hard enough to leave a quicksilver taste of blood in my mouth it was neither affection nor desire but a blind passion a determination to possess me he was through talking so was i i pulled my mouth away and slapped him hard across the face fingers curved to rake his flesh he jerked back cheek scraped raw then twisted his fingers tight in my hair bent and took my mouth again deliberate and savage ignoring the kicks and blows i rained on him he bit my lower lip hard and when i opened my lips gasping thrust his tongue into my mouth stealing breath and words together he threw me bodily onto the bed where we had lain laughing an hour before and pinned me there at once with the weight of his body he was most mightily roused so was i mine he said without uttering a word mine i fought him with boundless fury and no little skill and yours my body echoed back yours and may you be damned for it i didnt feel him rip my gown but i felt the heat of his body on my bare breasts through the thin linen of his shirt the long hard muscle of his thigh straining against my own he took his hand off my arm to tear at his breeches and i clawed him from ear to breast striping his skin with pale red we were doing our level best to kill each other fueled by the rage of years apartmine for his sending me away his for my going mine for laoghaire his for frank bitch he panted whore damn you i got a hand in his own long hair and yanked pulling his face down to me again we rolled off the bed and landed on the floor in a tangled heap rolling to and fro in a welter of halfuttered curses and broken words i didnt hear the door open i didnt hear anything though she must have called out more than once blind and deaf i knew nothing but jamie until the shower of cold water struck us sudden as an electric shock jamie froze all the color left his face leaving the bones jutting stark beneath the skin i lay dazed drops of water dripping from the ends of his hair onto my breasts just behind him i could see jenny her face as white as his holding an empty pan in her hands stop it she said her eyes were slanted with a horrified anger how could ye jamie rutting like a wild beast and not carin if all the house hears ye he moved off me slowly clumsy as a bear jenny snatched a quilt from the bed and flung it over my body on all fours he shook his head like a dog sending droplets of water flying then very slowly he got to his feet and pulled his ripped breeches back into place are ye no ashamed she cried scandalized jamie stood looking down at her as though he had never seen any creature quite like her and was making up his mind what she might be the wet ends of his hair dripped over his bare chest yes he said at last quite mildly i am he seemed dazed he closed his eyes and a brief deep shudder went over him without a word he turned and went out flight from eden jenny helped me to the bed making small clucking noises whether of shock or concern i couldnt tell i was vaguely conscious of hovering figures in the doorwayservants i supposedbut wasnt disposed to pay much attention ill find ye something to put on she murmured fluffing a pillow and pushing me back onto it and perhaps a bit of a drink youre all right wheres jamie she glanced at me quickly sympathy mixed with a gleam of curiosity dinna be afraid ill no let him at ye again she spoke firmly then pressed her lips tight together frowning as she tucked the quilt around me how he could do such a thing it wasnt his faultnot this i ran a hand through my tangled hair indicating my general dishevelment i meani did it as much as he did it was both of us hei i let my hand fall helpless to explain i was bruised and shaken and my lips were swollen i see was all jenny said but she gave me a long assessing look and i thought it quite possible that she did see i didnt want to talk about the recent happenings and she seemed to sense this for she kept quiet for a bit giving a softvoiced order to someone in the hall then moving about the room straightening furniture and tidying things i saw her pause for a moment as she saw the holes in the armoire then she stooped to pick up the larger pieces of the shattered ewer as she dumped them into the basin there was a faint thud from the house below the slam of the big main door she stepped to the window and pushed the curtain aside its jamie she said she glanced at me and let the curtain fall hell be going up to the hill he goes there if hes troubled that or he gets drunk wi ian the hills better i gave a small snort yes i expect hes troubled all right there was a light step in the hallway and the younger janet appeared carefully balancing a tray of biscuits whisky and water she looked pale and scared are yewell aunt she asked tentatively setting down the tray im fine i assured her pushing myself upright and reaching for the whisky decanter a sharp glance having assured jenny of the same she patted her daughters arm and turned toward the door stay wi your auntie she ordered ill go and find a dress janet nodded obediently and sat down by the bed on a stool watching me as i ate and drank i began to feel physically much stronger with a little food inside me internally i felt quite numb the recent events seemed at once dreamlike and yet completely clear in my mind i could recall the smallest details the blue calico bows on the dress of laoghaires daughter the tiny broken veins in laoghaires cheeks a roughtorn fingernail on jamies fourth finger do you know where laoghaire is i asked janet the girl had her head down apparently studying her own hands at my question she jerked upright blinking oh she said oh aye she and marsali and joan went back to balriggan where they live uncle jamie made them go did he i said flatly janet bit her lip twisting her hands in her apron suddenly she looked up at me auntim so awfully sorry her eyes were a warm brown like her fathers but swimming now with tears its all right i said having no idea what she meant but trying to be soothing but it was me she burst out she looked thoroughly miserable but determined to confess ii told laoghaire ye were here thats why she came oh well that explained that i supposed i finished the whisky and set the glass carefully back on the tray i didna thinki mean i didna have it in mind to cause a kebbielebbie truly not i didna ken that youthat she its all right i said again one of us would have found out sooner or later it made no difference but i glanced at her with some curiosity why did you tell her though the girl glanced cautiously over her shoulder hearing steps start up from below she leaned close to me mother told me to she whispered and with that she rose and hastily left the room brushing past her mother in the doorway i didnt ask jenny had found a dress for meone of the elder girlsand there was no conversation beyond the necessary as she helped me into it when i was dressed and shod my hair combed and put up i turned to her i want to go i said now she didnt argue but only looked me over to see that i was strong enough she nodded then dark lashes covering the slanted blue eyes so like her brothers i think thats best she said quietly it was late morning when i left lallybroch for what i knew would be the last time i had a dagger at my waist for protection though it was unlikely i would need it my horses saddlebags held food and several bottles of ale enough to see me back to the stone circle i had thought of taking back the pictures of brianna from jamies coat but after a moments hesitation had left them she belonged to him forever even if i didnt it was a cold autumn day the mornings gray promise fulfilled with a mourning drizzle no one was in sight near the house as jenny led the horse out of the stable and held the bridle for me to mount i pulled the hood of my cloak farther forward and nodded to her last time we had parted with tears and embraces as sisters she let go the reins and stood back as i turned the horses head toward the road godspeed i heard her call behind me i didnt answer nor did i look back i rode most of the day without really noticing where i was going taking heed only for the general direction and letting the gelding pick his own way through the mountain passes i stopped when the light began to go hobbled the horse to graze lay down wrapped in my cloak and dropped straight asleep unwilling to stay awake for fear i might think and remember numbness was my only refuge i knew it would go but i clung to its gray comfort so long as i might it was hunger that brought me unwillingly back to life the next day i had not paused to eat through all the day before nor when rising in the morning but by noon my stomach had begun to register loud protests and i stopped in a small glen beside a sparkling burn and unwrapped the food that jenny had slipped into my saddlebag there were oatcakes and ale and several small loaves of freshbaked bread slit down the middle stuffed with sheepmilk cheese and homemade pickle highland sandwiches the hearty fare of shepherds and warriors as characteristic of lallybroch as peanut butter had been of boston very suitable that my quest should end with one of these i ate a sandwich drank one of the stone bottles of ale and swung back into the saddle turning the horses head to the northeast once more unfortunately while the food had brought fresh strength to my body it had given fresh life to my feelings as well as we climbed higher and higher into the clouds my spirits fell lowerand they hadnt been high to begin with the horse was willing enough but i wasnt near midafternoon i felt that i simply couldnt go on leading the horse far enough into a small thicket that it wouldnt be noticeable from the road i hobbled it loosely and walked farther under the trees myself til i came to the trunk of a fallen aspen smoothskinned stained green with moss i sat slumped over elbows on my knees and head on my hands i ached in every joint not really from the encounter of the day before or from the rigors of riding from grief constraint and judgment had been a great deal of my life i had learned at some pains the art of healing to give and to care but always stopping short of that danger point where too much was given to make me effective i had learned detachment and disengagement to my cost with frank too i had learned the balancing act of civility kindness and respect that did not pass those unseen boundaries into passion and brianna love for a child cannot be free from the first signs of movement in the womb a devotion springs up as powerful as it is mindless irresistible as the process of birth itself but powerful as it is it is a love always of control one is in charge the protector the watcher the guardianthere is great passion in it to be sure but never abandon always always i had had to balance compassion with wisdom love with judgment humanity with ruthlessness only with jamie had i given everything i had risked it all i had thrown away caution and judgment and wisdom along with the comforts and constraints of a hardwon career i had brought him nothing but myself been nothing but myself with him given him soul as well as body let him see me naked trusted him to see me whole and cherish my frailtiesbecause he once had i had feared he couldnt again or wouldnt and then had known those few days of perfect joy thinking that what had once been true was true once more i was free to love him with everything i had and was and be loved with an honesty that matched my own the tears slid hot and wet between my fingers i mourned for jamie and for what i had been with him do you know his voice said whispering what it means to say again i love you and to mean it i knew and with my head in my hands beneath the pine trees i knew i would never mean it again sunk as i was in miserable contemplation i didnt hear the footsteps until he was nearly upon me startled by the crack of a branch nearby i rocketed off the fallen tree like a rising pheasant and whirled to face the attacker heart in my mouth and dagger in hand christ my stalker shied back from the open blade clearly as startled as i was what the hell are you doing here i demanded i pressed my free hand to my chest my heart was pounding like a kettledrum and i was sure i was as white as he was jesus auntie claire whered ye learn to pull a knife like that ye scairt hell out of me young ian passed a hand over his brow adams apple bobbing as he swallowed the feeling is mutual i assured him i tried to sheathe the dagger but my hand was shaking too much with reaction to manage it knees wobbling i sank back on the aspen trunk and laid the knife on my thigh i repeat i said trying to gain mastery of myself what are you doing here i had a bloody good idea what he was doing there and i wasnt having any on the other hand i needed a moments recovery from the fright before i could reliably stand up young ian bit his lip glanced around and at my nod of permission sat down awkwardly on the trunk beside me uncle jamie sent me he began i didnt pause to hear more but got up at once knees or no knees thrusting the dagger into my belt as i turned away wait aunt please he grabbed at my arm but i jerked loose pulling away from him im not interested i said kicking the fronds of bracken aside go home wee ian ive places to go i hoped i had at least but it isnt what you think unable to stop me leaving the clearing he was following me arguing as he ducked low branches he needs you aunt really he does ye must come back wi me i didnt answer him i had reached my horse and bent to undo the hobbles auntie claire will ye no listen to me he loomed up on the far side of the horse gawky height peering at me over the saddle he looked very much like his father his goodnatured halfhomely face creased with anxiety no i said briefly i stuffed the hobbles into the saddlebag and put my foot into the stirrup swinging up with a satisfyingly majestic swish of skirts and petticoats my dignified departure was hampered at this point by the fact that young ian had the horses reins in a death grip let go i said peremptorily not until ye hear me out he said he glared up at me jaw clenched with stubbornness soft brown eyes ablaze i glared back at him gangling as he was he had ians skinny muscularity unless i was prepared to ride him down there seemed little choice but to listen to him all right i decided fat lot of good it would do to him or his doubledealing uncle but id listen talk i said mustering what patience i could he drew a deep breath eyeing me warily to see whether i meant it deciding that i did he blew his breath out making the soft brown hair over his brow flutter and squared his shoulders to begin well he started seeming suddenly unsure itihe i made a low sound of exasperation in my throat start at the beginning i said but dont make a song and dance of it hm he nodded teeth set in his upper lip as he concentrated well there was the hell of a stramash broke out at the house after ye left when uncle jamie came back he began ill just bet there was i said despite myself i was conscious of a small stirring of curiosity but fought it down assuming an expression of complete indifference ive never seen uncle jamie sae furious he said watching my face carefully nor mother either they went at it hammer and tongs the two o them father tried to quiet them but it was like they didna even hear him uncle jamie called mother a meddling besom and a langnebbitandand a lot of worse names he added flushing he shouldnt have been angry with jenny i said she was only trying to helpi think i felt sick with the knowledge that i had caused this rift too jenny had been jamies mainstay since the death of their mother when both were children was there no end to the damage i had caused by coming back to my surprise jennys son smiled briefly well it wasna all onesided he said dryly my mothers no the person to be taking abuse lying down ye ken uncle jamie had a few toothmarks on him before the end of it he swallowed remembering in fact i thought theyd damage each other surely mother went for uncle jamie wi an iron girdle and he snatched it from her and threw it through the kitchen window scairt the chickens out o the yard he added with a feeble grin less about chickens young ian i said looking down at him coldly get on with it i want to leave well then uncle jamie knocked over the bookshelf in the parlori dinna think he did it on purpose the lad added hastily he was just too fashed to see straightand went out the door father stuck his head out the window and shouted at him where was he going and he said he was going to find you then why are you here and not him i was leaning forward slightly watching his hand on the reins if his fingers showed signs of relaxation perhaps i could twitch the rein out of his grasp young ian sighed well just as uncle jamie was setting out on his horse aunteri mean his wi he blushed miserably laoghaire sheshe came down the hill and into the dooryard at this point i gave up pretending indifference and what happened then he frowned there was an awful collieshangie but i couldna hear much auntiei mean laoghaireshe doesna seem to know how to fight properly like my mam and uncle jamie she just weeps and wails a lot mam says she snivels he added mmphm i said and so laoghaire had slid off her own mount clutched jamie by the leg and more or less dragged him off as well according to young ian she had then subsided into a puddle in the dooryard clutching jamie about the knees weeping and wailing as was her usual habit unable to escape jamie had at last hauled laoghaire to her feet flung her bodily over his shoulder and carried her into the house and up the stairs ignoring the fascinated gazes of his family and servants right i said i realized that i had been clenching my jaw and consciously unclenched it so he sent you after me because he was too occupied with his wife bastard the gall of him he thinks he can just send someone to fetch me back like a hired girl because it doesnt suit his convenience to come himself he thinks he can have his cake and eat it does he bloody arrogant selfish overbearingscot distracted as i was by the picture of jamie carrying laoghaire upstairs scot was the worst epithet i could come up with on short notice my knuckles were white where my hand clutched the edge of the saddle not caring about subtlety any more i leaned down snatching for the reins let go but auntie claire its not that whats not that caught by his tone of desperation i glanced up his long narrow face was tight with the anguished need to make me understand uncle jamie didna stay to tend laoghaire then why did he send you he took a deep breath renewing his grip on my reins she shot him he sent me to find ye because hes dying if youre lying to me ian murray i said for the dozenth time youll regret it to the end of your lifewhich will be short i had to raise my voice to be heard the rising wind came whooshing past me lifting my hair in streamers off my shoulders whipping my skirts tight around my legs the weather was suitably dramatic great black clouds choked the mountain passes boiling over the crags like seafoam with a faint distant rumble of thunder like faroff surf on packed sand lacking breath young ian merely shook his bowed head as he leaned into the wind he was afoot leading both ponies across a treacherously boggy stretch of ground near the edge of a tiny loch i glanced instinctively at my wrist missing my rolex it was difficult to tell where the sun was with the inrolling storm filling half the western sky but the upper edge of the darktinged clouds glowed a brilliant white that was almost gold i had lost the knack of telling time by sun and sky but thought it was no more than midafternoon lallybroch lay several hours ahead i doubted we would reach it by dark meaching my way reluctantly toward craigh na dun i had taken nearly two days to reach the small wood where young ian had caught up with me he had he said spent only one day in the pursuit he had known roughly where i was headed and he himself had shod the pony i rode my tracks had been plain to him where they showed in the mudpatches among the heather on the open moor two days since i had left and oneor moreon the journey back three days then since jamie had been shot i could get few useful details from young ian having succeeded in his mission he wanted only to return to lallybroch as fast as possible and saw no point in further conversation jamies gunshot wound was in the left arm he said that was good so far as it went the ball had penetrated into jamies side as well that wasnt good jamie was conscious when last seenthat was goodbut was starting a fever not good at all as to the possible effects of shock the type or severity of the fever or what treatment had so far been administered young ian merely shrugged so perhaps jamie was dying perhaps he wasnt it wasnt a chance i could take as jamie himself would know perfectly well i wondered momentarily whether he might conceivably have shot himself as a means of forcing me to return our last interview could have left him in little doubt as to my response had he come after me or used force to make me return it was beginning to rain in soft spatters that caught in my hair and lashes blurring my sight like tears past the boggy spot young ian had mounted again leading the way upward to the final pass that led to lallybroch jamie was devious enough to have thought of such a plan all right and certainly courageous enough to have carried it out on the other hand i had never known him to be reckless he had taken plenty of bold risksmarrying me being one of them i thought ruefullybut never without an estimation of the cost and a willingness to pay it would he have thought drawing me back to lallybroch worth the chance of actually dying that hardly seemed logical and jamie fraser was a very logical man i pulled the hood of my cloak further over my head to keep the increasing downpour out of my face young ians shoulders and thighs were dark with wet and the rain dripped from the brim of his slouch hat but he sat straight in the saddle ignoring the weather with the stoic nonchalance of a trueborn scot very well given that jamie likely hadnt shot himself was he shot at all he might have made up the story and sent his nephew to tell it on consideration though i thought it highly unlikely that young ian could have delivered the news so convincingly were it false i shrugged the movement sending a cold rivulet down inside the front of my cloak and set myself to wait with what patience i could for the journey to be ended years in the practice of medicine had taught me not to anticipate the reality of each case was bound to be unique and so must be my response to it my emotions however were much harder to control than my professional reactions each time i had left lallybroch i had thought i would never return now here i was going back once more twice now i had left jamie knowing with certainty that i would never see him again and yet here i was going back to him like a bloody homing pigeon to its loft ill tell you one thing jamie fraser i muttered under my breath if you arent at deaths door when i get there youll live to regret it practical and applied witchcraft it was several hours past dark when we arrived at last soaked to the skin the house was silent and dark save for two dimly lighted windows downstairs in the parlor there was a single warning bark from one of the dogs but young ian shushed the animal and after a quick curious nosing at my stirrup the blackandwhite shape faded back into the darkness of the dooryard the warning had been enough to alert someone as young ian led me into the hall the door to the parlor opened jenny poked her head out her face drawn with worry at the sight of young ian she popped out into the hallway her expression transformed to one of joyous relief at once superseded by the righteous anger of a mother confronted by an errant offspring ian ye wee wretch she said where have ye been all this time your da and i ha been worrit sick for ye she paused long enough to look him over anxiously youre all right at his nod her lips grew tight again aye well youre for it now laddie ill tell ye and just where the devil have ye been anyway gangling knobjointed and dripping wet young ian looked like nothing so much as a drowned scarecrow but he was still large enough to block me from his mothers view he didnt answer jennys scolding but shrugged awkwardly and stepped aside exposing me to his mothers startled gaze if my resurrection from the dead had disconcerted her this second reappearance stunned her her deep blue eyes normally as slanted as her brothers opened so wide they looked round she stared at me for a long moment without saying anything then her gaze swiveled once more to her son a cuckoo she said almost conversationally thats what ye are laddiea great cuckoo in the nest god knows whose son ye were meant to be it wasna mine young ian flushed hotly dropping his eyes as the red burned in his cheeks he pushed the feathery damp hair out of his eyes with the back of one hand iwell i just he began eyes on his boots i couldna just oh never mind about it now his mother snapped get ye upstairs to your bed your da will deal wi ye in the morning ian glanced helplessly at the parlor door then at me he shrugged once more looked at the sodden hat in his hands as though wondering how it had got there and shuffled slowly down the hall jenny stood quite still eyes fixed on me until the padded door at the end of the hallway closed with a soft thump behind young ian her face showed lines of strain and the shadows of sleeplessness smudged her eyes still fineboned and erect for once she looked her age and more so youre back she said flatly seeing no point in answering the obvious i nodded briefly the house was quiet around us and full of shadows the hallway lighted only by a threepronged candlestick set on the table never mind about it now i said softly so as not to disturb the houses slumber there was after all only one thing of importance at the moment wheres jamie after a small hesitation she nodded as well accepting my presence for the moment in there she said waving toward the parlor door i started toward the door then paused there was the one thing more wheres laoghaire i asked gone she said her eyes were flat and dark in the candlelight unreadable i nodded in response and stepped through the door closing it gently but firmly behind me too long to be laid on the sofa jamie lay on a camp bed set up before the fire asleep or unconscious his profile rose dark and sharpedged against the light of the glowing coals unmoving whatever he was he wasnt deadat least not yet my eyes growing accustomed to the dim light of the fire i could see the slow rise and fall of his chest beneath nightshirt and quilt a flask of water and a brandy bottle sat on the small table by the bed the padded chair by the fire had a shawl thrown over its back jenny had been sitting there watching over her brother there seemed no need now for haste i untied the strings at the neck of my cloak and spread the soggy garment over the chairback taking the shawl in substitute my hands were cold i put them under my arms hugging myself to bring them to something like a normal temperature before i touched him when i did venture to place a thawed hand on his forehead i nearly jerked it back he was hot as a justfired pistol and he twitched and moaned at my touch fever indeed i stood looking down at him for a moment then carefully moved to the side of the bed and sat down in jennys chair i didnt think he would sleep long with a temperature like that and it seemed a shame to wake him needlessly soon merely to examine him the cloak behind me dripped water on the floor a slow arrhythmic patting it reminded me unpleasantly of an old highland superstitionthe deathdrop just before a death occurs the story goes the sound of water dripping is heard in the house by those sensitive to such things i wasnt thank heaven subject to noticing supernatural phenomena of that sort no i thought wryly it takes something like a crack through time to get your attention the thought made me smile if only briefly and dispelled the frisson i had felt at the thought of the deathdrop as the rain chill left me though i still felt uneasy and for obvious reasons it wasnt that long ago that i had stood by another makeshift bed deep in the nightwatches and contemplated death and the waste of a marriage the thoughts i had begun in the wood hadnt stopped on the hasty journey back to lallybroch and they continued now without my conscious volition honor had led frank to his decisionto keep me as his wife and raise brianna as his own honor and an unwillingness to decline a responsibility he felt was his well here before me lay another honorable man laoghaire and her daughters jenny and her family the scots prisoners the smugglers mr willoughby and geordie fergus and the tenantshow many other responsibilities had jamie shouldered through our years apart franks death had absolved me of one of my own obligations brianna herself of another the hospital board in their eternal wisdom had severed the single great remaining tie that bound me to that life i had had time with joe abernathys help to relieve myself of the smaller responsibilities to depute and delegate divest and resolve jamie had had neither warning nor choice about my reappearance in his life no time to make decisions or resolve conflicts and he was not one to abandon his responsibilities even for the sake of love yes hed lied to me hadnt trusted me to recognize his responsibilities to stand by himor to leave himas his circumstances demanded hed been afraid so had i afraid that he wouldnt choose me confronted with the struggle between a twentyyearold love and a presentday family so id run away who you jiving lj i heard joe abernathys voice say derisive and affectionate i had fled toward craigh na dun with all the speed and decision of a condemned felon approaching the steps of the gallows nothing had slowed my journey but the hope that jamie would come after me true the pangs of conscience and wounded pride had spurred me on but the one moment when young ian had said hes dying had shown those up for the flimsy things they were my marriage to jamie had been for me like the turning of a great key each small turn setting in play the intricate fall of tumblers within me bree had been able to turn that key as well edging closer to the unlocking of the door of myself but the final turn of the lock was frozenuntil i had walked into the printshop in edinburgh and the mechanism had sprung free with a final decisive click the door now was ajar the light of an unknown future shining through its crack but it would take more strength than i had alone to push it open i watched the rise and fall of his breath and the play of light and shadow on the strong clean lines of his face and knew that nothing truly mattered between us but the fact that we both still lived so here i was again and whatever the cost of it might be to him or me here i stayed i didnt realize that his eyes had opened until he spoke ye came back then he said softly i knew ye would i opened my mouth to reply but he was still talking eyes fixed on my face pupils dilated to pools of darkness my love he said almost whispering god ye do look so lovely wi your great eyes all gold and your hair so soft round your face he brushed his tongue across dry lips i knew ye must forgive me sassenach once ye knew once i knew my brows shot up but i didnt speak he had more to say i was so afraid to lose ye again mo chridhe he murmured so afraid i havena loved anyone but you my sassenach never since the day i saw yebut i couldnai couldna bear his voice drifted off in an unintelligible mumble and his eyes closed again lashes lying dark against the high curve of his cheek i sat still wondering what i should do as i watched his eyes opened suddenly once again heavy and drowsy with fever they sought my face it willna be long sassenach he said as though reassuring me one corner of his mouth twitched in an attempt at a smile not long then i shall touch ye once more i do long to touch you oh jamie i said moved by tenderness i reached out and laid my hand along his burning cheek his eyes snapped wide with shock and he jerked bolt upright in bed letting out a bloodcurdling yell of anguish as the movement jarred his wounded arm oh god oh christ oh jesus lord god almighty he said bent halfbreathless and clutching at his left arm youre real bloody stinking filthy pigswiving hell oh christ are you all right i said rather inanely i could hear startled exclamations from the floor above muffled by the thick planks and the thump of feet as one after another of lallybrochs inhabitants leapt from their beds to investigate the uproar jennys head eyes even wider than before poked through the parlor door jamie saw her and somehow found sufficient breath to roar get out before doubling up again with an agonized groan jesus he said between clenched teeth what in gods holy name are ye doing here sassenach what do you mean what am i doing here i said you sent for me and what do you mean im real he unclenched his jaw and tentatively loosened his grip on his left arm the resultant sensation proving unsatisfactory he promptly grabbed it again and said several things in french involving the reproductive organs of assorted saints and animals for gods sake lie down i said i took him by the shoulders and eased him back onto the pillows noting with some alarm how close his bones were to the surface of his heated skin i thought ye were a fever dream til you touched me he said gasping what the hell dye mean popping up by my bed and scarin me to death he grimaced in pain christ it feels like my damn arms come off at the shoulder och bugger it he exclaimed as i firmly detached the fingers of his right hand from his left arm didnt you send young ian to tell me you were dying i said deftly rolling back the sleeve of his nightshirt the arm was wound in a huge bandage above the elbow and i groped for the end of the linen strip me no ow that hurts itll hurt worse before im through with you i said carefully unwrapping you mean the little bastard came after me on his own you didnt want me to come back want ye back no want ye to come back to me for nothing but pity the same as ye might show for a dog in a ditch bloody hell no i forbade the little bugger to go after ye he scowled furiously at me ruddy brows knitting together im a doctor i said coldly not a veterinarian and if you didnt want me back what was all that you were saying before you realized i was real hm bite the blanket or something the ends stuck and im going to pull it loose he bit his lip instead and made no noise but a swift intake of air through his nose it was impossible to judge his color in the firelight but his eyes closed briefly and small beads of sweat popped out on his forehead i turned away for a moment groping in the drawer of jennys desk where the extra candles were kept i needed more light before i did anything i suppose young ian told me you were dying just to get me back here he must have thought i wouldnt come otherwise the candles were there fine beeswax from the lallybroch hives for what its worth i am dying his voice came from behind me dry and blunt despite his breathlessness i turned back to him in some surprise his eyes rested on my face quite calmly now that the pain in his arm had lessened a bit but his breath was still coming unevenly and his eyes were heavy and bright with fever i didnt respond at once but lit the candles i had found placing them in the big candelabra that usually decorated the sideboard unused save for great occasions the flames of five additional candles brightened the room as though in preparation for a party i bent over the bed noncommital lets have a look at it the wound itself was a ragged dark hole scabbed at the edges and faintly bluetinged i pressed the flesh on either side of the wound it was red and angrylooking and there was a considerable seepage of pus jamie stirred uneasily as i drew my fingertips gently but firmly down the length of the muscle you have the makings of a very fine little infection there my lad i said young ian said it went into your side a second shot or did it go through your arm it went through jenny dug the ball out of my side that wasna so bad though just an inch or so in he spoke in brief spurts lips tightening involuntarily between sentences let me see where it went through moving very slowly he turned his hand to the outside letting the arm fall away from his side i could see that even that small movement was intensely painful the exit wound was just above the elbow joint on the inside of the upper arm not directly opposite the entrance wound though the ball had been deflected in its passage hit the bone i said trying not to imagine what that must have felt like do you know if the bones broken i dont want to poke you more than i need to thanks for small mercies he said with an attempt at a smile the muscles of his face trembled though and went slack with exhaustion no i think its not broken he said ive broken my collarbone and my hand before and its not like that though it hurts a bit i expect it does i felt my way carefully up the swell of his biceps testing for tenderness how far up does the pain go he glanced at his wounded arm almost casually feels like ive a hot poker in my arm not a bone but its no just the arm pains me now my whole sides gone stiff and sore he swallowed licking his lips again will ye give me a taste of the brandy he asked it hurts to feel my heart beating he added apologetically without comment i poured a cup of water from the flask on the table and held it to his lips he raised one brow but drank thirstily then let his head fall back against the pillow he breathed deeply for a moment eyes closed then opened them and looked directly at me ive had two fevers in my life that near killed me he said i think this one likely will i wouldna send for ye butim glad youre here he swallowed once then went on iwanted to say to ye that im sorry and to bid ye a proper farewell i wouldna ask ye to stay til the end butwould yewould ye stay wi mejust for a bit his right hand was pressed flat against the mattress steadying him i could see that he was fighting hard to keep any note of pleading from his voice or eyes to make it a simple request one that could be refused i sat down on the bed beside him careful not to jar him the firelight glowed on one side of his face sparking the redgold stubble of his beard picking up the small flickers of silver here and there leaving the other side masked in shadow he met my eyes not blinking i hoped the yearning that showed in his face was not quite so apparent on my own i reached out and ran a hand gently down the side of his face feeling the soft scratchiness of beard stubble ill stay for a bit i said but youre not going to die he raised one eyebrow you brought me through one bad fever using what i still think was witchcraft and jenny got me through the next wi naught but plain stubbornness i suppose wi the both of ye here ye might just manage it but im no at all sure i want to go through such an ordeal again i think id rather just die and ha done with it if its all the same to you ingrate i said coward torn between exasperation and tenderness i patted his cheek and stood up groping in the deep pocket of my skirt there was one item i had carried on my person at all times not trusting it to the vagaries of travel i laid the small flat case on the table and flipped the latch im not going to let you die this time either i informed him greatly as i may be tempted i carefully extracted the roll of gray flannel and laid it on the table with a soft clinking noise i unrolled the flannel displaying the gleaming row of syringes and rummaged in the box for the small bottle of penicillin tablets what in gods name are those jamie asked eyeing the syringes with interest they look wicked sharp i didnt answer occupied in dissolving the penicillin tablets in the vial of sterile water i selected a glass barrel fitted a needle and pressed the tip through the rubber covering the mouth of the bottle holding it up to the light i pulled back slowly on the plunger watching the thick white liquid fill the barrel checking for bubbles then pulling the needle free i depressed the plunger slightly until a drop of liquid pearled from the point and rolled slowly down the length of the spike roll onto your good side i said turning to jamie and pull up your shirt he eyed the needle in my hand with keen suspicion but reluctantly obeyed i surveyed the terrain with approval your bottom hasnt changed a bit in twenty years i remarked admiring the muscular curves neither has yours he replied courteously but im no insisting you expose it are ye suffering a sudden attack of lustfulness not just at present i said evenly swabbing a patch of skin with a cloth soaked in brandy thats a verra nice make of brandy he said peering back over his shoulder but im more accustomed to apply it at the other end its also the best source of alcohol available hold still now and relax i jabbed deftly and pressed the plunger slowly in ouch jamie rubbed his posterior resentfully itll stop stinging in a minute i poured an inch of brandy into the cup now you can have a bit to drinka very little bit he drained the cup without comment watching me roll up the collection of syringes finally he said i thought ye stuck pins in illwish dolls when ye meant to witch someone not in the people themselves its not a pin its a hypodermic syringe i dinna care what ye call it it felt like a bloody horseshoe nail would ye care to tell me why jabbing pins in my arse is going to help my arm i took a deep breath well do you remember my once telling you about germs he looked quite blank little beasts too small to see i elaborated they can get into your body through bad food or water or through open wounds and if they do they can make you ill he stared at his arm with interest ive germs in my arm have i you very definitely have i tapped a finger on the small flat box the medicine i just shot into your backside kills germs though you get another shot every four hours til this time tomorrow and then well see how youre doing i paused jamie was staring at me shaking his head do you understand i asked he nodded slowly aye i do i should ha let them burn ye twenty years ago whats in a name after giving him a shot and settling him comfortably i sat watching until he fell asleep again allowing him to hold my hand until his own grip relaxed in sleep and the big hand dropped slack by his side i sat by his bed for the rest of the night dozing sometimes and rousing myself by means of the internal clock all doctors have geared to the rhythms of a hospitals shift changes two more shots the last at daybreak and by then the fever had loosed its hold perceptibly he was still very warm to the touch but his flesh no longer burned and he rested easier falling asleep after the last shot with no more than a few grumbles and a faint moan as his arm twinged bloody eighteenthcentury germs are no match for penicillin i told his sleeping form no resistance even if you had syphilis id have it cleaned up in no time and what then i wondered as i staggered off to the kitchen in search of hot tea and food a strange woman presumably the cook or the housemaid was firing up the brick oven ready to receive the daily loaves that lay rising in their pans on the table she didnt seem surprised to see me but cleared away a small space for me to sit down and brought me tea and fresh girdlecakes with no more than a quick good mornin to ye mum before returning to her work evidently jenny had informed the household of my presence did that mean she accepted it herself i doubted it clearly she had wanted me to go and wasnt best pleased to have me back if i was going to stay there was plainly going to be a certain amount of explanation about laoghaire from both jenny and jamie and i was going to stay thank you i said politely to the cook and taking a fresh cup of tea with me went back to the parlor to wait until jamie saw fit to wake up again people passed by the door during the morning pausing now and then to peep through but always went on hurriedly when i looked up at last jamie showed signs of waking just before noon he stirred sighed groaned as the movement jarred his arm and subsided once more i gave him a few moments to realize that i was there but his eyes stayed shut he wasnt asleep though the lines of his body were slightly tensed not relaxed in slumber i had watched him sleep all night i knew the difference all right i said i leaned back in the chair settling myself comfortably well out of his reach lets hear it then a small slit of blue showed under the long auburn lashes then disappeared again mmmm he said pretending to wake slowly the lashes fluttered against his cheeks dont stall i said crisply i know perfectly well youre awake open your eyes and tell me about laoghaire the blue eyes opened and rested on me with an expression of some disfavor youre no afraid of giving me a relapse he inquired ive always heard sick folk shouldna be troubled owermuch it sets them back you have a doctor right here i assured him if you pass out from the strain ill know what to do about it thats what im afraid of his narrowed gaze flicked to the little case of drugs and hypodermics on the table then back to me my arse feels like ive sat in a gorse bush wi no breeks on good i said pleasantly youll get another one in an hour right now youre going to talk his lips pressed tight together but then relaxed as he sighed he pushed himself laboriously upright against the pillows onehanded i didnt help him all right he said at last he didnt look at me but down at the quilt where his finger traced the edge of the starred design well it was when id come back from england he had come up from the lake district and over the carters bar that great ridge of high ground that divides england from scotland on whose broad back the ancient courts and markets of the borders had been held theres a stone there to mark the border maybe youll know it looks the sort of stone to last a while he glanced at me questioning and i nodded i did know it a huge menhir some ten feet tall in my time someone had carved on its one face england and on the other scotland there he stopped to rest as thousands of travelers had stopped over the years his exiled past behind him the futureand homebelow and beyond past the hazy green hollows of the lowlands up into the gray crags of the highlands hidden by fog his good hand ran back and forth through his hair as it always did when he thought leaving the cowlicks on top standing up in small bright whorls youll not know how it is to live among strangers for so long wont i i said with some sharpness he glanced up at me startled then smiled faintly looking down at the coverlet aye maybe ye will he said ye change no much as ye want to keep the memories of home and who ye areyoure changed not one of the strangers ye could never be that even if ye wanted to but different from who ye were too i thought of myself standing silent beside frank a bit of flotsam in the eddies of university parties pushing a pram through the chilly parks of boston playing bridge and talking with other wives and mothers speaking the foreign language of middleclass domesticity strangers indeed yes i said i know get on he sighed rubbing his nose with a forefinger so i came back he said he looked up a smile hidden in the corner of his mouth what is it ye told wee ian home is the place where when ye have to go there they have to take ye in thats it i said its a quotation from a poet called frost but what do you mean surely your family was glad to see you he frowned fingering the quilt aye they were he said slowly its not thati dinna mean they made me feel unwelcome not at all but i had been away so longmichael and wee janet and ian didna even remember me he smiled ruefully theyd heard about me though when i came into the kitchen theyd squash back against the walls and stare at me wi their eyes gone round he leaned forward a little intent on making me understand see it was different when i hid in the cave i wasna in the house and they seldom saw me but i was always here i was always part of them i hunted for them i kent when they were hungry or cold or when the goats were ill or the kail crop poor or a new draft under the kitchen door then i went to prison he said abruptly and to england i wrote to themand they to mebut it canna be the same to see a few black words on the paper telling things that happened months before and when i came back he shrugged wincing as the movement jarred his arm it was different ian would ask me what i thought of fencing in auld kirbys pasture but id know hed already set young jamie to do it id walk through the fields and folk would squint at me suspicious thinking me a stranger then their eyes would go big as theyd seen a ghost when they knew me he stopped looking out at the window where the brambles of his mothers rose beat against the glass as the wind changed i was a ghost i think he glanced at me shyly if ye ken what i mean maybe i said rain was streaking the glass with drops the same gray as the sky outside you feel like your ties to the earth are broken i said softly floating through rooms without feeling your footsteps hearing people speak to you and not making sense of it i remember thatbefore bree was born but i had had one tie then i had her to anchor me to life he nodded not looking at me and then was quiet for a minute the peat fire hissed on the hearth behind me smelling of the highlands and the rich scent of cockaleekie and baking bread spread through the house warm and comforting as a blanket i was here he said softly but not home i could feel the pull of it around methe house the family the place itself i who couldnt remember a childhood home felt the urge to sit down here and stay forever enmeshed in the thousand strands of daily life bound securely to this bit of earth what would it have meant to him who had lived all his life in the strength of that bond endured his exile in the hope of coming back to it and then arrived to find himself still rootless and i suppose i was lonely he said quietly he lay still on the pillow eyes closed i suppose you were i said careful to let no tone either of sympathy or condemnation show i knew something of loneliness too he opened his eyes then and met my gaze with a naked honesty aye there was that too he said not the main thing nobut aye that too jenny had tried with varying degrees of gentleness and insistence to persuade him to marry again she had tried intermittently since the days after culloden presenting first one and then another personable young widow this and that sweettempered virgin all to no avail now bereft of the feelings that had sustained him so far desperately seeking some sense of connectionhe had listened laoghaire was married to hugh mackenzie one of colums tacksmen he said eyes closed once more hugh was killed at culloden though and two years later laoghaire married simon mackimmie of clan fraser the two lassiesmarsali and joantheyre his the english arrested him a few years later and took him to prison in edinburgh he opened his eyes looking up at the dark ceiling beams overhead he had a good house and property worth seizing that was enough to make a highland man a traitor then whether hed fought for the stuarts openly or not his voice was growing hoarse and he stopped to clear his throat simon wasnt as lucky as i was he died in prison before they could bring him to trial the crown tried for some time to take the estate but ned gowan went to edinburgh and spoke for laoghaire and he managed to save the main house and a little money claiming it was her dower right ned gowan i spoke with mingled surprise and pleasure he cant still be alive surely it was ned gowan a small and elderly solicitor who advised the mackenzie clan on legal matters who had saved me from being burned as a witch twenty years before i had thought him quite ancient then jamie smiled seeing my pleasure oh aye i expect theyll have to knock him on the head wi an ax to kill him he looks just the same as he always did though he must be past seventy now does he still live at castle leoch he nodded reaching to the table for the tumbler of water he drank awkwardly righthanded and set it back whats left of it aye though hes traveled a great deal these last years appealing treason cases and filing lawsuits to recover property jamies smile had a bitter edge theres a saying aye after a war first come the corbies to eat the flesh and then the lawyers to pick the bones his right hand went to his left shoulder massaging it unconsciously no hes a good man is ned in spite of his profession he goes back and forth to inverness to edinburghsometimes even to london or paris and he stops here from time to time to break his journey it was ned gowan who had mentioned laoghaire to jenny returning from balriggan to edinburgh pricking up her ears jenny had inquired for further details and finding these satisfactory had at once sent an invitation to balriggan for laoghaire and her two daughters to come to lallybroch for hogmanay which was near the house was bright that night with candles lit in the windows and bunches of holly and ivy fixed to the staircase and the doorposts there were not so many pipers in the highlands as there had been before culloden but one had been found and a fiddler as well and music floated up the stairwell mixed with the heady scent of rum punch plum cake almond squirts and savoy biscuits jamie had come down late and hesitant many people here he had not seen in nearly ten years and he was not eager to see them now feeling changed and distant as he did but jenny had made him a new shirt brushed and mended his coat and combed his hair smooth and plaited it for him before going downstairs to see to the cooking he had no excuse to linger and at last had come down into the noise and swirl of the gathering mister fraser peggy gibbons was the first to see him she hurried across the room face glowing and threw her arms about him quite unabashed taken by surprise he hugged her back and within moments was surrounded by a small crowd of women exclaiming over him holding up small children born since his departure kissing his cheeks and patting his hands the men were shyer greeting him with a gruff word of welcome or a slap on the back as he made his way slowly through the rooms until quite overwhelmed he had escaped temporarily into the lairds study once his fathers room and then his own it now belonged to his brotherinlaw who had run lallybroch through the years of his absence the ledgers and stockbooks and accounts were all lined up neatly on the edge of the battered desk he ran a finger along the leather spines feeling a sense of comfort at the touch it was all in here the planting and the harvests the careful purchases and acquisitions the slow accumulations and dispersals that were the rhythm of life to the tenants of lallybroch on the small bookshelf he found his wooden snake along with everything else of value he had left it behind when he went to prison a small icon carved of cherrywood it had been the gift of his elder brother dead in childhood he was sitting in the chair behind the desk stroking the snakes wellworn curves when the door of the study opened jamie she had said hanging shyly back he had not bothered to light a lamp in the study she was silhouetted by the candles burning in the hall she wore her pale hair loose like a maid and the light shone through it haloing her unseen face youll remember me maybe she had said tentative reluctant to come into the room without invitation aye he said after a pause aye of course i do the musics starting she said it was he could hear the whine of the fiddle and the stamp of feet from the front parlor along with an occasional shout of merriment it showed signs of being a good party already most of the guests would be asleep on the floor come morning your sister says youre a bonny dancer she said still shy but determined it will ha been some time since i tried he said feeling shy himself and painfully awkward though the fiddle music ached in his bones and his feet twitched at the sound of it its tha mo leabaidh san fhraochin the heathers my bedyoull ken that one will ye come and try wi me she had held out a hand to him small and graceful in the halfdark and he had risen clasped her outstretched hand in his own and taken his first steps in pursuit of himself it was in here he said waving his good hand at the room where we sat jenny had had the furniture cleared away all but one table wi the food and the whisky and the fiddler stood by the window there wi a new moon over his shoulder he nodded at the window where the rose vine trembled something of the light of that hogmanay feast lingered on his face and i felt a small pang seeing it we danced all that night sometimes wi others but mostly with each other and at the dawn when those still awake went to the end o the house to see what omens the new year might bring the two of us went too the single women took it in turns to spin about and walk through the door wi their eyes closed then spin again and open their eyes to see what the first thing they might see would befor that tells them about the man theyll marry ye ken there had been a lot of laughter as the guests heated by whisky and dancing pushed and shoved at the door laoghaire had held back flushed and laughing saying it was a game for young girls and not for a matron of thirtyfour but the others had insisted and try she had spun three times clockwise and opened the door stepped out into the cold dawnlight and spun again and when she opened her eyes they had rested on jamies face wide with expectation sothere she was a widow wi two bairns she needed a man that was plain enough i neededsomething he gazed into the fire where the low flame glimmered through the red mass of the peat heat without much light i supposed that we might help each other they had married quietly at balriggan and he had moved his few possessions there less than a year later he had moved out again and gone to edinburgh what on earth happened i asked more than curious he looked up at me helpless i canna say it wasna that anything was wrong exactlyonly that nothing was right he rubbed a hand tiredly between his brows it was me i think my fault i always disappointed her somehow wed sit down to supper and all of a sudden the tears would well up in her eyes and shed leave the table sobbing and me sitting there wi not a notion what id done or said wrong his fist clenched on the coverlet then relaxed god i never knew what to do for her or what to say anything i said just made it worse and there would be daysnay weekswhen shed not speak to me but only turn away when i came near her and stand staring out the window until i went away again his fingers went to the parallel scratches down the side of his neck they were nearly healed now but the marks of my nails still showed on his fair skin he looked at me wryly you never did that to me sassenach not my style i agreed smiling faintly if im mad at you youll bloody know why at least he snorted briefly and lay back on his pillows neither of us spoke for a bit then he said staring up at the ceiling i thought i didna want to hear anything about what it was likewi frank i mean i was maybe wrong about that ill tell you anything you want to know i said but not just now its still your turn he sighed and closed his eyes she was afraid of me he said softly a minute later i tried to be gentle wi hergod i tried again and again everything i knew to please a woman but it was no use his head turned restlessly making a hollow in the feather pillow maybe it was hugh or maybe simon i kent them both and they were good men but theres no telling what goes on in a marriage bed maybe it was bearing the children not all women can stand it but something hurt her sometime and i couldna heal it for all my trying she shrank away when i touched her and i could see the sickness and the fear in her eyes there were lines of sorrow around his own closed eyes and i reached impulsively for his hand he squeezed it gently and opened his eyes thats why i left finally he said softly i couldna bear it anymore i didnt say anything but went on holding his hand putting a finger on his pulse to check it his heartbeat was reassuringly slow and steady he shifted slightly in the bed moving his shoulders and making a grimace of discomfort as he did so arm hurt a lot i asked a bit i bent over him feeling his brow he was very warm but not feverish there was a line between the thick ruddy brows and i smoothed it with a knuckle head ache yes ill go and make you some willowbark tea i made to rise but his hand on my arm stopped me i dinna need tea he said it would ease me though if maybe i could lay my head in your lap and have ye rub my temples a bit blue eyes looked up at me limpid as a spring sky you dont fool me a bit jamie fraser i said im not going to forget about your next shot nonetheless i was already moving the chair out of the way and sitting down beside him on the bed he made a small grunting sound of content as i moved his head into my lap and began to stroke it rubbing his temples smoothing back the thick wavy mass of his hair the back of his neck was damp i lifted the hair away and blew softly on it seeing the smooth fair skin prickle into gooseflesh at the nape of his neck oh that feels good he murmured despite my resolve not to touch him beyond the demands of caretaking until everything between us was resolved i found my hands molding themselves to the clean bold lines of his neck and shoulders seeking the hard knobs of his vertebrae and the broad flat planes of his shoulder blades he was firm and solid under my hands his breath a warm caress on my thigh and it was with some reluctance that i at last eased him back onto the pillow and reached for the ampule of penicillin all right i said turning back the sheet and reaching for the hem of his shirt a quick stick and youll my hand brushed over the front of his nightshirt and i broke off startled jamie i said amused you cant possibly i dinna suppose i can he agreed comfortably he curled up on his side like a shrimp his lashes dark against his cheek but a man can dream no i didnt go upstairs to bed that night either we didnt talk much just lay close together in the narrow bed scarcely moving so as not to jar his injured arm the rest of the house was quiet everyone safely in bed and there was no sound but the hissing of the fire the sigh of the wind and the scratch of ellens rosebush at the window insistent as the demands of love do ye know he said softly somewhere in the black small hours of the night do ye know what its like to be with someone that way to try all ye can and seem never to have the secret of them yes i said thinking of frank yes i do know i thought perhaps ye did he was quiet for a moment and then his hand touched my hair lightly a shadowy blur in the firelight and then he whispered then to have it back again that knowing to be free in all ye say or do and know that it is right to say i love you and mean it with all your heart i said softly to the dark aye he answered barely audible to say that his hand rested on my hair and without knowing quite how it happened i found myself curled against him my head just fitting in the hollow of his shoulder for so many years he said for so long i have been so many things so many different men i felt him swallow and he shifted slightly the linen of his nightshirt rustling with starch i was uncle to jennys children and brother to her and ian milord to fergus and sir to my tenants mac dubh to the men of ardsmuir and mackenzie to the other servants at helwater malcolm the printer then and jamie roy at the docks the hand stroked my hair slowly with a whispering sound like the wind outside but here he said so softly i could barely hear him here in the dark with youi have no name i lifted my face toward his and took the warm breath of him between my own lips i love you i said and did not need to tell him how i meant it i meet a lawyer as i had predicted eighteenthcentury germs were no match for a modern antibiotic jamies fever had virtually disappeared within twentyfour hours and within the next two days the inflammation in his arm began to subside as well leaving no more than a reddening about the wound itself and a very slight oozing of pus when pressed on the fourth day after satisfying myself that he was mending nicely i dressed the wound lightly with coneflower salve bandaged it again and left to dress and make my own toilet upstairs ian janet young ian and the servants had all put their heads in at intervals over the last few days to see how jamie progressed jenny had been conspicuously absent from these inquiries but i knew that she was still entirely aware of everything that happened in her house i hadnt announced my intention of coming upstairs yet when i opened the door to my bedroom there was a large pitcher of hot water standing by the ewer gently steaming and a fresh cake of soap laid alongside it i picked it up and sniffed finemilled french soap perfumed with lily of the valley it was a delicate comment on my status in the householdhonored guest to be sure but not one of the family who would all make do as a matter of course with the usual coarse soap made of tallow and lye right i muttered well well see wont we and lathered the cloth for washing as i was arranging my hair in the glass a halfhour later i heard the sounds below of someone arriving several someones in fact from the sounds of it i came down the stairs to find a small mob of children in residence streaming in and out of the kitchen and front parlor with here and there a strange adult visible in the midst of them who stared curiously at me as i came down the stairs entering the parlor i found the camp bed put away and jamie shaved and in a fresh nightshirt neatly propped up on the sofa under a quilt with his left arm in a sling surrounded by four or five children these were shepherded by janet young ian and a smiling young man who was a fraser of sorts by the shape of his nose but otherwise bore only the faintest resemblances to the tiny boy i had seen last at lallybroch twenty years before there she is jamie exclaimed with pleasure at my appearance and the entire roomful of people turned to look at me with expressions ranging from pleasant greeting to gapemouthed awe youll remember young jamie the elder jamie said nodding to the tall broadshouldered young man with curly black hair and a squirming bundle in his arms i remember the curls i said smiling the rest has changed a bit young jamie grinned down at me i remember ye well auntie he said in a deepbrown voice like wellaged ale ye held me on your knee and played ten wee piggies wi my toes i cant possibly have i said looking up at him in some dismay while it seemed to be true that people really didnt change markedly in appearance between their twenties and their forties they most assuredly did so between four and twentyfour perhaps ye can have a go wi wee benjamin here young jamie suggested with a smile maybe the knack of it will come back to ye he bent and carefully laid his bundle in my arms a very round face looked up at me with that air of befuddlement so common to new babies benjamin appeared mildly confused at having me suddenly exchanged for his father but didnt object instead he opened his small pink mouth very wide inserted his fist and began to gnaw on it in a thoughtful manner a small blond boy in homespun breeks leaned on jamies knee staring up at me in wonder whos that nunkie he asked in a loud whisper thats your greatauntie claire jamie said gravely yell have heard about her i expect oh aye the little boy said nodding madly is she as old as grannie even older jamie said nodding back solemnly the lad gawked up at me for a moment then turned back to jamie face screwed up in scorn get on wi ye nunkie she doesna look anything like as old as grannie why theres scarce a bit o silver in her hair thank you child i said beaming at him are ye sure thats our greatauntie claire the boy went on looking doubtfully at me mam says greatauntie claire was maybe a witch but this lady doesna look much like it she hasna got a single wart on her nose that i can see thanks i said again a little more dryly and whats your name he turned suddenly shy at being thus directly addressed and buried his head in jamies sleeve refusing to speak this is angus walter edwin murray carmichael jamie answered for him ruffling the silky blond hair maggies eldest son and most commonly known as wally we call him snotrag a small redhaired girl standing by my knee informed me cause his neb is always clotted wi gook angus walter jerked his face out of his uncles shirt and glared at his female relation his features beetred with fury is not he shouted take it back not waiting to see whether she would or not he flung himself at her fists clenched but was jerked off his feet by his greatuncles hand attached to his collar ye dinna hit girls jamie informed him firmly its not manly but she said i was snotty angus walter wailed i must hit her and its no verra civil to pass remarks about someones personal appearance mistress abigail jamie said severely to the little girl ye should apologize to your cousin well but he is abigail persisted but then caught jamies stern eyes and dropped her own flushing scarlet sorry wally she murmured wally seemed at first indisposed to consider this adequate compensation for the insult he had suffered but was at last prevailed upon to cease trying to hit his cousin by his uncle promising him a story tell the one about the kelpie and the horseman my redhaired acquaintance exclaimed pushing forward to be in on it no the one about the devils chess game chimed in one of the other children jamie seemed to be a sort of magnet for them two boys were plucking at his coverlet while a tiny brownhaired girl had climbed up onto the sofa back by his head and begun intently plaiting strands of his hair pretty nunkie she murmured taking no part in the hail of suggestions its wallys story jamie said firmly quelling the incipient riot with a gesture he can choose as he likes he drew a clean handkerchief out from under the pillow and held it to wallys nose which was in fact rather unsightly blow he said in an undertone and then louder and then tell me which youll have wally wally snuffled obligingly then said st bride and the geese please nunkie jamies eyes sought me resting on my face with a thoughtful expression all right he said after a pause well then yell ken that the greylag mate for life if ye kill a grown goose hunting ye must always wait for the mate will come to mourn then ye must try to kill the second too for otherwise it will grieve itself to death calling through the skies for the lost one little benjamin shifted in his wrappings squirming in my arms jamie smiled and shifted his attention back to wally hanging openmouthed on his greatuncles knee so he said it was a time more hundreds of years past than you could ken or dream of that bride first set foot on the stone of the highlands along with michael the blessed benjamin let out a small squawk at this point and began to rootle at the front of my dress young jamie and his siblings seemed to have disappeared and after a moments patting and joggling had proved vain i left the room in search of benjamins mother leaving the story in progress behind me i found the lady in question in the kitchen embedded in a large company of girls and women and after turning benjamin over to her spent some time in introductions greeting and the sort of ritual by which women appraise each other openly and otherwise the women were all very friendly evidently everyone knew or had been told who i was for while they introduced me from one to another there was no apparent surprise at the return of jamies first wifeeither from the dead or from france depending on what theyd been told still there were very odd undercurrents passing through the gathering they scrupulously avoided asking me questions in another place this might be mere politeness but not in the highlands where any strangers life history was customarily extracted in the course of a casual visit and while they treated me with great courtesy and kindness there were small looks from the corner of the eye the passing of glances exchanged behind my back and casual remarks made quietly in gaelic but strangest of all was jennys absence she was the hearthfire of lallybroch i had never been in the house when it was not suffused with her presence all the inhabitants in orbit about her like planets about the sun i could think of nothing less like her than that she should leave her kitchen with such a mob of company in the house her presence was as strong now as the perfume of the fresh pine boughs that lay in a large pile in the back pantry their presence beginning to scent the house but of jenny herself not a hair was to be seen she had avoided me since the night of my return with young iannatural enough i supposed under the circumstances neither had i sought an interview with her both of us knew there was a reckoning to be made but neither of us would seek it then it was warm and cozy in the kitchentoo warm the intermingled scents of drying cloth hot starch wet diapers sweating bodies oatcake frying in lard and bread baking were becoming a bit too heady and when katherine mentioned the need of a pitcher of cream for the scones i seized the opportunity to escape volunteering to fetch it down from the dairy shed after the press of heated bodies in the kitchen the cold damp air outside was so refreshing that i stood still for a minute shaking the kitchen smells out of my petticoats and hair before making my way to the dairy shed this shed was some distance away from the main house convenient to the milking shed which in turn was built to adjoin the two small paddocks in which sheep and goats were kept cattle were kept in the highlands but normally for beef rather than milk cows milk being thought suitable only for invalids to my surprise as i came out of the dairy shed i saw fergus leaning on the paddock fence staring moodily at the mass of milling wooly backs below i had not expected to see him here and wondered whether jamie knew he had returned jennys prized merino sheepimported handfed and a great deal more spoilt than any of her grandchildrenspotted me as i passed and rushed en masse for the side of their pen blatting frenziedly in hope of tidbits fergus looked up startled at the racket then waved halfheartedly he called something but it was impossible to hear him over the uproar there was a large bin of frostblasted cabbage heads near the pen i pulled out a large limp green head and doled out leaves to a dozen or so pairs of eagerly grasping lips in hopes of shutting them up the ram a huge wooly creature named hughie with testicles that hung nearly to the ground like woolcovered footballs shouldered his massive way into the front rank with a loud and autocratic bahh fergus who had reached my side by this time picked up a whole cabbage and hurled it at hughie with considerable force and fair accuracy taistoi he said irritably hughie shied and let out an astonished highpitched beh as the cabbage bounced off his padded back then shaking himself back into some semblance of dignity he trotted off testes swinging with offended majesty his flock sheeplike trailed after him uttering a low chorus of discontented bahs in his wake fergus glowered malevolently after them useless noisy smelly beasts he said rather ungratefully i thought given that the scarf and stockings he was wearing had almost certainly been woven from their wool nice to see you again fergus i said ignoring his mood does jamie know youre back yet i wondered just how much fergus knew of recent events if he had just arrived at lallybroch no he said rather listlessly i suppose i should tell him i am here in spite of this he made no move toward the house but continued staring into the churned mud of the paddock something was obviously eating at him i hoped nothing had gone wrong with his errand did you find mr gage all right i asked he looked blank for a moment then a spark of animation came back into his lean face oh yes milord was right i went with gage to warn the other members of the society and then we went together to the tavern where they were to meet sure enough there was a nest of customs men there waiting disguised and may they be waiting as long as their fellow in the cask ha ha the gleam of savage amusement died out of his eyes then and he sighed we cannot expect to be paid for the pamphlets of course and even though the press was saved god knows how long it may be until milords business is reestablished he spoke with such mournfulness that i was surprised you dont help with the printing business do you i asked he raised one shoulder and let it fall not to say help milady but milord was kind enough to allow me to invest a part of my share of the profits from the brandy in the printing business in time i should have become a full partner i see i said sympathetically do you need money perhaps i can he shot me a glance of surprise and then a smile that displayed his perfect square white teeth thank you milady but no i myself need very little and i have enough he patted the side pocket of his coat which jingled reassuringly he paused frowning and thrust both wrists deep into the pockets of his coat noo he said slowly it is onlywell the printing business is most respectable milady i suppose so i said slightly puzzled he caught my tone and smiled rather grimly the difficulty milady is that while a smuggler may be in possession of an income more than sufficient for the support of a wife smuggling as a sole profession is not likely to appeal to the parents of a respectable young lady oho i said everything becoming clear you want to get married to a respectable young lady he nodded a little shyly yes madame but her mother does not favor me i couldnt say i blamed the young ladys mother all things considered while fergus was possessed of dark good looks and a dashing manner that might well win a young girls heart he lacked a few of the things that might appeal somewhat more to conservative scottish parents such as property income a left hand and a last name likewise while smuggling cattlelifting and other forms of practical communism had a long and illustrious history in the highlands the french did not and no matter how long fergus himself had lived at lallybroch he remained as french as notre dame he would like me always be an outlander if i were a partner in a profitable printing firm you see perhaps the good lady might be induced to consider my suit he explained but as it is he shook his head disconsolately i patted his arm sympathetically dont worry about it i said well think of something does jamie know about this girl im sure hed be willing to speak to her mother for you to my surprise he looked quite alarmed oh no milady please say nothing to himhe has a great many things of more importance to think of just now on the whole i thought this was probably true but i was surprised at his vehemence still i agreed to say nothing to jamie my feet were growing chilly from standing in the frozen mud and i suggested that we go inside perhaps a little later milady he said for now i believe i am not suitable company even for sheep with a heavy sigh he turned and trudged off toward the dovecote shoulders slumped to my surprise jenny was in the parlor with jamie she had been outside her cheeks and the end of her long straight nose were pink with the cold and the scent of winter mist lingered in her clothes ive sent young ian to saddle donas she said she frowned at her brother can ye stand to walk to the barn jamie or had he best bring the beast round for ye jamie stared up at her one eyebrow raised i can walk wherever its needful to go but im no going anywhere just now did i not tell ye hed be coming jenny said impatiently amyas kettrick stopped by here late last night and said hed just come from kinwallis hobarts meaning to come today he said she glanced at the pretty enameled clock on the mantel if he left after breakfast hell be here within the hour jamie frowned at his sister tilting his head back against the sofa i told ye jenny im no afraid of hobart mackenzie he said shortly damned if ill run from him jennys brows rose as she looked coldly at her brother oh aye she said ye werent afraid of laoghaire either and look where that got ye she jerked her head at the sling on his arm despite himself jamies mouth curled up on one side aye well its a point he said on the other hand jenny ye ken guns are scarcer than hens teeth in the highlands i dinna think hobarts going to come and ask to borrow my own pistol to shoot me with i shouldna think hed bother hell just walk in and spit ye through the gizzard like the silly gander ye are she snapped jamie laughed and she glared at him i seized the moment to interrupt who i inquired is hobart mackenzie and why exactly does he want to spit you like a gander jamie turned his head to me the light of amusement still in his eyes hobart is laoghaires brother sassenach he explained as for spitting me or otherwise laoghaires sent for him from kinwallis where he lives jenny interrupted and told him aboutall this a slight impatient gesture encompassed me jamie and the awkward situation in general the notion being that hobarts meant to come round and expunge the slight upon his sisters honor by expunging me jamie explained he seemed to find the idea entertaining i wasnt so sure about it and neither was jenny youre not worried about this hobart i asked of course not he said a little irritably he turned to his sister for gods sake jenny ye ken hobart mackenzie the man couldna stick a pig without cutting off his own foot she looked him up and down evidently gauging his ability to defend himself against an incompetent pigsticker and reluctantly concluding that he might manage even onehanded mmphm she said well and what if he comes for ye and ye kill him aye what then then hell be dead i expect jamie said dryly and yell be hangit for murder she shot back or on the run wi all the rest of laoghaires kin after ye want to start a blood feud do ye jamie narrowed his eyes at his sister emphasizing the already marked resemblance between them what i want he said with exaggerated patience is my breakfast dye mean to feed me or dye mean to wait until i faint from hunger and then hide me in the priest hole til hobart leaves annoyance struggled with humor on jennys fineboned face as she glared at her brother as usual with both frasers humor won out its a thought she said teeth flashing in a brief reluctant smile if i could drag your stubborn carcass that far id club ye myself she shook her head and sighed all right jamie yell have it your way but yell try not to make a mess on my good turkey carpet aye he looked up at her long mouth curling up on one side its a promise jenny he said nay bloodshed in the parlor she snorted clot she said but without rancor ill send janet wi your parritch and she was gone in a swirl of skirts and petticoats did she say donas i asked looking after her in bemusement surely it isnt the same horse you took from leoch och no jamie tilted his head back smiling up at me this is donass grandsonor one of them we give the name to the sorrel colts in his honor i leaned over the back of the sofa gently feeling down the length of the injured arm from the shoulder sore i asked seeing him wince as i pressed a few inches above the wound it was better the day before the area of soreness had started higher not bad he said he removed the sling and tried gingerly extending the arm grimacing i dinna think ill turn handsprings awhile yet though i laughed no i dont suppose so i hesitated jamiethis hobart you really dont think i dont he said firmly and if i did id still want my breakfast first i dinna mean to be killed on an empty stomach i laughed again somewhat reassured ill go and get it for you i promised as i stepped out into the hall though i caught sight of a flutter through one of the windows and stopped to look it was jenny cloaked and hooded against the cold headed up the slope to the barn seized by a sudden impulse i snatched a cloak from the hall tree and darted out after her i had things to say to jenny murray and this might be the best chance of catching her alone i caught up with her just outside the barn she heard my step behind her and turned startled she glanced about quickly but saw we were alone realizing that there was no way of putting off a confrontation she squared her shoulders under the woolen cloak and lifted her head meeting my eyes straight on i thought id best tell young ian to unsaddle the horse she said then im going to the root cellar to fetch up some onions for a tart will ye come with me i will pulling my cloak tight around me against the winter wind i followed her into the barn it was warm inside at least by contrast with the chill outdoors dark and filled with the pleasant scent of horses hay and manure i paused a moment to let my eyes adapt to the dimness but jenny walked directly down the central aisle footsteps light on the stone floor young ian was sprawled at length on a pile of fresh straw he sat up blinking at the sound jenny glanced from her son to the stall where a softeyed sorrel was peacefully munching hay from its manger unburdened by saddle or bridle did i not tell ye to ready donas she asked the boy her voice sharp young ian scratched his head looking a little sheepish and stood up aye mam ye did he said but i didna think it worth the time to saddle him only to have to unsaddle him again jenny stared up at him oh aye she said and what made ye so certain he wouldna be needed young ian shrugged and smiled down at her mam ye ken as well as i do that uncle jamie wouldna run away from anything let alone uncle hobart dont ye he added gently jenny looked up at her son and sighed then a reluctant smile lighted her face and she reached up smoothing the thick untidy hair away from his face aye wee ian i do her hand lingered along his ruddy cheek then dropped away go along to the house then and have second breakfast wi your uncle she said your auntie and i are goin to the root cellar but ye come and fetch me smartly if mr hobart mackenzie should come aye right away mam he promised and shot for the house impelled by the thought of food jenny watched him go moving with the clumsy grace of a young whooping crane and shook her head the smile still on her lips sweet laddie she murmured then recalled to the present circumstances she turned to me with decision come along then she said i expect ye want to talk to me aye neither of us said anything until we reached the quiet sanctuary of the root cellar it was a small room dug under the house pungent with the scent of the long braided strings of onions and garlic that hung from the rafters the sweet spicy scent of dried apples and the moist earthy smell of potatoes spread in lumpy brown blankets over the shelves that lined the cellar dye remember telling me to plant potatoes jenny asked passing a hand lightly over the clustered tubers that was a lucky thing twas the potato crop kept us alive more than one winter after culloden i remembered all right i had told her as we stood together on a cold autumn night about to partshe to return to a newborn baby i to hunt for jamie an outlaw in the highlands under sentence of death i had found him and saved himand lallybroch evidently and she had tried to give them both to laoghaire why i said softly at last i spoke to the top of her head bent over her task her hand went out with the regularity of clockwork pulling an onion from the long hanging braid breaking the tough withered stems from the plait and tossing it into the basket she carried why did you do it i said i broke off an onion from another braid but instead of putting it in the basket held it in my hands rolling it back and forth like a baseball hearing the papery skin rustle between my palms why did i do what her voice was perfectly controlled again only someone who knew her well could have heard the note of strain in it i knew her wellor had at one time why did i make the match between my brother and laoghaire dye mean she glanced up quickly smooth black brows raised in question but then bent back to the braid of onions youre right he wouldna have done it without i made him so you did make him do it i said the wind rattled the door of the root cellar sending a small sifting of dirt down upon the cutstone steps he was lonely she said softly so lonely i couldna bear to see him so he was wretched for so long ye ken mourning for you i thought he was dead i said quietly answering the unspoken accusation he might as well have been she said sharply then raised her head and sighed pushing back a lock of dark hair aye maybe ye truly didna ken hed lived there were a great many who didnt after cullodenand its sure he thought you were dead and gone then but he was sair wounded and not only his leg and when he came home from england she shook her head and reached for another onion he was whole enough to look at but not she gave me a look straight on with those slanted blue eyes so disturbingly like her brothers hes no the sort of man should sleep alone aye granted i said shortly but we did live the both of us why did you send for laoghaire when we came back with young ian jenny didnt answer at first but only went on reaching for onions breaking reaching breaking reaching i liked you she said at last so low i could barely hear her loved ye maybe when ye lived here with jamie before i liked you too i said just as softly then why her hands stilled at last and she looked up at me fists balled at her sides when ian told me yed come back she said slowly eyes fastened on the onions ye could have knocked me flat wi a downfeather at first i was excited wanting to see yewanting to know where yed been she added arching her brows slightly in inquiry i didnt answer and she went on but then i was afraid she said softly her eyes slid away shadowed by their thick fringe of black lashes i saw ye ye ken she said still looking off into some unseeable distance when he wed laoghaire and them standing by the altarye were there wi them standing at his left hand betwixt him and laoghaire and i kent that meant ye would take him back the hair prickled slightly on the nape of my neck she shook her head slowly and i saw she had gone pale with the memory she sat down on a barrel the cloak spreading out around her like a flower im not one of those born wi the sight nor one who has it regular ive never had it before and hope never to have it again but i saw ye there as clear as i see ye now and it scairt me so that i had to leave the room right in the midst o the vows she swallowed looking at me directly i dinna ken who ye are she said softly ororwhat we didna ken your people or your place i never asked ye did i jamie chose ye that was enough but then ye were gone and after so longi thought he might have forgot ye enough to wed again and be happy he wasnt though i said hoping for confirmation from jenny she gave it shaking her head no she said quietly but jamies a faithful man aye no matter how it was between the two of them him and laoghaire if hed sworn to be her man he wouldna leave her altogether it didna matter that he spent most of his time in edinburgh i kent hed always come back herehed be bound here to the highlands but then you came back her hands lay still in her lap a rare sight they were still finely shaped longfingered and deft but the knuckles were red and rough with years of work and the veins stood out blue beneath the thin white skin dye ken she said looking into her lap i have never been further than ten miles from lallybroch in all my life no i said slightly startled she shook her head slowly then looked up at me you have though she said youve traveled a great deal i expect her gaze searched my face looking for clues i have she nodded as though thinking to herself youll go again she said nearly whispering i kent ye would go again youre not bound here not like laoghairenot like me and he would go with ye and i should never see him again she closed her eyes briefly then opened them looking at me under her fine dark brows thats why she said i thought if ye kent about laoghaire yed go again at onceyou did she added with a faint grimace and jamie would stay but ye came back her shoulders rose in a faint helpless shrug and i see its no good hes bound to ye for good or ill its you thats his wife and if ye leave again he will go with ye i searched helplessly for words to reassure her but i wont i wont go again i only want to stay here with himalways i laid a hand on her arm and she stiffened slightly after a moment she laid her own hand over mine it was chilled and the tip of her long straight nose was red with cold folk say different things of the sight aye she said after a moment some say its doomed whatever ye see that way must come to pass but others say nay its no but a warning take heed and ye can change things what dye think yourself she looked sideways at me curiously i took a deep breath the smell of onions stinging the back of my nose this was hitting home in no uncertain terms i dont know i said and my voice shook slightly id always thought that of course you could change things if you knew about them but nowi dont know i ended softly thinking of culloden jenny watched me her eyes so deep a blue as almost to be black in the dim light i wondered again just how much jamie had told herand how much she knew without the telling but ye must try even so she said with certainty ye couldna just leave it could ye i didnt know whether she meant this personally but i shook my head no i said you couldnt youre right you have to try we smiled at each other a little shyly youll take good care of him jenny said suddenly even if ye go ye will aye i squeezed her cold fingers feeling the bones of her hand light and fragileseeming in my grasp i will i said then thats all right she said softly and squeezed back we sat for a moment holding each others hands until the door of the root cellar swung open admitting a blast of rain and wind down the stairs mam young ians head poked in eyes bright with excitement hobart mackenzies come da says to come quick jenny sprang to her feet barely remembering to snatch up the basket of onions has he come armed then she asked anxiously has he brought a pistol or a sword ian shook his head his dark hair lifting wildly in the wind oh no mam he said its worse hes brought a lawyer anything less resembling vengeance incarnate than hobart mackenzie could scarcely be imagined a small lightboned man of about thirty he had pale blue palelashed eyes with a tendency to water and indeterminate features that began with a receding hairline and dwindled down into a similarly receding chin that seemed to be trying to escape into the folds of his stock he was smoothing his hair at the mirror in the hall when we came in the front door a neatly curled bob wig sitting on the table beside him he blinked at us in alarm then snatched up the wig and crammed it on his head bowing in the same motion mrs jenny he said his small rabbity eyes flicked in my direction away then back again as though he hoped i really wasnt there but was very much afraid i was jenny glanced from him to me sighed deeply and took the bull by the horns mr mackenzie she said dropping him a formal curtsy might i present my goodsister claire claire mr hobart mackenzie of kinwallis his mouth dropped open and he simply gawked at me i started to extend a hand to him but thought better of it i would have liked to know what emily post had to recommend in a situation like this but as miss post wasnt present i was forced to improvise how nice to meet you i said smiling as cordially as possible ah he said he bobbed his head tentatively at me umyourservant maam fortunately at this point in the proceedings the door to the parlor opened i looked at the small neat figure framed in the doorway and let out a cry of delighted recognition ned ned gowan it was indeed ned gowan the elderly edinburgh lawyer who had once saved me from burning as a witch he was noticeably more elderly now shrunken with age and so heavily wrinkled as to look like one of the dried apples i had seen in the root cellar the bright black eyes were the same though and they fastened on me at once with an expression of joy my dear he exclaimed hastening forward at a rapid hobble he seized my hand beaming and pressed it to his withered lips in fervent gallantry i had heard that you how did you come to be so delightful to see you so happy to see you again but a cough from hobart mackenzie interrupted this rapturous exchange and mr gowan looked up startled then nodded oh aye of course business first my dear he said with a gallant bow to me and then if ye will i should be most charmed to hear the tale of your adventures ahill do my best i said wondering just how much he would insist on hearing splendid splendid he glanced about the hall bright little eyes taking in hobart and jenny who had hung up her cloak and was smoothing her hair mr fraser and mr murray are already in the parlor mr mackenzie if you and the ladies would consent to join us perhaps we can settle your affairs expeditiously and proceed to more congenial matters if you will allow me my dear he crooked a bony arm to me invitingly jamie was still on the sofa where i had left him and in approximately the same conditionthat is alive the children were gone with the exception of one chubby youngster who was curled up on jamies lap fast asleep jamies hair now sported several small plaits on either side with silk ribbons woven gaily through them which gave him an incongruously festive air you look like the cowardly lion of oz i told him in an undertone sitting down on a hassock behind his sofa i didnt think it likely that hobart mackenzie intended any outright mischief but if anything happened i meant to be in close reach of jamie he looked startled and put a hand to his head i do shh i said ill tell you later the other participants had now arranged themselves around the parlor jenny sitting down by ian on the other love seat and hobart and mr gowan taking two velvet chairs we are assembled mr gowan inquired glancing around the room all interested parties are present excellent well to begin with i must declare my own interest i am here in the capacity of solicitor to mr hobart mackenzie representing the interests of mrs james fraser he saw me start and added with precisionthat is the second mrs james fraser née laoghaire mackenzie that is understood he glanced inquiringly at jamie who nodded it is good mr gowan picked up a glass from the table next to him and took a tiny sip my clients the mackenzies have accepted my proposal to seek a legal solution to the imbroglio which i understand has resulted from the sudden and unexpectedthough of course altogether happy and fortuitous he added with a bow to me return of the first mrs fraser he shook his head reprovingly at jamie you my dear young man have contrived to entangle yourself in considerable legal difficulties i am sorry to say jamie raised one eyebrow and looked at his sister aye well i had help he said dryly just what difficulties are we speakin of well to begin with ned gowan said cheerily his sparkling black eyes sinking into nets of wrinkles as he smiled at me the first mrs fraser would be well within her rights to bring a civil suit against ye for adultery and criminal fornication forbye penalties for which include jamie glanced back at me with a quick blue gleam i think im no so worrit by that possibility he told the lawyer what else ned gowan nodded obligingly and held up one withered hand folding down the fingers as he ticked off his points with respect to the second mrs frasernée laoghaire mackenzieye could of course be charged wi bigamous misconduct intent to defraud actual fraud committedwhether wi intent or no which is a separate questionfelonious misrepresentationhe happily folded down his fourth finger and drew breath for moreand jamie had been listening patiently to this catalogue now he interrupted leaning forward ned he said gently what the hell does the bloody woman want the small lawyer blinked behind his spectacles lowered his hand and cast up his eyes to the beams overhead weel the ladys chief desire as stated he said circumspectly is to see ye castrated and disemboweled in the market square at broch mordha and your head mounted on a stake over her gate jamies shoulders vibrated briefly and he winced as the movement jarred his arm i see he said his mouth twitching a smile gathered up the wrinkles by neds ancient mouth i was obliged to inform mrsthat is the lady he amended with a glance at me and a slight cough that her remedies under the law were somewhat more limited than would accommodate her desires quite jamie said dryly but i assume the general idea is that she doesna particularly want me back as a husband no hobart put in unexpectedly crows bait maybe but not a husband ned cast a cold glance at his client ye willna compromise your case by admitting things in advance of settlement aye he said reprovingly or what are ye payin me for he turned back to jamie professional dignity unimpaired while miss mackenzie does not wish to resume a marital position wi regard to youan action which would be impossible in any case he added fairly unless ye should wish to divorce the present mrs fraser and remarry no i dinna want to do that jamie assured him hurriedly with another glance at me well in such case ned went on unruffled i should advise my clients that it is more desirable where possible to avoid the costand the publicity he added cocking an invisible eyebrow in admonition to hobart who nodded hastily of a suit at law with a public trial and its consequent exposure of facts that being the case how much jamie interrupted mr fraser ned gowan looked shocked i havena mentioned anything in the nature of a pecuniary settlement as yet only because yere too busy enjoying yourself ye wicked auld rascal jamie said he was irritateda red patch burned over each cheekbonebut amused too get to it aye ned gowan inclined his head ceremoniously weel ye must understand he began that a successful suit brought under the charges as described might result in miss mackenzie and her brother mulcting ye in substantial damagesverra substantial indeed he added with a faint lawyerly gloating at the prospect after all miss mackenzie has not only been subject to public humiliation and ridicule leading to acute distress of mind but is also threatened with loss of her chief means of support she isna threatened wi any such thing jamie interrupted heatedly i told her i should go on supporting her and the two lassies what does she think i am ned exchanged a glance with hobart who shook his head ye dinna want to know what she thinks ye are hobart assured jamie i wouldna have thought she kent such words myself but ye do mean to pay jamie nodded impatiently rubbing his good hand through his hair aye i will only until shes marrit again though everyones head turned in surprise toward jenny who nodded firmly to ned gowan if jamies married to claire the marriage between him and laoghaire wasna valid aye the lawyer bowed that is true mrs murray well then jenny said in a decided manner shes free to marry again at once is she no and once she does my brother shouldna be providing for her household an excellent point mrs murray ned gowan took up his quill and scratched industriously well we make progress he declared laying it down again and beaming at the company now the next point to be covered an hour later the decanter of whisky was empty the sheets of foolscap on the table were filled with ned gowans chickenscratchings and everyone lay limp and exhaustedexcept ned himself spry and brighteyed as ever excellent excellent he declared again gathering up the sheets and tapping them neatly into order sothe main provisions of the settlement are as follows mr fraser agrees to pay to miss mackenzie the sum of five hundred pounds in compensation for distress inconvenience and the loss of his conjugal servicesjamie snorted slightly at this but ned affected not to hear him continuing his synopsisand in addition agrees to maintain her household at the rate of one hundred pounds per annum until such time as the aforesaid miss mackenzie may marry again at which time such payment shall cease mr fraser agrees also to provide a brideportion for each of miss mackenzies daughters of an additional three hundred pounds and as a final provision agrees not to pursue a prosecution against miss mackenzie for assault with intent to commit murder in return miss mackenzie acquits mr fraser of any and all other claims this is in accordance with your understanding and consent mr fraser he quirked a brow at jamie aye it is jamie said he was pale from sitting up too long and there was a fine dew of sweat at his hairline but he sat straight and tall the child still asleep in his lap thumb firmly embedded in her mouth excellent ned said again he rose beaming and bowed to the company as our friend dr john arbuthnot says law is a bottomless pit but not more so at the moment than my stomach is that delectable aroma indicative of a saddle of mutton in our vicinity mrs jenny at table i sat to one side of jamie hobart mackenzie to the other now looking pink and relaxed mary macnab brought in the joint and by ancient custom set it down in front of jamie her gaze lingered on him a moment too long he picked up the long wicked carving knife with his good hand and offered it politely to hobart will ye have a go at it hobart he said och no hobart said waving it away better let your wife carve it im no hand wi a knifelikely cut my finger off instead you know me jamie he said comfortably jamie gave his erstwhile brotherinlaw a long look over the saltcellar once i would ha thought so hobart he said pass me the whisky aye the thing to do is to get her married at once jenny declared the children and grandchildren had all retired and ned and hobart had departed for kinwallis leaving the four of us to take stock over brandy and cream cakes in the lairds study jamie turned to his sister the matchmakings more in your line aye he said with a noticeable edge to his voice i expect you can think of a suitable man or two for the job if ye put your mind to it i expect i can she said matching his edge with one of her own she was embroidering the needle stabbed through the linen fabric flashing in the lamplight it had begun to sleet heavily outside but the study was cozy with a small fire on the hearth and the pool of lamplight spilling warmth over the battered desk and its burden of books and ledgers theres the one thing about it she said eyes on her work where dye mean to get twelve hundred pounds jamie i had been wondering that myself the insurance settlement on the printshop had fallen far short of that amount and i doubted that jamies share of the smuggling proceeds amounted to anything near that magnitude certainly lallybroch itself could not supply the money survival in the highlands was a chancy business and even several good years in a row would provide only the barest surplus well theres only the one place isnt there ian looked from his sister to his brotherinlaw and back after a short silence jamie nodded i suppose so he said reluctantly he glanced at the window where the rain was slashing across the glass in slanting streaks a vicious time of year for it though ian shrugged and sat forward a bit in his chair the spring tide will be in a week jamie frowned looking troubled aye thats so but theres no one has a better right to it jamie ian said he reached out and squeezed his friends good arm smiling it was meant for prince charles followers aye and ye were one of those whether ye wanted to be or no jamie gave him back a rueful halfsmile aye i suppose thats true he sighed in any case its the only thing i can see to do he glanced back and forth between ian and jenny evidently debating whether to add something else his sister knew him even better than i did she lifted her head from her work and looked at him sharply what is it jamie she said he took a deep breath i want to take young ian he said no she said instantly the needle had stopped stuck halfway through a brilliant red bud in the pattern the color of blood against the white smock hes old enough jenny jamie said quietly hes not she objected hes but barely fifteen michael and jamie were both sixteen at least and better grown aye but wee ians a better swimmer than either of his brothers ian said judiciously his forehead was furrowed with thought it will have to be one of the lads after all he pointed out to jenny he jerked his head toward jamie cradling his arm in its sling jamie canna very well be swimming himself in his present condition or claire for that matter he added with a smile at me swim i said utterly bewildered swim where ian looked taken aback for a moment then he glanced at jamie brows lifted oh ye hadna told her jamie shook his head i had but not all of it he turned to me its the treasure sassenachthe seals gold unable to take the treasure with him he had concealed it in its place and returned to ardsmuir i didna ken what best to do about it he explained duncan kerr gave the care of it to me but i had no notion who it belonged to or who put it there or what i was to do with it the white witch was all duncan said and that meant nothing to me but you sassenach reluctant to make use of the treasure himself and yet feeling that someone should know about it lest he die in prison he had sent a carefully coded letter to jenny and ian at lallybroch giving the location of the cache and the use for which it hadpresumablybeen meant times had been hard for jacobites then sometimes even more so for those who had escaped to franceleaving lands and fortunes behindthan for those who remained to face english persecution in the highlands at about the same time lallybroch had experienced two bad crops in a row and letters had reached them from france asking for any help possible to succor erstwhile companions there in danger of starvation we had nothing to send in fact we were damn close to starving here ian explained i sent word to jamie and he said as he thought perhaps it wouldna be wrong to use a small bit of the treasure to help feed prince tearlachs followers it seemed likely it was put there by one of the stuarts supporters jamie chimed in he cocked a ruddy brow at me and his mouth quirked up at one corner i thought i wouldna send it to prince charles though good thinking i said dryly any money given to charles stuart would have been wasted squandered within weeks and anyone who had known charles intimately as jamie had would know that very well ian had taken his eldest son jamie and made his way across scotland to the seals cove near coigach fearful of any word of the treasure getting out they had not sought a fishermans boat but instead young jamie had swum to the seals rock as his uncle had several years before he had found the treasure in its place abstracted two gold coins and three of the smaller gemstones and secreting these in a bag tied securely round his neck had replaced the rest of the treasure and made his way back through the surf arriving exhausted they had made their way to inverness then and taken ship to france where their cousin jared fraser a successful expatriate wine merchant had helped them to change the coins and jewels discreetly into cash and taken the responsibility of distributing it among the jacobites in need three times since ian had made the laborious trip to the coast with one of his sons each time to abstract a small part of the hidden fortune to supply a need twice the money had gone to friends in need in france once it had been needed to purchase fresh plantingstock for lallybroch and provide the food to see its tenants through a long winter when the potato crop failed only jenny ian and the two elder boys jamie and michael knew of the treasure ians wooden leg prevented his swimming to the seals island so one of his sons must always make the trip with him i gathered that it had been something of a rite of passage for both young jamie and michael entrusted with such a great secret now it might be young ians turn no jenny said again but i thought her heart wasnt in it ian was already nodding thoughtfully would ye take him with ye to france too jamie jamie nodded aye thats the thing i shall have to leave lallybroch and stay away for a good bit for laoghaires sakei canna be living here with you under her nose he said apologetically to me at least not until shes suitably wed to someone else he switched his attention back to ian i havena told ye everything thats happened in edinburgh ian but all things considered i think it likely best i stay away from there for a time too i sat quiet trying to digest this news i hadnt realized that jamie meant to leave lallybrochleave scotland altogether it sounded like so what dye mean to do jamie jenny had given up any pretense of sewing and sat with her hands in her lap he rubbed his nose looking tired this was the first day he had been up i privately thought he should have been back in bed hours ago but he had insisted upon staying up to preside over dinner and visit with everyone well he said slowly jareds offered more than once to take me into his firm perhaps i shall stay in france at least for a year i was thinking young ian could go with us and be schooled in paris jenny and ian exchanged a long look one of those in which longmarried couples are capable of carrying out complete conversations in the space of a few heartbeats at last jenny tilted her head a bit to one side ian smiled and took her hand itll be all right mo nighean dubh he said to her in a low tender voice then he turned to jamie aye take him itll be a great chance for the lad youre sure jamie hesitated speaking to his sister rather than ian jenny nodded her blue eyes glistened in the lamplight and the end of her nose was slightly red i suppose its best we give him his freedom while he still thinks its ours to give she said she looked at jamie then at me straight and steady but youll take good care of him aye lost and by the wind grieved this part of scotland was as unlike the leafy glens and lochs near lallybroch as the north yorkshire moors here there were virtually no trees only long sweeps of rockstrewn heather rising into crags that touched the lowering sky and disappeared abruptly into curtains of mist as we got nearer to the seacoast the mist became heavier setting in earlier in the afternoon lingering longer in the morning so that only for a couple of hours in the middle of the day did we have anything like clear riding the going was consequently slow but none of us minded greatly except young ian who was beside himself with excitement impatient to arrive how far is it from the shore to the seals island he asked jamie for the tenth time a quarter mile i make it his uncle replied i can swim that far young ian repeated for the tenth time his hands were clenched tightly on the reins and his bony jaw set with determination aye i know ye can jamie assured him patiently he glanced at me the hint of a smile hidden in the corner of his mouth ye willna need to though just swim straight for the island and the current will carry ye the boy nodded and lapsed into silence but his eyes were bright with anticipation the headland above the cove was mistshrouded and deserted our voices echoed oddly in the fog and we soon stopped talking out of an abiding sense of eeriness i could hear the seals barking far below the sound wavering and mixing with the crash of the surf so that now and then it sounded like sailors hallooing to one another over the sound of the sea jamie pointed out the rock chimney of ellens tower to young ian and taking a coil of rope from his saddle picked his way over the broken rock of the headland to the entrance keep your shirt on til youre down he told the lad shouting to be heard above the wave else the rock will tear your back to shreds ian nodded understanding then the rope tied securely round his middle gave me a nervous grin took two jerky steps and disappeared into the earth jamie had the other end of the rope wrapped round his own waist paying out the length of it carefully with his sound hand as the boy descended crawling on hands and knees i made my way over the short turf and pebbles to the crumbling edge of the cliff where i could look over to the halfmoon beach below it seemed a very long time but finally i saw ian emerge from the bottom of the chimney a small antlike figure he untied his rope peered around spotted us at the top of the cliff and waved enthusiastically i waved back but jamie merely muttered all right get on then under his breath i could feel him tense beside me as the boy stripped off to his breeks and scrambled down the rocks to the water and i felt his flinch as the small figure dived headlong into the grayblue waves brrr i said watching the water must be freezing it is jamie said with feeling ians right its a vicious time of year to be swimming his face was pale and set i didnt think it was the result of discomfort from his wounded arm though the long ride and the exercise with the rope couldnt have done it any good while he had shown nothing but encouraging confidence while ian was making his descent he wasnt making any effort to hide his worry now the fact was that there was no way for us to reach ian should anything go wrong maybe we should have waited for the mist to lift i said more to distract him than because i thought so if we had til next easter we might he agreed ironically though ill grant ye ive seen it clearer than this he added squinting into the swirling murk below the three islands were only intermittently visible from the cliff as the fog swept across them i had been able to see the bobbing dot of ians head for the first twenty yards as he left the shore but now he had disappeared into the mist do you think hes all right jamie bent to help me scramble upright the cloth of his coat was damp and rough under my fingers soaked with mist and the fine droplets of ocean spray aye hell do hes a bonny swimmer and its none so difficult a swim either once hes into the current still he stared into the mist as though sheer effort could pierce its veils on jamies advice young ian had timed his descent to begin when the tide began to go out so as to have as much assistance as possible from the tiderace looking over the edge i could see a floating mass of bladder wrack halfstranded on the widening strip of beach perhaps two hours before he comes back jamie answered my unspoken question he turned reluctantly from his vain perusal of the misthidden cove damn i wish id gone myself arm or no arm both young jamie and michael have done it i reminded him he gave me a rueful smile oh aye ian will do fine its only that its a good deal easier to do something thats a bit dangerous than it is to wait and worry while someone else does it ha i told him so now you know whats it like being married to you he laughed oh aye i suppose so besides it would be a shame to cheat young ian of his adventure come on then lets get out of the wind we moved inland a bit away from the crumbling edge of the cliff and sat down to wait using the horses bodies as shelter rough shaggy highland ponies they appeared unmoved by the unpleasant weather merely standing together heads down tails turned against the wind the wind was too high for easy conversation we sat quietly leaning together like the horses with our backs to the windy shore whats that jamie raised his head listening what i thought i heard shouting i expect its the seals i said but before the words were out of my mouth he was up and striding toward the cliffs edge the cove was still full of curling mist but the wind had uncovered the seals island and it was clearly visible at least for the moment there were no seals on it now though a small boat was drawn up on a sloping rock shelf at one side of the island not a fishermans boat this one was longer and more pointed at the prow with one set of oars as i stared a man appeared from the center of the island he carried something under one arm the size and shape of the box jamie had described i didnt have long to speculate as to the nature of this object though for just then a second man came up the far slope of the island and into sight this one was carrying young ian he had the boys halfnaked body slung carelessly over one shoulder it swung head down arms dangling with a limpness that made it clear the boy was unconscious or dead ian jamies hand clamped over my mouth before i could shout again hush he dragged me to my knees to keep me out of sight we watched helpless as the second man heaved ian carelessly into the boat then took hold of the gunwales to run it back into the water there wasnt a chance of making the descent down the chimney and the swim to the island before they succeeded in making their escape but escape to where where did they come from i gasped nothing else stirred in the cove below save the mist and the shifting kelpbeds turning in the tide a ship its a ships boat jamie added something low and heartfelt in gaelic and then was gone i turned to see him fling himself on one of the horses and wrench its head around then he was off riding hellforleather across the headland away from the cove rough as the footing across the headland was the horses were shod for it better than i was i hastily mounted and followed jamie a highpitched whinny of protest from ians hobbled mount ringing in my ears it was less than a quarter of a mile to the ocean side of the headland but it seemed to take forever to reach it i saw jamie ahead of me his hair flying loose in the wind and beyond him the ship lying to offshore the ground broke away in a tumble of rock that fell down to the ocean not so steep as the cliffs of the cove but much too rough to take a horse down by the time i had reined up jamie was off his horse and picking his way down the rubble toward the water to the left i could see the longboat from the island pulling round the curve of the headland someone on the ship must have been looking out for them for i heard a faint hail from the direction of the ship and saw small figures suddenly appear in the rigging one of these must also have seen us for there was a sudden agitation aboard with heads popping up above the rail and more yelling the ship was blue with a broad black band painted all around it there was a line of gunports set in this band and as i watched the forward one opened and the round black eye of the gun peeked out jamie i shrieked as loudly as i could he looked up from the rocks at his feet saw where i was pointing and hurled himself flat in the rubble as the gun went off the report wasnt terribly loud but there was a sort of whistling noise past my head that made me duck instinctively several of the rocks around me exploded in puffs of flying rock chips and it occurred to me rather belatedly that the horses and i were a great deal more visible there at the top of the headland than jamie was on the cliff below the horses having grasped this essential fact long before i did were on their way back to where we had left their hobbled fellow well before the dust had settled i flung myself bodily over the edge of the headland slid several feet in a shower of gravel and wedged myself into a deep crevice in the cliff there was another explosion somewhere above my head and i pressed myself even closer into the rock evidently the people on board the ship were satisfied with the effect of their last shot for relative silence now descended my heart was hammering against my ribs and the air around my face was full of a fine gray dust that gave me an irresistible urge to cough i risked a look over my shoulder and was in time to see the longboat being hoisted aboard ship of ian and his two captors there was no sign the gunport closed silently as i watched and the rope that held the anchor slithered up streaming water the ship turned slowly seeking wind the air was light and the sails barely puffed but even that was enough slowly then faster she was moving toward the open sea by the time jamie had reached my roosting place the ship had all but vanished in the thick cloudbank that obscured the horizon jesus was all he said when he reached me but he clutched me hard for a moment jesus he let go then and turned to look out over the sea nothing moved save a few tendrils of slowfloating mist the whole world seemed stricken with silence even the occasional cries of the murres and shearwaters had been cut off by the cannons boom the gray rock near my foot showed a fresh patch of lighter gray where shot had struck off a wide flake of stone it was no more than three feet above the crevice where i had taken refuge what shall we do i felt numbed both by the shock of the afternoon and by the sheer enormity of what had happened impossible to believe that in less than an hour ian had disappeared from us as completely as though he had been wiped off the face of the earth the fogbank loomed thick and impenetrable a little way off the coast before us a barrier as impassible as the curtain between earth and the underworld my mind kept replaying images the mist drifting over the outlines of the silkies island the sudden appearance of the boat the men coming over the rocks ians lanky teenaged body whiteskinned as the mist skinny limbs dangling like a disjointed dolls i had seen everything with that clarity that attends tragedy every detail fixed in my minds eye to be shown again and again always with that halfconscious feeling that this time i should be able to alter it jamies face was set in rigid lines the furrows cut deep from nose to mouth i dont know he said damn me to hell i dont know what to do his hands flexed suddenly into fists at his sides he shut his eyes breathing heavily i felt even more frightened at this admission in the brief time i had been back with him i had grown once more accustomed to having jamie always know what to do even in the direst circumstances this confession seemed more upsetting than anything that had yet happened a sense of helplessness swirled round me like the mist every nerve cried out to do something but what i saw the streak of blood on his cuff then he had gashed his hand climbing down the rocks that i could help and i felt a sense of thankfulness that there was after all one thing i could do however small youve cut yourself i said i touched his injured hand let me see ill wrap it for you no he said he turned away face strained still looking desperately out into the fog when i reached for him again he jerked away no i said leave it be i swallowed hard and wrapped my arms about myself under my cloak there was little wind now even on the headland but it was cold and clammy nonetheless he rubbed his hand carelessly against the front of his coat leaving a rusty smear he was still staring out to sea toward the spot where the ship had vanished he closed his eyes and pressed his lips tight together then he opened them made a small gesture of apology toward me and turned toward the headland i suppose we must catch the horses he said quietly come on we walked back across the thick short turf and strewn rocks without speaking silent with shock and grief i could see the horses small sticklegged figures in the distance clustered together with their hobbled companion it seemed to have taken hours to run from the headland to the outer shore going back seemed much longer i dont think he was dead i said after what seemed like a year i laid a hand tentatively on jamies arm meaning to be comforting but he wouldnt have noticed if i had struck him with a blackjack he walked on slowly head down no he said and i saw him swallow hard no he wasnt dead or theyd not have taken him did they take him aboard the ship i pressed did you see them i thought it might be better for him if he would talk he nodded aye they passed him aboard i saw it clear i suppose thats some hope he muttered as though to himself if they didna knock him on the head at once maybe they wont suddenly remembering that i was there he turned and looked at me eyes searching my face youre all right sassenach i was scraped raw in several places covered with filth and shakykneed with fright but basically sound im fine i put my hand on his arm again this time he let it stay thats good he said softly after a moment he tucked my hand into the crook of his elbow and we went on have you any idea who they were i had to raise my voice slightly to be heard above the wash of the surf behind us but i wanted to keep him talking if i could he shook his head frowning the effort of talking seemed to be bringing him slowly out of his own shock i heard one of the sailors shout to the men in the boat and he spoke in french but that proves nothingsailors come from everywhere still i have seen enough of ships at the docks to think that this one didna have quite the look of a merchantnor the look of an english ship at all he added though i couldna say why exactly the way the sails were rigged maybe it was blue with a black line painted round it i said that was all i had time to see before the guns started firing was it possible to trace a ship the germ of the idea gave me hope perhaps the situation was not so hopeless as i had first thought if ian was not dead and we could find out where the ship was going did you see a name on it i asked a name he looked faintly surprised at the notion what on the ship do ships not usually have their names painted on the sides i asked no what for he sounded honestly puzzled so you could bloody tell who they are i said exasperated taken by surprise by my tone he actually smiled a little aye well i should expect that perhaps they dinna much want anyone telling who they are given their business he said dryly we paced on together for a few moments thinking then i said curiously well but how do legitimate ships tell who each other is if they havent got names painted on he glanced at me one eyebrow raised i should know you from another woman he pointed out and ye havena got your name stitched upon your bosom not so much as a letter a i said flippantly but seeing his blank look added you mean ships look different enoughand there are few enough of themthat you can tell one from another just by looking not me he said honestly i know a few ships where i ken the captain and have been aboard to do business or a few like the packet boats that go back and forth so often that ive seen them in port dozens of times but a sailing man would ken a great deal more then it might be possible to find out what the ship that took ian is called he nodded looking at me curiously aye i think so i have been trying to call to mind everything about it as we walked so as to tell jared hell know a great many ships and a great many more captainsand perhaps one of them will know a blue ship wide in the beam with three masts twelve guns and a scowling figurehead my heart bounded upward so you do have a plan i wouldna call it so much a plan he said its only i canna think of anything else to do he shrugged and wiped a hand over his face tiny droplets of moisture were condensing on us as we walked glistening in the ruddy hairs of his eyebrows and coating his cheeks with a wetness like tears he sighed the passage is arranged from inverness the best i can see to do is to go jared will be expecting us in le havre when we see him perhaps he can help us to find out what the blue ship is called and maybe where its bound aye he said dryly anticipating my question ships have home ports and if they dinna belong to the navy they have runs they commonly make and papers for the harbormaster too showing where theyre bound i began to feel better than i had since ian had descended ellens tower if theyre not pirates or privateers that is he added with a warning look which put an immediate damper on my rising spirits and if they are then god knows but i dont he said briefly and would not say any more until we reached the horses they were grazing on the headland near the tower where we had left ians mount behaving as though nothing had happened pretending to find the tough sea grass delicious tcha jamie viewed them disapprovingly silly beasts he grabbed the coil of rope and wrapped it twice round a projecting stone handing me the end with a terse instruction to hold it he dropped the free end down the chimney shed his coat and shoes and disappeared down the rope himself without further remark sometime later he came back up sweating profusely with a small bundle tucked under his arm young ians shirt coat shoes and stockings with his knife and the small leather pouch in which the lad kept such valuables as he had do you mean to take them home to jenny i asked i tried to imagine what jenny might think say or do at the news and succeeded all too well i felt a little sick knowing that the hollow aching sense of loss i felt was as nothing to what hers would be jamies face was flushed from the climb but at my words the blood drained from his cheeks his hands tightened on the bundle oh aye he said very softly with great bitterness aye i shall go home and tell my sister that i have lost her youngest son she didna want him to come wi me but i insisted ill take care of him i said and now he is hurt and maybe deadbut here are his clothes to remember him by his jaw clenched and he swallowed convulsively id rather be dead myself he said he knelt on the ground then shaking out the articles of clothing folding them carefully and laying them together in a pile he folded the coat carefully around the other things stood up and stuffed the bundle into his saddlebag ian will be needing them i expect when we find him i said trying to sound convinced jamie looked at me but after a moment he nodded aye he said softly i expect he will it was too late in the day to begin the ride to inverness the sun was setting announcing the fact with a dull reddish glow that barely penetrated the gathering mist without speaking we began to make camp there was cold food in the saddlebags but neither of us had the heart to eat instead we rolled ourselves up in cloaks and blankets and lay down to sleep cradled in small hollows that jamie had scooped in the earth i couldnt sleep the ground was hard and stony beneath my hips and shoulders and the thunder of the surf below would have been sufficient to keep me awake even had my mind not been filled with thoughts of ian was he badly hurt the limpness of his body had bespoken some damage but i had seen no blood presumably he had merely been hit on the head if so what would he feel when he woke to find himself abducted and being carried farther from home and family with each passing minute and how were we ever to find him when jamie had first mentioned jared i had felt hopeful but the more i thought of it the slimmer seemed the prospects of actually finding a single ship which might now be sailing in any direction at all to anyplace in the world and would his captors bother to keep ian or would they on second thoughts conclude that he was a dangerous nuisance and pitch him overboard i didnt think i slept but i must have dozed my dreams full of trouble i woke shivering with cold and edged out a hand reaching for jamie he wasnt there when i sat up i found that he had spread his blanket over me while i dozed but it was a poor substitute for the heat of his body he was sitting some distance away with his back to me the offshore wind had risen with the setting of the sun and blown some of the mist away a halfmoon shed enough light through the clouds to show me his hunched figure clearly i got up and walked over to him folding my cloak tight about me against the chill my steps made a light crunching sound on the crumbled granite but the sound was drowned in the sighing rumble of the sea below still he must have heard me he didnt turn around but gave no sign of surprise when i sank down beside him he sat with his chin in his hands his elbows on his knees eyes wide and sightless as he gazed out into the dark water of the cove if the seals were awake they were quiet tonight are you all right i said quietly its beastly cold he was wearing nothing but his coat and in the small chilled hours of the night in the wet cold air above the sea that was far from enough i could feel the tiny constant shiver that ran through him when i set my hand on his arm aye im fine he said with a marked lack of conviction i merely snorted at this piece of prevarication and sat down next to him on another chunk of granite it wasnt your fault i said after we had sat in silence for some time listening to the sea ye should go and sleep sassenach his voice was even but with an undertone of hopelessness that made me move closer to him trying to embrace him he was clearly reluctant to touch me but i was shivering very obviously myself by this time im not going anywhere he sighed deeply and pulled me closer settling me upon his knee so that his arms came inside my cloak holding tight little by little the shivering eased what are you doing out here i asked at last praying he said softly or trying to i shouldnt have interrupted you i made as though to move away but his hold on me tightened no stay he said we stayed clasped close i could feel the warmth of his breathing in my ear he drew in his breath as though about to speak but then let it out without saying anything i turned and touched his face what is it jamie is it wrong for me to have ye he whispered his face was bonewhite his eyes no more than dark pits in the dim light i keep thinkingis it my fault have i sinned so greatly wanting you so much needing ye more than life itself do you i took his face between my hands feeling the wide bones cold under my palms and if you dohow can that be wrong im your wife in spite of everything the simple word wife made my heart lighten he turned his face slightly so his lips lay against my palm and his hand came up groping for mine his fingers were cold too and hard as driftwood soaked in seawater i tell myself so god has given ye to me how can i not love you and yeti keep thinking and canna stop he looked down at me then brow furrowed with trouble the treasureit was all right to use it when there was need to feed the hungry or to rescue folk from prison but to try to buy my freedom from guiltto use it only so that i might live free at lallybroch with you and not trouble myself over laoghairei think maybe that was wrong to do i drew his hand down around my waist and pulled him close he came eager for comfort and laid his head on my shoulder hush i said to him though he hadnt spoken again be still jamie have you ever done something for yourself alonenot with any thought of anyone else his hand rested gently on my back tracing the seam of my bodice and his breathing held the hint of a smile oh many and many a time he whispered when i saw you when i took ye not caring did ye want me or no did ye have somewhere else to be someone else to love bloody man i whispered in his ear rocking him as best i could youre an awful fool jamie fraser and what about brianna that wasnt wrong was it no he swallowed i could hear the sound of it clearly and feel the pulse beat in his neck where i held him but now i have taken ye back from her as well i love youand i love ian like he was my own and i am thinking maybe i cannot have ye both jamie fraser i said again with as much conviction as i could put into my voice youre a terrible fool i smoothed the hair back from his forehead and twisted my fist in the thick tail at his nape pulling his head back to make him look at me i thought my face must look to him as his did to me the bleached bones of a skull with the lips and eyes dark as blood you didnt force me to come to you or snatch me away from brianna i came because i wanted tobecause i wanted you as much as you did meand my being here has nothing to do with whats happened were married blast you by any standard you care to namebefore god man neptune or whathaveyou neptune he said sounding a little stunned be quiet i said were married i say and it isnt wicked for you to want me or to have me and no god worth his salt would take your nephew away from you because you wanted to be happy so there besides i added pulling back and looking up at him a moment later im not bloody going back so what could you do about it anyway the small vibration in his chest this time was laughter not cold take ye and be damned for it i expect he said he kissed my forehead gently loving you has put me through hell more than once sassenach ill risk it again if need be bah i said and you think loving yous been a bed of roses do you this time he laughed out loud no he said but youll maybe keep doing it maybe i will at that youre a verra stubborn woman he said the smile clear in his voice it bloody takes one to know one i said and then we were both quiet for quite some time it was very lateperhaps four oclock in the morning the halfmoon was low in the sky seen only now and then through the moving clouds the clouds themselves were moving faster the wind was shifting and the mist breaking up in the turning hour between dark and dawn somewhere below one of the seals barked loudly once do ye think perhaps ye could stand to go now jamie said suddenly not wait for the daylight once off the headland the goings none so bad that the horses canna manage in the dark my whole body ached from weariness and i was starving but i stood up at once and brushed the hair out of my face lets go i said part eight on the water i shall go down to the sea it will have to be the artemis jared flipped shut the cover of his portable writing desk and rubbed his brow frowning jamies cousin had been in his fifties when i knew him before and was now well past seventy but the snubnosed hatchet face the spare narrow frame and the tireless capacity for work were just the same only his hair marked his age gone from lank darkness to a scanty pure and gleaming white jauntily tied with a red silk ribbon shes no more than a midsized sloop with a crew of forty or so he remarked but its late in the season and well not likely do betterall of the indiamen will have gone a month since artemis would have gone with the convoy to jamaica was she not laid up for repair id sooner have a ship of yoursand one of your captains jamie assured him the size doesna matter jared cocked a skeptical eyebrow at his cousin oh well and ye may find it matter more than ye think out at sea its like to be squally this late in the season and a sloop will be bobbin like a cork might i ask how ye weathered the channel crossing in the packet boat cousin jamies face already drawn and grim grew somewhat grimmer at this question the completest of landlubbers he was not just prone to seasickness but prostrated by it he had been violently ill all the way from inverness to le havre though sea and weather had been quite calm now some six hours later safe ashore in jareds warehouse by the quay there was still a pale tinge to his lips and dark circles beneath his eyes ill manage he said shortly jared eyed him dubiously well aware of his response to seagoing craft of any kind jamie could scarcely set foot on a ship at anchor without going green the prospect of his crossing the atlantic sealed inescapably in a small and constantly tossing ship for two or three months was enough to boggle the stoutest mind it had been troubling mine for some time well i suppose theres no help for it jared said with a sigh echoing my thought and at least youll have a physician to hand he added with a smile at me that is i suppose you intend accompanying him my dear yes indeed i assured him how long will it be before the ship is ready id like to find a good apothecarys to stock my medicine chest before the voyage jared pursed his lips in concentration a week god willing he said artemis is in bilbao at the moment shes to carry a cargo of tanned spanish hides with a load of copper from italyshell ship that here once she arrives which should be day after tomorrow with a fair wind ive no captain signed on for the voyage yet but a good man in mind i may have to go to paris to fetch him though and that will be two days there and two back add a day to complete stores fill the water casks add all the bits and pieces and she should be ready to leave at dawn tomorrow week how long to the west indies jamie asked the tension in him showed in the lines of his body little affected either by our journey or by the brief rest he was strung taut as a bow and likely to remain so until we had found young ian two months in the season jared replied the small frown still lining his forehead but youre a month past the season now hit the winter gales and it could be three or more or never but jared exseaman that he was was too superstitiousor too tactfulto voice this possibility still i saw him touch the wood of his desk surreptitiously for luck neither would he voice the other thought that occupied my mind we had no positive proof that the blue ship was headed for the west indies we had only the records jared had obtained for us from the le havre harbormaster showing two visits by the shipaptly named brujawithin the last five years each time giving her home port as bridgetown on the island of barbados tell me about her againthe ship that took young ian jared said how did she ride high in the water or sunk low as if she were loaded heavy for a voyage jamie closed his eyes for a moment concentrating then opened them with a nod heavyladen i could swear it her gunports were no more than six feet from the water jared nodded satisfied then she was leaving port not coming in ive messengers out to all the major ports in france portugal and spain with luck theyll find the port she shipped from and then well know her destination for sure from her papers his thin lips quirked suddenly downward unless shes turned pirate and sailing under false papers that is the old wine merchant carefully set aside the lap desk its carved mahogany richly darkened by years of use and rose to his feet moving stiffly well thats the most that can be done for the moment lets go to the house now mathilde will have supper waiting tomorrow ill take ye over the manifests and orders and your wife can find her bits of herbs it was nearly five oclock and full dark at this time of year but jared had two linksmen waiting to escort us the short distance to his house equipped with torches to light the way and armed with stout clubs le havre was a thriving port city and the quay district was no place to walk alone after dark particularly if one was known as a prosperous wine merchant despite the exhaustion of the channel crossing the oppressive clamminess and pervasive fishsmell of le havre and a gnawing hunger i felt my spirits rise as we followed the torches through the dark narrow streets thanks to jared we had at least a chance of finding young ian jared had concurred with jamies opinion that if the pirates of the brujafor so i thought of themhad not killed young ian on the spot they were likely to keep him unharmed a healthy young male of any race could be sold as a slave or indentured servant in the west indies for upward of two hundred pounds a respectable sum by current standards if they did intend so to dispose of young ian profitably and if we knew the port to which they were sailing it should be a reasonably easy matter to find and recover the boy a gust of wind and a few chilly drops from the hovering clouds dampened my optimism slightly reminding me that while it might be no great matter to find ian once we had reached the west indies both the bruja and the artemis had to reach the islands first and the winter storms were beginning the rain increased through the night drumming insistently on the slate roof above our heads i would normally have found the sound soothing and soporific under the circumstances the low thrum seemed threatening not peaceful despite jareds substantial dinner and the excellent wines that accompanied it i found myself unable to sleep my mind summoning images of rainsoaked canvas and the swell of heavy seas at least my morbid imaginings were keeping only myself awake jamie had not come up with me but had stayed to talk with jared about the arrangements for the upcoming voyage jared was willing to risk a ship and a captain to help in the search in return jamie would sail as supercargo as what i had said hearing this proposal the supercargo jared had explained patiently thats the man whose duty it is to oversee the loading the unloading and the sale and disposition of the cargo the captain and the crew merely sail the ship someones got to look after the contents in a case where the welfare of the cargo will be affected the supercargos orders may override even the captains authority and so it was arranged while jared was more than willing to go to some risk in order to help a kinsman he saw no reason not to profit from the arrangement he had therefore made quick provision for a miscellaneous cargo to be loaded from bilbao and le havre we would sail to jamaica to upload the bulk of it and would arrange for the reloading of the artemis with rum produced by the sugarcane plantation of fraser et cie on jamaica for the return trip the return trip however would not occur until good sailing weather returned in late april or early may for the time between arrival on jamaica in february and return to scotland in may jamie would have disposal of the artemis and her crew to travel to barbadosor other placesin search of young ian three months i hoped it would be enough it was a generous arrangement still jared who had been an expatriate wineseller for many years in france was wealthy enough that the loss of a ship while distressing would not cripple him the fact did not escape me that while jared was risking a small portion of his fortune we were risking our lives the wind seemed to be dying it no longer howled down the chimney with quite such force sleep proving still elusive i got out of bed and with a quilt wrapped round my shoulders for warmth went to the window the sky was a deep mottled gray the scudding rain clouds edged with brilliant light from the moon that hid behind them and the glass was streaked with rain still enough light seeped through the clouds for me to make out the masts of the ships moored at the quay less than a quarter of a mile away they swayed to and fro their sails furled tight against the storm rising and falling in uneasy rhythm as the waves rocked the boats at anchor in a weeks time i would be on one i had not dared to think what life might be like once i had found jamie lest i not find him after all then i had found him and in quick succession had contemplated life as a printers wife among the political and literary worlds of edinburgh a dangerous and fugitive existence as a smugglers lady and finally the busy settled life of a highland farm which i had known before and loved now in equally quick succession all these possibilities had been jerked away and i faced an unknown future once more oddly enough i was not so much distressed by this as excited by it i had been settled for twenty years rooted as a barnacle by my attachments to brianna to frank to my patients now fateand my own actionshad ripped me loose from all those things and i felt as though i were tumbling free in the surf at the mercy of forces a great deal stronger than myself my breath had misted the glass i traced a small heart in the cloudiness as i had used to do for brianna on cold mornings then i would put her initials inside the heartber for brianna ellen randall would she still call herself randall i wondered or fraser now i hesitated then drew two letters inside the outline of the hearta j and a c i was still standing before the window when the door opened and jamie came in are ye awake still he asked rather unnecessarily the rain kept me from sleeping i went and embraced him glad of his warm solidness to dispel the cold gloom of the night he hugged me resting his cheek against my hair he smelt faintly of seasickness much more strongly of candlewax and ink have you been writing i asked he looked down at me in astonishment i have but how did ye know that you smell of ink he smiled slightly stepping back and running his hand through his hair youve a nose as keen as a truffle pigs sassenach why thank you what a graceful compliment i said what were you writing the smile disappeared from his face leaving him looking strained and tired a letter to jenny he said he went to the table where he shed his coat and began to unfasten his stock and jabot i didna want to write her until wed seen jared and i could tell her what plans we had and what the prospects were for bringing ian home safe he grimaced and pulled the shirt over his head god knows what shell do when she gets itand thank god ill be at sea when she does he added wryly emerging from the folds of linen it couldnt have been an easy piece of composition but i thought he seemed easier for the writing of it he sat down to take off his shoes and stockings and i came behind him to undo the clubbed queue of his hair im glad the writings over at least he said echoing my thought id been dreading telling her more than anything else you told her the truth he shrugged i always have except about me i didnt voice the thought though but began to rub his shoulders kneading the knotted muscles what did jared do with mr willoughby i asked massage bringing the chinese to mind he had accompanied us on the channel crossing sticking to jamie like a small bluesilk shadow jared used to seeing everything on the docks had taken mr willoughby in stride bowing gravely to him and addressing him with a few words of mandarin but his housekeeper had viewed this unusual guest with considerably more suspicion i believe hes gone to sleep in the stable jamie yawned and stretched himself luxuriously mathilde said she wasna accustomed to have heathens in the house and didna mean to start now she was sprinkling the kitchen wi holy water after he ate supper there glancing up he caught sight of the heart i had traced on the windowpane black against the misted glass and smiled whats that just silliness i said he reached up and took my right hand the ball of his thumb caressing the small scar at the base of my own thumb the letter j he had made with the point of his knife just before i left him before culloden i didna ask he said whether ye wished to come with me i could leave ye here jared would have ye stay wi him and welcome here or in paris or ye could go back to lallybroch if ye wished no you didnt ask i said because you knew bloody well what the answer would be we looked at each other and smiled the lines of heartsickness and weariness had lifted from his face the candlelight glowed softly on the burnished crown of his head as he bent and gently kissed the palm of my hand the wind still whistled in the chimney and the rain ran down the glass like tears outside but it no longer mattered now i could sleep the sky had cleared by morning a brisk cold breeze rattled the windowpanes of jareds study but couldnt penetrate to the cozy room inside the house at le havre was much smaller than his lavish paris residence but still boasted three stories of solid halftimbered comfort i pushed my feet farther toward the crackling fire and dipped my quill into the inkwell i was making up a list of all the things i thought might be needed in the medical way for a twomonth voyage distilled alcohol was both the most important and the easiest to obtain jared had promised to get me a cask in paris wed best label it something else though hed told me or the sailors will have drunk it before youve left port purified lard i wrote slowly stjohnswort garlic ten pounds yarrow i wrote borage then shook my head and crossed it out replacing it with the older name by which it was more likely known now bugloss it was slow work at one time i had known the medicinal uses of all the common herbs and not a few uncommon ones i had had to they were all that was available at that many of them were surprisingly effective despite the skepticismand outspoken horrorof my supervisors and colleagues at the hospital in boston i had used them occasionally on my modern patients to good effect did you see what dr randall did a shocked interns cry echoed in memory making me smile as i wrote she fed the stomach in b boiled flowers the fact remained that one wouldnt use yarrow and comfrey on a wound if iodine were available nor treat a systemic infection with bladderwort in preference to penicillin i had forgotten a lot but as i wrote the names of the herbs the look and the smell of each one began to come back to methe dark bituminous look and pleasant light smell of birch oil the sharp tang of the mint family the dusty sweet smell of chamomile and the astringency of bistort across the table jamie was struggling with his own lists a poor penman he wrote laboriously with his crippled right hand pausing now and then to rub the healing wound above his left elbow and mutter curses under his breath have ye lime juice on your list sassenach he inquired looking up no ought i to have he brushed a strand of hair out of his face and frowned at the sheet of paper in front of him it depends customarily it would be the ships surgeon who provides the lime juice but in a ship the size of the artemis there generally isnt a surgeon and the provision of foodstuffs falls to the purser but there isnt a purser either theres no time to find a dependable man so i shall fill that office too well if youll be purser and supercargo i expect ill be the closest thing to a ships surgeon i said smiling slightly ill get the lime juice all right we returned to a companionable scratching unbroken until the entrance of josephine the parlormaid to announce the arrival of a person her long nose wrinkled in unconscious disapproval at the information he waits upon the doorstep the butler tried to send him away but he insists that he has an appointment with you monsieur james the questioning tone of this last implied that nothing could seem more unlikely but duty compelled her to relay the improbable suggestion jamies eyebrows rose a person what sort of person josephines lips primmed together as though she really could not bring herself to say i was becoming curious to see this person and ventured over to the window sticking my head far out i could see the top of a very dusty black slouch hat on the doorstep and not much more he looks like a peddler hes got a bundle of some kind on his back i reported craning out still farther hands on the sill jamie clutched me by the waist and drew me back thrusting his own head out in turn och its the coin dealer jared mentioned he exclaimed bring him up then with an eloquent expression on her narrow face josephine departed returning in short order with a tall gangling youth of perhaps twenty dressed in a badly outmoded style of coat wide unbuckled breeches that flapped limply about his skinny shanks drooping stockings and the cheapest of wooden sabots the filthy black hat courteously removed indoors revealed a thin face with an intelligent expression adorned with a vigorous if scanty brown beard since virtually no one in le havre other than a few seamen wore a beard it hardly needed the small shiny black skullcap on the newcomers head to tell me he was a jew the boy bowed awkwardly to me then to jamie struggling with the straps of his peddlers pack madame he said with a bob that made his curly sidelocks dance monsieur it is most good of you to receive me he spoke french oddly with a singsong intonation that made him hard to follow while i entirely understood josephines reservations about thisperson still he had wide guileless blue eyes that made me smile at him despite his generally unprepossessing appearance its we who should be grateful to you jamie was saying i had not expected you to come so promptly my cousin tells me your name is mayer the coin dealer nodded a shy smile breaking out amid the sprigs of his youthful beard yes mayer it is no trouble i was in the city already yet you come from frankfort no a long way jamie said politely he smiled as he looked over mayers costume which looked as though he had retrieved it from a rubbish tipand a dusty one too i expect he added will you take wine mayer looked flustered at this offer but after opening and closing his mouth a few times finally settled on a silent nod of acceptance his shyness vanished though once the pack was opened though from the outside the shapeless bundle looked as though it might contain at best a change of ragged linen and mayers midday meal once opened it revealed several small wooden racks cleverly fitted into a framework inside the pack each rack packed carefully with tiny leather bags cuddling together like eggs in a nest mayer removed a folded square of fabric from beneath the racks whipped it open and spread it with something of a flourish on jamies desk then one by one mayer opened the bags and drew out the contents placing each gleaming round reverently on the deep blue velvet of the cloth an aquilia severa aureus he said touching one small coin that glowed with the deep mellowness of ancient gold from the velvet and here a sestercius of the calpurnia family his voice was soft and his hands sure stroking the edge of a silver coin only slightly worn or cradling one in his palm to demonstrate the weight of it he looked up from the coins eyes bright with the reflections of the precious metal monsieur fraser tells me that you desire to inspect as many of the greek and roman rarities as possible i have not my whole stock with me of course but i have quite a fewand i could send to frankfort for others if you desire jamie smiled shaking his head im afraid we havent time mr mayer we just mayer monsieur fraser the young man interrupted perfectly polite but with a slight edge in his voice indeed jamie bowed slightly i hope my cousin shall not have misled you i shall be most happy to pay the cost of your journey and something for your time but i am not wishful to purchase any of your stock myselfmayer the young mans eyebrows rose in inquiry along with one shoulder what i wish jamie said slowly leaning forward to look closely at the coins on display is to compare your stock with my recollection of several ancient coins i have seen and thenshould i see any that are similarto inquire whether youor your family i should say for i expect you are too young yourselfshould be familiar with anyone who might have purchased such coins twenty years ago he glanced up at the young jew who was looking justifiably astonished and smiled that may be asking a bit much of you i know but my cousin tells me that your family is one of the few who deals in such matters and is by far the most knowledgeable if you can acquaint me likewise with any persons in the west indies with interests in this area i should be deeply obliged to you mayer sat looking at him for a moment then inclined his head the sunlight winking from the border of small jet beads that adorned his skullcap it was plain that he was intensely curious but he merely touched his pack and said my father or my uncle would have sold such coins not me but i have here the catalogue and record of every coin that has passed through our hands in thirty years i will tell you what i can he drew the velvet cloth toward jamie and sat back do you see anything here like the coins you remember jamie studied the rows of coins with close attention then gently nudged a silver piece about the size of an american quarter three leaping porpoises circled its edge surrounding a charioteer in the center this one he said there were several like itsmall differences but several with these porpoises he looked again picked out a worn gold disc with an indistinct profile then a silver one somewhat larger and in better condition with a mans head shown both fullface and in profile these he said fourteen of the gold ones and ten of the ones with two heads ten mayers bright eyes popped wide with astonishment i should not have thought there were so many in europe jamie nodded im quite certaini saw them closely handled them even these are the twin heads of alexander mayer said touching the coin with reverence very rare indeed it is a tetradrachm struck to commemorate the battle fought at amphipolos and the founding of a city on the site of the battlefield jamie listened with attention a slight smile on his lips while he had no great interest in ancient money himself he did have a great appreciation for a man with a passion a quarter of an hour more another consultation of the catalogue and the business was complete four greek drachmas of a type jamie recognized had been added to the collection several small gold and silver coins and a thing called a quintinarius a roman coin in heavy gold mayer bent and reached into his pack once more this time pulling out a sheaf of foolscap pages furled into a roll and tied with ribbon untied they showed row upon row of what looked from a distance like bird tracks on closer inspection they proved to be hebraic writing inked small and precise he thumbed slowly through the pages stopping here and there with a murmured um then passing on at last he laid the pages on his shabby knee and looked up at jamie head cocked to one side our transactions are naturally carried out in confidence monsieur he said and so while i could tell you for example that certainly we had sold such and such a coin in such and such a year i should not be able to tell you the name of the purchaser he paused evidently thinking then went on we did in fact sell coins of your descriptionthree drachmas two each of the heads of egalabalus and the double head of alexander and no fewer than six of the gold calpurnian aurei in the year he hesitated normally that is all i could tell you howeverin this case monsieur i happen to know that the original buyer of these coins is deadhas been dead for some years in fact really i cannot see that under the circumstances he shrugged making up his mind the purchaser was an englishman monsieur his name was clarence marylebone duke of sandringham sandringham i exclaimed startled into speech mayer looked curiously at me then at jamie whose face betrayed nothing beyond polite interest yes madame he said i know that the duke is dead for he possessed an extensive collection of ancient coins which my uncle bought from his heirs in the transaction is listed here he raised the catalogue slightly and let it fall i knew the duke of sandringham was dead too and by more immediate experience jamies godfather murtagh had killed him on a dark night in march soon before the battle of culloden brought an end to the jacobite rebellion i swallowed briefly recalling my last sight of the dukes face its blueberry eyes fixed in an expression of intense surprise mayers eyes went back and forth between us then he added hesitantly i can tell you also this when my uncle purchased the dukes collection after his death there were no tetradrachms in it no jamie murmured to himself there wouldnt have been then recollecting himself he stood and reached for the decanter that stood on the sideboard i thank you mayer he said formally and now let us drink to you and your wee book there a few minutes later mayer was kneeling on the floor doing up the fastenings of his ragged pack the small pouch filled with silver livres that jamie had given him in payment was in his pocket he rose and bowed in turn to jamie and to me before straightening and putting on his disreputable hat i bid you goodbye madame he said goodbye to you too mayer i replied then i asked somewhat hesitantly is mayer really your only name something flickered in the wide blue eyes but he answered politely heaving the heavy sack onto his back yes madame the jews of frankfort are not allowed to use family names he looked up and smiled lopsidedly for the sake of convenience the neighbors call us after an old red shield that was painted on the front of our house many years ago but beyond thatno madame we have no name josephine came then to conduct our visitor to the kitchen taking care to walk several paces in front of him her nostrils pinched white as though smelling something foul mayer stumbled after her his clumsy sabots clattering on the polished floor jamie relaxed in his chair eyes abstracted in deep thought i heard the door close downstairs a few minutes later with what was almost a slam and the click of sabots on the stone steps below jamie heard it too and turned toward the window well godspeed to ye mayer redshield he said smiling jamie i said suddenly thinking of something do you speak german eh oh aye he said vaguely his attention still fixed on the window and the noises outside what is red shield in german i asked he looked blank for a moment then his eyes cleared as his brain made the proper connection rothschild sassenach he said why just a thought i said i looked toward the window where the clatter of wooden shoes was long since lost in the noises of the street i suppose everyone has to start somewhere fifteen men on a dead mans chest i observed yohoho and a bottle of rum jamie gave me a look oh aye he said the duke being the dead man i explained do you think the seals treasure was really his i couldna say for sure but it seems at least likely jamies two stiff fingers tapped briefly on the table in a meditative rhythm when jared mentioned mayer the coin dealer to me i thought it worth inquiringfor surely the most likely person to have sent the bruja to retrieve the treasure was the person who put it there good reasoning i said but evidently it wasnt the same person if it was the duke who put it there do you think the whole treasure amounted to fifty thousand pounds jamie squinted at his reflection in the rounded side of the decanter considering then he picked it up and refilled his glass to assist thought not as metal no but did ye notice the prices that some of those coins in mayers catalogue have sold for i did as much as a thousand poundsterlingfor a moldy bit of metal he said marveling i dont think metal molds i said but i take your point anyway i said dismissing the question with a wave of my hand the point here is this do you suppose the seals treasure could have been the fifty thousand pounds that the duke had promised to the stuarts in the early days of when charles stuart had been in france trying to persuade his royal cousin louis to grant him some sort of support he had received a ciphered offer from the duke of sandringham of fifty thousand poundsenough to hire a small armyon condition that he enter england to retake the throne of his ancestors whether it had been this offer that finally convinced the vacillating prince charles to undertake his doomed excursion we would never know it might as easily have been a challenge from someone he was drinking with or a slightreal or imaginedby his mistress that had sent him to scotland with nothing more than six companions two thousand dutch broadswords and several casks of brandywine with which to charm the highland chieftains in any case the fifty thousand pounds had never been received because the duke had died before charles reached england another of the speculations that troubled me on sleepless nights was the question of whether that money would have made a difference if charles stuart had received it would he have taken his ragged highland army all the way to london retaken the throne and regained his fathers crown if he hadwell if he had the jacobite rebellion might have succeeded culloden might not have happened i should never have gone back through the circle of stoneand i and brianna would likely both have died in childbed and been dust these many years past surely twenty years should have been enough to teach me the futility of if jamie had been considering meditatively rubbing the bridge of his nose it might have been he said at last given a proper market for the coins and gemsye ken such things take time to sell if ye must dispose of them quickly youll get but a fraction of the price but given long enough to search out good buyersaye it might reach fifty thousand duncan kerr was a jacobite wasnt he jamie frowned nodding he was aye it could bethough god knows its an awkward kind of fortune to be handing to the commander of an army to pay his troops yes but its also small portable and easy to hide i pointed out and if you were the duke and busy committing treason by dealing with the stuarts that might be important to you sending fifty thousand pounds in sterling with strongboxes and carriages and guards would attract the hell of a lot more attention than sending one man secretly across the channel with a small wooden box jamie nodded again likewise if ye had a collection of such rarities already it would attract no attention to be acquiring more and no one would likely notice what coins ye had it would be a simple matter to take out the most valuable replace them with cheap ones and no one the wiser no banker who might talk were ye to shift money or land he shook his head admiringly its a clever scheme aye whoever made it he looked up inquiringly at me but then why did duncan kerr come nearly ten years after culloden and what happened to him did he come to leave the fortune on the silkies isle then or to take it away and who sent the bruja now i finished for him i shook my head too damned if i know perhaps the duke had a confederate of some sort but if he did we dont know who it was jamie sighed and impatient with sitting for so long stood up and stretched he glanced out the window estimating the height of the sun his usual method of telling time whether a clock was handy or not aye well well have time for speculation once were at sea its near on noon now and the paris coach leaves at three oclock the apothecarys shop in the rue de varennes was gone in its place were a thriving tavern a pawnbrokers and a small goldsmiths shop crammed companionably cheek by jowl master raymond the pawnbroker knitted grizzled brows i have heard of him madamehe darted a wary glance at me suggesting that whatever he had heard had not been very admirablebut he has been gone for several years if you are requiring a good apothecary though krasner in the place daloes or perhaps madame verrue near the tuileries he stared with interest at mr willoughby who accompanied me then leaned over the counter to address me confidentially might you be interested in selling your chinaman madame i have a client with a marked taste for the orient i could get you a very good pricewith no more than the usual commission i assure you mr willoughby who did not speak french was peering with marked contempt at a porcelain jar painted with pheasants done in an oriental style thank you i said but i think not ill try krasner mr willoughby had attracted relatively little attention in le havre a port city teeming with foreigners of every description on the streets of paris wearing a padded jacket over his bluesilk pajamas and with his queue wrapped several times around his head for convenience he caused considerable comment he did however prove surprisingly knowledgeable about herbs and medicinal substances bai jei ai he told me picking up a pinch of mustard seed from an open box in krasners emporium good for shenyenkidneys yes it is i said surprised how did you know he allowed his head to roll slightly from side to side as i had learned was his habit when pleased at being able to astonish someone i know healers one time was all he said though before turning to point at a basket containing what looked like balls of dried mud shanyü he said authoritatively goodvery goodcleanse blood liver he work good no dry skin help see you buy i stepped closer to examine the objects in question and found them to be a particularly homely sort of dried eel rolled into balls and liberally coated with mud the price was quite reasonable though so to please him i added two of the nasty things to the basket over my arm the weather was mild for early december and we walked back toward jareds house in the rue tremoulins the streets were bright with winter sunshine and lively with vendors beggars prostitutes shopgirls and the other denizens of the poorer part of paris all taking advantage of the temporary thaw at the corner of the rue du nord and the allée des canards though i saw something quite out of the ordinary a tall slopeshouldered figure in black frock coat and a round black hat reverend campbell i exclaimed he whirled about at being so addressed then recognizing me bowed and removed his hat mistress malcolm he said how most agreeable to see you again his eye fell on mr willoughby and he blinked features hardening in a stare of disapproval erthis is mr willoughby i introduced him hes anassociate of my husbands mr willoughby the reverend archibald campbell indeed the reverend campbell normally looked quite austere but contrived now to look as though he had breakfasted on barbed wire and found it untasty i thought that you were sailing from edinburgh to the west indies i said in hopes of taking his gelid eye off the chinaman it worked his gaze shifted to me and thawed slightly i thank you for your kind inquiries madame he said i still harbor such intentions however i had urgent business to transact first in france i shall be departing from edinburgh on thursday week and how is your sister i asked he glanced at mr willoughby with dislike then taking a step to one side so as to be out of the chinamans direct sight lowered his voice she is somewhat improved i thank you the draughts you prescribed have been most helpful she is much calmer and sleeps quite regularly now i must thank you again for your kind attentions thats quite all right i said i hope the voyage will agree with her we parted with the usual expressions of good will and mr willoughby and i walked down the rue du nord back toward jareds house reverend meaning most holy fella not true mr willoughby said after a short silence he had the usual oriental difficulty in pronouncing the letter r which made the word reverend more than slightly picturesque but i gathered his meaning well enough true i said glancing down at him curiously he pursed his lips and pushed them in and out then grunted in a distinctly amused manner not so holy that reverend fella he said what makes you say so he gave me a brighteyed glance full of shrewdness i see him one time madame jeannes not loud talking then very quiet then reverend fella oh really i turned to look back but the reverends tall figure had disappeared into the crowd stinking whores mr willoughby amplified making an extremely rude gesture in the vicinity of his crotch in illustration yes i gathered i said well i suppose the flesh is weak now and then even for scottish free church ministers at dinner that night i mentioned seeing the reverend though without adding mr willoughbys remarks about the reverends extracurricular activities i ought to have asked him where in the west indies he was going i said not that hes a particularly scintillating companion but it might be useful to know someone there jared who was consuming veal patties in a businesslike way paused to swallow then said dinna trouble yourself about that my dear ive made up a list for you of useful acquaintances ive written letters for ye to carry to several friends there who will certainly lend ye assistance he cut another sizable chunk of veal wiped it through a puddle of wine sauce and chewed it while looking thoughtfully at jamie having evidently come to a decision of some kind he swallowed took a sip of wine and said in a conversational voice we met on the level cousin i stared at him in bewilderment but jamie after a moments pause replied and we parted on the square jareds narrow face broke into a wide smile ah thats a help he said i wasna just sure aye but i thought it worth the trial where were ye made in prison jamie replied briefly it will be the inverness lodge though jared nodded in satisfaction aye well enough there are lodges on jamaica and barbadosill have letters for ye to the masters there but the largest lodge is on trinidadbetter than two thousand members there if ye should need great help in finding the lad thats where ye must ask word of everything that happens in the islands comes through that lodge sooner or later would you care to tell me what youre talking about i interrupted jamie glanced at me and smiled freemasons sassenach youre a mason i blurted you didnt tell me that hes not meant to jared said a bit sharply the rites of freemasonry are secret known only to the members i wouldna have been able to give jamie an introduction to the trinidad lodge had he not been one of us already the conversation became general again as jamie and jared fell to discussing the provisioning of the artemis but i was quiet concentrating on my own veal the incident small as it was had reminded me of all the things i didnt know about jamie at one time i should have said i knew him as well as one person can know another now there would be moments talking intimately together falling asleep in the curve of his shoulder holding him close in the act of love when i felt i knew him still his mind and heart as clear to me as the lead crystal of the wineglasses on jareds table and others like now when i would stumble suddenly over some unsuspected bit of his past or see him standing still eyes shrouded with recollections i didnt share i felt suddenly unsure and alone hesitating on the brink of the gap between us jamies foot pressed against mine under the table and he looked across at me with a smile hidden in his eyes he raised his glass a little in a silent toast and i smiled back feeling obscurely comforted the gesture brought back a sudden memory of our wedding night when we had sat beside each other sipping wine strangers frightened of each other with nothing between us but a marriage contractand the promise of honesty there are things ye maybe canna tell me he had said i willna ask ye or force ye but when ye do tell me something let it be the truth there is nothing between us now but respect and respect has room for secrets i thinkbut not for lies i drank deeply from my own glass feeling the strong bouquet of the wine billow up inside my head and a warm flush heat my cheeks jamies eyes were still fixed on me ignoring jareds soliloquy about ships biscuit and candles his foot nudged mine in silent inquiry and i pressed back in answer aye ill see to it in the morning he said in reply to a question from jared but for now cousin i think i shall retire its been a long day he pushed back his chair stood up and held out his arm to me will ye join me claire i stood up the wine rushing through my limbs making me feel warm all over and slightly giddy our eyes met with a perfect understanding there was more than respect between us now and room for all our secrets to be known in good time in the morning jamie and mr willoughby went with jared to complete their errands i had another errand of my ownone that i preferred to do alone twenty years ago there had been two people in paris whom i cared for deeply master raymond was gone dead or disappeared the chances that the other might still be living were slim but still i had to see before i left europe for what might be the last time with my heart beating erratically i stepped into jareds coach and told the coachman to drive to the hôpital des anges the grave was set in the small cemetery reserved for the convent under the buttresses of the nearby cathedral even though the air from the seine was damp and cold and the day cloudy the walled cemetery held a soft light reflected from the blocks of pale limestone that sheltered the small plot from wind in the winter there were no shrubs or flowers growing but leafless aspens and larches spread a delicate tracery against the sky and a deep green moss cradled the stones thriving despite the cold it was a small stone made of a soft white marble a pair of cherubs wings spread out across the top sheltering the single word that was the stones only other decoration faith it read i stood looking down at it until my vision blurred i had brought a flower a pink tulipnot the easiest thing to find in paris in december but jared kept a conservatory i knelt down and laid it on the stone stroking the soft curve of the petal with a finger as though it were a babys cheek i thought i wouldnt cry i said a little later i felt the weight of mother hildegardes hand on my head le bon dieu orders things as he thinks best she said softly but he seldom tells us why i took a deep breath and wiped my cheeks with a corner of my cloak it was a long time ago though i rose slowly to my feet and turned to find mother hildegarde watching me with an expression of deep sympathy and interest i have noticed she said slowly that time does not really exist for mothers with regard to their children it does not matter greatly how old the child isin the blink of an eye the mother can see the child again as it was when it was born when it learned to walk as it was at any ageat any time even when the child is fully grown and a parent itself especially when theyre asleep i said looking down again at the little white stone you can always see the baby then ah mother nodded satisfied i thought you had had more children you have the look somehow one more i glanced at her and how do you know so much about mothers and children the small black eyes shone shrewdly under heavy brow ridges whose sparse hairs had gone quite white the old require very little sleep she said with a deprecatory shrug i walk the wards at night sometimes the patients talk to me she had shrunk somewhat with advancing age and the wide shoulders were slightly bowed thin as a wire hanger beneath the black serge of her habit even so she was still taller than i and towered over most of the nuns more scarecrowlike but imposing as ever she carried a walking stick but strode erect firm of tread and with the same piercing eye using the stick more frequently to prod idlers or direct underlings than to lean on i blew my nose and we turned back along the path to the convent as we walked slowly back i noticed other small stones set here and there among the larger ones are those all children i asked a little surprised the children of the nuns she said matteroffactly i gaped at her in astonishment and she shrugged elegant and wry as always it happens she said she walked a few steps farther then added not often of course she gestured with her stick around the confines of the cemetery this place is reserved for the sisters a few benefactors of the hôpitaland those they love the sisters or the benefactors the sisters here you lump mother hildegarde paused in her progress spotting an orderly leaning idly against the church wall smoking a pipe as she berated him in the elegantly vicious court french of her girlhood i stood back looking around the tiny cemetery against the far wall but still in consecrated ground was a row of small stone tablets each with a single name bouton below each name was a roman numeral i through xv mother hildegardes beloved dogs i glanced at her current companion the sixteenth holder of that name this one was coalblack and curly as a persian lamb he sat bolt upright at her feet round eyes fixed on the delinquent orderly a silent echo of mother hildegardes outspoken disapproval the sisters and those they love mother hildegarde came back her fierce expression altering at once to the smile that transformed her strong gargoyle features into beauty i am so pleased that you have come again ma chère she said come inside i shall find things that may be useful to you on your journey tucking the stick in the crook of her arm she instead took my forearm for support grasping it with a warm bony hand whose skin had grown paperthin i had the odd feeling that it was not i who supported her but the other way around as we turned into the small yew alley that led to the entrance to the hôpital i glanced up at her i hope you wont think me rude mother i said hesitantly but there is one question i wanted to ask you eightythree she replied promptly she grinned broadly showing her long yellow horses teeth everyone wants to know she said complacently she looked back over her shoulder toward the tiny graveyard and lifted one shoulder in a dismissive gallic shrug not yet she said confidently le bon dieu knows how much work there is still to do we set sail it was a cold gray daythere is no other kind in scotland in decemberwhen the artemis touched at cape wrath on the northwest coast i peered out of the tavern window into a solid gray murk that hid the cliffs along the shore the place was depressingly reminiscent of the landscape near the silkies isle with the smell of dead seaweed strong in the air and the crashing of waves so loud as to inhibit conversation even inside the small pothouse by the wharf young ian had been taken nearly a month before now it was past christmas and here we were still in scotland no more than a few miles from the seals island jamie was striding up and down the dock outside in spite of the cold rain too restless to stay indoors by the fire the sea journey from france back to scotland had been no better for him than the first channel crossing and i knew the prospect of two or three months aboard the artemis filled him with dread at the same time his impatience to be in pursuit of the kidnappers was so acute that any delay filled him with frustration more than once i had awakened in the middle of the night to find him gone walking the streets of le havre alone ironically this final delay was of his own making we had touched at cape wrath to retrieve fergus and with him the small group of smugglers whom jamie had sent him to fetch before leaving ourselves for le havre theres no telling what we shall find in the indies sassenach jamie had explained to me i dinna mean to go up against a shipload of pirates singlehanded nor yet to fight wi men i dinna ken alongside me the smugglers were all men of the shore accustomed to boats and the ocean if not to ships they would be hired on as part of the artemiss crew shorthanded in consequence of the late season in which we sailed cape wrath was a small port with little traffic at this time of year besides the artemis only a few fishing boats and a ketch were tied up at the wooden wharf there was a small pothouse though in which the crew of the artemis cheerfully passed their time while waiting the men who would not fit inside the house crouching under the eaves swilling pots of ale passed through the windows by their comrades indoors jamie walked on the shore coming in only for meals when he would sit before the fire the wisps of steam rising from his soggy garments symptomatic of his increasing aggravation of soul fergus was late no one seemed to mind the wait but jamie and jareds captain captain raines a small plump elderly man spent most of his time on the deck of his ship keeping one weather eye on the overcast sky and the other on his barometer thats verra strongsmelling stuff sassenach jamie observed during one of his brief visits to the taproom what is it fresh ginger i answered holding up the remains of the root i was grating its the thing most of my herbals say is best for nausea oh aye he picked up the bowl sniffed at the contents and sneezed explosively to the vast amusement of the onlookers i snatched back the bowl before he could spill it you dont take it like snuff i said you drink it in tea and i hope to heaven it works because if it doesnt well be scooping you out of the bilges if bilges are what i think they are oh not to worry missus one of the older hands assured me overhearing lots o green hands feel a bit queerlike the first day or two but usually they comes round soon enough by the third day theyve got used to the pitch and roll and theyre up in the rigging happy as larks i glanced at jamie who was markedly unlarklike at the moment still this comment seemed to give him some hope for he brightened a bit and waved to the harassed servingmaid for a glass of ale it may be so he said jared said the same that seasickness doesna generally last more than a few days provided the seas arent too heavy he took a small sip of his ale and then with growing confidence a deeper swallow i can stand three days of it i suppose late in the afternoon of the second day six men appeared winding their way along the stony shore on shaggy highland ponies theres raeburn in the lead jamie said shading his eyes and squinting to distinguish the identities of the six small dots kennedy after him then inneshes missing the left arm seeand meldrum and thatll be macleod with him they always ride together like that is the last man gordon then or fergus it must be gordon i said peering over his shoulder at the approaching men because its much too fat to be fergus where the devil is fergus then jamie asked raeburn once the smugglers had been greeted introduced to their new shipmates and sat down to a hot supper and a cheerful glass raeburn bobbed his head in response hastily swallowing the remains of his pasty weel he said to me as how hed some business to see to and would i see to the hiring of the horses and speak to meldrum and macleod about coming for they were out wi their own boat at the time and not expected back for a day or twa more and what business jamie said sharply but got no more than a shrug in reply jamie muttered something under his breath in gaelic but returned to his own supper without further comment the crew being now completesave ferguspreparations began in the morning for getting under way the deck was a scene of organized confusion with bodies darting to and fro popping up through hatchways and dropping suddenly out of the rigging like dead flies jamie stood near the wheel keeping out of the way but lending a hand whenever a matter requiring muscle rather than skill arose for the most part though he simply stood eyes fixed on the road along the shore we shall have to sail by midafternoon or miss the tide captain raines spoke kindly but firmly well have surly weather in twentyfour hours the glass is falling and i feel it in my neck the captain tenderly massaged the part in question and nodded at the sky which had gone from pewter to leadgray since early morning ill not set sail in a storm if i can help it and if we mean to make the indies as soon as possible aye i understand captain jamie interrupted him of course ye must do as seems best he stood back to let a bustling seaman go past and the captain disappeared issuing orders as he went as the day wore on jamie seemed composed as usual but i noticed that the stiff fingers fluttered against his thigh more and more often the only outward sign of worry and worried he was fergus had been with him since the day twenty years before when jamie had found him in a paris brothel and hired him to steal charles stuarts letters more than that fergus had lived at lallybroch since before young ian was born the boy had been a younger brother to fergus and jamie the closest thing to a father that fergus had ever known i could not imagine any business so urgent that it would have kept him from jamies side neither could jamie and his fingers beat a silent tattoo on the wood of the rail then it was time and jamie turned reluctantly away tearing his eyes from the empty shore the hatches were battened the lines coiled and several seamen leapt ashore to cast free the mooring hawsers there were six of them each a rope as thick around as my wrist i put a hand on jamies arm in silent sympathy youd better come down below i said ive got a spirit lamp ill brew you some hot ginger tea and then you the sound of a galloping horse echoed along the shore the scrunch of hoofbeats on gravel echoing from the cliffside well in advance of its appearance there he is the wee fool jamie said his relief evident in voice and body he turned to captain raines one brow raised in question theres enough of the tide left aye then lets go cast off the captain bellowed and the waiting hands sprang into action the last of the lines tethering us to the piling was slipped free and neatly coiled and all around us lines tightened and sails snapped overhead as the bosun ran up and down the deck bawling orders in a voice like rusty iron she moves she stirs she seems to feel the thrill of life along her keel i declaimed delighted to feel the deck quiver beneath my feet as the ship came alive the energy of all the crew poured into its inanimate hulk transmuted by the power of the windcatching sails oh god said jamie hollowly feeling the same thing he grasped the rail closed his eyes and swallowed mr willoughby says he has a cure for seasickness i said watching him sympathetically ha he said opening his eyes i ken what he means and if he thinks ill let himwhat the bloody hell i whirled to look and saw what had caused him to break off fergus was on deck reaching up to help down a girl perched awkwardly above him on the railing her long blond hair whipping in the wind laoghaires daughtermarsali mackimmie before i could speak jamie was past me and striding toward the pair what in the name of holy god dye mean by this ye wee coofs he was demanding by the time i made my way into earshot through the obstacle course of lines and seamen he loomed menacingly over the pair a foot taller than either of them we are married fergus said bravely moving in front of marsali he looked both scared and excited his face pale beneath the shock of black hair married jamies hands clenched at his sides and fergus took an involuntary step backward nearly treading on marsalis toes what dye mean married i assumed this was a rhetorical question but it wasnt jamies appreciation of the situation had as usual outstripped mine by yards and seized at once upon the salient point have ye bedded her he demanded bluntly standing behind him i couldnt see his face but i knew what it must look like if only because i could see the effect of his expression on fergus the frenchman turned a couple of shades paler and licked his lips erno milord he said just as marsali eyes blazing thrust her chin up and said defiantly yes he has jamie glanced briefly back and forth between the two of them snorted loudly and turned away mr warren he called down the deck to the ships sailing master put back to the shore if ye please mr warren stopped openmouthed in the middle of an order addressed to the rigging and stared first at jamie thenquite elaboratelyat the receding shoreline in the few moments since the appearance of the putative newlyweds the artemis had moved more than a thousand yards from the shore and the rocks of the cliffs were slipping by with increasing speed i dont believe he can i said i think were already in the tiderace no sailor himself jamie had spent sufficient time in the company of seamen at least to understand the notion that time and tide wait for no one he breathed through his teeth for a moment then jerked his head toward the ladder that led belowdecks come down then the both of ye fergus and marsali sat together in the tiny cabin huddled on one berth hands clutched tight jamie waved me to a seat on the other berth then turned to the pair hands on his hips now then he said whats this nonsense of bein married it is true milord fergus said he was quite pale but his dark eyes were bright with excitement his one hand tightened on marsalis his hook resting across his thigh aye jamie said with the maximum of skepticism and who married ye the two glanced at each other and fergus licked his lips briefly before replying wewe are handfast before witnesses marsali put in in contrast to ferguss paleness a high color burned in her cheeks she had her mothers roseleaf skin but the stubborn set of her jaw had likely come from somewhere else she put a hand to her bosom where something crackled under the fabric i ha the contract and the signatures here jamie made a low growling noise in his throat by the laws of scotland two people could in fact be legally married by clasping hands before witnesseshandfastingand declaring themselves to be man and wife aye well he said but yere no bedded yet and a contracts not enough in the eyes o the church he glanced out of the stern casement where the cliffs were just visible through the ragged mist then nodded with decision well stop at lewes for the last provisions marsali will go ashore there ill send two seamen to see her home to her mother yell do no such thing marsali cried she sat up straight glaring at her stepfather im going wi fergus oh no youre not my lassie jamie snapped dye have no feeling for your mother to run off wi no word and leave her to be worrit i left word marsalis square chin was high i sent a letter from inverness saying id married fergus and was off to sail wi you sweet bleeding jesus shell think i kent all about it jamie looked horrorstricken weidid ask the lady laoghaire for the honor of her daughters hand milord fergus put in last month when i came to lallybroch aye well ye needna tell me what she said jamie said dryly seeing the sudden flush on ferguss cheeks since i gather the general answer was no she said he was a bastard marsali burst out indignantly and a criminal andand he is a bastard and a criminal jamie pointed out and a cripple wi no property either as im sure your mother noticed i dinna care marsali gripped ferguss hand and looked at him with fierce affection i want him taken aback jamie rubbed a finger across his lips then he took a deep breath and returned to the attack be that as it may he said yere too young to be married im fifteen thats plenty old enough aye and hes thirty jamie snapped he shook his head nay lassie im sorry about it but i canna let ye do it if it were nothing else the voyage is too dangerous youre taking her marsalis chin jerked contemptuously in my direction youll leave claire out of this jamie said evenly shes none of your concern and oh shes not you leave my mother for this english whore and make her a laughingstock for the whole countryside and its no my concern is it marsali leapt up and stamped her foot on the deck and you ha the hellish nerve to tell me what i shall do i have jamie said keeping hold of his temper with some difficulty my private affairs are not your concern and mine arent any of yours fergus looking alarmed was on his feet trying to calm the girl marsali ma chère you must not speak to milord in such a way he is only ill speak to him any way i want no you will not surprised at the sudden harshness in ferguss tone marsali blinked only an inch or two taller than his new wife the frenchman had a certain wiry authority that made him seem much bigger than he was no he said more softly sit down ma ptite he pressed her back down on the berth and stood before her milord has been to me more than a father he said gently to the girl i owe him my life a thousand times he is also your stepfather however your mother may regard him he has without doubt supported and sheltered her and you and your sister you owe him respect at the least marsali bit her lip her eyes bright finally she ducked her head awkwardly at jamie im sorry she murmured and the air of tension in the cabin lessened slightly its all right lassie jamie said gruffly he looked at her and sighed but still marsali we must send ye back to your mother i wont go the girl was calmer now but the set of her pointed chin was the same she glanced at fergus then at jamie he says we havena bedded together but we have or at any rate i shall say we have if ye send me home ill tell everyone that hes had me so ye seei shall either be married or ruined her tone was reasonable and determined jamie closed his eyes may the lord deliver me from women he said between his teeth he opened his eyes and glared at her all right he said youre married but youll do it right before a priest well find one in the indies when we land and until yeve been blessed fergus doesna touch you aye he turned a ferocious gaze on both of them yes milord said fergus his features suffused with joy merci beaucoup marsali narrowed her eyes at jamie but seeing that he wasnt to be moved she bowed her head demurely with a sidelong glance at me yes daddy she said the question of ferguss elopement had at least distracted jamies mind temporarily from the motion of the ship but the palliative effect didnt last he held on grimly nevertheless turning greener by the moment but refusing to leave the deck and go below so long as the shore of scotland was in sight i may never see it again he said gloomily when i tried to persuade him to go below and lie down he leaned heavily on the rail he had just been vomiting over eyes resting longingly on the unprepossessingly bleak coast behind us no youll see it i said with an unthinking surety youre coming back i dont know when but i know youll come back he turned his head to look up at me puzzled then the ghost of a smile crossed his face youve seen my grave he said softly havent ye i hesitated but he didnt seem upset and i nodded its all right he said he closed his eyes breathing heavily dontdont tell me when though if ye dinna mind i cant i said there werent any dates on it just your nameand mine yours his eyes popped open i nodded again feeling my throat tighten at the memory of that granite slab it had been what they call a marriage stone a quartercircle carved to fit with another in a complete arch i had of course seen only the one half it had all your names on it thats how i knew it was you and underneath it said beloved husband of claire at the time i didnt see howbut now of course i do he nodded slowly absorbing it aye i see aye well i suppose if i shall be in scotland and still married to youthen maybe when doesna matter so much he gave me a shadow of his usual grin and added wryly it also means well find young ian safe for ill tell ye sassenach i willna set foot in scotland again without him well find him i said with an assurance i didnt altogether feel i put a hand on his shoulder and stood beside him watching scotland slowly recede in the distance by the time evening set in the rocks of scotland had disappeared in the sea mists and jamie chilled to the bone and pale as a sheet suffered himself to be led below and put to bed at this point the unforeseen consequences of his ultimatum to fergus became apparent there were only two small private cabins besides the captains if fergus and marsali were forbidden to share one until their union was formally blessed then clearly jamie and fergus would have to take one and marsali and i the other it seemed destined to be a rough voyage in more ways than one i had hoped that the sickness might ease if jamie couldnt see the slow heave and fall of the horizon but no such luck again said fergus sleepily rousing on one elbow in his berth in the middle of the night how can he he has eaten nothing all day tell him that i said trying to breathe through my mouth as i sidled toward the door a basin in my hands making my way with difficulty through the tiny cramped quarters the deck rose and fell beneath my unaccustomed feet making it hard to keep my balance here milady allow me fergus swung bare feet out of bed and stood up beside me staggering and nearly bumping into me as he reached for the basin you should go and sleep now milady he said taking it from my hands i will see to him be assured well the thought of my berth was undeniably tempting it had been a long day go sassenach jamie said his face was a ghastly white sheened with sweat in the dim light of the small oil light that burned on the wall ill be all right this was patently untrue at the same time it was unlikely that my presence would help particularly fergus could do the little that could be done there was no known cure for seasickness after all one could only hope that jared was right and that it would ease of itself as the artemis made its way out into the longer swells of the atlantic all right i said giving in perhaps youll feel better in the morning jamie opened one eye for a moment then groaned and shivering closed it again or perhaps ill be dead he suggested on that cheery note i made my way out into the dark companionway only to stumble over the prostrate form of mr willoughby curled up against the door of the cabin he grunted in surprise then seeing that it was only me rolled slowly onto all fours and crawled into the cabin swaying with the rolling of the ship ignoring ferguss exclamation of distate he curled himself about the pedestal of the table and fell promptly back asleep an expression of beatific content on his small round face my own cabin was just across the companionway but i paused for a moment to breathe in the fresh air coming down from the deck above there was an extraordinary variety of noises from the creak and crack of timbers all around to the snap of sails and the whine of rigging above and the faint echo of a shout somewhere on deck despite the racket and the cold air pouring in down the companionway marsali was sound asleep a humped black shape in one of the two berths just as well at least i neednt try to make awkward conversation with her despite myself i felt a pang of sympathy for her this was likely not what she had expected of her wedding night it was too cold to undress fully clothed i crawled into my small boxberth and lay listening to the sounds of the ship around me i could hear the hissing of the water passing the hull only a foot or two beyond my head it was an oddly comforting sound to the accompaniment of the song of the wind and the faint sound of retching across the corridor i fell peacefully asleep the artemis was a tidy ship as ships go but when you cram thirtytwo menand two womeninto a space eighty feet long and twentyfive wide together with six tons of roughcured hides fortytwo barrels of sulfur and enough sheets of copper and tin to sheathe the queen mary basic hygiene is bound to suffer by the second day i had already flushed a rata small rat as fergus pointed out but still a ratin the hold where i went to retrieve my large medicine box packed away there by mistake during the loading there was a soft shuffling noise in my cabin at night which when the lantern was lit proved to be the footsteps of several dozen middlingsize cockroaches all fleeing frantically for the shelter of the shadows the heads two small quartergalleries on either side of the ship toward the bow were nothing more than a pair of boardswith a strategic slot between themsuspended over the bounding waves eight feet below so that the user was likely to get an unexpected dash of cold seawater at some highly inopportune moment i suspected that this coupled with a diet of salt pork and hardtack likely caused constipation to be epidemic among seamen mr warren the ships master proudly informed me that the decks were swabbed regularly every morning the brass polished and everything generally made shipshape which seemed a desirable state of affairs given that we were in fact aboard a ship still all the holystoning in the world could not disguise the fact that thirtyfour human beings occupied this limited space and only one of us bathed given such circumstances i was more than startled when i opened the door of the galley on the second morning in search of boiling water i had expected the same dim and grubby conditions that obtained in the cabins and holds and was dazzled by the glitter of sunlight through the overhead lattice on a rank of copper pans so scrubbed that the metal of their bottoms shone pink i blinked against the dazzle my eyes adjusting and saw that the walls of the galley were solid with builtin racks and cupboards so constructed as to be proof against the roughest seas blue and green glass bottles of spice each tenderly jacketed in felt against injury vibrated softly in their rack above the pots knives cleavers and skewers gleamed in deadly array in a quantity sufficient to deal with a whale carcass should one present itself a rimmed double shelf hung from the bulkhead thick with bulb glasses and shallow plates on which a quantity of freshcut turnip tops were set to sprout for greens an enormous pot bubbled softly over the stove emitting a fragrant steam and in the midst of all this spotless splendor stood the cook surveying me with baleful eye out he said good morning i said as cordially as possible my name is claire fraser out he repeated in the same graveled tones i am mrs fraser the wife of the supercargo and ships surgeon for this voyage i said giving him eyeball for eyeball i require six gallons of boiling water when convenient for cleaning of the head his small bright blue eyes grew somewhat smaller and brighter the black pupils of them training on me like gunbarrels i am aloysius oshaughnessy murphy he said ships cook and i require ye to take yer feet off my freshwashed deck i do not allow women in my galley he glowered at me under the edge of the black cotton kerchief that swathed his head he was several inches shorter than i but made up for it by measuring about three feet more in circumference with a wrestlers shoulders and a head like a cannonball set upon them without apparent benefit of an intervening neck a wooden leg completed the ensemble i took one step back with dignity and spoke to him from the relative safety of the passageway in that case i said you may send up the hot water by the messboy i may he agreed and then again i may not he turned his broad back on me in dismissal busying himself with a chopping block a cleaver and a joint of mutton i stood in the passageway for a moment thinking the thud of the cleaver sounded regularly against the wood mr murphy reached up to his spice rack grasped a bottle without looking and sprinkled a good quantity of the contents over the diced meat the dusty scent of sage filled the air superseded at once by the pungency of an onion whacked in two with a casual swipe of the cleaver and tossed into the mixture evidently the crew of the artemis did not subsist entirely upon salt pork and hardtack then i began to understand the reasons for captain rainess rather pearshaped physique i poked my head back through the door taking care to stand outside cardamom i said firmly nutmeg whole dried this year fresh extract of anise ginger root two large ones with no blemishes i paused mr murphy had stopped chopping cleaver poised motionless above the block and i added half a dozen whole vanilla beans from ceylon he turned slowly wiping his hands upon his leather apron unlike his surroundings neither the apron nor his other apparel was spotless he had a broad florid face edged with stiff sandy whiskers like a scrubbing brush which quivered slightly as he looked at me like the antennae of some large insect his tongue darted out to lick pursed lips saffron he asked hoarsely half an ounce i said promptly taking care to conceal any trace of triumph in my manner he breathed in deeply lust gleaming bright in his small blue eyes yell find a mat just outside maam should ye care to wipe yer boots and come in one head sterilized within the limits of boiling water and ferguss tolerance i made my way back to my cabin to clean up for luncheon marsali was not there she was undoubtedly attending to fergus whose labors at my insistence had been little short of heroic i rinsed my own hands with alcohol brushed my hair and then went across the passage to see whetherby some wild chancejamie wanted anything to eat or drink one glance disabused me of this notion marsali and i had been given the largest cabin which meant that each of us had approximately six square feet of space not including the beds these were boxberths a sort of enclosed bed built into the wall about five and a half feet long marsali fitted neatly into hers but i was forced to adopt a slightly curled position like a caper on toast which caused me to wake up with pins and needles in my feet jamie and fergus had similar berths jamie was lying on his side wedged into one of these like a snail into its shell one of which beasts he strongly resembled at the moment being a pale and viscid gray in color with streaks of green and yellow that contrasted nastily with his red hair he opened one eye when he heard me come in regarded me dimly for a moment and closed it again not so good hm i said sympathetically the eye opened again and he seemed to be preparing to say something he opened his mouth changed his mind and closed it again no he said and shut the eye once more i tentatively smoothed his hair but he seemed too sunk in misery to notice captain raines says it will likely be calmer by tomorrow i offered the sea wasnt terribly rough as it was but there was a noticeable rise and fall it doesna matter he said not opening his eyes i shall be dead by thenor at least i hope so afraid not i said shaking my head nobody dies of seasickness though i must say it seems a wonder that they dont looking at you not that he opened his eyes and struggled up on one elbow an effort that left him clammy with sweat and white to the lips claire be careful i should have told ye beforebut i didna want to worry ye and i thought his face changed familiar as i was with expressions of bodily infirmity i had the basin there just in time oh god he lay limp and exhausted pale as the sheet what should you have told me i asked wrinkling my nose as i put the basin on the floor near the door whatever it was you should have told me before we sailed but its too late to think of that i didna think it would be so bad he murmured you never do i said rather tartly what did you want to tell me though ask fergus he said say i said he must tell ye and tell him innes is all right what are you talking about i was mildly alarmed delirium wasnt a common effect of seasickness his eyes opened and fixed on mine with great effort beads of sweat stood out on his brow and upper lip innes he said he canna be the one he doesna mean to kill me a small shiver ran up my spine are you quite all right jamie i asked i bent and wiped his face and he gave me the ghost of an exhausted smile he had no fever and his eyes were clear who i said carefully with a sudden feeling that there were eyes fixed on my back who does mean to kill you i dont know a passing spasm contorted his features but he clamped his lips tight and managed to subdue it ask fergus he whispered when he could talk again in private hell tell ye i felt exceedingly helpless i had no notion what he was talking about but if there was any danger i wasnt about to leave him alone ill wait until he comes down i said one hand was curled near his nose it straightened slowly and slid under the pillow coming out with his dirk which he clasped to his chest i shall be all right he said go on then sassenach i shouldna think theyd try anything in daylight if at all i didnt find this reassuring in the slightest but there seemed nothing else to do he lay quite still the dirk held to his chest like a stone tombfigure go he murmured again his lips barely moving just outside the cabin door something stirred in the shadows at the end of the passage peering sharply i made out the crouched silk shape of mr willoughby chin resting on his knees he spread his knees apart and bowed his head politely between them not worry honorable first wife he assured me in a sibilant whisper i watch good i said keep doing it and went in considerable distress of mind to find fergus fergus found with marsali on the after deck peering into the ships wake at several large white birds was somewhat more reassuring we are not sure that anyone intends actually to kill milord he explained the casks in the warehouse might have been an accidenti have seen such things happen more than onceand likewise the fire in the shed but wait one minute young fergus i said gripping him by the sleeve what casks and what fire oh he said looking surprised milord did not tell you milord is sick as a dog and incapable of telling me anything more than that i should ask you fergus shook his head clicking his tongue in a censorious french way he never thinks he will be so ill he said he always is and yet every time he must set foot on a ship he insists that it is only a matter of will his mind will be master and he will not allow his stomach to be dictating his actions then within ten feet of the dock he has turned green he never told me that i said amused at this description stubborn little fool marsali had been hanging back behind fergus with an air of haughty reserve pretending that i wasnt there at this unexpected description of jamie though she was surprised into a brief snort of laughter she caught my eye and turned hastily away cheeks flaming to stare out to sea fergus smiled and shrugged you know what he is like milady he said with tolerant affection he could be dying and one would never know youd know if you went down and looked at him now i said tartly at the same time i was conscious of surprise accompanied by a faint feeling of warmth in the pit of my stomach fergus had been with jamie almost daily for twenty years and still jamie would not admit to him the weakness that he would readily let me see were he dying i would know about it all right men i said shaking my head milady never mind i said you were telling me about casks and fires oh indeed yes fergus brushed back his thick shock of black hair with his hook it was the day before i met you again milady at madame jeannes the day i had returned to edinburgh no more than a few hours before i had found jamie at the printshop he had been at the burntisland docks with fergus and a gang of six men during the night taking advantage of the late dawn of winter to retrieve several casks of unbonded madeira smuggled in among a shipment of innocent flour madeira does not soak through the wood so quickly as some other wines do fergus explained you cannot bring in brandy under the noses of the customs like that for the dogs will smell it at once even if their masters do not but not madeira provided it has been freshly casked dogs some of the customs inspectors have dogs milady trained to smell out such contraband as tobacco and brandy he waved away the interruption squinting his eyes against the brisk sea wind we had removed the madeira safely and brought it to the warehouseone of those belonging apparently to lord dundas but in fact it belongs jointly to milord and madame jeanne indeed i said again with that minor dip of the stomach i had felt when jamie opened the door of the brothel on queen street partners are they well of a sort fergus sounded regretful milord has only a five percent share in return for his finding the place and making the arrangements printing as an occupation is much less profitable than keeping a hôtel de joie marsali didnt look round but i thought her shoulders stiffened further i daresay i said edinburgh and madame jeanne were a long way behind us after all get on with the story someone may cut jamies throat before i find out why of course milady fergus bobbed his head apologetically the contraband had been safely hidden awaiting disguise and sale and the smugglers had paused to refresh themselves with a drink in lieu of breakfast before making their way home in the brightening dawn two of the men had asked for their shares at once needing the money to pay gaming debts and buy food for their families jamie agreeing to this he had gone across to the warehouse office where some gold was kept as the men relaxed over their whisky in a corner of the warehouse their joking and laughter was interrupted by a sudden vibration that shook the floor beneath their feet comedown shouted macleod an experienced warehouseman and the men had dived for cover even before they had seen the great rack of hogsheads near the office quiver and rumble one twoton cask rolling down the stack with ponderous grace to smash in an aromatic lake of ale followed within seconds by a cascade of its monstrous fellows milord was crossing in front of the rank fergus said shaking his head it was only by the grace of the blessed virgin herself that he was not crushed a bounding cask had missed him by inches in fact and he had escaped another only by diving headfirst out of its way and under an empty winerack that had deflected its course as i say such things happen often fergus said shrugging a dozen men are killed each year in such accidents in the warehouses near edinburgh alone but with the other things the week before the incident of the casks a small shed full of packing straw had burst into flames while jamie was working in it a lantern placed between him and the door had apparently fallen over setting the straw alight and trapping jamie in the windowless shed behind a sudden wall of flame the shed was fortunately of a most flimsy construction and the boards halfrotted it went up like matchwood but milord was able to kick a hole in the back wall and crawl out with no injury we thought at first that the lantern had merely fallen of its own accord and were most grateful for his escape it was only later that milord told me he thought that he had heard a noiseperhaps a shot perhaps only the cracking noises an old warehouse makes as its boards settleand when he turned to see found the flames shooting up before him fergus sighed he looked rather tired and i wondered whether perhaps he had stayed awake to stand watch over jamie during the night so he said shrugging once more we do not know such incidents may have been no more than accidentthey may not but taking such occurrences together with what happened at arbroath you may have a traitor among the smugglers i said just so milady fergus scratched his head but what is more disturbing to milord is the man whom the chinaman shot at madame jeannes because you think he was a customs agent whod tracked jamie from the docks to the brothel jamie said he couldnt be because he had no warrant not proof fergus noted but worse the booklet he had in his pocket the new testament i saw no particular relevance to that and said so oh but there is miladyor might be i should say fergus corrected himself you see the booklet was one that milord himself had printed i see i said slowly or at least im beginning to fergus nodded gravely to have the customs trace brandy from the points of delivery to the brothel would be bad of course but not fatalanother hiding place could be found in fact milord has arrangements with the owners of two taverns thatbut that is of no matter he waved it away but to have the agents of the crown connect the notorious smuggler jamie roy with the respectable mr malcolm of carfax close he spread his hands wide you see i did were the customs to get too close to his smuggling operations jamie could merely disperse his assistants cease frequenting his smugglers haunts and disappear for a time retreating into his guise as a printer until it seemed safe to resume his illegal activities but to have his two identities both detected and merged was not only to deprive him of both his sources of income but to arouse such suspicion as might lead to discovery of his real name his seditious activities and thence to lallybroch and his history as rebel and convicted traitor they would have evidence to hang him a dozen timesand once was enough i certainly do see so jamie wasnt only worried about laoghaire and hobart mackenzie when he told ian he thought it would be as well for us to skip to france for a bit paradoxically i felt somewhat relieved by ferguss revelations at least i hadnt been singlehandedly responsible for jamies exile my reappearance might have precipitated the crisis with laoghaire but i had had nothing to do with any of this exactly milady and still we do not know for certain that one of the men has betrayed usor whether even if there should be a traitor among them he should wish to kill milord thats a point it was but not a large one if one of the smugglers had undertaken to betray jamie for money that was one thing if it was for some motive of personal vengeance though the man might well feel compelled to take matters into his own hands now that we weretemporarily at leastout of reach of the kings customs if so fergus was continuing it will be one of six menthe six milord sent me to collect to sail with us these six were present both when the casks fell and when the shed caught fire all have been to the brothel he paused and all of them were present on the road at arbroath when we were ambushed and found the exciseman hanged do they all know about the printshop oh no milady milord has always been most careful to let none of the smuggling men know of thatbut it is always possible that one of them shall have seen him on the streets in edinburgh followed him to carfax close and so learned of a malcolm he smiled wryly milord is not the most inconspicuous of men milady very true i said matching his tone but now all of them know jamies real namecaptain raines calls him fraser yes he said with a faint grim smile that is why we must discover whether we do indeed sail with a traitorand who it is looking at him it occurred to me for the first time that fergus was indeed a grown man nowand a dangerous one i had known him as an eager squirreltoothed boy of ten and to me something of that boy would always remain in his face but some time had passed since he had been a paris street urchin marsali had remained staring out to sea during most of this discussion preferring to take no risk of having to converse with me she had obviously been listening though and now i saw a shiver pass through her thin shoulderswhether of cold or apprehension i couldnt tell she likely hadnt planned on shipping with a potential murderer when she had agreed to elope with fergus youd better take marsali below i said to fergus shes going blue round the edges dont worry i said to marsali in a cool voice i shant be in the cabin for some time where are you going milady fergus was squinting at me slightly suspicious milord will not wish you to be i dont mean to i assured him im going to the galley the galley his fine black brows shot up to see whether aloysius oshaughnessy murphy has anything to suggest for seasickness i said if we dont get jamie back on his feet he isnt going to care whether anyone cuts his throat or not murphy sweetened by an ounce of dried orange peel and a bottle of jareds best claret was quite willing to oblige in fact he seemed to consider the problem of keeping food in jamies stomach something of a professional challenge and spent hours in mystic contemplation of his spice rack and pantriesall to no avail we encountered no storms but the winter winds drove a heavy swell before them and the artemis rose and fell ten feet at a time laboring up and down the great glassy peaks of the waves there were times watching the hypnotic rise and lurch of the taffrail against the horizon when i felt a few interior qualms of my own and turned hastily away jamie showed no signs of being about to fulfill jareds heartening prophecy and spring to his feet suddenly accustomed to the motion he remained in his berth the color of rancid custard moving only to stagger to the head and guarded in turns day and night by mr willoughby and fergus on the positive side of things none of the six smugglers made any move that might be considered threatening all expressed a sympathetic concern for jamies welfare andcarefully watchedall had visited him briefly in his cabin with no suspicious circumstances attending for my part i spent the days in exploring the ship attending to such small medical emergencies as arose from the daily business of sailinga smashed finger a cracked rib bleeding gums and an abscessed toothand pounding herbs and making medicines in a corner of the galley allowed to work there by murphys grace marsali was absent from our shared cabin when i rose already asleep when i returned to it and silently hostile when the cramped confines of shipboard forced us to meet on deck or over meals i assumed that the hostility was in part the result of her natural feelings for her mother and in part the result of frustration over passing her night hours in my company rather than ferguss for that matter if she remained untouchedand judging from her sullen demeanor i was reasonably sure she didit was owing entirely to ferguss respect for jamies dictates in terms of his role as guardian of his stepdaughters virtue jamie himself was a negligible force at the moment wot not the broth too murphy said the cooks broad red face lowered menacingly which ive had folk rise from their deathbeds after a sup of that broth he took the pannikin of broth from fergus sniffed at it critically and thrust it under my nose here smell that missus marrow bones garlic caraway seed and a lump o pork fat to flavor all strained careful through muslin same as some folks bein poorly to their stomachs cant abide chunks but chunks youll not find there not a one the broth was in fact a clear golden brown with an appetizing smell that made my own mouth water despite the excellent breakfast i had made less than an hour before captain raines had a delicate stomach and in consequence had taken some pains both in the procurement of a cook and the provisioning of the galley to the benefit of the officers table murphy with a wooden leg and the general dimensions of a rum cask looked the picture of a thoroughgoing pirate but in fact had a reputation as the best seacook in le havreas he had told me himself without the least boastfulness he considered cases of seasickness a challenge to his skill and jamie still prostrate after four days was a particular affront to him im sure its wonderful broth i assured him its just that he cant keep anything down murphy grunted dubiously but turned and carefully poured the remains of the broth into one of the numerous kettles that steamed day and night over the galley fire scowling horribly and running one hand through the wisps of his scanty blond hair he opened a cupboard and closed it then bent to rummage through a chest of provisions muttering under his breath a bit o hardtack maybe he muttered dry thats whats wanted maybe a whiff o vinegar though tart pickle say i watched in fascination as the cooks huge sausagefingered hands flicked deftly through the stock of provisions plucking dainties and assembling them swiftly on a tray ere lets try this then he said handing me the finished tray let im suck on the pickled gherkins but dont let im bite em yet then follow on with a bite of the plain hardtackthere aint no weevils in it yet i dont thinkbut see as he dont drink water with it then a bite of gherkin wellchewed to make the spittle flow a bite of hardtack and so to go on with that much stayin down then we can proceed to the custard which its freshmade last evening for the captains supper then if that sticks his voice followed me out of the galley continuing the catalogue of available nourishment milk toast which its made with goats milk and freshmilked too syllabub beat up well with whisky and a nice egg boomed down the passageway as i negotiated the narrow turn with the loaded tray carefully stepping over mr willoughby who was as usual crouched in a corner of the passage by jamies door like a small blue lapdog one step inside the cabin though i could see that the exercise of murphys culinary skill was going to be once again in vain in the usual fashion of a man feeling unwell jamie had managed to arrange his surroundings to be as depressing and uncomfortable as possible the tiny cabin was dank and squalid the cramped berth covered with a cloth so as to exclude both light and air and halfpiled with a tangle of clammy blankets and unwashed clothes rise and shine i said cheerfully i set down the tray and pulled off the makeshift curtain which appeared to be one of ferguss shirts what light there was came from a large prism embedded in the deck overhead it struck the berth illuminating a countenance of ghastly pallor and baleful mien he opened one eye an eighth of an inch go away he said and shut it again ive brought you some breakfast i said firmly the eye opened again coldly blue and gelid dinna mention the word breakfast to me he said call it luncheon then i said its late enough i pulled up a stool next to him picked a gherkin from the tray and held it invitingly under his nose youre supposed to suck on it i told him slowly the other eye opened he said nothing but the pair of blue orbs swiveled around resting on me with an expression of such ferocious eloquence that i hastily withdrew the pickle the eyelids drooped slowly shut once more i surveyed the wreckage frowning he lay on his back his knees drawn up while the builtin berth provided more stability for the sleeper than the crews swinging hammocks it was designed to accommodate the usual run of passengers whojudging from the size of the berthwere assumed to be no more than a modest five feet three or so you cant be at all comfortable in there i said i am not would you like to try a hammock instead at least you could stretch i would not the captain says he requires a list of the cargo from youat your convenience he made a brief and unrepeatable suggestion as to what captain raines might do with his list not bothering to open his eyes i sighed and picked up his unresisting hand it was cold and damp and his pulse was fast well i said after a pause perhaps we could try something i used to do with surgical patients it seemed to help sometimes he gave a low groan but didnt object i pulled up a stool and sat down still holding his hand i had developed the habit of talking with the patients for a few minutes before they were taken to surgery my presence seemed to reassure them and i had found that if i could fix their attention on something beyond the impending ordeal they seemed to do betterthere was less bleeding the postanesthetic nausea was less and they seemed to heal better i had seen it happen often enough to believe that it was not imagination jamie hadnt been altogether wrong when assuring fergus that the power of mind over flesh was possible lets think of something pleasant i said pitching my voice to be as low and soothing as possible think of lallybroch of the hillside above the house think of the pine trees therecan you smell the needles think of the smoke coming up from the kitchen chimney on a clear day and an apple in your hand think about how it feels in your hand all hard and smooth and then sassenach both jamies eyes were open and fixed on me in intense concentration sweat gleamed in the hollow of his temples yes go away what go away he repeated very gently or i shall break your neck go away now i rose with dignity and went out mr willoughby was leaning against an upright in the passage peering thoughtfully into the cabin dont have those stone balls with you do you i asked yes he answered looking surprised wanting healthy balls for tseimi he began to fumble in his sleeve but i stopped him with a gesture what i want to do is bash him on the head with them but i suppose hippocrates would frown on that mr willoughby smiled uncertainly and bobbed his head several times in an effort to express appreciation of whatever i thought i meant never mind i said i glared back over my shoulder at the heap of reeking bedclothes it stirred slightly and a groping hand emerged patting gingerly around the floor until it found the basin that stood there grasping this the hand disappeared into the murky depths of the berth from which presently emerged the sound of dry retching bloody man i said exasperation mingled with pityand a slight feeling of alarm the ten hours of a channel crossing were one thing what would his state be like after two months of this head of pig mr willoughby agreed with a lugubrious nod he is rat you think or maybe dragon he smells like a whole zoo i said why dragon though one is born in year of dragon year of rat year of sheep year of horse mr willoughby explained being different each year different people you are knowing is tseimi rat or dragon you mean which year was he born in i had vague memories of the menus in chinese restaurants decorated with the animals of the chinese zodiac with explanations of the supposed character traits of those born in each year it was but i dont know offhand which animal that was the year of i am thinking rat said mr willoughby looking thoughtfully at the tangle of bedclothes which were heaving in a mildly agitated manner rat very clever very lucky but dragon too could be he is most lusty in bed tseimi dragons most passionate people not so as you would notice lately i said watching the heap of bedclothes out of the corner of my eye it heaved upward and fell back as though the contents had turned over suddenly i have chinese medicine mr willoughby said observing this phenomenon thoughtfully good for vomit stomach head all making most peaceful and serene i looked at him with interest really id like to see that have you tried it on jamie yet the little chinese shook his head regretfully not want he replied say damnall throwing overboard if i am come near mr willoughby and i looked at each other with a perfect understanding you know i said raising my voice a decibel or two prolonged dry retching is very bad for a person oh most bad yes mr willoughby had shaved the forward part of his skull that morning the bald curve shone as he nodded vigorously it erodes the stomach tissues and irritates the esophagus this is so quite so it raises the blood pressure and strains the abdominal muscles too can even tear them and cause a hernia ah and i continued raising my voice just a trifle it can cause the testicles to become tangled round each other inside the scrotum and cuts off the circulation there ooh mr willoughbys eyes went round if that happens i said ominously the only thing to do usually is to amputate before gangrene sets in mr willoughby made a hissing sound indicative of understanding and deep shock the heap of bedclothes which had been tossing to and fro in a restless manner during this conversation was quite still i looked at mr willoughby he shrugged i folded my arms and waited after a minute a long foot elegantly bare was extruded from the bedclothes a moment later its fellow joined it resting on the floor damn the pair of ye said a deep scottish voice in tones of extreme malevolence come in then fergus and marsali were leaning over the aft rail cozily shoulder to shoulder ferguss arm about the girls waist her long fair hair fluttering in the wind hearing approaching footsteps fergus glanced back over his shoulder then he gasped whirled round and crossed himself eyes bulging notoneword if ye please jamie said between clenched teeth fergus opened his mouth but nothing came out marsali turning to look too emitted a shrill scream da whats happened to ye the obvious fright and concern in her face stopped jamie from whatever acerbic remark he had been about to make his face relaxed slightly making the slender gold needles that protruded from behind his ears twitch like ants feelers its all right he said gruffly its only some rubbish of the chinees to cure the puking wideeyed marsali came up to him gingerly extending a finger to touch the needles embedded in the flesh of his wrist below the palm three more flashed from the inside of his leg a few inches above the ankle doesdoes it work she asked how does it feel jamies mouth twitched his normal sense of humor beginning to reassert itself i feel like a bloody illwish doll that someones been poking full o pins he said but then i havena vomited in the last quarterhour so i suppose it must work he shot a quick glare at me and mr willoughby standing side by side near the rail mind ye he said i dinna feel like sucking on gherkins just yet but i could maybe go so far as to relish a glass of ale if ye mind where some might be found fergus oh oh yes milord if you will come with me unable to refrain from staring fergus reached out a tentative hand to take jamies arm but thinking better of it turned in the direction of the after gangway shall i tell murphy to start cooking your luncheon i called after jamie as he turned to follow fergus he gave me a long level look over one shoulder the golden needles sprouted through his hair in twin bunches gleaming in the morning light like a pair of devils horns dinna try me too high sassenach he said im no going to forget ye ken tangled testiclespah mr willoughby had been ignoring this exchange squatting on his heels in the shadow of the aftdeck scuttlebutt a large barrel filled with water for refreshment of the deck watch he was counting on his fingers evidently absorbed in some kind of calculation as jamie stalked away he looked up not rat he said shaking his head not dragon too tseimi born in year of ox really i said looking after the broad shoulders and red head lowered stubbornly against the wind how appropriate the man in the moon as his title suggested jamies job as supercargo was not onerous beyond checking the contents of the hold against the bills of lading to insure that the artemis was in fact carrying the requisite quantities of hides tin and sulfur there was nothing for him to do while at sea his duties would begin once we reached jamaica when the cargo must be unloaded rechecked and sold with the requisite taxes paid commissions deducted and paperwork filed in the meantime there was little for himor meto do while mr picard the bosun eyed jamies powerful frame covetously it was obvious that he would never make a seaman quick and agile as any of the crew his ignorance of ropes and sails made him useless for anything beyond the occasional situation where sheer strength was required it was plain he was a soldier not a sailor he did assist with enthusiasm at the gunnery practice that was held every other day helping to run the four huge guns on their carriages in and out with a tremendous racket and spending hours in rapt discussion of esoteric cannon lore with tom sturgis the gunner during these thunderous exercises marsali mr willoughby and i sat safely out of the way under the care of fergus who was excluded from the fireworks because of his missing hand somewhat to my surprise i had been accepted as the ships surgeon with little question from the crew it was fergus who explained that in small merchant ships even barbersurgeons were uncommon it was commonly the gunners wifeif he had onewho dealt with the small injuries and illnesses of the crew i saw the normal run of crushed fingers burnt hands skin infections abscessed teeth and digestive ills but in a crew of only thirtytwo men there was seldom enough work to keep me busy beyond the hour of sick call each morning in consequence both jamie and i had a great deal of free time and as the artemis drew gradually south into the great gyre of the atlantic we began to spend most of this time with each other for the first time since my return to edinburgh there was time to talk to relearn all the halfforgotten things we knew of each other to find out the new facets that experience had polished and simply to take pleasure in each others presence without the distractions of danger and daily life we strolled the deck constantly up and down marking off miles as we conversed of everything and nothing pointing out to each other the phenomena of a sea voyage the spectacular sunrises and sunsets schools of strange green and silver fish enormous islands of floating seaweed harboring thousands of tiny crabs and jellyfish the sleek dolphins that appeared for several days in a row swimming parallel with the ship leaping out of the water now and then as though to get a look at the curious creatures above the water the moon rose huge and fast and golden a great glowing disc that slid upward out of the water and into the sky like a phoenix rising the water was dark now and the dolphins invisible but i thought somehow that they were still there keeping pace with the ship on her flight through the dark it was a scene breathtaking enough even for the sailors who had seen it a thousand times to stop and sigh with pleasure at the sight as the huge orb rose to hang just over the edge of the world seeming almost near enough to touch jamie and i stood close together by the rail admiring it it seemed so close that we could make out with ease the dark spots and shadows on its surface it seems so close ye could speak to the man in the moon he said smiling and waved a hand in greeting to the dreaming golden face above the weeping pleiads wester and the moon is under seas i quoted and look it is down there too i pointed over the rail to where the trail of moonlight deepened glowing in the water as though a twin of the moon itself were sunken there when i left i said men were getting ready to fly to the moon i wonder whether theyll make it do the flying machines go so high then jamie asked he squinted at the moon i should say its a great way for all it looks so close just now i read a book by an astronomerhe said it was perhaps three hundred leagues from the earth to the moon is he wrong then or is it only that theairplanes was itwill fly so far it takes a special kind called a rocket i said actually its a lot farther than that to the moon and once you get far away from the earth theres no air to breathe in space theyll have to carry air with them on the voyage like food and water they put it in sort of canisters really he gazed up face full of light and wonder what will it look like there i wonder i know that i said ive seen pictures its rocky and barren with no life at allbut very beautiful with cliffs and mountains and cratersyou can see the craters from here the dark spots i nodded toward the smiling moon then smiled at jamie myself its not unlike scotlandexcept that it isnt green he laughed then evidently reminded by the word pictures reached into his coat and drew out the little packet of photographs he was cautious about them never taking them out where they might be seen by anyone even fergus but we were alone back here with little chance of interruption the moon was bright enough to see briannas face glowing and mutable as he thumbed slowly through the pictures the edges were becoming frayed i saw will she walk about on the moon dye think he asked softly pausing at a shot of bree looking out a window secretly dreaming unaware of being photographed he glanced up again at the orb above us and i realized that for him a voyage to the moon seemed very little more difficult or farfetched than the one in which we were engaged the moon after all was only another distant unknown place i dont know i said smiling a bit he thumbed through the pictures slowly absorbed as he always was by the sight of his daughters face so like his own i watched him quietly sharing his silent joy at this promise of our immortality i thought briefly of that stone in scotland engraved with his name and took comfort from its distance whenever our parting might come chances were it would not be soon and even when and where it didbrianna would still be left of us more of housmans lines drifted through my headhalt by the headstone naming the heart no longer stirred and say the lad that loved you was one that kept his word i drew close to him feeling the heat of his body through coat and shirt and rested my head against his arm as he turned slowly through the small stack of photographs she is beautiful he murmured as he did every time he saw the pictures and clever too did ye not say just like her father i told him and felt him chuckle softly i felt him stiffen slightly as he turned one picture over and lifted my head to see which one he was looking at it was one taken at the beach when brianna was about sixteen it showed her standing thighdeep in the surf hair in a sandy tangle kicking water at her friend a boy named rodney who was backing away laughing too hands held up against the spray of water jamie frowned slightly lips pursed that he began do they he paused and cleared his throat i wouldna venture to criticize claire he said very carefully but do ye not think this is a wee bitindecent i suppressed an urge to laugh no i said composedly thats really quite a modest bathing suitfor the time while the suit in question was a bikini it was by no means skimpy rising to at least an inch below brees navel i chose this picture because i thought youd want to ersee as much of her as possible he looked mildly scandalized at this thought but his eyes returned to the picture drawn irresistibly his face softened as he looked at her aye well he said aye shes verra lovely and im glad to know it he lifted the picture studying it carefully no its no the thing shes wearing i meant most women who bathe outside do it naked and their skins are no shame to them its onlythis lad surely she shouldna be standing almost naked before a man he scowled at the hapless rodney and i bit my lip at the thought of the scrawny little boy whom i knew very well as a masculine threat to maidenly purity well i said drawing a deep breath we were on slightly delicate ground here no i mean boys and girls do play togetherlike that you know people dress differently then ive told you no ones really covered up a great deal except when the weathers cold mmphm he said aye yeve told me he managed to convey the distinct impression that on the basis of what id told him he was not impressed with the moral conditions under which his daughter was living he scowled at the picture again and i thought it was fortunate that neither bree nor rodney was present i had seen jamie as lover husband brother uncle laird and warrior but never before in his guise as a ferocious scottish father he was quite formidable for the first time i thought that perhaps it was not altogether a bad thing that he wasnt able to oversee brees life personally he would have frightened the living daylights out of any lad bold enough to try to court her jamie blinked at the picture once or twice then took a deep breath and i could feel him brace himself to ask dye think she isa virgin the halt in his voice was barely perceptible but i caught it of course she is i said firmly i thought it very likely in fact but this wasnt a situation in which to admit the possibility of doubt there were things i could explain to jamie about my own time but the idea of sexual freedom wasnt one of them oh the relief in his voice was inexpressible and i bit my lip to keep from laughing aye well i was sure of it only ithat is he stopped and swallowed brees a very good girl i said i squeezed his arm lightly frank and i may not have got on so well together but we were both good parents to her if i do say so aye i know ye were i didna mean to say otherwise he had the grace to look abashed and tucked the beach picture carefully back into the packet he put the pictures back into his pocket patting them to be sure they were safe he stood looking up at the moon then his brows drew together in a slight frown the sea wind lifted strands of his hair tugging them loose from the ribbon that bound it and he brushed them back absentmindedly clearly there was still something on his mind do ye think he began slowly not looking at me do ye think that it was quite wise to come to me now claire not that i dinna want ye he added hastily feeling me stiffen beside him he caught my hand preventing my turning away no i didna mean that at all christ i do want ye he drew me closer pressing my hand in his against his heart i want ye so badly that sometimes i think my heart will burst wi the joy of having ye he added more softly its onlybriannas alone now frank is gone and you she has no husband to protect her no men of her family to see her safely wed will she not have need of ye awhile yet should ye no have waited a bit i mean i paused before answering trying to get my own feelings under control i dont know i said at last my voice quivered in spite of my struggle to control it lookthings arent the same then i know that you dont i pulled my hand loose and glared at him you dont know jamie and there isnt any way for me to tell you because you wont believe me but brees a grown woman shell marry when and as she likes not when someone arranges it for her she doesnt need to marry for that matter shes having a good education she can earn her own livingwomen do that she wont have to have a man to protect her and if theres no need for a man to protect a woman and care for her then i think it will be a verra poor time he glared back at me i drew a deep breath trying to be calm i didnt say theres no need for it i placed a hand on his shoulder and spoke in a softer tone i said she can choose she neednt take a man out of necessity she can take one for love his face began to relax just slightly you took me from need he said when we wed and i came back for love i said do you think i needed you any less only because i could feed myself the lines of his face eased and the shoulder under my hand relaxed a bit as he searched my face no he said softly i dinna think that he put his arm around me and drew me close i put my arms around his waist and held him feeling the small flat patch of briannas pictures in his pocket under my cheek i did worry about leaving her i whispered a little later she made me go we were afraid that if i waited longer i might not be able to find you but i did worry i know i shouldna ha said anything he brushed my curls away from his chin smoothing them down i left her a letter i said it was all i could think to doknowing i mightmight not see her again i pressed my lips tight together and swallowed hard his fingertips stroked my back very softly aye that was good sassenach what did ye say to her i laughed a little shakily everything i could think of motherly advice and wisdomwhat i had of it all the practical thingswhere the deed to the house and the family papers were and everything i knew or could think of about how to live i expect shell ignore it all and have a wonderful lifebut at least shell know i thought about her it had taken me nearly a week going through the cupboards and desk drawers of the house in boston finding all of the business papers the bankbooks and mortgage papers and the family things there were a good many bits and pieces of franks family lying about huge scrapbooks and dozens of genealogy charts albums of photographs cartons of saved letters my side of the family was a good deal simpler to sum up i lifted down the box i kept on the shelf of my closet it was a small box uncle lambert was a saver as all scholars are but there had been little to save the essential documents of a small familybirth certificates mine and my parents their marriage lines the registration for the car that had killed themwhat ironic whim had prompted uncle lamb to save that more likely he had never opened the box but only kept it in a scholars blind faith that information must never be destroyed for who knew what use it might be and to whom i had seen its contents before of course there had been a period in my teens when i opened it nightly to look at the few photos it contained i remembered the bonedeep longing for the mother i didnt remember and the vain effort to imagine her to bring her back to life from the small dim images in the box the best of them was a closeup photograph of her face turned toward the camera warm eyes and a delicate mouth smiling under the brim of a felt cloche hat the photograph had been handtinted the cheeks and lips were an unnatural rosepink the eyes soft brown uncle lamb said that that was wrong her eyes had been gold he said like mine i thought perhaps that time of deep need had passed for brianna but was not sure i had had a studio portrait made of myself the week before i placed it carefully in the box and closed it and put the box in the center of my desk where she would find it then i sat down to write my dear bree i wrote and stopped i couldnt couldnt possibly be contemplating abandoning my child to see those three black words stark on the page brought the whole mad idea into a cold clarity that struck me to the bone my hand shook and the tip of the pen made small wavering circles in the air above the paper i put it down and clasped my hands between my thighs eyes closed get a grip on yourself beauchamp i muttered write the bloody thing and have done if she doesnt need it it will do no harm and if she does it will be there i picked up the pen and began again i dont know if you will ever read this but perhaps its as well to set it down this is what i know of your grandparents your real ones your greatgrandparents and your medical history i wrote for some time covering page after page my mind grew calmer with the effort of recall and the necessity of setting down the information clearly and then i stopped thinking what could i tell her beyond those few bare bloodless facts how to impart what sparse wisdom i had gained in fortyeight years of a fairly eventful life my mouth twisted wryly in consideration of that did any daughter listen would i had my mother been there to tell me it made no difference though i would just have to set it down to be of use if it could but what was true that would last forever in spite of changing times and ways what would stand her in good stead most of all how could i tell her just how much i loved her the enormity of what i was about to do gaped before me and my fingers clenched tight on the pen i couldnt thinknot and do this i could only set the pen to the paper and hope babyi wrote and stopped then swallowed hard and started again you are my baby and always will be you wont know what that means until you have a child of your own but i tell you now anywayyoull always be as much a part of me as when you shared my body and i felt you move inside always i can look at you asleep and think of all the nights i tucked you in coming in the dark to listen to your breathing lay my hand on you and feel your chest rise and fall knowing that no matter what happens everything is right with the world because you are alive all the names ive called you through the yearsmy chick my pumpkin precious dove darling sweetheart dinky smudgei know why the jews and muslims have nine hundred names for god one small word is not enough for love i blinked hard to clear my vision and went on writing fast i didnt dare take time to choose my words or i would never write them i remember everything about you from the tiny line of golden down that zigged across your forehead when you were hours old to the bumpy toenail on the big toe you broke last year when you had that fight with jeremy and kicked the door of his pickup truck god it breaks my heart to think it will stop nowthat watching you seeing all the tiny changesi wont know when you stop biting your nails if you ever doseeing you grow suddenly taller than i and your face take its shape i always will remember bree i always will theres probably no one else on earth bree who knows what the back of your ears looked like when you were three years old i used to sit beside you reading one fish two fish red fish blue fish or the three billy goats gruff and see those ears turn pink with happiness your skin was so clear and fragile i thought a touch would leave fingerprints on you you look like jamie i told you you have something from me too thoughlook at the picture of my mother in the box and the little blackandwhite one of her mother and grandmother you have that broad clear brow they have so do i ive seen a good many of the frasers tooi think youll age well if you take care of your skin take care of everything breeoh i wishwell i have wished i could take care of you and protect you from everything all your life but i cant whether i stay or go take care of yourself thoughfor me the tears were puckering the paper now i had to stop to blot them lest they smear the ink beyond reading i wiped my face and resumed slower now you should know breei dont regret it in spite of everything i dont regret it youll know something now of how lonely i was for so long without jamie it doesnt matter if the price of that separation was your life neither jamie nor i can regret iti know he wouldnt mind my speaking for him breeyou are my joy youre perfect and wonderfuland i hear you saying now in that tone of exasperation but of course you think thatyoure my mother yes thats how i know bree you are worth everythingand more ive done a great many things in my life so far but the most important of them all was to love your father and you i blew my nose and reached for another fresh sheet of paper that was the most important thing i could never say all i felt but this was the best i could do what might i add to be of aid in living well in growing up and growing old what had i learned that i might pass on to her choose a man like your father i wrote either of them i shook my head over thatcould there be two men more differentbut left it thinking of roger wakefield once youve chosen a man dont try to change him i wrote with more confidence it cant be done more importantdont let him try to change you he cant do it either but men always try i bit the end of the pen tasting the bitter tang of india ink and finally i put down the last and the best advice i knew on growing older stand up straight and try not to get fat with all my love always mama jamies shoulders shook as he leaned against the rail whether with laughter or some other emotion i couldnt tell his linen glowed white with moonlight and his head was dark against the moon at last he turned and pulled me to him i think she will do verra well he whispered for no matter what poor gowk has fathered her no lass has ever had a better mother kiss me sassenach for believe mei wouldna change ye for the world phantom limbs fergus mr willoughby jamie and i had all kept careful watch upon the six scottish smugglers since our departure from scotland but there was not the slightest hint of suspicious behavior from any of them and after a time i found myself relaxing my wariness around them still i felt some reserve toward most of them save innes i had finally realized why neither fergus nor jamie thought him a possible traitor with but one arm innes was the only smuggler who could not have strung up the exciseman on the arbroath road innes was a quiet man none of the scots was what one might call garrulous but even by their high standards of taciturnity he was reserved i was therefore not surprised to see him grimacing silently one morning bent over behind a hatch cover evidently engaged in some silent internal battle have you a pain innes i asked stopping och he straightened startled but then fell back into his halfcrouched position his one arm locked across his belly mmphm he muttered his thin face flushing at being so discovered come along with me i said taking him by the elbow he looked frantically about for salvation but i towed him resisting but not audibly protesting back to my cabin where i forced him to sit upon the table and removed his shirt so that i could examine him i palpated his lean and hairy abdomen feeling the firm smooth mass of the liver on one side and the mildly distended curve of the stomach on the other the intermittent way in which the pains came on causing him to writhe like a worm on a hook then passing off gave me a good idea that what troubled him was simple flatulence but best to be thorough i probed for the gallbladder just in case wondering as i did so just what i would do should it prove to be an acute attack of cholecystitis or an inflamed appendix i could envision the cavity of the belly in my mind as though it lay open in fact before me my fingers translating the soft lumpy shapes beneath the skin into visionthe intricate folds of the intestines softly shielded by their yellow quilting of fatpadded membrane the slick smooth lobes of the liver deep purplered so much darker than the vivid scarlet of the hearts pericardium above opening that cavity was a risky thing to do even equipped with modern anesthetics and antibiotics sooner or later i knew i would be faced with the necessity of doing it but i sincerely hoped it would be later breathe in i said hands on his chest and saw in my mind the pinkflushed grainy surface of a healthy lung breathe out now and felt the color fade to soft blue no rales no halting a nice clear flow i reached for one of the thick sheets of vellum paper i used for stethoscopes when did you last move your bowels i inquired rolling the paper into a tube the scots thin face turned the color of fresh liver fixed with my gimlet eye he mumbled something incoherent in which the word four was just distinguishable four days i said forestalling his attempts to escape by putting a hand on his chest and pinning him flat to the table hold still ill just have a listen here to be sure the heart sounds were reassuringly normal i could hear the valves open and close with their soft meaty clicks all in the right places i was quite sure of the diagnosishad been virtually from the moment i had looked at himbut by now there was an audience of heads peering curiously round the doorway inness mates watching for effect i moved the end of my tubular stethoscope down farther listening for belly sounds just as i thought the rumble of trapped gas was clearly audible in the upper curve of the large intestine the lower sigmoid colon was blocked though no sound at all down there you have belly gas i said and constipation aye i ken that fine innes muttered looking frantically for his shirt i put my hand on the garment in question preventing him from leaving while i catechized him about his diet of late not surprisingly this consisted almost entirely of salt pork and hardtack what about the dried peas and the oatmeal i asked surprised having inquired as to the normal fare aboard ship i had taken the precaution of stowingalong with my surgeons cask of lime juice and the collection of medicinal herbsthree hundred pounds of dried peas and a similar quantity of oatmeal intending that this should be used to supplement the seamens normal diet innes remained tonguetied but this inquiry unleashed a flood of revelation and grievance from the onlookers in the doorway jamie fergus marsali and i all dined daily with captain raines feasting on murphys ambrosia so i was unaware of the deficiencies of the crews mess evidently the difficulty was murphy himself who while holding the highest culinary standards for the captains table considered the crews dinner to be a chore rather than a challenge he had mastered the routine of producing the crews meals quickly and competently and was highly resistant to any suggestions for an improved menu that might require further time or trouble he declined absolutely to trouble with such nuisances as soaking peas or boiling oatmeal compounding the difficulty was murphys ingrained prejudice against oatmeal a crude scottish mess that offended his aesthetic sense i knew what he thought about that having heard him muttering things about dogs vomit over the trays of breakfast that included the bowls of parritch to which jamie marsali and fergus were addicted mr murphy says as how salt pork and hardtack is good enough for every crew hes had to feed for thirty yeargiven figgydowdy or plum duff for pudding and beef on sundays toothough if thats beef im a chinamanand its good enough for us gordon burst in accustomed to polyglot crews of french italian spanish and norwegian sailors murphy was also accustomed to having his meals accepted and consumed with a voracious indifference that transcended nationalities the scots stubborn insistence on oatmeal roused all his own irish intransigence and the matter at first a small simmering disagreement was now beginning to rise to a boil we knew as there was meant to be parritch macleod explained for fergus did say so when he asked us to come but its been nothing but the meat and biscuit since we left scotland which is a wee bit griping to the belly if yere not used to it we didna like to trouble jamie roy ower such a thing raeburn put in geordies got his girdle and weve been makin our own oatcake ower the lamps in the crew quarters but weve run through what corn we brought in our bags and mr murphys got the keys to the pantry store he glanced shyly at me under his sandy blond lashes we didna like to ask knowin what he thought of us ye wouldna ken whats meant by the term spalpeens would ye mistress fraser macrae asked raising one bushy brow while listening to this outpouring of woe i had been selecting assorted herbs from my boxanise and angelica two large pinches of horehound and a few sprigs of peppermint tying these into a square of gauze i closed the box and handed innes his shirt into which he burrowed at once in search of refuge ill speak to mr murphy i promised the scots meanwhile i said to innes handing him the gauze bundle brew you a good pot of tea from that and drink a cupful at every watch change if weve had no results by tomorrow well try stronger measures as if in answer to this a high squeaking fart emerged from under innes to an ironic cheer from his colleagues aye thats right mistress fraser maybe ye can scare the shit out o him macleod said a broad grin splitting his face innes scarlet as a ruptured artery took the bundle bobbed his head in inarticulate thanks and fled precipitously followed in more leisurely fashion by the other smugglers a rather acrimonious debate with murphy followed terminating without bloodshed but with the compromise that i would be responsible for the preparation of the scots morning parritch permitted to do so under provision that i confined myself to a single pot and spoon did not sing while cooking and was careful not to make a mess in the precincts of the sacred galley it was only that night tossing restlessly in the cramped and chilly confines of my berth that it occurred to me how odd the mornings incident had been were this lallybroch and the scots jamies tenants not only would they have had no hesitation in approaching him about the matter they would have had no need to he would have known already what was wrong and taken steps to remedy the situation accustomed as i had always been to the intimacy and unquestioning loyalty of jamies own men i found this distance troubling jamie was not at the captains table next morning having gone out in the small boat with two of the sailors to catch whitebait but i met him on his return at noon sunburned cheerful and covered with scales and fish blood what have ye done to innes sassenach he said grinning hes hiding in the starboard head and says ye told him he mustna come out at all until hed shit i didnt tell him that exactly i explained i just said if he hadnt moved his bowels by tonight id give him an enema of slippery elm jamie glanced over his shoulder in the direction of the head well i suppose we will hope that inness bowels cooperate or i doubt but hell spend the rest of the voyage in the head wi a threat like that hangin ower him well i shouldnt worry now that he and the others have their parritch back their bowels ought to take care of themselves without undue interference from me jamie glanced down at me surprised got their parritch back whatever dye mean sassenach i explained the genesis of the oatmeal war and its outcome as he fetched a basin of water to clean his hands a small frown drew his brows close together as he pushed his sleeves up his arms they ought to have come to me about it he said i expect they would have sooner or later i said i only happened to find out by accident when i found innes grunting behind a hatch cover mmphm he set about scouring the bloodstains off his fingers rubbing the clinging scales free with a small pumice stone these men arent like your tenants at lallybroch are they i said voicing the thought i had had no he said quietly he dipped his fingers in the basin leaving tiny shimmering circles where the fish scales floated im no their laird only the man who pays them they like you though i protested then remembered ferguss story and amended this rather weakly to or at least five of them do i handed him the towel he took it with a brief nod and dried his hands looking down at the strip of cloth he shook his head aye macleod and the rest like me well enoughor five of them do he repeated ironically and theyll stand by me if its needfulfive of them but they dinna ken me much nor me them save innes he tossed the dirty water over the side and tucking the empty basin under his arm turned to go below offering me his arm there was more died at culloden than the stuart cause sassenach he said youll be coming for your dinner now i did not find out why innes was different until the next week perhaps emboldened by the success of the purgative i had given him innes came voluntarily to call upon me in my cabin a week later i am wondering mistress he said politely whether there might be a medicine for something as isna there what i must have looked puzzled at this description for he lifted the empty sleeve of his shirt in illustration my arm he explained its no there as ye can plainly see and yet it pains me something terrible sometimes he blushed slightly i did wonder for some years was i only a bit mad he confided in lowered tones but i spoke a bit wi mr murphy and he tells me its the same with his leg that got lost and fergus says he wakes sometimes feeling his missing hand slide into someones pocket he smiled briefly teeth a flash under his drooping mustache so i thought maybe if it was a common thing to feel a limb that wasnt there perhaps there was something that might be done about it i see i rubbed my chin pondering yes it is common its called a phantom limb when you still have feelings in a part thats been lost as for what to do about it i frowned trying to think whether i had ever heard of anything therapeutic for such a situation to gain time i asked how did you happen to lose the arm oh twas the blood poison he said casually i tore a small hole in my hand wi a nail one day and it festered i stared at the sleeve empty from the shoulder i suppose it did i said faintly oh aye it was a lucky thing though it was that stopped me bein transported wi the rest the rest of whom he looked at me surprised why the other prisoners from ardsmuir did mac dubh not tell ye about that when they stopped the fortress from being a prison they sent off all of the scottish prisoners to be indenture men in the coloniesall but mac dubh for he was a great man and they didna want him out o their sight and me for id lost the arm and was no good for hard labor so mac dubh was taken somewhere else and i was let gopardoned and set free so ye see it was a most fortunate accident save only for the pain that comes on sometimes at night he grimaced and made as though to rub the nonexistent arm stopping and shrugging at me in illustration of the problem i see so you were with jamie in prison i didnt know that i was turning through the contents of my medicine chest wondering whether a general pain reliever like willowbark tea or horehound with fennel would work on a phantom pain oh aye innes was losing his shyness and beginning to speak more freely i should have been dead of starvation by now had mac dubh not come to find me when he was released himself he went looking for you out of the corner of my eye i spotted a flash of blue and beckoned to mr willoughby who was passing by aye when he was released from his parole he came to inquire to see whether he could trace any of the men whod been taken to americato see whether any might have returned he shrugged the missing arm exaggerating the gesture but there were none in scotland save me i see mr willoughby have you a notion what might be done about this motioning to the chinese to come and look i explained the problem and was pleased to hear that he did indeed have a notion we stripped innes of his shirt once again and i watched taking careful notes as mr willoughby pressed hard with his fingers at certain spots on the neck and torso explaining as best he might what he was doing arm is in the ghost world he explained body not here in upper world arm tries to come back for it does not like to be away from body this anmopresspressthis stops pain but also we tell arm not come back and how dye do that innes was becoming interested in the procedure most of the crew would not let mr willoughby touch them regarding him as heathen unclean and a pervert to boot but innes had known and worked with the chinese for the last two years mr willoughby shook his head lacking words and burrowed in my medicine box he came up with the bottle of dried hot peppers and shaking out a careful handful put it into a small dish have fire he inquired i had a flint and steel and with these he succeeded in kindling a spark to ignite the dried herb the pungent smell filled the cabin and we all watched as a small plume of white rose up from the dish and formed a small hovering cloud over the dish send smoke of fan jiao messenger to ghost world speak arm mr willoughby explained inflating his lungs and puffing out his cheeks like a blowfish he blew lustily at the cloud dispersing it then without pausing he turned and spat copiously on inness stump why ye heathen bugger innes cried eyes bulging with fury dye dare spit on me spit on ghost mr willoughby explained taking three quick steps backward toward the door ghost afraid spittle not come back now right away i laid a restraining hand on inness remaining arm does your missing arm hurt now i asked the rage began to fade from his face as he thought about it wellno he admitted then he scowled at mr willoughby but that doesna mean ill have ye spit on me whenever the fancy takes ye ye wee poutworm oh no mr willoughby said quite cool i not spit you spit now scare you own ghost innes scratched his head not sure whether to be angry or amused well i will be damned he said finally he shook his head and picking up his shirt pulled it on still he said i think perhaps next time ill try your tea mistress fraser forces of nature i said jamie am a fool he spoke broodingly watching fergus and marsali who were absorbed in close conversation by the rail on the opposite side of the ship what makes you think so i asked though i had a reasonably good idea the fact that all four of the married persons aboard were living in unwilling celibacy had given rise to a certain air of suppressed amusement among the members of the crew whose celibacy was involuntary i have spent twenty years longing to have ye in my bed he said verifying my assumption and within a month of having ye back again ive arranged matters so that i canna even kiss ye without sneakin behind a hatch cover and even then half the time i look round to find fergus looking crosseyed down his nose at me the little bastard and no one to blame for it but my own foolishness what did i think i was doing he demanded rhetorically glaring at the pair across the way who were nuzzling each other with open affection well marsali is only fifteen i said mildly i expect you thought you were being fatherlyor stepfatherly aye i did he looked down at me with a grudging smile the reward for my tender concern being that i canna even touch my own wife oh you can touch me i said i took one of his hands caressing the palm gently with my thumb you just cant engage in acts of unbridled carnality we had had a few abortive attempts along those lines all frustrated by either the inopportune arrival of a crew member or the sheer uncongeniality of any nook aboard the artemis sufficiently secluded as to be private one latenight foray into the after hold had ended abruptly when a large rat had leapt from a stack of hides onto jamies bare shoulder sending me into hysterics and depriving jamie abruptly of any desire to continue what he was doing he glanced down at our linked hands where my thumb continued to make secret love to his palm and narrowed his eyes at me but let me continue he closed his fingers gently round my hand his own thumb featherlight on my pulse the simple fact was that we couldnt keep our hands off each otherno more than fergus and marsali coulddespite the fact that we knew very well such behavior would lead only to greater frustration aye well in my own defense i meant well he said ruefully smiling down into my eyes well you know what they say about good intentions what do they say his thumb was stroking gently up and down my wrist sending small fluttering sensations through the pit of my stomach i thought it must be true what mr willoughby said about sensations on one part of the body affecting another they pave the road to hell i gave his hand a squeeze and tried to take mine away but he wouldnt let go mmphm his eyes were on fergus who was teasing marsali with an albatrosss feather holding her by one arm and tickling her beneath the chin as she struggled ineffectually to get away verra true he said i meant to make sure the lass had a chance to think what she was about before the matter was too late for mending the end result of my interference being that i lie awake half the night trying not to think about you and listening to fergus lust across the cabin and come up in the morning to find the crew all grinning in their beards whenever they see me he aimed a vicious glare at maitland who was passing by the beardless cabin boy looked startled and edged carefully away glancing nervously back over his shoulder how do you hear someone lust i asked fascinated he glanced down at me looking mildly flustered oh wellits only he paused for a moment then rubbed the bridge of his nose which was beginning to redden in the sharp breeze have ye any idea what men in a prison do sassenach having no women for a verra long time i could guess i said thinking that perhaps i didnt really want to hear firsthand he hadnt spoken to me before about his time in ardsmuir i imagine ye could he said dryly and yed be right too theres the three choices use each other go a bit mad or deal with the matter by yourself aye he turned to look out to sea and bent his head slightly to look down at me a slight smile visible on his lips dye think me mad sassenach not most of the time i replied honestly turning round beside him he laughed and shook his head ruefully no i dinna seem able to manage it i now and then wished i could go madhe said thoughtfully it seemed a great deal easier than having always to think what to do nextbut it doesna seem to come natural to me nor does buggery he added with a wry twist of his mouth no i shouldnt think so men who might in the ordinary way recoil in horror from the thought of using another man could still bring themselves to the act out of desperate need not jamie knowing what i did of his experiences at the hands of jack randall i suspected that he very likely would have gone mad before seeking such resort himself he shrugged slightly and stood silent looking out to sea then he glanced down at his hands spread before him clutching the rail i fought themthe soldiers who took me id promised jenny i wouldntshe thought theyd hurt mebut when the time came i couldna seem to help it he shrugged again and slowly opened and closed his right hand it was his crippled hand the third finger marked by a thick scar that ran the length of the first two joints the fourth fingers second joint fused into stiffness so that the finger stuck out awkwardly even when he made a fist i broke this again then against a dragoons jaw he said ruefully waggling the finger slightly that was the third time the second was at culloden i didna mind it much but they put me in chains and i minded that a great deal id think you would it was hardnot difficult but surprisingly painfulto think of that lithe powerful body subdued by metal bound and humbled theres nay privacy in prison he said i minded that more than the fetters i think day and night always in sight of someone wi no guard for your thoughts but to feign sleep as for the other he snorted briefly and shoved the loose hair back behind his ear well ye wait for the light to go for the only modesty there is is darkness the cells were not large and the men lay close together for warmth in the night with no modesty save darkness and no privacy save silence it was impossible to remain unaware of the accommodation each man made to his own needs i was in irons for more than a year sassenach he said he lifted his arms spread them eighteen inches apart and stopped abruptly as though reaching some invisible limit i could move that farand nay more he said staring at his immobile hands and i couldna move my hands at all without the chain makin a sound torn between shame and need he would wait in the dark breathing in the stale and brutish scent of the surrounding men listening to the murmurous breath of his companions until the stealthy sounds nearby told him that the telltale clinking of his irons would be ignored if theres one thing i ken verra well sassenach he said quietly with a brief glance at fergus its the sound of a man makin love to a woman whos not there he shrugged and jerked his hands suddenly spreading them wide on the rail bursting his invisible chains he looked down at me then with a halfsmile and i saw the dark memories at the back of his eyes under the mocking humor i saw too the terrible need there the desire strong enough to have endured loneliness and degradation squalor and separation we stood quite still looking at each other oblivious of the deck traffic passing by he knew better than any man how to hide his thoughts but he wasnt hiding them from me the hunger in him went bonedeep and my own bones seemed to dissolve in recognition of it his hand was an inch from mine resting on the wooden rail longfingered and powerfulif i touched him i thought suddenly he would turn and take me here on the deck boards as though hearing my thought he took my hand suddenly pressing it tight against the hard muscle of his thigh how many times have we lain together since ye came back to me he whispered once twice in the brothel three times in the heather and then at lallybroch again in paris his fingers tapped lightly against my wrist one after the other in time with my pulse each time i left your bed as hungry as ever i came to it it takes no more to ready me now than the scent of your hair brushing past my face or the feel of your thigh against mine when we sit to eat and to see ye stand on deck wi the wind pressing your gown tight to your body the corner of his mouth twitched slightly as he looked at me i could see the pulse beat strong in the hollow of his throat his skin flushed with wind and desire there are moments sassenach when for one copper penny id have ye on the spot back against the mast and your skirts about your waist and devil take the bloody crew my fingers convulsed against his palm and he tightened his grasp nodding pleasantly in response to the greeting of the gunner coming past on his way toward the quartergallery the bell for the captains dinner sounded beneath my feet a sweet metallic vibration that traveled up through the soles of my feet and melted the marrow of my bones fergus and marsali left their play and went below and the crew began preparations for the changing of the watch but we stayed standing by the rail fixed in each others eyes burning the captains compliments mr fraser and will you be joining him for dinner it was maitland the cabin boy keeping a cautious distance as he relayed this message jamie took a deep breath and pulled his eyes away from mine aye mr maitland well be there directly he took another breath settled his coat on his shoulders and offered me his arm shall we go below sassenach just a minute i drew my hand out of my pocket having found what i was looking for i took his hand and pressed the object into his palm he stared down at the image of king george iii in his hand then up at me on account i said lets go and eat the next day found us on deck again though the air was still chilly the cold was far preferable to the stuffiness of the cabins we took our usual path down one side of the ship and up the other but then jamie stopped pausing to lean against the rail as he told me some anecdote about the printing business a few feet away mr willoughby sat crosslegged in the protection of the mainmast a small cake of wet black ink by the toe of his slipper and a large sheet of white paper on the deck before him the tip of his brush touched the paper lightly as a butterfly leaving surprising strong shapes behind as i watched fascinated he began again at the top of the page he worked rapidly with a sureness of stroke that was like watching a dancer or a fencer sure of his ground one of the deckhands passed dangerously close to the edge of the paper almostbut not quiteplacing a large dirty foot on the snowy white a few moments later another man did the same thing though there was plenty of room to pass by then the first man came back this time careless enough to kick over the small cake of black ink as he passed tck the seaman exclaimed in annoyance he scuffed at the black splotch on the otherwise immaculate deck filthy heathen look ere wot hes done the second man returning from his brief errand paused in interest on the clean deck captain raines wont be pleased will he he nodded at mr willoughby mockjovial best hurry and lick it up little fella before the captain comes aye thatll do lick it up quick now the first man moved a step nearer the seated figure his shadow falling on the page like a blot mr willoughbys lips tightened just a shade but he didnt look up he completed the second column righted the ink cake and dipped his brush without taking his eyes from the page and began a third column hand moving steadily i said began the first seaman loudly but stopped in surprise as a large white handkerchief fluttered down on the deck in front of him covering the inkblot your pardon gentlemen said jamie i seem to have dropped something with a cordial nod to the seamen he bent down and swept up the handkerchief leaving nothing but a faint smear on the decking the seamen glanced at each other uncertain then at jamie one man caught sight of the blue eyes over the blandly smiling mouth and blanched visibly he turned hastily away tugging at his mates arm norratall sir he mumbled cmon joe were wanted aft jamie didnt look either at the departing seamen or at mr willoughby but came toward me tucking his handkerchief back in his sleeve a verra pleasant day is it not sassenach he said he threw back his head inhaling deeply refreshing air aye more so for some than for others i expect i said amused the air at this particular spot on deck smelled rather strongly of the alumtanned hides in the hold below that was kind of you i said as he leaned back against the rail next to me do you think i should offer mr willoughby the use of my cabin to write jamie snorted briefly no ive told him he can use my cabin or the table in the mess between meals but hed rather be herestubborn wee fool that he is well i suppose the lights better i said dubiously eyeing the small hunched figure crouched doggedly against the mast as i watched a gust of wind lifted the edge of the paper mr willoughby pinned it at once holding it still with one hand while continuing his short sure brushstrokes with the other it doesnt look comfortable though its not jamie ran his fingers through his hair in mild exasperation he does it on purpose to provoke the crew well if thats what hes after hes doing a good job i observed what on earth for though jamie leaned back against the rail beside me and snorted once more aye well thats complicated ever met a chinaman before have ye a few but i suspect theyre a bit different in my time i said dryly they tend not to wear pigtails and silk pajamas for one thing nor do they have obsessions about ladies feetor if they did they didnt tell me about it i added to be fair jamie laughed and moved a few inches closer so that his hand on the rail brushed mine well its to do wi the feet he said or thats the start of it anyway see josie whos one of the whores at madame jeannes told gordon about it and of course hes told everyone now what on earth is it about the feet i demanded curiosity becoming overwhelming what does he do to them jamie coughed and a faint flush rose in his cheeks well its a bit you couldnt possibly tell me anything that would shock me i assured him i have seen quite a lot of things in my life you knowand a good many of them with you come to that i suppose ye have at that he said grinning aye well its no so much what he does butwell in china the highborn ladies have their feet bound ive heard of that i said wondering what all the fuss was about its supposed to make their feet small and graceful jamie snorted again graceful aye dye know how its done and proceeded to tell me they take a tiny lassienay more than a year old ayeand turn under the toes of her feet until they touch her heel then tie bandages about the foot to hold it so ouch i said involuntarily yes indeed he said dryly her nanny will take the bandages off now and then to clean the foot but puts them back directly after some time her wee toes rot and fall off and by the time shes grown the poor lassies little more at the end of her legs than a crumple of bones and skin smaller than the size o my fist his closed fist knocked softly against the wood of the rail in illustration but shes considered verra beautiful then he ended graceful as ye say thats perfectly disgusting i said but what has that got to do with i glanced at mr willoughby but he gave no sign of hearing us the wind was blowing from him toward us carrying our words out to sea say this was a lassies foot sassenach he said stretching his right hand out flat before him curl the toes under to touch the heel and what have ye in the middle he curled his fingers loosely into a fist in illustration what i said bewildered jamie extended the middle finger of his left hand and thrust it abruptly through the center of his fist in an unmistakably graphic gesture a hole he said succinctly youre kidding thats why they do it his forehead furrowed slightly then relaxed oh am i jesting by no means sassenach he sayshe nodded delicately at mr willoughbythat its a most remarkable sensation to a man why that perverted little beast jamie laughed at my indignation aye well thats about what the crew thinks too of course he canna get quite the same effect wi a european woman but i gather hetries now and then i began to understand the general feeling of hostility toward the little chinese even a short acquaintance with the crew of the artemis had taught me that seamen on the whole tended to be gallant creatures with a strong romantic streak where women were concernedno doubt because they did without female company for a good part of the year hm i said with a glance of suspicion at mr willoughby well that explains them all right but what about him thats whats a wee bit complicated jamies mouth curled upward in a wry smile see to mr yi tien cho late of the heavenly kingdom of china were the barbarians is that so i glanced up at brodie cooper coming down the ratlines above the filthy calloused soles of his feet all that was visible from below i rather thought both sides had a point even you oh aye im a filthy badsmelling gwaofethat means a foreign devil ye kenwi the stink of a weaseli think thats what huangshulang meansand a face like a gargoyle he finished cheerfully he told you all that it seemed an odd recompense for saving someones life jamie glanced down at me cocking one eyebrow have ye noticed maybe that verra small men will say anything to ye when theyve drink taken he asked i think brandy makes them forget their size they think theyre great hairy brutes and swagger something fierce he nodded at mr willoughby industriously painting hes a bit more circumspect when hes sober but it doesna change what he thinks it fair galls him aye especially knowing that if it wasna for me someone would likely knock him on the head or put him through the window into the sea some quiet night he spoke with simple matteroffactness but i hadnt missed the sideways looks directed at us by the passing seamen and had already realized just why jamie was passing time in idle conversation by the rail with me if anyone had been in doubt about mr willoughbys being under jamies protection they would be rapidly disabused of the notion so you saved his life gave him work and keep him out of trouble and he insults you and thinks youre an ignorant barbarian i said dryly sweet little fellow aye well the wind had shifted slightly blowing a lock of jamies hair free across his face he thumbed it back behind his ear and leaned farther toward me our shoulders nearly touching let him say what he likes im the only one who understands him really i laid a hand over jamies where it rested on the rail well maybe not to say understand him he admitted he looked down at the deck between his feet but i do remember he said softly what its like to have nothing but your prideand a friend i remembered what innes had said and wondered whether it was the onearmed man who had been his friend in time of need i knew what he meant i had had joe abernathy and knew what a difference it made yes i had a friend at the hospital i began but was interrupted by loud exclamations of disgust emanating from under my feet damn blazing hades that filtheating son of a pigfart i looked down startled then realized from the muffled irish oaths proceeding from below that we were standing directly over the galley the shouting was loud enough to attract attention from the hands forward and a small group of sailors gathered with us watching in fascination as the cooks blackkerchiefed head poked out of the hatchway glaring ferociously at the crowd burryarsed swabs he shouted whatre ye lookin at two of yer idle barsteds tumble arse down here and toss this muck over the side dye mean me to be climbin ladders all day and me with half a leg the head disappeared abruptly and with a goodnatured shrug picard motioned to one of the younger sailors to come along below shortly there was a confusion of voices and a bumping of some large object down below and a terrible smell assaulted my nostrils jesus christ on a piece of toast i snatched a handkerchief from my pocket and clapped it to my nose this wasnt the first smell i had encountered afloat and i usually kept a linen square soaked in wintergreen in my pocket as a precaution whats that by the smell of it dead horse a verra old horse at that and a long time dead jamies long thin nose looked a trifle pinched around the nostrils and all around sailors were gagging holding their noses and generally commenting unfavorably on the smell maitland and grosman faces averted from their burden but slightly green nonetheless manhandled a large cask through the hatchway and onto the deck the top had been split and i caught a brief glimpse of a yellowishwhite mass in the opening glistening faintly in the sun it seemed to be moving maggots in profusion eew the exclamation was jerked from me involuntarily the two sailors said nothing their lips being pressed tightly together but both of them looked as though they agreed with me together they manhandled the cask to the rail and heaved it up and over such of the crew as were not otherwise employed gathered at the rail to watch the cask bobbing in the wake and be entertained by murphys outspokenly blasphemous opinion of the ships chandler who had sold it to him manzetti a small italian seaman with a thick russet pigtail was standing by the rail loading a musket shark he explained with a gleam of teeth beneath his mustache seeing me watching him very good to eat ar said sturgis approvingly such of the crew as were not presently occupied gathered at the stern watching there were sharks i knew maitland had pointed out to me two dark flexible shapes hovering in the shadow of the hull the evening before keeping pace with the ship with no apparent effort save a small and steady oscillation of sickled tails there a shout went up from several throats as the cask jerked suddenly in the water a pause and manzetti fixed his aim carefully in the vicinity of the floating cask another jerk as though something had bumped it violently and another the water was a muddy gray but clear enough for me to catch a glimpse of something moving under the surface fast another jerk the cask heeled to one side and suddenly the sharp edge of a fin creased the surface of the water and a gray back showed briefly tiny waves purling off it the musket discharged next to me with a small roar and a cloud of blackpowder smoke that left my eyes stinging there was a universal shout from the observers and when the watering of my eyes subsided i could see a small brownish stain spreading round the cask did he hit the shark or the horsemeat i asked jamie in a lowvoiced aside the cask he said with a smile still its fine shooting several more shots went wild while the cask began to dance an agitated jig the frenzied sharks striking it repeatedly bits of white and brown flew from the broken cask and a large circle of grease rotten blood and debris spread round the sharks feast as though by magic seabirds began to appear one and two at a time diving for tidbits no good said manzetti at last lowering the musket and wiping his face with his sleeve too far he was sweating and stained from neck to hairline with black powder the wiping left a streak of white across his eyes like a raccoons mask i could relish a slab of shark said the captains voice near my ear i turned to see him peering thoughtfully over the rail at the scene of carnage perhaps we might lower a boat mr picard the bosun turned with an obliging roar and the artemis hauled her wind coming round in a small circle to draw near the remains of the floating cask a small boat was launched containing manzetti with musket and three seamen armed with gaffs and rope by the time they reached the spot there was nothing left of the cask but a few shattered bits of wood there was still plenty of activity though the water roiled with the sharks thrashing beneath the surface and the scene was nearly obscured by a raucous cloud of seabirds as i watched i saw a pointed snout rise suddenly from the water mouth open seize one of the birds and disappear beneath the waves all in the flick of an eyelash did you see that i said awed i was aware in a general way that sharks were wellequipped with teeth but this practical demonstration was more striking than any number of national geographic photographs why grandmother dear what big teeth ye have said jamie sounding suitably impressed oh they do indeed said a genial voice nearby i glanced aside to find murphy grinning at my elbow broad face shining with a savage glee little good it will do the buggers with a ball blown clean through their fucking brains he pounded a hamlike fist on the rail and shouted get me one of them jagged buggers manzetti theres a bottle o cookin brandy waitin if ye do is it a personal matter to ye mr murphy jamie asked politely or professional concern both mr fraser both the cook replied watching the hunt with a fierce attention he kicked his wooden leg against the side with a hollow clunk theyve had a taste o me he said with grim relish but ive tasted a good many more o them the boat was barely visible through the flapping screen of birds and their screams made it hard to hear anything other than murphys war cries shark steak with mustard murphy was bellowing eyes mere slits in an ecstasy of revenge stewed liver wi piccalilli ill make soup o yer fins and jelly yer eyeballs in sherry wine ye wicked barsted i saw manzetti kneeling in the bows take aim with his musket and the puff of black smoke as he fired and then i saw mr willoughby i hadnt seen him jump from the rail no one had with all eyes fixed on the hunt but there he was some distance away from the melee surrounding the boat his shaven head glistening like a fishing float as he wrestled in the water with an enormous bird its wings churning the water like an eggbeater alerted by my cry jamie tore his eyes from the hunt goggled for an instant and before i could move or speak was perched on the rail himself my shout of horror coincided with a surprised roar from murphy but jamie was gone too lancing into the water near the chinaman with barely a splash there were shouts and cries from the deckand a shrill screech from marsalias everyone realized what had happened jamies wet red head emerged next to mr willoughby and in seconds he had an arm tight about the chinamans throat mr willoughby clung tightly to the bird and i wasnt sure just for the moment whether jamie intended rescue or throttling but then he kicked strongly and began to tow the struggling mass of bird and man back toward the ship triumphant shouts from the boat and a spreading circle of deep red in the water there was a tremendous thrashing as one shark was gaffed and hauled behind the small boat by a rope about its tail then everything was confusion as the men in the boat noticed what else was going on in the water nearby lines were thrown over one side and then the other and crewmen rushed back and forth in high excitement undecided whether to help with rescue or shark but at last jamie and his burdens were hauled in to starboard and dumped dripping on the deck while the captured sharkseveral large bites taken out of its body by its hungry companionswas drawn in still feebly snapping to port jesuschrist jamie said chest heaving he lay flat on the deck gasping like a landed fish are you all right i knelt beside him and wiped the water off his face with the hem of my skirt he gave me a lopsided smile and nodded still gasping jesus he said at last sitting up he shook his head and sneezed i thought i was eaten sure those fools in the boat started toward us and there were sharks all round them under the water bitin at the gaffed one he tenderly massaged his calves its nay doubt oversensitive of me sassenach but ive always dreaded the thought of losing a leg it seems almost worse than bein killed outright id as soon you didnt do either i said dryly he was beginning to shiver i pulled off my shawl and wrapped it around his shoulders then looked about for mr willoughby the little chinese still clinging stubbornly to his prize a young pelican nearly as big as he was ignored both jamie and the considerable abuse flung in his direction he squelched below dripping protected from physical castigation by the clacking bill of his captive which discouraged anyone from getting too close to him a nasty chunking sound and a crow of triumph from the other side of the deck announced murphys use of an ax to dispatch his erstwhile nemesis the seamen clustered round the corpse knives drawn to get pieces of the skin further enthusiastic chopping and murphy came strolling past beaming a choice section of tail under his arm the huge yellow liver hanging from one hand in a bag of netting and the bloody ax slung over his shoulder not drowned are ye he said ruffling jamies damp hair with his spare hand i cant see why yed bother wi the little bugger myself but ill say twas bravely done ill brew ye up a fine broth from the tail to keep off the chill he promised and stumped off planning menus aloud why did he do it i asked mr willoughby i mean jamie shook his head and blew his nose on his shirttail damned if i know he wanted the bird i expect but i couldna say why to eat maybe murphy overheard this and swung round at the head of the galley ladder frowning ye cant eat pelicans he said shaking his head in disapproval fishytasting no matter how ye cook em and god knows what ones doing out here anyway theyre shorebirds pelicans blown out by a storm i suppose awkward buggers his bald head disappeared into his realm murmuring happily of dried parsley and cayenne jamie laughed and stood up aye well perhaps its only he wants the feathers to make quills of come along below sassenach ye can help me dry my back he had spoken jokingly but as soon as the words were out of his mouth his face went blank he glanced quickly to port where the crew was arguing and jostling over the remains of the shark while fergus and marsali cautiously examined the severed head lying gapejawed on the deck then his eyes met mine with a perfect understanding thirty seconds later we were below in his cabin cold drops from his wet hair rained over my shoulders and slid down my bosom but his mouth was hot and urgent the hard curves of his back glowed warm through the soaked fabric of the shirt that stuck to them ifrinn he said breathlessly breaking loose long enough to yank at his breeches christ theyre stuck to me i canna get them off snorting with laughter he jerked at the laces but the water had soaked them into a hopeless knot a knife i said wheres a knife snorting myself at the sight of him struggling frantically to get his drenched shirttail out of his breeches i began to rummage through the drawers of the desk tossing out bits of paper bottle of ink a snuffboxeverything but a knife the closest thing was an ivory letter opener made in the shape of a hand with a pointing finger i seized upon this and grasped him by the waistband trying to saw at the tangled laces he yelped in alarm and backed away christ be careful wi that sassenach its no going to do ye any good to get my breeks off and ye geld me in the process halfcrazed with lust as we were that seemed funny enough to double us both up laughing here rummaging in the chaos of his berth he snatched up his dirk and brandished it triumphantly an instant later the laces were severed and the sopping breeks lay puddled on the floor he seized me picked me up bodily and laid me on the desk heedless of crumpled papers and scattered quills tossing my skirts up past my waist he grabbed my hips and halflay on me his hard thighs forcing my legs apart it was like grasping a salamander a blaze of heat in a chilly shroud i gasped as the tail of his sopping shirt touched my bare belly then gasped again as i heard footsteps in the passage stop i hissed in his ear someones coming too late he said with breathless certainty i must have ye or die he took me with one quick ruthless thrust and i bit his shoulder hard tasting salt and wet linen but he made no sound two strokes three and i had my legs locked tight around his buttocks my cry muffled in his shirt not caring either who else might be coming he had me quickly and thoroughly and thrust himself home and home and home again with a deep sound of triumph in his throat shuddering and shaking in my arms two minutes later the cabin door swung open innes looked slowly round the wreckage of the room his soft brown gaze traveled from the ravaged desk to me sitting damp and disheveled but respectably clothed upon the berth and rested at last on jamie who sat collapsed on a stool still clad in his wet shirt chest heaving and the deep red color fading slowly from his face inness nostrils flared delicately but he said nothing he walked into the cabin nodding at me and bent to reach under ferguss berth whence he pulled out a bottle of brandywine for the chinee he said to me so as he mightnt take a chill he turned toward the door and paused squinting thoughtfully at jamie ye might should have mr murphy make ye some broth on that same account mac dubh they do say as tis dangerous to get chilled after hard work aye ye dinna want to take the ague there was a faint twinkle in the mournful brown depths jamie brushed back the salty tangle of his hair a slow smile spreading across his face aye well and if it should come to that innes at least i shall die a happy man we found out the next day what mr willoughby wanted the pelican for i found him on the afterdeck the bird perched on a sailchest beside him its wings bound tight to its body by means of strips of cloth it glared at me with round yellow eyes and clacked its bill in warning mr willoughby was pulling in a line on the end of which was a small wriggling purple squid detaching this he held it up in front of the pelican and said something in chinese the bird regarded him with deep suspicion but didnt move quickly he seized the upper bill in his hand pulled it up and tossed the squid into the birds pouch the pelican looking surprised gulped convulsively and swallowed it haoliao mr willoughby said approvingly stroking the birds head he saw me watching and beckoned me to come closer keeping a cautious eye on the wicked bill i did so ping an he said indicating the pelican peaceful one the bird erected a small crest of white feathers for all the world as though it were pricking up its ears at its name and i laughed really what are you going to do with him i teach him hunt for me the little chinese said matteroffactly you watch i did after several more squid and a couple of small fish had been caught and fed to the pelican mr willoughby removed another strip of soft cloth from the recesses of his costume and wrapped this snugly round the birds neck not want choke he explained not swallow fish he then tied a length of light line tightly to this collar motioned to me to stand back and with a swift jerk released the bindings that held the birds wings surprised at the sudden freedom the pelican waddled back and forth on the locker flapped its huge bony wings once or twice and then shot into the sky in an explosion of feathers a pelican on the ground is a comical thing all awkward angles splayed feet and gawky bill a soaring pelican circling over water is a thing of wonder graceful and primitive startling as a pterodactyl among the sleeker forms of gulls and petrels ping an the peaceful one soared to the limit of his line struggled to go higher then as though resigned began to circle mr willoughby eyes squinted nearly shut against the sun spun slowly round and round on the deck below playing the pelican like a kite all the hands in the rigging and on deck nearby stopped what they were doing to watch in fascination sudden as a bolt from a crossbow the pelican folded its wings and dived cleaving the water with scarcely a splash as it popped to the surface looking mildly surprised mr willoughby began to tow it in aboard once more the pelican was persuaded with some difficulty to give up its catch but at last suffered its captor to reach cautiously into the leathery subgular pouch and extract a fine fat sea bream mr willoughby smiled pleasantly at a gawking picard took out a small knife and slit the stillliving fish down the back pinioning the bird in one wiry arm he loosened the collar with his other hand and offered it a flapping piece of bream which ping an eagerly snatched from his fingers and gulped his mr willoughby explained wiping blood and scales carelessly on the leg of his trousers mine nodding toward the halffish still sitting on the locker now motionless within a week the pelican was entirely tame able to fly free collared but without the tethering line returning to his master to regurgitate a pouchful of shining fish at his feet when not fishing ping an either took up a position on the crosstrees much to the displeasure of the crewmen responsible for swabbing the deck beneath or followed mr willoughby around the deck waddling absurdly from side to side eightfoot wings halfspread for balance the crew both impressed by the fishing and wary of ping ans great snapping bill steered clear of mr willoughby who made his words each day beside the mast weather permitting secure under the benign yellow eye of his new friend i paused one day to watch mr willoughby at his work staying out of sight behind the shelter of the mast he sat for a moment a look of quiet satisfaction on his face contemplating the finished page i couldnt read the characters of course but the shape of the whole thing was somehow very pleasing to look at then he glanced quickly around as though checking to see that no one was coming picked up the brush and with great care added a final character in the upper left corner of the page without asking i knew it was his signature he sighed then and lifted his face to look out over the rail not inscrutable by any means his expression was filled with a dreaming delight and i knew that whatever he saw it was neither the ship nor the heaving ocean beyond at last he sighed again and shook his head as though to himself he laid hands on the paper and quickly gently folded it once and twice and again then rising to his feet he went to the rail extended his hands over the water and let the folded white shape fall it tumbled toward the water then the wind caught it and whirled it upward a bit of white receding in the distance looking much like the gulls and terns who squawked behind the ship in search of scraps mr willoughby didnt stay to watch it but turned away from the rail and went below the dream still stamped on his small round face mr willoughbys tale as we passed the center of the atlantic gyre and headed south the days and evenings became warm and the offduty crew began to congregate on the forecastle for a time after supper to sing songs dance to brodie coopers fiddle or listen to stories with the same instinct that makes children camping in the wood tell ghost stories the men seemed particularly fond of horrible tales of shipwreck and the perils of the sea as we passed farther south and out the realm of kraken and sea serpent the mood for monsters passed and the men began instead to tell stories of their homes it was after most of these had been exhausted that maitland the cabin boy turned to mr willoughby crouched as usual against the foot of the mast with his cup cradled to his chest how was it that you came from china willoughby maitland asked curiously ive not seen more than a handful of chinese sailors though folk do say as theres a great many people in china is it such a fine place that the inhabitants dont care to take leave of it perhaps at first demurring the little chinese seemed mildly flattered at the interest provoked by this question with a bit more urging he consented to tell of his departure from his homelandrequiring only that jamie should translate for him his own english being inadequate to the task jamie readily agreeing he sat down beside mr willoughby and cocked his head to listen i was a mandarin mr willoughby began in jamies voice a mandarin of letters one gifted in composition i wore a silk gown embroidered in very many colors and over this the scholars blue silk gown with the badge of my office embroidered upon breast and backthe figure of a fenghuanga bird of fire i think he means a phoenix jamie added turning to me for a moment before directing his attention back to the patiently waiting mr willoughby who began speaking again at once i was born in pekin the imperial city of the son of heaven that is how they call their emperor fergus whispered to me such presumption to equate their king with the lord jesus shh hissed several people turning indignant faces toward fergus he made a rude gesture at maxwell gordon but fell silent turning back to the small figure sitting crouched against the mast i was found early to have some skill in composition and while i was not at first adept in the use of brush and ink i learned at last with great effort to make the representations of my brush resemble the ideas that danced like cranes within my mind and so i came to the notice of wuxien a mandarin of the imperial household who took me to live with him and oversaw my training i rose rapidly in merit and eminence so that before my twentysixth birthday i had attained a globe of red coral upon my hat and then came an evil wind that blew the seeds of misfortune into my garden it may be that i was cursed by an enemy or perhaps that in my arrogance i had omitted to make proper sacrificefor surely i was not lacking in reverence to my ancestors being careful always to visit my familys tomb each year and to have joss sticks always burning in the hall of ancestors if his compositions were always so longwinded no doubt the son of heaven lost patience and tossed him in the river fergus muttered cynically but whatever the cause jamies voice continued my poetry came before the eyes of wanmei the emperors second wife second wife was a woman of great power having borne no less than four sons and when she asked that i might become part of her own household the request was granted at once and what was wrong wi that demanded gordon leaning forward in interest a chance to get on in the world surely mr willoughby evidently understood the question for he nodded in gordons direction as he continued and jamies voice took up the story oh the honor was inestimable i should have had a large house of my own within the walls of the palace and a guard of soldiers to escort my palanquin with a triple umbrella borne before me in symbol of my office and perhaps even a peacock feather for my hat my name would have been inscribed in letters of gold in the book of merit the little chinaman paused scratching at his scalp the hair had begun to sprout from the shaved part making him look rather like a tennis ball however there is a condition of service within the imperial household all the servants of the royal wives must be eunuchs a gasp of horror greeted this followed by a babble of agitated comment in which the remarks bloody heathen and yellow bastards were heard to predominate what is a eunuch marsali asked looking bewildered nothing you need ever concern yourself with chèrie fergus assured her slipping an arm about her shoulders so you ran mon ami he addressed mr willoughby in tones of deepest sympathy i should do the same without doubt a deep murmur of heartfelt approbation reinforced this sentiment mr willoughby seemed somewhat heartened by such evident approval he bobbed his head once or twice at his listeners before resuming his story it was most dishonorable of me to refuse the emperors gift and yetit is a grievous weaknessi had fallen in love with a woman there was a sympathetic sigh at this most sailors being wildly romantic souls but mr willoughby stopped jerking at jamies sleeve and saying something to him oh im wrong jamie corrected himself he says it was not a womanjust womanall women or the idea of women in general he means thats it he asked looking down at mr willoughby the chinaman nodded satisfied and sat back the moon was full up by now threequarters full and bright enough to show the little mandarins face as he talked yes he said through jamie i thought much of women their grace and beauty blooming like lotus flowers floating like milkweed on the wind and the myriad sounds of them sometimes like the chatter of ricebirds or the song of nightingales sometimes the cawing of crows he added with a smile that creased his eyes to slits and brought his hearers to laughter but even then i loved them i wrote all my poems to womansometimes they were addressed to one lady or another but most often to woman alone to the taste of breasts like apricots the warm scent of a womans navel when she wakens in the winter the warmth of a mound that fills your hand like a peach split with ripeness fergus scandalized put his hands over marsalis ears but the rest of his hearers were most receptive no wonder the wee fellow was an esteemed poet raeburn said with approval its verra heathen but i like it worth a red knob on your hat anyday maitland agreed almost worth learning a bit of chinee for the masters mate chimed in eyeing mr willoughby with fresh interest does he have a lot of those poems jamie waved the audienceby now augmented by most of the offduty handsto silence and said go on then to mr willoughby i fled on the night of lanterns the chinaman said a great festival and one when people would be thronging the streets there would be no danger of being noticed by the watchmen just after dark as the processions were assembling throughout the city i put on the garments of a traveler thats like a pilgrim jamie interjected they go to visit their ancestors tombs far away and wear white clothesthats for mourning ye ken and i left my house i made my way through the crowds without difficulty carrying a small anonymous lantern i had boughtone without my name and place of residence painted on it the watchmen were hammering upon their bamboo drums the servants of the great households beating gongs and from the roof of the palace fireworks were being set off in great profusion the small round face was marked by nostalgia as he remembered it was in a way a most appropriate farewell for a poet he said fleeing nameless to the sound of great applause as i passed the soldiers garrison at the city gate i looked back to see the many roofs of the palace outlined by bursting flowers of red and gold it looked like a magic gardenand a forbidden one for me yi tien cho had made his way without incident through the night but had nearly been caught the next day i had forgotten my fingernails he said he spread out a hand small and shortfingered the nails bitten to the quicks for a mandarin has long nails as symbol that he is not obliged to work with his hands and my own were the length of one of my finger joints a servant at the house where he had stopped for refreshment next day saw them and ran to tell the guard yi tien cho ran too and succeeded at last in eluding his pursuers by sliding into a wet ditch and lying hidden in the bushes while lying there i destroyed my nails of course he said he waggled the little finger of his right hand i was obliged to tear that nail out for it had a golden da zi inlaid in it which i could not dislodge he had stolen a peasants clothes from a bush where they had been hung to dry leaving the tornout nail with its golden character in exchange and made his way slowly across country toward the coast at first he paid for his food with the small store of money he had brought away but outside lulong he met with a band of robbers who took his money but left him his life and after that he said simply i stole food when i could and starved when i could not and at last the wind of fortune changed a little and i met with a group of traveling apothecaries on their way to the physicians fair near the coast in return for my skill at drawing banners for their booth and composing labels extolling the virtues of their medicines they carried me along with them once reaching the coast he had made his way to the waterfront and tried there to pass himself off as a seaman but failed utterly as his fingers so skillful with brush and ink knew nothing of the art of knots and lines there were several foreign ships in port he had chosen the one whose sailors looked the most barbarous as being likely to carry him farthest away and seizing his chance had slipped past the deck guard and into the hold of the serafina bound for edinburgh you had always meant to leave the country altogether fergus asked interested it seems a desperate choice emperors reach very long mr willoughby said softly in english not waiting for translation i am exile or i am dead his listeners gave a collective sigh at the awesome contemplation of such bloodthirsty power and there was a moment of silence with only the whine of the rigging overhead while mr willoughby picked up his neglected cup and drained the last drops of his grog he set it down licking his lips and laid his hand once more on jamies arm it is strange mr willoughby said and the air of reflection in his voice was echoed exactly by jamies but it was my joy of women that second wife saw and loved in my words yet by desiring to possess meand my poemsshe would have forever destroyed what she admired mr willoughby uttered a small chuckle whose irony was unmistakable nor is that the end of the contradiction my life has become because i could not bring myself to surrender my manhood i have lost all elsehonor livelihood country by that i mean not only the land itself with the slopes of noble fir trees where i spent my summers in tartary and the great plains of the south the flowing of rivers filled with fish but also the loss of myself my parents are dishonored the tombs of my ancestors fall into ruin and no joss burns before their images all order all beauty is lost i am come to a place where the golden words of my poems are taken for the clucking of hens and my brushstrokes for their scratchings i am taken as less than the meanest beggar who swallows serpents for the entertainment of the crowds allowing passersby to draw the serpent from my mouth by its tail for the tiny payment that will let me live another day mr willoughby glared round at his hearers making his parallel evident i am come to a country of women coarse and rank as bears the chinamans voice rose passionately though jamie kept to an even tone reciting the words but stripping them of feeling they are creatures of no grace no learning ignorant badsmelling their bodies gross with sprouting hair like dogs and thesethese disdain me as a yellow worm so that even the lowest whores will not lie with me for the love of woman i am come to a place where no woman is worthy of love at this point seeing the dark looks on the seamens faces jamie ceased translating and instead tried to calm the chinaman laying a big hand on the bluesilk shoulder aye man i quite see and im sure theres no a man present would have done otherwise given the choice is that not so lads he asked glancing over his shoulder with eyebrows raised significantly his moral force was sufficient to extort a grudging murmur of agreement but the crowds sympathy with the tale of mr willoughbys travails had been quite dissipated by his insulting conclusion pointed remarks were made about licentious ungrateful heathen and a great many extravagantly admiring compliments paid to marsali and me as the men dispersed aft fergus and marsali left then too fergus pausing en route to inform mr willoughby that any further remarks about european women would cause him fergus to be obliged to wrap his willoughbys queue about his neck and strangle him with it mr willoughby ignored remarks and threats alike merely staring straight ahead his black eyes shining with memory and grog jamie at last stood up too and held out a hand to help me down from my cask it was as we were turning to leave that the chinaman reached down between his legs completely without lewdness he cupped his testicles so that the rounded mass pressed against the silk he rolled them slowly in the palm of his hand staring at the bulge in deep meditation sometime he said as though to himself i think not worth it we meet a porpoise i had been conscious for some time that marsali was trying to get up the nerve to speak to me i had thought she would sooner or later whatever her feelings toward me i was the only other woman aboard i did my best to help smiling kindly and saying good morning but the first move would have to be hers she made it finally in the middle of the atlantic ocean a month after we had left scotland i was writing in our shared cabin making surgical notes on a minor amputationtwo smashed toes on one of the foredeck hands i had just completed a drawing of the surgical site when a shadow darkened the doorway of the cabin and i looked up to see marsali standing there chin thrust out pugnaciously i need to know something she said firmly i dinna like ye and i reckon ye ken that but da says youre a wisewoman and i think youre maybe an honest woman even if ye are a whore so youll maybe tell me there were any number of possible responses to this remarkable statement but i refrained from making any of them maybe i will i said putting down the pen what is it you need to know seeing that i wasnt angry she slid into the cabin and sat down on the stool the only available spot weel its to do wi bairns she explained and how ye get them i raised one eyebrow your mother didnt tell you where babies come from she snorted impatiently her small blond brows knotted in fierce scorn o course i ken where they come from any fool knows that much ye let a man put his prick between your legs and theres the devil to pay nine months later what i want to know is how ye dont get them i see i regarded her with considerable interest you dont want a child eronce youre properly married i mean most young women seem to well she said slowly twisting a handful of her dress i think i maybe would like a babe sometime for itself i mean if it maybe had dark hair like fergus a hint of dreaminess flitted across her face but then her expression hardened once more but i cant she said why not she pushed out her lips thinking then pulled them in again well because of fergus we havena lain together yet we havena been able to do more than kiss each other now and again behind the hatch coversthanks to da and his bloodyminded notions she added bitterly amen i said with some wryness eh never mind i waved a hand dismissing it what has that got to do with not wanting babies i want to like it she said matteroffactly when we get to the prick part i bit the inside of my lower lip ierimagine that has something to do with fergus but im afraid i dont quite see what it has to do with babies marsali eyed me warily without hostility for once more as though she were estimating me in some fashion fergus likes ye she said im fond of him too i answered cautiously not sure where the conversation was heading ive known him for quite a long time ever since he was a boy she relaxed suddenly some of the tension going out of the slender shoulders oh youll know about it thenwhere he was born suddenly i understood her wariness the brothel in paris yes i know about that he told you then she nodded aye he did a long time ago last hogmanay well i supposed a year was a long time to a fifteenyearold thats when i told him i loved him she went on her eyes were fixed on her skirt and a faint tinge of pink showed in her cheeks and he said he loved me too but my mother wasna going to ever agree to the match and i said why not there was nothing so awful about bein french not everybody could be scots and i didna think his hand mattered a bit eitherafter all there was mr murray wi his wooden leg and mother liked him well enoughbut then he said no it was none of those things and then he told meabout paris i mean and being born in a brothel and being a pickpocket until he met da she raised her eyes a look of incredulity in the light blue depths i think he thought id mind she said wonderingly he tried to go away and said he wouldna see me anymore well she shrugged tossing her fair hair out of the way i soon took care of that she looked at me straight on then hands clasped in her lap its just i didna want to mention it in case ye didnt know already but since ye dowell its no fergus im worried about he says he knows what to do and ill like it fine once were past the first time or two but thats not what my mam told me what did she tell you i asked fascinated a small line showed between the light brows well marsali said slowly it wasna so much she said itthough she did say when i told her about fergus and me that hed do terrible things to me because of living wi whores and having one for a motherit was more sheshe acted like it her face was a rosy pink now and she kept her eyes in her lap where her fingers twisted themselves in the folds of her skirt the wind seemed to be picking up small strands of blond hair rose gently from her head wafted by the breeze from the window when i started to bleed the first time she told me what to do and about how it was part o the curse of eve and i must just put up wi it and i said what was the curse of eve and she read me from the bible all about how st paul said women were terrible filthy sinners because of what eve did but they could still be saved by suffering and bearing children i never did think a lot of st paul i observed and she looked up startled but hes in the bible she said shocked so are a lot of other things i said dryly heard that story about gideon and his daughter have you or the fellow who sent his lady out to be raped to death by a crowd of ruffians so they wouldnt get him gods chosen men just like paul but go on do she gaped at me for a minute but then closed her mouth and nodded a little stunned aye well mother said as how it meant i was nearly old enough to be wed and when i did marry i must be sure to remember it was a womans duty to do as her husband wanted whether she liked it or no and she looked so sad when she told me thati thought whatever a womans duty was it must be awful and from what st paul said about suffering and bearing children she stopped and sighed i sat quietly waiting when she resumed it was haltingly as though she had trouble choosing her words i canna remember my father i was only three when the english took him away but i was old enough when my mother wedwed jamieto see how it was between them she bit her lip she wasnt used to calling jamie by his name dajamie i meanhes kind i think he always was to joan and me but id see when hed lay his hand on my mothers waist and try to draw her closeshed shrink away from him she gnawed her lip some more then continued i could see she was afraid she didna like him to touch her but i couldna see that he ever did anything to be afraid of not where we could seeso i thought it must be something he did when they were in their bed alone joan and i used to wonder what it could be mam never had marks on her face or her arms and she didna limp when she walkednot like magdalen wallace whose husband always beats her when hes drunk on market dayso we didna think da hit her marsali licked her lips dried by the warm salt air and i pushed the jug of water toward her she nodded in thanks and poured a cupful so i thought she said eyes fixed on the stream of water that it must be because mam had had childrenhad usand she knew it would be terrible again and so she didna want to go to bed withwith jamie for fear of it she took a drink then set down the cup and looked at me directly firming her chin in challenge i saw ye with my da she said just that minute before he saw me ii think ye liked what he was doing to you in the bed i opened my mouth and closed it again wellyes i said a little weakly i did she grunted in satisfaction mmphm and ye like it when he touches ye ive seen well then ye havena got any children and id heard there are ways not to have them only nobody seems to know just how but you must bein a wisewoman and all she tilted her head to one side studying me id like a babe she admitted but if its got to be a babe or liking fergus then its fergus so it wont be a babeif youll tell me how i brushed the curls back behind my ear wondering where on earth to start well i said drawing a deep breath to begin with i have had children her eyes sprang wide and round at this ye do does dadoes jamie know well of course he does i replied testily they were his i never heard da had any bairns at all the pale eyes narrowed with suspicion i dont imagine he thought it was any of your business i said perhaps a trifle more sharply than necessary and its not either i added but she just raised her brows and went on looking suspicious the first baby died i said capitulating in france shes buried there myour second daughter is grown now she was born after culloden so hes never seen her the grown one marsali spoke slowly frowning i shook my head unable to speak for a moment there seemed to be something stuck in my throat and i reached for the water marsali pushed the jug absently in my direction leaning against the swing of the ship thats verra sad she said softly to herself then she glanced up at me frowning once more in concentration as she tried to work it all out so yeve had children and it didna make a difference to you mmphm but its been a long while thendid ye have other men whilst ye were away in france her lower lip came up over the upper one making her look very much like a small and stubborn bulldog that i said firmly putting the cup down is definitely none of your business as to whether childbirth makes a difference possibly it does to some women but not all of them but whether it does or not there are good reasons why you might not want to have a child right away she withdrew the pouting underlip and sat up straight interested so there is a way there are a lot of ways and unfortunately most of them dont work i told her with a pang of regret for my prescription pad and the reliability of contraceptive pills still i remembered well enough the advice of the maîtresses sagefemme the experienced midwives of the hôpital des anges where i had worked in paris twenty years before hand me the small box in the cupboard over there i said pointing to the doors above her head yes that one some of the french midwives make a tea of bayberry and valerian i said rummaging in my medicine box but its rather dangerous and not all that dependable i dont think dye miss her marsali asked abruptly i glanced up startled your daughter her face was abnormally expressionless and i suspected the question had more to do with laoghaire than with me yes i said simply but shes grown she has her own life the lump in my throat was back and i bent my head over the medicine box hiding my face the chances of laoghaire ever seeing marsali again were just about as good as the chances that i would ever see brianna it wasnt a thought i wanted to dwell on here i said pulling out a large chunk of cleaned sponge i took one of the thin surgical knives from the fitted slots in the lid of the box and carefully sliced off several thin pieces about three inches square i searched through the box again and found the small bottle of tansy oil with which i carefully saturated one square under marsalis fascinated gaze all right i said thats about how much oil to use if you havent any oil you can dip the sponge in vinegareven wine will work in a pinch you put the bit of sponge well up inside you before you go to bed with a manmind you do it even the first time you can get with child from even once marsali nodded her eyes wide and touched the sponge gently with a forefinger aye andand after do i take it out again or an urgent shout from above coupled with a sudden heeling of the artemis as she backed her mainsails put an abrupt end to the conversation something was happening up above ill tell you later i said pushing the sponge and bottle toward her and headed for the passage jamie was standing with the captain on the afterdeck watching the approach of a large ship behind us she was perhaps three times the size of the artemis threemasted with a perfect forest of rigging and sail through which small black figures hopped like fleas on a bedsheet a puff of white smoke floated in her wake token of a cannon recently fired is she firing on us i asked in amazement no jamie said grimly a warning shot only she means to board us can they i addressed the question to captain raines who was looking even more glum than usual the downturned corners of his mouth sunk in his beard they can he said well not outrun her in a stiff breeze like this on the open sea what is she her ensign flew at the masthead but seen against the sun at this distance it looked completely black jamie glanced down at me expressionless a british manowar sassenach seventyfour guns perhaps yed best go below this was bad news while britain was no longer at war with france relations between the two countries were by no means cordial and while the artemis was armed she had only four twelvepound guns sufficient to deter small pirates but no match for a manofwar what can they want of us jamie asked the captain raines shook his head his soft plump face set grimly likely pressing he answered shes shorthanded you can see by her riggingand her foredeck all ahoo he noted disapprovingly eyes fixed on the manofwar now looming as she drew alongside he glanced at jamie they can press any of our hands who look to be britishwhich is something like half the crew and yourself mr fraserunless you wish to pass for french damn jamie said softly he glanced at me and frowned did i not tell ye to get below you did i said not going i drew closer to him my eyes fixed on the manofwar where a small boat was now being lowered one officer in a gilded coat and laced hat was climbing down the side if they press the british hands i asked captain raines what will happen to them theyll serve aboard the porpoisethats her he nodded at the manofwar which sported a pufflipped fish as the figurehead as members of the royal navy she may release the pressed hands when she reaches portor she may not what you mean they can just kidnap men and make them serve as sailors for as long as they please a thrill of fear shot through me at the thought of jamies being abruptly taken away they can the captain said shortly and if they do well have a job of it to reach jamaica ourselves with half a crew he turned abruptly and went forward to greet the arriving boat jamie gripped my elbow and squeezed theyll not take innes or fergus he said theyll help ye to hunt for young ian if they take usi noted the us with a sharp pangyoull go on to jareds place at sugar bay and search from there he looked down and gave me a brief smile ill meet ye there he said and gave my elbow a reassuring squeeze i canna say how long it might be but ill come to ye there but you could pass as a frenchman i protested you know you could he looked at me for a moment and shook his head smiling faintly no he said softly i canna let them take my men and stay behind hiding under a frenchmans name but i started to protest that the scottish smugglers were not his men had no claim on his loyalty and then stopped realizing that it was useless the scots might not be his tenants or his kin and one of them might well be a traitor but he had brought them here and if they went he would go with them dinna mind it sassenach he said softly i shall be all right one way or the other but i think it is best if our name is malcolm for the moment he patted my hand then released it and went forward shoulders braced to meet whatever was coming i followed more slowly as the gig pulled alongside i saw captain rainess eyebrows rise in astonishment god save us what is this he murmured under his breath as a head appeared above the artemiss rail it was a young man evidently in his late twenties but with his face drawn and shoulders slumping with fatigue a uniform coat that was too big for him had been tugged on over a filthy shirt and he staggered slightly as the deck of the artemis rose beneath him you are the captain of this ship the englishmans eyes were redrimmed from tiredness but he picked raines from the crowd of grimfaced hands at a glance i am acting captain thomas leonard of his majestys ship porpoise for the love of god he said speaking hoarsely have you a surgeon aboard over a warily offered glass of port below captain leonard explained that the porpoise had suffered an outbreak of some infectious plague beginning some four weeks before half the crew are down with it he said wiping a crimson drop from his stubbled chin weve lost thirty men so far and look fair to lose a lot more you lost your captain raines asked leonards thin face flushed slightly thethe captain and the two senior lieutenants died last week and the surgeon and the surgeons mate as well i was third lieutenant that explained both his surprising youth and his nervous state to be landed suddenly in sole command of a large ship a crew of six hundred men and a rampant infection aboard was enough to rattle anyone if you have anyone aboard with some medical experience he looked hopefully from captain raines to jamie who stood by the desk frowning slightly im the artemiss surgeon captain leonard i said from my place in the doorway what symptoms do your men have you the young captains head swiveled to stare at me his jaw hung slackly open showing the furred tongue and stained teeth of a tobaccochewer my wifes a rare healer captain jamie said mildly if its help ye came for id advise ye to answer her questions and do as she tells ye leonard blinked once but then took a deep breath and nodded yes well it seems to start with griping pains in the belly and a terrible flux and vomiting the afflicted men complain of headache and they have considerable fever they do some of them have a rash on their bellies i interrupted he nodded eagerly they do and some of them bleed from the arse as well oh i beg pardon maam he said suddenly flustered i meant no offense only that i think i know what that might be i interrupted his apologies a feeling of excitement began to grow in me the feeling of a diagnosis just under my hands and the sure knowledge of how to proceed with it the call of trumpets to a warhorse i thought with wry amusement id need to look at them to be sure but my wife would be pleased to advise ye captain jamie said firmly but im afraid she canna go aboard your ship are you sure captain leonard looked from one to the other of us eyes desperate with disappointment if she could only look at my crew no jamie said at the same moment i replied yes of course there was an awkward silence for a moment then jamie rose to his feet said politely youll excuse us captain leonard and dragged me bodily out of the cabin down the passage to the afterhold are ye daft he hissed still clutching me by one arm ye canna be thinking of setting foot on a ship wi the plague risk your life and the crew and young ian all for the sake of a pack of englishmen it isnt plague i said struggling to get free and i wouldnt be risking my life let go of my arm you bloody scot he let go but stood blocking the ladder glowering at me listen i said striving for patience it isnt plague im almost sure its typhoid feverthe rash sounds like it i cant catch that ive been vaccinated for it momentary doubt flitted across his face despite my explanations he was still inclined to consider germs and vaccines in the same league with black magic aye he said skeptically well perhaps thats so but still look i said groping for words im a doctor theyre sick and i can do something about it iitswell i have to thats all judging from its effect this statement appeared to lack something in eloquence jamie raised one eyebrow inviting me to go on i took a deep breath how should i explain itthe need to touch the compulsion to heal in his own way frank had understood surely there was a way to make it clear to jamie i took an oath i said when i became a physician both eyebrows went up an oath he echoed what sort of oath i had said it aloud only the one time still i had had a framed copy in my office frank had given it to me a gift when i graduated from medical school i swallowed a small thickening in my throat closed my eyes and read what i could remember from the scroll before my minds eye i swear by apollo the physician by aesculapius hygeia and panacea and i take to witness all the gods all the goddesses to keep according to my ability and my judgment the following oath i will prescribe regimen for the good of my patients according to my ability and my judgment and never do harm to anyone to please no one will i prescribe a deadly drug nor give advice which may cause his death but i will preserve the purity of my life and my art in every house where i come i will enter only for the good of my patients keeping myself far from all intentional illdoing and all seduction and especially from the pleasures of love with women or with men be they free or slaves all that may come to my knowledge in the exercise of my profession or outside of my profession or in daily commerce with men which ought not to be spread abroad i will keep secret and will never reveal if i keep this oath faithfully may i enjoy my life and practice my art respected by all men and in all times but if i swerve from it or violate it may the reverse be my lot i opened my eyes to find him looking down at me thoughtfully erparts of it are just for tradition i explained the corner of his mouth twitched slightly i see he said well the first part sounds a wee bit pagan but i like the part about how ye willna seduce anyone i thought youd like that one i said dryly captain leonards virtue is safe with me he gave a small snort and leaned back against the ladder running one hand slowly through his hair is that how its done then in the company of physicians he asked ye hold yourself bound to help whoever calls for it even an enemy it doesnt make a great difference you know if theyre ill or hurt i looked up searching his face for understanding aye well he said slowly ive taken an oath now and then myselfand none of them lightly he reached out and took my right hand his fingers resting on my silver ring some weigh heavier than others though he said watching my face in turn he was very close to me the sun from the hatchway overhead striping the linen of his sleeve the skin of his hand a deep ruddy bronze where it cradled my own white fingers and the glinting silver of my wedding ring it does i said softly speaking to his thought you know it does i laid my other hand against his chest its gold ring glowing in a bar of sunlight but where one vow can be kept without damage to another he sighed deeply enough to move the hand on my chest then bent and kissed me very gently aye well i wouldna have ye be forsworn he said straightening up with a wry twist to his mouth youre sure of this vaccination of yours it does work it works i assured him perhaps i should go with ye he said frowning slightly you cantyou havent been vaccinated and typhoids awfully contagious youre only thinking its typhoid from what leonard says he pointed out ye dinna ken for sure that its that no i admitted but theres only one way to find out i was assisted up onto the deck of the porpoise by means of a bosuns chair a terrorizing swing over empty air and frothing sea i landed ignominiously in a sprawl on the deck once i regained my feet i was astonished to find how solid the deck of the manofwar felt compared to the tiny pitching quarterdeck of the artemis far below it was like standing on the rock of gibraltar my hair had blown loose during the trip between the ships i twisted it up and repinned it as best i could then reached to take the medicine box i had brought from the midshipman who held it youd best show me where they are i said the wind was brisk and i was aware that it was taking a certain amount of work on the part of both crews to keep the two ships close together even as both drifted leeward it was dark in the tweendecks the confined space lit by small oil lamps that hung from the ceiling swaying gently with the rise and fall of the ship so that the ranks of hammocked men lay in deep shadow blotched with dim patches of light from above they looked like pods of whales or sleeping sea beasts lying humped and black side by side swaying with the movement of the sea beneath the stench was overpowering what air there was came down through crude ventilator shafts that reached the upper deck but that wasnt a lot worse than unwashed seamen was the reek of vomitus and the ripe throatclogging smell of bloodstreaked diarrhea which liberally spattered the decking beneath the hammocks where sufferers had been too ill to reach the few available chamber pots my shoes stuck to the deck coming away with a nasty sucking noise as i made my way cautiously into the area give me a better light i said peremptorily to the apprehensivelooking young midshipman who had been told off to accompany me he was holding a kerchief to his face and looked both scared and miserable but he obeyed holding up the lantern he carried so that i could peer into the nearest hammock the occupant groaned and turned away his face as the light struck him he was flushed with fever and his skin hot to the touch i pulled his shirt up and felt his stomach it too was hot the skin distended and hard as i prodded gently here and there the man writhed like a worm on a hook uttering piteous groans its all right i said soothingly urging him to flatten out again yes ill help you it will feel better soon let me look into your eyes now yes thats right i pulled back the eyelid his pupil shrank in the light leaving his eyes brown and redrimmed with suffering christ take away the light he gasped jerking his head away it splits my head fever vomiting abdominal cramps headache do you have chills i asked waving back the midshipmans lantern the answer was more a moan than a word but in the affirmative even in the shadows i could see that many of the men in the hammocks were wrapped in their blankets though it was stifling hot here below if not for the headache it could be simple gastroenteritisbut not with this many men stricken something very contagious indeed and i was fairly sure what not malaria coming from europe to the caribbean typhus was a possibility spread by the common body louse it was prone to rapid spread in close quarters like these and the symptoms were similar to those i saw around mewith one distinctive difference that seaman didnt have the characteristic belly rash nor the next but the third one did the light red rosettes were plain on the clammy white skin i pressed firmly on one and it disappeared blinking back into existence a moment later as the blood returned to the skin i squeezed my way between the hammocks the heavy sweating bodies pressing in on me from either side and made my way back to the companionway where captain leonard and two more of his midshipmen waited for me its typhoid i told the captain i was as sure as i could be lacking a microscope and blood culture oh his drawn face remained apprehensive do you know what to do for it mrs malcolm yes but it wont be easy the sick men need to be taken above washed thoroughly and laid where they can have fresh air to breathe beyond that its a matter of nursing theyll need to have a liquid dietand lots of waterboiled water thats very importantand sponging to bring down the fever the most important thing is to avoid infecting any more of your crew though there are several things that need to be done do them he interrupted i shall give orders to have as many of the healthy men as can be spared to attend you order them as you will well i said with a dubious glance at the surroundings i can make a start and tell you how to be going on but its going to be a big job captain raines and my husband will be anxious to be on our way mrs malcolm the captain said earnestly i shall be eternally grateful for any assistance you can render us we are most urgently bound for jamaica and unless the remainder of my crew can be saved from this wicked illness we will never reach that island he spoke with profound seriousness and i felt a twinge of pity for him all right i said with a sigh send me a dozen healthy crewmen for a start climbing to the quarterdeck i went to the rail and waved at jamie who was standing by the artemiss wheel looking upward i could see his face clearly despite the distance it was worried but relaxed into a broad smile when he saw me are ye comin down now he shouted cupping his hands not yet i shouted back i need two hours holding up two fingers to make my meaning clear in case he hadnt heard i stepped back from the rail but not before i saw the smile fade from his face hed heard i saw the sick men removed to the afterdeck and a crew of hands set to strip them of their filthy clothes and hose and sponge them with seawater from the pumps i was in the galley instructing the cook and galley crew in foodhandling precautions when i felt the movement of the deck under my feet the cook to whom i was talking snaked out a hand and snapped shut the latch of the cupboard behind him with the utmost dispatch he grabbed a loose pot that leapt off its shelf thrust a large ham on a spit into the lower cupboard and whirled to clap a lid on the boiling pot hung over the galley fire i stared at him in astonishment i had seen murphy perform this same odd ballet whenever the artemis cast off or changed course abruptly what i said but then abandoned the question and headed for the quarterdeck as fast as i could go we were under way big and solid as the porpoise was i could feel the vibration that ran through the keel as she took the wind i burst onto the deck to find a cloud of sails overhead set and drawing and the artemis falling rapidly behind us captain leonard was standing by the helmsman looking back to the artemis as the master bawled commands to the men overhead what are you doing i shouted you bloody little bastard whats going on here the captain glanced at me plainly embarrassed but with his jaw set stubbornly we must get to jamaica with the utmost dispatch he said his cheeks were chapped red with the rushing sea wind or he might have blushed i am sorry mrs malcolmindeed i regret the necessity but but nothing i said furious put about heave to drop the bloody anchor you cant take me away like this i regret the necessity he said again doggedly but i believe that we require your continuing services most urgently mrs malcolm dont worry he said striving for a reassurance that he didnt achieve he reached out as though to pat my shoulder but then thought better of it his hand dropped to his side i have promised your husband that the navy will provide you accommodation in jamaica until the artemis arrives there he flinched backward at the look on my face evidently afraid that i might attack himand not without reason what do you mean you promised my husband i said through gritted teeth do you mean that jthat mr malcolm permitted you to abduct me erno no he didnt the captain appeared to be finding the interview a strain he dragged a filthy handkerchief from his pocket and wiped his brow and the back of his neck he was most intransigent im afraid intransigent eh well so am i i stamped my foot on the deck aiming for his toes and missing only because he leapt agilely backward if you expect me to help you you bloody kidnapper just bloody think again the captain tucked his handkerchief away and set his jaw mrs malcolm you compel me to tell you what i told your husband the artemis sails under a french flag and with french papers but more than half her crew are englishmen or scots i could have pressed these men to service hereand i badly need them instead i have agreed to leave them unmolested in return for the gift of your medical knowledge so youve decided to press me instead and my husband agreed to thisthis bargain no he didnt the young man said rather dryly the captain of the artemis however perceived the force of my argument he blinked down at me his eyes swollen from days without sleep the toobig jacket flapping around his slender torso despite his youth and his slovenly appearance he had considerable dignity i must beg your pardon for what must seem the height of ungentlemanly behavior mrs malcolmbut the truth is that i am desperate he said simply you may be our only chance i must take it i opened my mouth to reply but then closed it despite my furyand my profound unease about what jamie was going to say when i saw him againi felt some sympathy for his position it was quite true that he stood in danger of losing most of his crew without help even with my help we would lose somebut that wasnt a prospect i cared to dwell on all right i said through my teeth allright i looked out over the rail at the dwindling sails of the artemis i wasnt prone to seasickness but i felt a distinct hollowing in the pit of my stomach as the shipand jamiefell far behind i wouldnt appear to have a lot of choice in the matter if you can spare as many men as possible to scrub down the tweendecksoh and have you any alcohol on board he looked mildly surprised alcohol well there is the rum for the hands grog and possibly some wine from the gun room locker will that do if thats what you have it will have to do i tried to push aside my own emotions long enough to deal with the situation i suppose i must speak to the purser then yes of course come with me leonard started toward the companionway that led belowdecks then flushing stood back and gestured awkwardly to let me go firstlest my descent expose my lower limbs indelicately i supposed biting my lip with a mixture of anger and amusement i went i had just reached the bottom of the ladder when i heard a confusion of voices above no i tell ee the captains not to be disturbed whatever you have to say will leave go i tell you if you dont let me speak to him now it will be too late and then leonards voice suddenly sharp as he turned to the interlopers stevens what is this whats the matter no matter sir said the first voice suddenly obsequious only that tompkins here is sure as he knows the cove what was on that shipthe big un with the red hair he says i havent time the captain said shortly tell the mate tompkins and i shall attend to it later i was naturally halfway back up the ladder by the time these words were spoken and listening for all i was worth the hatchway darkened as leonard began the backward descent down the ladder the young man glanced at me sharply but i kept my face carefully blank saying only have you many food stores left captain the sick men will need to be fed very carefully i dont suppose there would be any milk saboard but oh theres milk he said suddenly more cheerful we have six milch goats in fact the gunners wife mrs johansen does quite wonderfully with them ill send her to talk with you after weve seen the purser captain leonard introduced me briefly to mr overholt the purser and then left with the injunction that i should be afforded every possible service mr overholt a small plump man with a bald and shining head peered at me out of the deep collar of his coat like an undersized humptydumpty murmuring unhappily about the scarcity of everything near the end of a cruise and how unfortunate everything was but i scarcely attended to him i was much too agitated thinking of what i had overheard who was this tompkins the voice was entirely unfamiliar and i was sure i had never heard the name before more important what did he know about jamie and what was captain leonard likely to do with the information as it was there was nothing i could do now save contain my impatience and with the half of my mind not busy with fruitless speculation work out with mr overholt what supplies were available for use in sickroom feeding not a great deal as it turned out no they certainly cant eat salt beef i said firmly nor yet hardtack though if we soak the biscuit in boiled milk perhaps we can manage that as they begin to recover if you knock the weevils out first i added as an afterthought fish mr overholt suggested in a hopeless sort of way we often encounter substantial schools of mackerel or even bonita as we approach the caribbean sometimes the crew will have luck with baited lines maybe that would do i said absently boiled milk and water will be enough in the early stages but as the men begin to recover they should have something light and nourishingsoup for instance i suppose we could make a fish soup unless you have something else that might be suitable well mr overholt looked profoundly uneasy there is a small quantity of dried figs ten pound of sugar some coffee a quantity of naples biscuit and a large cask of madeira wine but of course we cannot use that why not i stared at him and he shuffled his feet uneasily why those supplies are intended for the use of our passenger he said what sort of passenger i asked blankly mr overholt looked surprised the captain did not tell you we are carrying the new governor for the island of jamaica that is the causewell one causehe corrected himself dabbing nervously at his bald head with a handkerchiefof our haste if hes not sick the governor can eat salt beef i said firmly be good for him i shouldnt wonder now if youll have the wine taken to the galley ive work to do aided by one of the remaining midshipmen a short stocky youth named pound i made a rapid tour of the ship ruthlessly dragooning supplies and hands pound trotting beside me like a small ferocious bulldog firmly informed surprised and resentful cooks carpenters sweepers swabbers sailmakers and holdsmen that all my wishesno matter how unreasonablemust be gratified instantly by the captains orders quarantine was the most important thing as soon as the tweendecks had been scrubbed and aired the patients would have to be carried down again but the hammocks restrung with plenty of space betweenthe unaffected crew would have to sleep on deckand provided with adequate toilet facilities i had seen a pair of large kettles in the galley that i thought might do i made a quick note on the mental list i was keeping and hoped the chief cook was not as possessive of his receptacles as murphy was i followed pounds round head covered with closeclipped brown curls down toward the hold in search of worn sails that might be used for cloths only half my mind was on my list with the other half i was contemplating the possible source of the typhoid outbreak caused by a bacillus of the salmonella genus it was normally spread by ingestion of the bacillus carried on hands contaminated by urine or feces given the sanitary habits of seamen any one of the crew could be the carrier of the disease the most likely culprit was one of the food handlers though given the widespread and sudden nature of the outbreakthe cook or one of his two mates or possibly one of the stewards i would have to find out how many of these there were which messes they served and whether anyone had changed duties four weeks agono five i corrected myself the outbreak had begun four weeks ago but there was an incubation period for the disease to be considered too mr pound i called and a round face peered up at me from the foot of the ladder yes maam mr poundwhats your first name by the way i asked elias maam he said looking mildly bewildered do you mind if i call you so i dropped off the foot of the ladder and smiled at him he smiled hesitantly back erno maam the captain might mind though he added cautiously tisnt really naval you know elias pound couldnt be more than seventeen or eighteen i doubted that captain leonard was more than five or six years older still protocol was protocol ill be very naval in public i assured him suppressing a smile but if youre going to work with me it will be easier to call you by name i knew as he didnt what lay aheadhours and days and possibly weeks of labor and exhaustion when the senses would blur and only bodily habit and blind instinctand the leadership of a tireless chiefwould keep those caring for the sick on their feet i was far from tireless but the illusion would have to be kept up this could be done with the help of two or three others whom i could train substitutes for my own hands and eyes who could carry on when i must rest fateand captain leonardhad designated elias pound as my new right hand best to be on comfortable terms with him at once how long have you been at sea elias i asked stopping to peer after him as he ducked under a low platform that held enormous loops of a huge evilsmelling chain each link more than twice the size of my fist the anchor chain i wondered touching it curiously it looked strong enough to moor the queen elizabeth which seemed a comforting thought since i was seven maam he said working his way out backward dragging a large chest he stood up puffing slightly from the exertion and wiped his round ingenuous face my uncles commander in triton so he was able to get me a berth in her i come to join the porpoise just this voyage though out of edinburgh he flipped open the chest revealing an assortment of rustsmeared surgical implementsat least i hoped it was rustand a jumbled collection of stoppered bottles and jugs one of the jars had cracked and a fine white dust like plaster of paris lay over everything in the chest this is what mr hunter the surgeon had with him maam he said will you have use for it god knows i said peering into the chest but ill have a look have someone else fetch it up to the sickbay though elias i need you to come and speak firmly to the cook as i oversaw the scrubbing of the tweendecks with boiling seawater my mind was occupied with several distinct trains of thought first i was mentally charting the necessary steps to take in combating the disease two men far gone from dehydration and malaise had died during the removal from the tweendecks and now lay at the far end of the afterdeck where the sailmaker was industriously stitching them into their hammocks for burial a pair of round shot sewn in at their feet four more werent going to make it through the night the remaining fortyfive had chances ranging from excellent to slim with luck and skill i might save most of them but how many new cases were brewing undetected among the remaining crew huge quantities of water were boiling in the galley at my order hot seawater for cleansing boiled fresh water for drinking i made another tick on my mental list i must see mrs johansen she of the milch goats and arrange for the milk to be sterilized as well i must interview the galley hands about their duties if a single source of infection could be found and isolated it would do a lot to halt the spread of the disease tick all of the available alcohol on the ship was being gathered in the sickbay to the profound horror of mr overholt it could be used in its present form but it would be better to have purified alcohol could a means be found of distilling it check with the purser tick all the hammocks must be boiled and dried before the healthy hands slept in them that would have to be done quickly before the next watch went to its rest send elias for a crew of swabbers and sweepers laundry duty seemed most in their line tick under the growing mental list of necessities were vague but continuing thoughts of the mysterious tompkins and his unknown information whatever it was it had not resulted in our changing course to return to the artemis either captain leonard had not taken it seriously or he was simply too eager to get to jamaica to allow anything to hinder his progress i had paused for a moment by the rail to organize my thoughts i pushed back the hair from my forehead and lifted my face to the cleansing wind letting it blow away the stench of sickness puffs of illsmelling steam rose from the nearby hatchway from the hotwater cleansing going on below it would be better down there when they had finished but a long way from fresh air i looked out over the rail hoping vainly for the glimpse of a sail but the porpoise was alone the artemisand jamieleft far behind i pushed away the sudden rush of loneliness and panic i must speak soon with captain leonard answers to two at least of the problems that concerned me lay with him the possible source of the typhoid outbreakand the role of the unknown mr tompkins in jamies affairs but for the moment there were more pressing matters elias i called knowing he would be somewhere within reach of my voice take me to mrs johansen and the goats please plague ship two days later i had still not found time to speak to captain leonard twice i had gone to his cabin but found the young captain gone or unavailabletaking position i was told or consulting charts or otherwise engaged in some bit of sailing arcana mr overholt had taken to avoiding me and my insatiable demands locking himself in his cabin with a pomander of dried sage and hyssop tied round his neck to ward off plague the ablebodied crewmen assigned to the work of cleaning and shifting had been lethargic and dubious at first but i had chivvied and scolded glared and shouted stamped my foot and shrieked and got them gradually moving i felt more like a sheepdog than a doctorsnapping and growling at their heels and hoarse now with the effort it was working though there was a new feeling of hope and purpose among the crewi could feel it four new deaths today and ten new cases reporting but the sounds of groaning distress from the tweendecks were much less and the faces of the stillhealthy showed the relief that comes of doing somethinganything i had so far failed to find the source of the contagion if i could do that and prevent any fresh outbreaks i mightjust possiblyhalt the devastation within a week while the porpoise still had hands enough to sail her a quick canvass of the surviving crew had turned up two men pressed from a county gaol where they had been imprisoned for brewing illicit liquor i had seized on these gratefully and put them to work building a still in whichto the horror of the crewhalf the ships store of rum was being distilled into pure alcohol for disinfection i had posted one of the surviving midshipmen by the entrance to the sickbay and another by the galley each armed with a basin of pure alcohol and instructions to see that no one went in or came out without dipping their hands beside each midshipman stood a marine with his rifle charged with the duty of seeing that no one should drink the grimy contents of the barrel into which the used alcohol was emptied when it became too filthy to be used any longer in mrs johansen the gunners wife i had found an unexpected ally an intelligent woman in her thirties she had understooddespite her having only a few words of broken english and my having no swedish at allwhat i wanted done and had done it if elias was my right hand annekje johansen was the left she had singlehandedly taken over the responsibility of scalding the goats milk patiently pounding hard biscuitremoving the weevils as she did soto be mixed with it and feeding the resulting mixture to those hands strong enough to digest it her own husband the chief gunner was one of the victims of the typhoid but he fortunately seemed one of the lighter cases and i had every hope that he might recoveras much because of his wifes devoted nursing as because of his own hardy constitution maam ruthven says as somebodys been adrinking of the pure alcohol again elias pound popped up at my elbow his round pink face looking drawn and wan substantially thinned by the pressures of the last few days i said something extremely bad and his brown eyes widened sorry i said i wiped the back of a hand across my brow trying to get my hair out of my eyes dont mean to offend your tender ears elias oh ive heard it before maam elias assured me just not from a lady like im not a lady elias i said tiredly im a doctor have someone go and search the ship for whoever it was theyll likely be unconscious by now he nodded and whirled on one foot ill look in the cable tier he said thats where they usually hide when theyre drunk this was the fourth in the last three days despite all guards set over the still and the purified alcohol the hands living on half their usual daily ration of grog were so desperate for drink that they contrived somehow to get at the pure grain alcohol meant for sterilization goodness mrs malcolm the purser had said shaking his bald head when i complained about the problem seamen will drink anything maam spoilt plum brandy peaches mashed inside a rubber boot and left to fermentwhy ive even known a hand caught stealing the old bandages from the surgeons quarters and soaking them in hopes of getting a whiff of alcohol no maam telling them that drinking it will kill them certainly wont stop them kill them it did one of the four men who had drunk it had died two more were in their own boardedoff section of the sickbay deeply comatose if they survived they were likely to be permanently braindamaged not that being on a bloody floating hellhole like this isnt likely to braindamage anyone i remarked bitterly to a tern who alighted on the rail nearby as if it isnt enough trying to save half the miserable lot from typhoid now the other half is trying to kill themselves with my alcohol damn the bloody lot of them the tern cocked its head decided i was not edible and flew away the ocean stretched empty all aroundbefore us where the unknown west indies concealed young ians fate and behind where jamie and the artemis had long since vanished and me in the middle with six hundred drinkmad english sailors and a hold full of inflamed bowels i stood fuming for a moment then turned with decision toward the forward gangway i didnt care if captain leonard was personally pumping the bilges he was going to talk to me i stopped just inside the door of the cabin it was not yet noon but the captain was asleep head pillowed on his forearms on top of an outspread book the quill had fallen from his fingers and the glass inkstand cleverly held in its anchored bracket swayed gently with the motion of the ship his face was turned to the side cheek pressed flat on his arm despite the heavy beard stubble he looked absurdly young i turned meaning to come back later but in moving brushed against the locker where a stack of books was precariously balanced amid a rubble of papers navigational instruments and halfrolled charts the top volume fell with a thump to the deck the sound was scarcely audible above the general sounds of creaking flapping whining rigging and shouting that made up the background of life on shipboard but it brought him awake blinking and looking startled mrs framrs malcolm he said he rubbed a hand over his face and shook his head quickly trying to wake himself whatthat isyou required something i didnt mean to wake you i said but i do need more alcoholif necessary i can use straight rumand you really must speak to the hands to see if there is some way of stopping them trying to drink the distilled alcohol weve had another thats poisoned himself today and if theres any way of bringing more fresh air down to the sickbay i stopped seeing that i was overwhelming him he blinked and scratched slowly pulling his thoughts into order the buttons on his sleeve had left two round red imprints on his cheek and his hair was flattened on that side i see he said rather stupidly then as he began to wake his expression cleared yes of course i will give orders to have a windsail rigged to bring more air below as for the alcoholi must beg leave to consult the purser as i do not myself know our present capacities in that regard he turned and took a breath as though to shout but then remembered that his steward was no longer within earshot being now below in the sickbay just then the ting of the ships bell came faintly from above i beg your pardon mrs malcolm he said politeness recovered it is nearly noon i must go and take our position i will send the purser to you should you care to remain here for a moment thank you i sat down in the chair he had just vacated he turned to go making an attempt to straighten the toolarge braided coat over his shoulders captain leonard i said moved by a sudden impulse he turned back questioning if you dont mind my askinghow old are you he blinked and his face tightened but he answered me i am nineteen maam your servant maam and with that he vanished through the door i could hear him in the companionway calling out in a voice halfcracked with fatigue nineteen i sat quite still paralyzed with shock i had thought him very young but not nearly that young his face weathered from exposure and lined with strain and sleeplessness he had looked to be at least in his midtwenties my god i thought appalled hes no more than a baby nineteen just briannas age and to be suddenly thrust into command not only of a shipand not just a ship but an english manofwarand not merely a manofwar but one with a plague aboard that had deprived her suddenly of a quarter of her crew and virtually all her commandi felt the fright and fury that had bubbled inside me for the last few days begin to ebb as i realized that the highhandedness that had led him to kidnap me was in fact not arrogance or illjudgment but the result of sheer desperation he had to have help he had said well he was right and i was it i took a deep breath visualizing the mess i had left behind in the sickbay that was mine and mine alone to do the best i could with captain leonard had left the logbook open on the desk his entry halfcomplete there was a small damp spot on the page he had drooled slightly in his sleep in a spasm of irritated pity i flipped over the page wishing to hide this further evidence of his vulnerability my eye caught a word on the new page and i stopped a chill snaking down from the nape of my neck as i remembered something when i had wakened him unexpectedly the captain had started up seen me and said mrs fra before catching himself and the name on the page before me the word that had caught my attention was fraser he knew who i wasand who jamie was i rose quickly and shut the door dropping the bolt at least i would have warning if anyone came then i sat down at the captains desk pressed flat the pages and began to read i flipped back to find the record of the meeting with the artemis three days before captain leonards entries were distinct from those of his predecessor and mostly quite briefnot surprising considering how much he had had to deal with of late most entries contained only the usual navigational information with a brief note of the names of those men who had died since the previous day the meeting with the artemis was noted though and my own presence february met near eight bells with artemis a small twomasted brig under french colors hailed her and requested the assistance of her surgeon c malcolm who was taken on board and remains with us to assist with the sick c malcolm eh no mention of my being a woman perhaps he thought it irrelevant or wished to avoid any inquiries over the propriety of his actions i went on to the next entry february i have recd information this day from harry tompkins able seaman that the supercargo of the brig artemis is known to him as a criminal by the name of james fraser known also by the names of jamie roy and of alexander malcolm this fraser is a seditionist and a notorious smuggler for whose capture a substantial reward is offered by the kings customs information was received from tompkins after we had parted company with artemis i thought it not expeditious to pursue artemis as we are ordered with all possible dispatch for jamaica because of our passenger however as i have promised to return the artemiss surgeon to them there fraser may be arrested at that time two men dead of the plaguewhich the artemiss surgeon informs me is the typhoide jno jaspers able seaman dd harty kepple cooks mate dd that was all the next days entry was confined entirely to navigation and the recording of the death of six men all with dd written beside their names i wondered what it meant but was too distracted to worry about it i heard steps coming down the passageway and barely got the bolt lifted before the pursers knock sounded on the door i scarcely heard mr overholts apologies my mind was too busy trying to make sense of this new revelation who in blinking bloody hell was this man tompkins no one i had ever seen or heard about i was sure and yet he obviously knew a dangerous amount about jamies activities which led to two questions how had an english seaman come by such informationand who else knew it cut the grog rations further to give you an additional cask of rum mr overholt was saying dubiously the hands wont like it but we might manage were only two weeks out of jamaica now whether they like it or not i need the alcohol more than they need grog i answered brusquely if they complain too much tell them if i dont have the rum none of them may make it to jamaica mr overholt sighed and wiped small beads of sweat from his shiny brow ill tell them maam he said too beaten down to object fine oh mr overholt he turned back questioning what does the legend dd mean i saw the captain write it in his log a small flicker of humor lighted in the pursers deepsunk eyes it means discharged dead maam he replied the only sure way for most of us of leaving his majestys navy as i oversaw the bathing of bodies and the constant infusions of sweetened water and boiled milk my mind continued to work on the problem of the unknown tompkins i knew nothing of the man save his voice he might be one of the faceless horde overhead the silhouettes that i saw in the rigging when i came up on deck for air or one of the hurrying anonymous bodies hurtling up and down the decks in a vain effort to do the work of three men i would meet him of course if he became infected i knew the names of each patient in the sickbay but i could hardly allow the matter to wait in the rather ghoulish hope that tompkins would contract typhoid at last i made up my mind to ask the man presumably knew who i was anyway even if he found out that i had been asking about him it was unlikely to do any harm elias was the natural place to begin i waited until the end of the day to ask trusting to fatigue to dull his natural curiosity tompkins the boys round face drew together in a brief frown then cleared oh yes maam one o the forecastle hands where did he come aboard do you know there was no good way of accounting for this sudden interest in a man i had never met but luckily elias was much too tired to wonder about it oh he said vaguely at spithead i think orno i remember now twas edinburgh he rubbed his knuckles under his nose to stifle a yawn thats it edinburgh i wouldn remember only he was a pressed man and a unholy fuss he made about it claimin as how they couldn press him he was protected account of he worked for sir percival turner in the customs the yawn got the better of him and he gaped widely then subsided but he didn have no written protection from sir percival he concluded blinking so there wasn nothing to be done a customs agent was he that went quite some way toward explaining things all right mmhm yes mum i mean elias was trying manfully to stay awake but his glazing eyes were fixed on the swaying lantern at the end of the sickbay and he was swaying with it you go on to bed elias i said taking pity on him ill finish here he shook his head quickly trying to shake off sleep oh no maam i aint sleepy not a bit he reached clumsily for the cup and bottle i held you give me that mum and go to rest yourself he would not be moved but stubbornly insisted on helping to administer the last round of water before staggering off to his cot i was nearly as tired as elias by the time we finished but sleep would not come i lay in the dead surgeons cabin staring up at the shadowy beam above my head listening to the creak and rumble of the ship about me wondering so tompkins worked for sir percival and sir percival assuredly knew that jamie was a smuggler but was there more to it than that tompkins knew jamie by sight how and if sir percival had been willing to tolerate jamies clandestine activities in return for bribes thenwell perhaps none of those bribes had made it to tompkinss pockets but in that caseand what about the ambush at arbroath cove was there a traitor among the smugglers and if so my thoughts were losing coherence spinning in circles like the revolutions of a dying top the powdered white face of sir percival faded into the purple mask of the hanged customs agent on the arbroath road and the gold and red flames of an exploding lantern lit the crevices of my mind i rolled onto my stomach clutching the pillow to my chest the last thought in my mind that i must find tompkins as it was tompkins found me for more than two days the situation in the sickbay was too pressing for me to leave for more than the barest space of time on the third day though matters seemed easier and i retired to the surgeons cabin intending to wash myself and rest briefly before the midday drum beat for the noon meal i was lying on the cot a cool cloth over my tired eyes when i heard the sound of bumping and voices in the passage outside my door a tentative knock sounded on my door and an unfamiliar voice said mrs malcolm theres been a haccident if you please maam i swung open the door to find two seamen supporting a third who stood storklike on one leg his face white with shock and pain it took no more than a single glance for me to know whom i was looking at the mans face was ridged down one side with the livid scars of a bad burn and the twisted eyelid on that side exposed the milky lens of a blind eye had i needed any further confirmation that here stood the oneeyed seaman young ian had thought hed killed lank brown hair grew back from a balding brow to a scrawny pigtail that drooped over one shoulder exposing a pair of large transparent ears mr tompkins i said with certainty and his remaining eye widened in surprise put him down over there please the men deposited tompkins on a stool by the wall and went back to their work the ship was too shorthanded to allow for distraction heart beating heavily i knelt down to examine the wounded leg he knew who i was all right i had seen it in his face when i opened the door there was a great deal of tension in the leg under my hand the injury was gory but not serious given suitable care a deep gash scored down the calf of the leg it had bled substantially but there were no deep arteries cut it had been wellwrapped with a piece of someones shirt and the bleeding had nearly stopped when i unwound the homemade bandage how did you do this mr tompkins i asked standing up and reaching for the bottle of alcohol he glanced up his single eye alert and wary splinter wound maam he answered in the nasal tones i had heard once before a spar broke as i was astanding on it the tip of his tongue stole out furtively wetting his lower lip i see i turned and flipped open the lid of my empty medicine box pretending to survey the available remedies i studied him out of the corner of one eye while i tried to think how best to approach him he was on his guard tricking him into revelations or winning his trust were clearly out of the question my eyes flicked over the tabletop seeking inspiration and found it with a mental apology to the shade of aesculapius the physician i picked up the late surgeons bonesaw a wicked thing some eighteen inches long a rustflecked steel i looked at this thoughtfully turned and laid the toothed edge of the instrument gently against the injured leg just above the knee i smiled charmingly into the seamans terrified single eye mr tompkins i said let us talk frankly an hour later ablebodied seaman tompkins had been restored to his hammock stitched and bandaged shaking in every limb but ablebodied still for my part i felt a little shaky as well tompkins was as he had insisted to the pressgang in edinburgh an agent of sir percival turner in that capacity he went about the docks and warehouses of all the shipping ports in the firth of forth from culross and donibristle to restalrig and musselburgh picking up gossip and keeping his beady eye sharppeeled to catch any evidence of unlawful activity the attitude of scots toward english tax laws being what it was there was no lack of such activity to report what was done with such reports though varied small smugglers caught redhanded with a bottle or two of unbonded rum or whisky might be summarily arrested tried and convicted and sentenced to anything from penal servitude to transportation with forfeiture of all their property to the crown the bigger fish though were reserved to sir percivals private judgment in other words allowed to pay substantial bribes for the privilege of continuing their operations under the blind eye here tompkins laughed sardonically touching the ruined side of his face of the kings agents sir percivals got ambitions see while not noticeably relaxed tompkins had at least unbent enough to lean forward one eye narrowing as he gestured in explanation hes in with dundas and all them everything goes right and he might have a peerage not just a knighthood eh but thatll take more than money one thing that could help was some spectacular demonstration of competence and service to the crown as in the sort of arrest that might make em sit up and take notice eh ooh that smarts missus you sure of what youre adoing of there tompkins squinted dubiously downward to where i was sponging the site of the injury with dilute alcohol im sure i said go on then i suppose a simple smuggler wouldnt have been good enough no matter how big evidently not however when word had reached sir percival that there might just possibly be a major political criminal within his grasp the old gentleman had nearly blown a gasket with excitement but seditions a harder thing to prove than smuggling eh you catch one of the little fish with the goods and theyre saying not a thing will lead you further on idealists them seditionists tompkins said shaking his head with disgust never rat on each other they dont so you didnt know who you were looking for i stood and took one of my catgut sutures from its jar threading it through a needle i caught tompkinss apprehensive look but did nothing to allay his anxiety i wanted him anxiousand voluble no we didnt know who the big fish wasnot until another of sir percivals agents had the luck to tumble to one of frasers associates what gave em the tip he was malcolm the printer and told his real name then it all come clear o course my heart skipped a beat who was the associate i asked the names and faces of the six smugglers darted through my mindlittle fish not idealists any of them but to which of them was loyalty no bar i dont know no its true missus i swear ow he said frantically as i jabbed the needle under the skin im not trying to hurt you i assured him in as false a voice as i could muster i have to stitch the wound though oh ow i dont know to be sure i dont id tell if i did as gods my witness im sure you would i said intent on my stitching oh please missus stop just for a moment all i know is it was an englishman thats all i stopped and stared up at him an englishman i said blankly yes missus thats what sir percival said he looked down at me tears trembling on the lashes of both his eyes i took the final stitch as gently as i could and tied the suture knot without speaking i got up poured a small tot of brandy from my private bottle and handed it to him he gulped it gratefully and seemed much restored in consequence whether out of gratitude or sheer relief for the end of the ordeal he told me the rest of the story in search of evidence to support a charge of sedition he had gone to the printshop in carfax close i know what happened there i assured him i turned his face toward the light examining the burn scars is it still painful no missus but it hurt precious bad for some time he said being incapacitated by his injuries tompkins had taken no part in the ambush at arbroath cove but he had heardnot directlike but i heard you know he said with a shrewd nod of the headwhat had happened sir percival had given jamie warning of an ambush to lessen the chances of jamies thinking him involved in the affair and possibly revealing the details of their financial arrangements in quarters where such revelations would be detrimental to sir percivals interests at the same time sir percival had learnedfrom the associate the mysterious englishmanof the fallback arrangement with the french delivery vessel and had arranged the graveambush on the beach at arbroath but what about the customs officer who was killed on the road i asked sharply i couldnt repress a small shudder at memory of that dreadful face who did that there were only five men among the smugglers who could possibly have done it and none of them are englishmen tompkins rubbed a hand over his mouth he seemed to be debating the wisdom of telling me or not i picked up the brandy bottle and set it by his elbow why im much obliged missus fraser youre a true christian missus and so i shall tell anyone who asks skip the testimonials i said dryly just tell me what you know about the customs officer he filled the cup and drained it sipping slowly then with a sigh of satisfaction he set it down and licked his lips it wasnt none of the smugglers done him in missus it was his own mate what i jerked back startled but he nodded blinking his good eye in token of sincerity thats right missus there was two of em wasnt there well the one of them had his instructions didnt he the instructions had been to wait until whatever smugglers escaped the ambush on the beach had reached the road whereupon the customs officer was to drop a noose over his partners head in the dark and strangle him swiftly then string him up and leave him as evidence of the smugglers murderous wrath but why i said bewildered and horrified what was the point of doing that do you not see tompkins looked surprised as though the logic of the situation should be obvious wed failed to get the evidence from the printshop that would have proved the case of sedition against fraser and with the shop burnt to the ground no possibility of another chance nor had we ever caught fraser redhanded with the goods himself only some of the small fish who worked for him one of the other agents thought hed a clue where the stuff was kept but something happened to himperhaps fraser caught him or bought him off for he disappeared one day in november and wasnt heard of again nor the hiding place for the contraband neither i see i swallowed thinking of the man who had accosted me on the stairs of the brothel what had become of that cask of crème de menthe but well im telling you missus just you wait tompkins raised a monitory hand soheres sir percival knowing as hes got a rare case with a mans not only one of the biggest smugglers on the firth and the author of some of the most firstrate seditious material its been my privilege to see but is also a pardoned jacobite traitor whose name will make the trial a sensation from one end of the kingdom to the other the only trouble beinghe shruggedas theres no evidence it began to make a hideous sort of sense as tompkins explained the plan the murder of a customs officer killed in pursuit of duty would not only make any smuggler arrested for the crime subject to a capital charge but was the sort of heinous crime that would cause a major public outcry the matteroffact acceptance that smugglers enjoyed from the populace would not protect them in a matter of such callous villainy your sir percival has got the makings of a really firstclass son of a bitch i observed tompkins nodded meditatively blinking into his cup well youve the right of it there missus ill not say youre wrong and the customs officer who was killedi suppose he was just a convenience tompkins sniggered with a fine spray of brandy his one eye seemed to be having some trouble focusing oh very convenient missus more ways than one dont you grieve none on his account there was a good many folk glad enough to see tom oakie swingand not the least of em sir percival i see i finished fastening the bandage about his calf it was getting late i would have to get back to the sickbay soon id better call someone to take you to your hammock i said taking the nearly empty bottle from his unresisting hand you should rest your leg for at least three days tell your officer i said you cant go aloft until ive taken out the stitches ill do that missus and i thank you for your kindness to a poor unfortunate sailor tompkins made an abortive attempt to stand looking surprised when he failed i got a hand under his armpit and heaved getting him on his feet andhe declining my offer to summon him assistancehelped him to the door you neednt worry about harry tompkins missus he said weaving unsteadily into the corridor he turned and gave me an exaggerated wink old harry always ends up all right no matter what looking at him with his long nose pinktipped from liquor his large transparent ears and his single sly brown eye it came to me suddenly what he reminded me of when were you born mr tompkins i asked he blinked for a moment uncomprehending but then said the year of our lord missus why no reason i said and waved him off watching as he caromed slowly down the corridor dropping out of sight at the ladder like a bag of oats i would have to check with mr willoughby to be sure but at the moment i would have wagered my chemise that had been a year of the rat moment of grace over the next few days a routine set in as it does in even the most desperate circumstances provided that they continue long enough the hours after a battle are urgent and chaotic with mens lives hanging on a seconds action here a doctor can be heroic knowing for certain that the wound just stanched has saved a life that the quick intervention will save a limb but in an epidemic there is none of that then come the long days of constant watching and battles fought on the field of germsand with no weapons suited to that field it can be no more than a battle of delay doing the small things that may not help but must be done over and over and over again fighting the invisible enemy of disease in the tenuous hope that the body can be supported long enough to outlast its attacker to fight disease without medicine is to push against a shadow a darkness that spreads as inexorably as night i had been fighting for nine days and fortysix more men were dead still i rose each day at dawn splashed water into my grainy eyes and went once more to the field of war unarmed with anything save persistenceand a barrel of alcohol there were some victories but even these left a bitter taste in my mouth i found the likely source of infectionone of the messmates a man named howard first serving on board as a member of one of the gun crews howard had been transferred to galley duty six weeks before the result of an accident with a recoiling guncarriage that had crushed several fingers howard had served the gun room and the first known case of the diseasetaken from the incomplete records of the dead surgeon mr hunterwas one of the marines who messed there four more cases all from the gun room and then it had begun to spread as infected but still ambulatory men left the deadly contamination smeared in the ships heads to be picked up there and passed to the crew at large howards admission that he had seen sickness like this before on other ships where he had served was enough to clinch the matter however the cook shorthanded as everyone else aboard had declined absolutely to part with a valuable hand only because of a goddamned females silly notion elias could not persuade him and i had been obliged to summon the captain himself whomisunderstanding the nature of the disturbance had arrived with several armed marines there was a most unpleasant scene in the galley and howard was removed to the brigthe only place of certain quarantineprotesting in bewilderment and demanding to know his crime as i came up from the galley the sun was going down into the ocean in a blaze that paved the western sea with gold like the streets of heaven i stopped for a moment just a moment transfixed by the sight it had happened many times before but it always took me by surprise always in the midst of great stress wading waistdeep in trouble and sorrow as doctors do i would glance out a window open a door look into a face and there it would be unexpected and unmistakable a moment of peace the light spread from the sky to the ship and the great horizon was no longer a blank threat of emptiness but the habitation of joy for a moment i lived in the center of the sun warmed and cleansed and the smell and sight of sickness fell away the bitterness lifted from my heart i never looked for it gave it no name yet i knew it always when the gift of peace came i stood quite still for the moment that it lasted thinking it strange and not strange that grace should find me here too then the light shifted slightly and the moment passed leaving me as it always did with the lasting echo of its presence in a reflex of acknowledgment i crossed myself and went below my tarnished armor faintly gleaming elias pound died of the typhoid four days later it was a virulent infection he came to the sickbay heavyeyed with fever and wincing at the light six hours later he was delirious and unable to rise the next dawn he pressed his cropped round head against my bosom called me mother and died in my arms i did what had to be done throughout the day and stood by captain leonard at sunset when he read the burial service the body of midshipman pound was consigned to the sea wrapped in his hammock i declined the captains invitation to dinner and went instead to sit in a remote corner of the afterdeck next to one of the great guns where i could look out over the water showing my face to no one the sun went down in gold and glory succeeded by a night of starred velvet but there was no moment of grace no peace in either sight for me as the darkness settled over the ship all her movements began to slow i leaned my head against the gun the polished metal cool under my cheek a seaman passed me at a fast walk intent on his duties and then i was alone i ached desperately my head throbbed my back was stiff and my feet swollen but none of these was of any significance compared to the deeper ache that knotted my heart any doctor hates to lose a patient death is the enemy and to lose someone in your care to the clutch of the dark angel is to be vanquished yourself to feel the rage of betrayal and impotence beyond the common human grief of loss and the horror of deaths finality i had lost twentythree men between dawn and sunset of this day elias was only the first several had died as i sponged their bodies or held their hands others alone in their hammocks had died uncomforted even by a touch because i could not reach them in time i thought i had resigned myself to the realities of this time but knowingeven as i held the twitching body of an eighteenyearold seaman as his bowels dissolved in blood and waterthat penicillin would have saved most of them and i had none was galling as an ulcer eating at my soul the box of syringes and ampules had been left behind on the artemis in the pocket of my spare skirt if i had had it i could not have used it if i had used it i could have saved no more than one or two but even knowing that i raged at the futility of it all clenching my teeth until my jaw ached as i went from man to man armed with nothing but boiled milk and biscuit and my two empty hands my mind followed the same dizzying lines my feet had traveled earlier seeing facesfaces contorted in anguish or smoothing slowly in the slackness of death but all of them looking at me at me i lifted my futile hand and slammed it hard against the rail i did it again and again scarcely feeling the sting of the blows in a frenzy of furious rage and grief stop that a voice spoke behind me and a hand seized my wrist preventing me from slapping the rail yet again let go i struggled but his grip was too strong stop he said again firmly his other arm came around my waist and he pulled me back away from the rail you mustnt do that he said youll hurt yourself i dont bloody care i wrenched against his grasp but then slumped defeated what did it matter he let go of me then and i turned to find myself facing a man i had never seen before he wasnt a sailor while his clothes were crumpled and stale with long wear they had originally been very fine the dovegray coat and waistcoat had been tailored to flatter his slender frame and the wilted lace at his throat had come from brussels who the hell are you i said in astonishment i brushed at my wet cheeks sniffed and made an instinctive effort to smooth down my hair i hoped the shadows hid my face he smiled slightly and handed me a handkerchief crumpled but clean my name is grey he said with a small courtly bow i expect that you must be the famous mrs malcolm whose heroism captain leonard has been so strongly praising i grimaced at that and he paused i am sorry he said have i said something amiss my apologies madame i had no notion of offering you offense he looked anxious at the thought and i shook my head it is not heroic to watch men die i said my words were thick and i stopped to blow my nose im just here thats all thank you for the handkerchief i hesitated not wanting to hand the used handkerchief back to him but not wanting simply to pocket it either he solved the dilemma with a dismissive wave of his hand might i do anything else for you he hesitated irresolute a cup of water some brandy perhaps he fumbled in his coat drawing out a small silver pocket flask engraved with a coat of arms which he offered to me i took it with a nod of thanks and took a swallow deep enough to make me cough it burned down the back of my throat but i sipped again more cautiously this time and felt it warm me easing and strengthening i breathed deeply and drank again it helped thank you i said a little hoarsely handing back the flask that seemed somewhat abrupt and i added id forgotten that brandy is good to drink ive been using it to wash people in the sickbay the statement brought back the events of the day to me with crushing vividness and i sagged back onto the powder box where i had been sitting i take it the plague continues unabated he asked quietly he stood in front of me the glow of a nearby lantern shining on his dark blond hair not unabated no i closed my eyes feeling unutterably bleak there was only one new case today there were four the day before and six the day before that that sounds hopeful he observed as though you are defeating the disease i shook my head slowly it felt dense and heavy as one of the cannonballs piled in the shallow bins by the guns no all were doing is to stop more men being infected there isnt a bloody thing i can do for the ones who already have it indeed he stooped and picked up one of my hands surprised i let him have it he ran a thumb lightly over the blister where i had burned myself scalding milk and touched my knuckles reddened and cracked from the constant immersion in alcohol you would appear to have been very active madame for someone who is doing nothing he said dryly of course im doing something i snapped yanking my hand back it doesnt do any good im sure he began it doesnt i slammed my fist on the gun the noiseless blow seeming to symbolize the painfilled futility of the day do you know how many men i lost today twentythree ive been on my feet since dawn elbowdeep in filth and vomit and my clothes stuck to me and none of its been any good i couldnt help do you hear me i couldnt help his face was turned away in shadow but his shoulders were stiff i hear you he said quietly you shame me madam i had kept to my cabin at the captains orders but i had no idea that the circumstances were such as you describe or i assure you that i should have come to help in spite of them why i said blankly it isnt your job is it yours he swung around to face me and i saw that he was handsome in his late thirties perhaps with sensitive finecut features and large blue eyes open in astonishment yes i said he studied my face for a moment and his own expression changed fading from surprise to thoughtfulness i see no you dont but it doesnt matter i pressed my fingertips hard against my brow in the spot mr willoughby had shown me to relieve headache if the captain means you to keep to your cabin then you likely should there are enough hands to help in the sickbay its just thatnothing helps i ended dropping my hands he walked over to the rail a few feet away from me and stood looking out over the expanse of dark water sparked here and there as a random wave caught the starlight i do see he repeated as though talking to the waves i had thought your distress due only to a womans natural compassion but i see it is something quite different he paused hands gripping the rail an indistinct figure in the starlight i have been a soldier an officer he said i know what it is to hold mens lives in your handand to lose them i was quiet and so was he the usual shipboard sounds went on in the distance muted by night and the lack of men to make them at last he sighed and turned toward me again what it comes to i think is the knowledge that you are not god he paused then added softly and the very real regret that you cannot be i sighed feeling some of the tension drain out of me the cool wind lifted the weight of my hair from my neck and the curling ends drifted across my face gentle as a touch yes i said he hesitated a moment as though not knowing what to say next then bent picked up my hand and kissed it very simply without affectation good night mrs malcolm he said and turned away the sound of his footsteps loud on the deck he was no more than a few yards past me when a seaman hurrying by spotted him and stopped with a cry it was jones one of the stewards my lord you shouldnt ought to be out of your cabin sir the night airs mortal and the plague loose on boardand the captains orderswhatever is your servant athinking of sir to let you walk about like this my acquaintance nodded apologetically yes yes i know i shouldnt have come up but i thought that if i stayed in the cabin a moment longer i should be stifled altogether better stifled than dead o the bloody flux sir and youll pardon of my saying so jones replied sternly my acquaintance made no remonstrance to this but merely murmured something and disappeared in the shadows of the afterdeck i reached out a hand and grasped jones by the sleeve as he passed causing him to start with a wordless yelp of alarm oh mrs malcolm he said coming to earth a bony hand splayed across his chest christ i did think you was a ghost mum begging your pardon i beg yours i said politely i only wanted to askwho was the man you were just talking to oh him jones twisted about to look over his shoulder but the aptly named mr grey had long since vanished why thats lord john grey mum him as is the new governor of jamaica he frowned censoriously in the direction taken by my acquaintance he aint supposed to be up here the captains give strict orders hes to stay safe below out o harms way all we needs to come into port with a dead political aboard and therell be the devil to pay mum savin your presence he shook his head disapprovingly then turned to me with a bob of the head youll be retiring mum shall i bring you down a nice cup of tea and maybe a bit o biscuit no thank you jones i said ill go and check the sickbay again before i go to bed i dont need anything well you do mum and you just say anytime good night to you mum he touched his forelock briefly and hurried off i stood at the rail alone for a moment before going below drawing in deep breaths of the clean fresh air it would be a good many hours yet until dawn the stars burned bright and clear over my head and i realized quite suddenly that the moment of grace i had wordlessly prayed for had come after all youre right i said at last aloud to the sea and sky a sunset wouldnt have been enough thank you i added and went below land ho its true what the sailors say you can smell land a long time before you see it despite the long voyage the goat pen in the hold was a surprisingly pleasant place by now the fresh straw had been exhausted and the goats hooves clicked restlessly to and fro on bare boards still the heaps of manure were swept up daily and neatly piled in baskets to be heaved overboard and annekje johansen brought dry armloads of hay to the manger each morning there was a strong smell of goat but it was a clean animal scent and quite pleasant by contrast with the stench of unwashed sailors komma komma komma dyr get she crooned luring a yearling within reach with a twiddled handful of hay the animal stretched out cautious lips and was promptly seized by the neck and pulled forward its head secured under annekjes brawny arm ticks is it i asked coming forward to help annekje looked up and gave me her broad gaptoothed smile guten morgen mrs claire she said ja tick here she took the young goats drooping ear in one hand and turned up the silky edge to show me the blueberry bulge of a bloodgorged tick burrowed deep in the tender skin she clutched the goat to hold it still and dug into the ear pinching the tick viciously between her nails she pulled it free with a twist and the goat blatted and kicked a tiny spot of blood welling from its ear where the tick had been detached wait i said when she would have released the animal she glanced at me curious but kept her hold and nodded i took the bottle of alcohol i wore slung at my belt like a sidearm and poured a few drops on the ear it was soft and tender the tiny veins clearly visible beneath the satin skin the goats squarepupilled eyes bulged farther and its tongue stuck out in agitation as it bleated no sore ear i said in explanation and annekje nodded in approval then the goatling was free and went plunging back into the herd to butt its head against its mothers side in a frantic search for milky reassurance annekje looked about for the discarded tick and found it lying on the deck tiny legs helpless to move its swollen body she smashed it casually under the heel of her shoe leaving a tiny dark blotch on the board we come to land i asked and she nodded with a wide happy smile she waved expansively upward where sunlight fell through the grating overhead ja smell she said sniffing vigorously in illustration she beamed land ja water grass is goot goot i need to go to land i said watching her carefully go quiet secret not tell ah annekjes eyes widened and she looked at me speculatively not tell captain ja not tell anyone i said nodding hard you can help she was quiet for a moment thinking a big placid woman she reminded me of her own goats adapting cheerfully to the queer life of shipboard enjoying the pleasures of hay and warm company thriving despite the lurching deck and stuffy shadows of the hold with that same air of capable adaptation she looked up at me and nodded calmly ja i help it was past midday when we anchored off what one of the midshipmen told me was watlings island i looked over the rail with considerable curiosity this flat island with its wide white beaches and lines of low palms had once been called san salvador renamed for the present in honor of a notorious buccaneer of the last century this dot of land was presumably christopher columbuss first sight of the new world i had the substantial advantage over columbus of having known for a fact that the land was here but still i felt a faint echo of the joy and relief that the sailors of those tiny wooden caravels had felt at that first landfall long enough on a rolling ship and you forget what it is to walk on land getting sea legs they call it its a metamorphosis this leggetting like the change from tadpole to frog a painless shift from one element to another but the smell and sight of land makes you remember that you were born to the earth and your feet ache suddenly for the touch of solid ground the problem at the moment was actually getting my feet on solid ground watlings island was no more than a pause to replenish our severely depleted water supply before the run through the windward isles down to jamaica it would be at least another weeks sail and the presence of so many invalids aboard requiring vast infusions of liquid had run the great water casks in the hold nearly dry san salvador was a small island but i had learned from careful questioning of my patients that there was a fair amount of shipping traffic through its main port in cockburn town it might not be the ideal place to escape but it looked as though there would be little other choice i had no intention of enjoying the navys hospitality on jamaica serving as the bait that would lure jamie to arrest starved as the crew was for the sight and feel of land no one was allowed to go ashore save the watering party now busy with their casks and sledges up pigeon creek at whose foot we were anchored one of the marines stood at the head of the gangway blocking any attempt at leaving such members of the crew as were not involved in watering or on watch stood by the rail talking and joking or merely gazing at the island the dream of hope fulfilled some way down the deck i caught sight of a long blond tail of hair flying in the shore breeze the governor too had emerged from seclusion pale face upturned to the tropic sun i would have gone to speak to him but there was no time annekje had already gone below for the goat i wiped my hands on my skirt making my final estimations it was no more than two hundred yards to the thick growth of palms and underbrush if i could get down the gangway and into the jungle i thought i had a good chance of getting away anxious as he was to be on his way to jamaica captain leonard was unlikely to waste much time in trying to catch me and if they did catch mewell the captain could hardly punish me for trying to leave the ship i was neither a seaman nor a formal captive after all the sun shone on annekjes blond head as she made her way carefully up the ladder a young goat cozily nestled against her wide bosom a quick glance to see that i was in place and she headed for the gangway annekje spoke to the sentry in her queer mixture of english and swedish pointing to the goat and then ashore insisting that it must have fresh grass the marine appeared to understand her but stood firm no maam he said respectfully enough no one is to go ashore save the watering party captains orders standing just out of sight i watched as she went on arguing thrusting her goatling urgently in his face forcing him a step back a step to the side maneuvering him artfully just far enough that i could slip past behind him no more than a moment now he was almost in place when she had drawn him away from the head of the gangplank she would drop the goat and cause sufficient confusion in the catching of it that i would have a minute or two to make my escape i shifted nervously from foot to foot my feet were bare it would be easier to run on the sandy beach the sentry moved his redcoated back fully turned to me a foot more i thought just a foot more such a fine day is it not mrs malcolm i bit my tongue very fine captain leonard i said with some difficulty my heart seemed to have stopped dead when he spoke it now resumed beating much faster than usual to make up for lost time the captain stepped up beside me and looked over the rail his young face shining with columbuss joy despite my strong desire to push him overboard i felt myself smile grudgingly at the sight of him this landfall is as much your victory as mine mrs malcolm he said without you i doubt we should ever have brought the porpoise to land he very shyly touched my hand and i smiled again a little less grudgingly im sure you would have managed captain i said you seem to be a most competent sailor he laughed and blushed he had shaved in honor of the land and his smooth cheeks glowed pink and raw well it is mostly the hands maam i may say they have done nobly and their efforts of course are due in turn to your skill as a physician he looked at me brown eyes shining earnestly indeed mrs malcolmi cannot say what your skill and kindness have meant to us ii mean to say so too to the governor and to sir grevilleyou know the kings commissioner on antigua i shall write a letter a most sincere testimonial to you and to your efforts on our behalf perhapsperhaps it will help he dropped his eyes help with what captain my heart was still beating fast captain leonard bit his lip then looked up i had not meant to say anything to you maam but ireally i cannot in honor keep silence mrs fraser i know your name and i know what your husband is really i said trying to keep control of my own emotions what is he the boy looked surprised at that why maam he is a criminal he paled a little you meanyou did not know yes i knew that i said dryly why are you telling me though he licked his lips but met my eyes bravely enough when i discovered your husbands identity i wrote it in the ships log i regret that action now but it is too late the information is official once i reach jamaica i must report his name and destination to the authorities there and likewise to the commander at the naval barracks on antigua he will be taken when the artemis docks he swallowed and if he is taken hell be hanged i said finishing what he could not the boy nodded wordless his mouth opened and closed seeking words i have seen men hanged he said at last mrs fraser i justi he stopped then fighting for control and found it he drew himself up straight and looked at me straight on the joy of his landing drowned in sudden misery i am sorry he said softly i cannot ask you to forgive me i can only say that i am most terribly sorry he turned on his heel and walked away directly before him stood annekje johansen and her goat still in heated conversation with the sentry what is this captain leonard demanded angrily remove this animal from the deck at once mr holford what are you thinking of annekjes eyes flicked from the captain to my face instantly divining what had gone wrong she stood still head bowed to the captains scolding then marched away toward the hatchway to the goats hold clutching her yearling as she passed one big blue eye winked solemnly we would try again but how racked by guilt and bedeviled by contrary winds captain leonard avoided me seeking refuge on his quarterdeck as we made our cautious way past acklin island and samana cay the weather aided him in this evasion it stayed bright but with odd light breezes alternating with sudden gusts so that constant adjustment of the sails was requiredno easy task in a ship so shorthanded it was four days later as we shifted course to enter the caicos passage that a sudden booming gust of wind struck the ship out of nowhere catching her illrigged and unprepared i was on deck when the gust struck there was a sudden whoosh that sent my skirts billowing and propelled me flying down the deck followed by a sharp loud crack somewhere overhead i crashed headon into ramsdell hodges one of the forecastle crew and we whirled together in a mad pirouette before falling entangled to the deck there was confusion all around with hands running and orders shouted i sat up trying to collect my scattered wits what is it i demanded of hodges who staggered to his feet and reached down to lift me up whats happened the fucking mainmasts split he said succinctly saving your presence maam but it has and now therell be hell to pay the porpoise limped slowly south not daring to risk the banks and shoals of the passage without a mainmast instead captain leonard put in for repairs at the nearest convenient anchorage bottle creek on the shore of north caicos island this time we were allowed ashore but no great good did it do me tiny and dry with few sources of fresh water the turks and caicos provided little more than numerous tiny bays that might shelter passing ships caught in storms and the idea of hiding on a foodless waterless island waiting for a convenient hurricane to blow me a ship did not appeal to annekje though our change of course suggested a new plan i know these island she said nodding wisely we go round now grand turk mouchoir not caicos i looked askance and she squatted drawing with a blunt forefinger in the yellow sand of the beach seecaicos passage she said sketching a pair of lines at the top between the lines she sketched the small triangle of a sail go through she said indicating the caicos passage but mast is gone now she quickly drew several irregular circles to the right of the passage north caicos south caicos caicos grand turk she said stabbing a finger at each circle in turn go round nowreefs mouchoir and she drew another pair of lines indicating a passage to the southeast of grand turk island mouchoir passage i had heard the sailors mention it but had no idea how it applied to my potential escape from the porpoise annekje nodded beaming then drew a long wavy line some way below her previous illustrations she pointed at it proudly hispaniola st domingue big island is there towns lots ships i raised my eyebrows still baffled she sighed seeing that i didnt understand she thought a moment then stood up dusting her heavy thighs we had been gathering whelks from the rocks in a shallow pan she seized this dumped out the whelks and filled it with seawater then laying it on the sand she motioned to me to watch she stirred the water carefully in a circular motion then lifted her finger out stained dark with the purple blood of the whelks the water continued to move swirling past the tin sides annekje pulled a thread from the raveling hem of her skirt bit off a short piece and spat it into the water it floated following the swirl of the water in lazy circles round the pan you she said pointing at it vater move you she pointed back to her drawing in the sand a new triangle in the mouchoir passage a line curving from the tiny sail down to the left indicating the ships course and now the blue thread representing me rescued from its immersion she placed it by the tiny sail representing the porpoise then dragged it off down the passage toward the coast of hispaniola jump she said simply youre crazy i said in horror she chuckled in deep satisfaction at my understanding ja she said but it vork vater move you she pointed to the end of the mouchoir passage to the coast of hispaniola and stirred the water in the pan once more we stood side by side watching the ripples of her manufactured current die away annekje glanced thoughtfully sideways at me you try not drown ja i took a deep breath and brushed the hair out of my eyes ja i said ill try i meet a priest the sea was remarkably warm as seas go and like a warm bath as compared to the icy surf off scotland on the other hand it was extremely wet after two or three hours of immersion my feet were numb and my fingers chilled where they gripped the ropes of my makeshift life preserver made of two empty casks the gunners wife was as good as her word though the long dim shape i had glimpsed from the porpoise grew steadily nearer its low hills dark as black velvet against a silver sky hispaniolahaiti i had no way of telling time and yet two months on shipboard with its constant bells and watchchanges had given me a rough feeling for the passage of the night hours i thought it must have been near midnight when i left the porpoise now it was likely near am and still over a mile to the shore ocean currents are strong but they take their time worn out from work and worry i twisted the rope awkwardly about one wrist to prevent my slipping out of the harness laid my forehead on one cask and drifted off to sleep with the scent of rum strong in my nostrils the brush of something solid beneath my feet woke me to an opal dawn the sea and sky both glowing with the colors found inside a shell with my feet planted in cold sand i could feel the strength of the current flowing past me tugging on the casks i disentangled myself from the rope harness and with considerable relief let the unwieldy things go bobbing toward the shore there were deep red indentations on my shoulders the wrist i had twisted through the wet rope was rubbed raw i was chilled exhausted and very thirsty and my legs were rubbery as boiled squid on the other hand the sea behind me was empty the porpoise nowhere in sight i had escaped now all that remained to be done was to get ashore find water find some means of quick transport to jamaica and find jamie and the artemis preferably before the royal navy did i thought i could just about manage the first item on the agenda such little as i knew of the caribbean from postcards and tourist brochures had led me to think in terms of whitesand beaches and crystal lagoons in fact prevailing conditions ran more toward a lot of dense and ugly vegetation embedded in extremely sticky darkbrown mud the thick bushlike plants must be mangroves they stretched as far as i could see in either direction there was no alternative but to clamber through them their roots rose out of the mud in big loops like croquet wickets which i tripped over regularly and the pale smooth gray twigs grew in bunches like finger bones snatching at my hair as i passed squads of tiny purple crabs ran off in profound agitation at my approach my feet sank into the mud to the ankles and i thought better of putting on my shoes wet as they were i rolled them up in my wet skirt kirtling it up above my knees and took out the fish knife annekje had given me just in case i saw nothing threatening but felt better with a weapon in my hand the rising sun on my shoulders at first was welcome as it thawed my chilled flesh and dried my clothes within an hour though i wished that it would go behind a cloud i was sweating heavily as the sun rose higher caked to the knees with drying mud and growing thirstier by the moment i tried to see how far the mangroves extended but they rose above my head and tossing waves of narrow graygreen leaves were all i could see the whole bloody island cant be mangroves i muttered slogging on there has to be solid land someplace and water i hoped a noise like a small cannon going off nearby startled me so that i dropped the fish knife i groped frantically in the mud for it then dived forward onto my face as something large whizzed past my head missing me by inches there was a loud rattling of leaves and then a sort of conversationalsounding kwark what i croaked i sat up cautiously knife in one hand and wiped the wet muddy curls out of my face with the other six feet away a large black bird was sitting on a mangrove regarding me with a critical eye he bent his head delicately preening his sleek black feathers as though to contrast his immaculate appearance with my own dishevelment well ladidah i said sarcastically youve got wings mate the bird stopped preening and eyed me censoriously then he lifted his beak into the air puffed his chest and as though to further establish his sartorial superiority suddenly inflated a large pouch of brilliant red skin that ran from the base of his neck halfway down his body bwoom he said repeating the cannonlike noise that had startled me before it startled me again but not so much dont do that i said irritably paying no attention the bird slowly flapped its wings settled back on its branch and boomed again there was a sudden harsh cry from above and with a loud flapping of wings two more large black birds plopped down landing in a mangrove a few feet away encouraged by the audience the first bird went on booming at regular intervals the skin of his pouch flaming with excitement within moments three more black shapes had appeared overhead i was reasonably sure they werent vultures but i still wasnt inclined to stay i had miles to go before i sleptor found jamie the chances of finding him in time were something i preferred not to dwell on a halfhour later i had made so little progress that i could still hear the intermittent booming of my fastidious acquaintance now joined by a number of similarly vocal friends panting with exertion i picked a thickish root and sat down to rest my lips were cracked and dry and the thought of water was occupying my mind to the exclusion of virtually everything else even jamie i had been struggling through the mangroves for what seemed like forever yet i could still hear the sound of the ocean in fact the tide must have been following me for as i sat a thin sheet of foaming dirty seawater came purling through the mangrove roots to touch my toes briefly before receding water water everywhere i said ruefully watching it nor any drop to drink a small movement on the damp mud caught my eye bending down i saw several small fishes of a sort i had never seen before so far from flopping about gasping for breath these fish were sitting upright propped on their pectoral fins looking as though the fact that they were out of water was of no concern at all fascinated i bent closer to inspect them one or two shifted on their fins but they seemed not to mind being looked at they goggled solemnly back at me eyes bulging it was only as i looked closer that i realized that the goggling appearance was caused by the fact that each fish appeared to have four eyes not two i stared at one for a long minute feeling the sweat trickle down between my breasts either im hallucinating i told it conversationally or you are the fish didnt answer but hopped suddenly landing on a branch several inches above the ground perhaps it sensed something for a moment later another wave washed through this one splashing up to my ankles a sudden welcome coolness fell on me the sun had obligingly gone behind a cloud and with its vanishing the whole feel of the mangrove forest changed the gray leaves rattled as a sudden wind came up and all the tiny crabs and fish and sand fleas disappeared as though by magic they obviously knew something i didnt and i found their going rather sinister i glanced up at the cloud where the sun had vanished and gasped a huge purple mass of boiling cloud was coming up behind the hills so fast that i could actually see the leading edge of the mass blazing white with shielded sunlight moving forward toward me the next wave came through two inches higher than the last and taking longer to recede i was neither a fish nor a crab but by this time i had tumbled to the fact that a storm was on its way and moving with amazing speed i glanced around but saw nothing more than the seemingly infinite stretch of mangroves before me nothing that could be used for shelter still being caught out in a rainstorm was hardly the worst that could happen under the circumstances my tongue felt dry and sticky and i licked my lips at the thought of cool sweet rain falling on my face the swish of another wave halfway up my shins brought me to a sudden awareness that i was in danger of more than getting wet a quick glance into the upper branches of the mangroves showed me dried tufts of seaweed tangled in the twigs and crotcheshightide leveland well above my head i felt a moments panic and tried to calm myself if i lost my bearings in this place i was done for hold on beauchamp i muttered to myself i remembered a bit of advice id learned as an internthe first thing to do in a cardiac arrest is take your own pulse i smiled at the memory feeling panic ebb at once as a gesture i did take my pulse a little fast but strong and steady all right then which way toward the mountain it was the only thing i could see above the sea of mangroves i pushed my way through the branches as fast as i could ignoring the ripping of my skirts and the increasing pull of each wave on my legs the wind was coming from the sea behind me pushing the waves higher it blew my hair constantly into my eyes and mouth and i wiped it back again and again cursing out loud for the comfort of hearing a voice but my throat was soon so dry that it hurt to talk i squelched on my skirt kept pulling loose from my belt and somewhere i dropped my shoes which disappeared at once in the boiling foam that now washed well above my knees it didnt seem to matter the tide was midthigh when the rain hit with a roar that drowned the rattle of the leaves it fell in drenching sheets that soaked me to the skin in moments at first i wasted time vainly tilting my head back trying to direct the rivulets that ran down my face into my open mouth then sense reasserted itself i took off the kerchief tucked around my shoulders let the rain soak it and wrung it out several times to remove the vestiges of salt then i let it soak in the rain once more lifted the wadded fabric to my mouth and sucked the water from it it tasted of sweat and seaweed and coarse cotton it was delicious i had kept going but was still in the clutches of the mangroves the incoming tide was nearly waistdeep and the walking getting much harder thirst slaked momentarily i put my head down and pushed forward as fast as i could lightning flashed over the mountains and a moment later came the growl of thunder the wash of the tide was so strong now that i could move forward only as each wave came in halfrunning as the water shoved me along then clinging to the nearest mangrove stem as the wash sucked back dragging my trailing legs i was beginning to think that i had been overhasty in abandoning captain leonard and the porpoise the wind was rising still further dashing rain into my face so that i could barely see sailors say every seventh wave is higher i found myself counting as i slogged forward it was the ninth wave in fact that struck me between the shoulder blades and knocked me flat before i could grasp a branch i floundered helpless and choking in a blur of sand and water then found my feet and stood upright again the wave had halfdrowned me but had also altered my direction i was no longer facing the mountain i was however facing a large tree no more than twenty feet away four more waves four more surging rushes forward four more grim clutchings as the tiderace sought to pull me back and i was on the muddy bank of a small inlet where a tiny stream ran through the mangroves and out to sea i crawled up it slipping and staggering as i clambered into the welcoming embrace of the tree from a perch twelve feet up i could see the stretch of the mangrove swamp behind me and beyond that the open sea i changed my mind once more about the wisdom of my leaving the porpoise no matter how awful things were on land they were a good deal worse out there lightning shattered over a surface of boiling water as wind and tiderace fought for control of the waves farther out in the mouchoir passage the swell was so high it looked like rolling hills the wind was high enough now to make a thin whistling scream as it passed by chilling me to the skin in my wet clothes thunder cracked together with the lightning flashes now as the storm moved over me the artemis was slower than the manofwar slow enough i hoped to be still safe far out in the atlantic i saw one clump of mangroves struck a hundred feet away the water hissed back boiled away and the dry land showed for a moment before the waves rolled back drowning the black wire of the blasted stems i wrapped my arms about the trunk of the tree pressed my face against the bark and prayed for jamie and the artemis for the porpoise annekje johansen and tom leonard and the governor and for me it was full daylight when i woke my leg wedged between two branches and numb from the knee down i halfclimbed halffell from my perch landing in the shallow water of the inlet i scooped up a handful of the water tasted it and spat it out not salt but too brackish to drink my clothes were damp but i was parched the storm was long gone everything around me was peaceful and normal with the exception of the blackened mangroves in the distance i could hear the booming of the big black birds brackish water here promised fresher water farther up the inlet i rubbed my leg trying to work out the pinsandneedles then limped up the bank the vegetation began to change from the graygreen mangroves to a lusher green with a thick undergrowth of grass and mossy plants that obliged me to walk in the water tired and thirsty as i was i could go only a short distance before having to sit down and rest as i did so several of the odd little fish hopped up onto the bank beside me goggling as though in curiosity well i think you look rather peculiar too i told one are you english said the fish incredulously the impression of alice in wonderland was so pronounced that i merely blinked stupidly at it for a moment then my head snapped up and i stared into the face of the man who had spoken his face was weathered and sunburned to the color of mahogany but the black hair that curled back from his brow was thick and ungrizzled he stepped out from behind the mangrove moving cautiously as though afraid to startle me he was a bit above middle height and burly thick through the shoulder with a broad boldly carved face whose naturally friendly expression was tinged with wariness he was dressed shabbily with a heavy canvas bag slung across his shoulderand a canteen made of goatskin hung from his belt vous êtes anglaise he asked repeating his original question in french comment ça va yes im english i said croaking may i have some water please his eyes popped wide openthey were a light hazelbut he didnt say anything just took the skin bag from his belt and handed it to me i laid the fish knife on my knee close within reach and drank deeply scarcely able to gulp fast enough careful he said its dangerous to drink too fast i know i said slightly breathless as i lowered the bag im a doctor i lifted the canteen and drank again but forced myself to swallow more slowly this time my rescuer was regarding me quizzicallyand little wonder i supposed seasoaked and sundried mudcaked and sweatstained with my hair straggling down over my face i looked like a beggar and probably a demented one at that a doctor he said in english showing that his thoughts had been traveling in the direction i suspected he eyed me closely in a way strongly reminiscent of the big black bird i had met earlier a doctor of what if i might ask medicine i said pausing briefly between gulps he had strongly drawn black brows these rose nearly to his hairline indeed he said after a noticeable pause indeed i said in the same tone of voice and he laughed he inclined his head toward me in a formal bow in that case madame physician allow me to introduce myself lawrence stern doctor of natural philosophy of the gesellschaft von naturwissenschaft philosophieren munich i blinked at him a naturalist he elaborated gesturing at the canvas bag over his shoulder i was making my way toward those frigate birds in hopes of observing their breeding display when i happened to overhear you er talking to a fish i finished yes wellhave they really got four eyes i asked in hopes of changing the subject yesor so it seems he glanced down at the fish who appeared to be following the conversation with rapt attention they seem to employ their oddly shaped optics when submerged so that the upper pair of eyes observes events above the surface of the water and the lower pair similarly takes note of happenings below it he looked then at me with a hint of a smile might i perhaps have the honor of knowing your name madame physician i hesitated unsure what to tell him i pondered the assortment of available aliases and decided on the truth fraser i said claire fraser mrs james fraser i added for good measure feeling vaguely that marital status might make me seem slightly more respectable appearances notwithstanding i fingered back the curl hanging in my left eye your servant madame he said with a gracious bow he rubbed the bridge of his nose thoughtfully looking at me you have been shipwrecked perhaps he ventured it seemed the most logicalif not the onlyexplanation of my presence and i nodded i need to find a way to get to jamaica i said do you think you can help me he stared at me frowning slightly as though i were a specimen he couldnt quite decide how to classify but then he nodded he had a broad mouth that looked made for smiling one corner turned up and he extended a hand to help me up yes he said i can help but i think maybe first we find you some food and maybe clothes eh i have a friend who lives not so far away i will take you there shall i what with parching thirst and the general press of events i had paid little attention to the demands of my stomach at the mention of food however ii it came immediately and vociferously to life that i said loudly in hopes of drowning it out would be very nice indeed i brushed back the tangle of my hair as well as i could and ducking under a branch followed my rescuer into the trees as we emerged from a palmetto grove the ground opened out into a meadowlike space then rose up in a broad hill before us at the top of the hill i could see a houseor at least a ruin its yellow plaster walls were cracked and overrun by pink bougainvillaeas and straggling guavas the tin roof sported several visible holes and the whole place gave off an air of mournful dilapidation hacienda de la fuente my new acquaintance said with a nod toward it can you stand the walk up the hill or he hesitated eyeing me as though estimating my weight i could carry you i suppose he said with a not altogether flattering tone of doubt in his voice i can manage i assured him my feet were bruised and sore and punctured by fallen palmetto fronds but the path before us looked relatively smooth the hillside leading up to the house was crisscrossed with the faint lines of sheep trails there were a number of these animals present peacefully grazing under the hot hispaniola sun as we stepped out of the trees one sheep spotted us and uttered a short bleat of surprise like clockwork every sheep on the hillside lifted its head in unison and stared at us feeling rather selfconscious under this unblinking phalanx of suspicious eyes i picked up my muddy skirts and followed dr stern toward the main pathtrodden by more than sheep to judge from its widththat led up and over the hill it was a fine bright day and flocks of orange and white butterflies flickered through the grass they lighted on the scattered blooms with here and there a brilliant yellow butterfly shining like a tiny sun i breathed in deeply a lovely smell of grass and flowers with minor notes of sheep and sunwarmed dust a brown speck lighted for a moment on my sleeve and clung long enough for me to see the velvet scales on its wing and the tiny curled hose of its proboscis the slender abdomen pulsed breathing to its wingbeats and then it was gone it might have been the promise of help the water the butterflies or all three but the burden of fear and fatigue under which i had labored for so long began to lift true i still had to face the problem of finding transport to jamaica but with thirst assuaged a friend at hand and the possibility of lunch just ahead that no longer appeared the impossible task it had seemed in the mangroves there he is lawrence stopped waiting for me to come up alongside him on the path he gestured upward toward a slight wiry figure picking its way carefully down the hillside toward us i squinted at the figure as it wandered through the sheep who took no apparent notice of his passage jesus i said its st francis of assisi lawrence glanced at me in surprise no neither one i told you hes english he raised an arm and shouted áhola señor fogden the grayrobed figure paused suspiciously one hand twined protectively in the wool of a passing ewe àquien es stern called lawrence lawrence stern come along he said and extended a hand to pull me up the steep hillside onto the sheep path above the ewe was making determined efforts to escape her protector which distracted him from our approach a slender man a bit taller than i he had a lean face that might have been handsome if not disfigured by a reddish beard that straggled dustmoplike round the edges of his chin his long and straying hair had gone to gray in streaks and runnels and fell forward into his eyes with some frequency an orange butterfly took wing from his head as we reached him stern he said brushing back the hair with his free hand and blinking owlishly in the sunlight i dont know anyoh its you his thin face brightened why didnt you say it was the shitworm man i should have known you at once stern looked mildly embarrassed at this and glanced at me apologetically iahcollected several interesting parasites from the excrement of mr fogdens sheep upon the occasion of my last visit he explained horrible great worms father fogden said shuddering violently in recollection a foot long some of them at least no more than eight inches stern corrected smiling he glanced at the nearest sheep his hand resting on his collecting bag as though in anticipation of further imminent contributions to science was the remedy i suggested effective father fogden looked vaguely doubtful as though trying to remember quite what the remedy had been the turpentine drench the naturalist prompted oh yes the sun broke out on the priests lean countenance and he beamed fondly upon us of course of course yes it worked splendidly a few of them died but the rest were quite cured capital entirely capital suddenly it seemed to dawn on father fogden that he was being less than hospitable but you must come in he said i was just about to partake of the midday meal i insist you must join me the priest turned to me this will be mrs stern will it mention of eightinch intestinal worms had momentarily suppressed my hunger pangs but at the mention of food they came gurgling back in full force no but we should be delighted to partake of your hospitality stern answered politely pray allow me to introduce my companiona mrs fraser a countrywoman of yours fogdens eyes grew quite round at this a pale blue with a tendency to water in bright sun they fixed wonderingly upon me an englishwoman he said disbelieving here the round eyes took in the mud and salt stains on my crumpled dress and my general air of disarray he blinked for a moment then stepped forward and with the utmost dignity bowed low over my hand your most obedient servant madame he said he rose and gestured grandly at the ruin on the hill mi casa es su casa he whistled sharply and a small king charles cavalier spaniel poked its face inquiringly out of the weeds we have a guest ludo the priest said beaming isnt that nice tucking my hand firmly under one elbow he took the sheep by its topknot of wool and towed us both toward the hacienda de la fuente leaving stern to follow the reason for the name became clear as we entered the dilapidated courtyard a tiny cloud of dragonflies hovered like blinking lights over an algaefilled pool in one corner it looked like a natural spring that someone had curbed in when the house was built at least a dozen jungle fowl sprang up from the shattered pavement and flapped madly past our feet leaving a small cloud of dust and feathers behind them from other evidences left behind i deduced that the trees overhanging the patio were their customary roost and had been for some time and so i was fortunate enough to encounter mrs fraser among the mangroves this morning stern concluded i thought that perhaps you mightoh look at that beauty a magnificent odonata a tone of amazed delight accompanied this last statement and he pushed unceremoniously past us to peer up into the shadows of the palmthatched patio roof where an enormous dragonfly at least four inches across was darting to and fro blue body catching fire when it crossed one of the errant rays of sunshine poking through the tattered roof oh do you want it be my guest our host waved a gracious hand at the dragonfly here becky trot in there and ill see to your hoof in a bit he shooed the ewe into the patio with a slap on the rump it snorted and galloped off a few feet then fell at once to browsing on the scattered fruit of a huge guava that overhung the ancient wall in fact the trees around the patio had grown up to such an extent that the branches at many points interlaced the whole of the courtyard seemed roofed with them a sort of leafy tunnel leading down the length of the patio into the gaping cavern of the houses entrance drifts of dust and the pink paper leaves of bougainvillaea lay heaped against the sill but just beyond the dark wood floor gleamed with polish bare and immaculate it was dark inside after the brilliance of the sunlight but my eyes quickly adapted to the surroundings and i looked around curiously it was a very plain room dark and cool furnished with no more than a long table a few stools and chairs and a small sideboard over which hung a hideous painting in the spanish stylean emaciated christ goateed and pallid in the gloom indicating with one skeletal hand the bleeding heart that throbbed in his chest this ghastly object so struck my eye that it was a moment before i realized there was someone else in the room the shadows in one corner of the room coalesced and a small round face emerged wearing an expression of remarkable malignity i blinked and took a step back the womanfor so she wastook a step forward black eyes fixed on me unblinking as the sheep she was no more than four feet tall and so thick through the body as to seem like a solid block without joint or indentation her head was a small round knob atop her body with the smaller knob of a sparse gray bun scraped tightly back behind it she was a light mahogany colorwhether from the sun or naturally i couldnt telland looked like nothing so much as a carved wooden doll an illwish doll mamacita said the priest speaking spanish to the graven image what good fortune we have guests who will eat with us you remember señor stern he added gesturing at lawrence sí claro said the image through invisible wooden lips the christkiller and who is the puta alba and this is señora fraser father fogden went on beaming as though she had not spoken the poor lady has had the misfortune to be shipwrecked we must assist her as much as we can mamacita looked me over slowly from top to toe she said nothing but the wide nostrils flared with infinite contempt your foods ready she said and turned away splendid the priest said happily mamacita welcomes you shell bring us some food wont you sit down the table was already laid with a large cracked plate and a wooden spoon the priest took two more plates and spoons from the sideboard and distributed them haphazardly about the table gesturing hospitably at us to be seated a large brown coconut sat on the chair at the head of the table fogden tenderly picked this up and set it alongside his plate the fibrous husk was darkened with age and the hair was worn off it in patches showing an almost polished appearance i thought he must have had it for some time hallo there he said patting it affectionately and how are you keeping this fine day coco i glanced at stern but he was studying the portrait of christ a small frown between his thick black brows i supposed it was up to me to open a conversation you live alone here mrah father fogden i inquired of our host you ander mamacita yes im afraid so thats why im so pleased to see you i havent any real company but ludo and coco you know he explained patting the hairy nut once more coco i said politely thinking that on the evidence to hand so far coco wasnt the only nut among those present i darted another glance at stern who looked mildly amused but not alarmed spanish for bugbearcoco the priest explained a hobgoblin see him there wee button nose and his dark little eyes fogden jabbed two long slender fingers suddenly into the depressions in the end of the coconut and jerked them back chortling ahah he cried mustnt stare coco its rude you know the pale blue eyes darted a piercing glance at me and with some difficulty i removed my teeth from my lower lip such a pretty lady he said as though to himself not like my ermenegilda but very pretty nonethelessisnt she ludo the dog thus addressed ignored me but bounded joyfully at its master shoving its head under his hand and barking he scratched its ears affectionately then turned his attention back to me would one of ermenegildas dresses fit you i wonder i didnt know whether to answer this or not instead i merely smiled politely and hoped what i was thinking didnt show on my face fortunately at this point mamacita came back carrying a steaming clay pot wrapped in towels she slapped a ladleful of the contents on each plate then went out her feetif she had anymoving invisibly beneath the shapeless skirt i stirred the mess on my plate which appeared to be vegetable in nature i took a cautious bite and found it surprisingly good fried plantain mixed with manioc and red beans lawrence explained seeing my hesitation he took a large spoonful of the steaming pulp himself and ate it without pausing for it to cool i had expected something of an inquisition about my presence identity and prospects instead father fogden was singing softly under his breath keeping time on the table with his spoon between bites i darted a glance at lawrence eyebrows up he merely smiled raised one shoulder in a slight shrug and bent to his own food no real conversation occurred until the conclusion of the meal when mamacitaunsmiling seemed an understatement of her expressionremoved the plates replacing them with a platter of fruit three cups and a gigantic clay pitcher have you ever drunk sangria mrs fraser i opened my mouth to say yes thought better of it and said no what is it sangria had been a popular drink in the s and i had had it many times at faculty parties and hospital social events but for now i was sure that it was unknown in england and scotland mrs fraser of edinburgh would never have heard of sangria a mixture of red wine and the juices of orange and lemon lawrence stern was explaining mulled with spices and served hot or cold depending upon the weather a most comforting and healthful beverage is it not fogden oh yes oh yes most comforting not waiting for me to find out for myself the priest drained his cup and reached for the pitcher before i had taken the first sip it was the same the same sweet throatrasping taste and i suffered the momentary illusion that i was back at the party where i had first tasted it in company with a marijuanasmoking graduate student and a professor of botany this illusion was fostered by sterns conversation which dealt with his collections and by father fogdens behavior after several cups of sangria he had risen rummaged through the sideboard and emerged with a large clay pipe this he packed full of a strongsmelling herb shaken out of a paper twist and proceeded to smoke hemp stern asked seeing this tell me do you find it settling to the digestive processes i have heard it is so but the herb is unobtainable in most european cities and i have no firsthand observations of its effect oh it is most genial and comforting to the stomach father fogden assured him he drew in a huge breath held it then exhaled long and dreamily blowing a stream of soft white smoke that floated in streamers of haze near the rooms low ceiling i shall send a packet home with you dear fellow do say now what do you mean doing you and this shipwrecked lady you have rescued stern explained his plan after a nights rest we intended to walk as far as the village of st luis du nord and from there see whether a fishing boat might carry us to caphaïtien thirty miles distant if not we would have to make our way overland to le cap the nearest port of any size the priests sketchy brows drew close together frowning against the smoke mm well i suppose there isnt much choice is there still you must go careful particularly if you go overland to le cap maroons you know maroons i glanced quizzically at stern who nodded frowning thats true i did meet with two or three small bands as i came north through the valley of the artibonite they didnt molest me thoughi daresay i looked little better off than they poor wretches the maroons are escaped slaves he explained to me having fled the cruelty of their masters they take refuge in the remote hills where the jungle hides them they might not trouble you father fogden said he sucked deeply on his pipe with a low slurping noise held his breath for a long count and then let it out reluctantly his eyes were becoming markedly bloodshot he closed one of them and examined me rather blearily with the other she doesnt look worth robbing really stern smiled broadly looking at me then quickly erased the smile as though feeling he had been less than tactful he coughed and took another cup of sangria the priests eyes gleamed over the pipe red as a ferrets i believe i need a little fresh air i said pushing back my chair and perhaps a little water to wash with oh of course of course father fogden cried he rose swaying unsteadily and thumped the coals from his pipe carelessly out onto the sideboard come with me the air in the patio seemed fresh and invigorating by comparison despite its mugginess i inhaled deeply looking on with interest as father fogden fumbled with a bucket by the fountain in the corner where does the water come from i asked is it a spring the stone trough was lined with soft tendrils of green algae and i could see these moving lazily evidently there was a current of some kind it was stern who answered yes there are hundreds of such springs some of them are said to have spirits living in thembut i do not suppose you subscribe to such superstition sir father fogden seemed to have to think about this he set the halffilled bucket down on the coping and squinted into the water trying to fix his gaze on one of the small silver fish that swam there ah he said vaguely well no spirits no stilloh yes i had forgotten i had something to show you going to a cupboard set into the wall he pulled open the cracked wooden door and removed a small bundle of coarse unbleached muslin which he put gingerly into sterns hands it came up in the spring one day last month he said it died when the noon sun struck it and i took it out im afraid the other fish nibbled it a bit he said apologetically but you can still see lying in the center of the cloth was a small dried fish much like those darting about in the spring save that this one was pure white it was also blind on either side of the blunt head there was a small swelling where an eye should have been but that was all do you think it is a ghost fish the priest inquired i thought of it when you mentioned spirits still i cant think what sort of sin a fish might have committed so as to be doomed to roam about like thateyeless i mean i meanhe closed one eye again in his favorite expressionone doesnt think of fish as having souls and yet if they dont how can they become ghosts i shouldnt think they do myself i assured him i peered more closely at the fish which stern was examining with the rapt joy of the born naturalist the skin was very thin and so transparent that the shadows of the internal organs and the knobbly line of the vertebrae were clearly visible yet it did have scales tiny and translucent though dulled by dryness it is a blind cave fish stern said reverently stroking the tiny blunt head i have seen one only once before in a pool deep inside a cave at a place called abandawe and that one escaped before i could examine it closely my dear fellow he turned to the priest eyes shining with excitement might i have it of course of course the priest fluttered his fingers in offhand generosity no use to me too small to eat you know even if mamacita would think of cooking it which she wouldnt he glanced around the patio kicking absently at a passing hen where is mamacita here cabrón where else i hadnt seen her come out of the house but there she was a dusty sunbrowned little figure stooping to fill another bucket from the spring a faintly musty unpleasant smell reached my nostrils and they twitched uneasily the priest must have noticed for he said oh you mustnt mind its only poor arabella arabella yes in here the priest held aside a ragged curtain of burlap that screened off a corner of the patio and i glanced behind it a ledge jutted out of the stone wall at waistheight on it were ranged a long row of sheeps skulls pure white and polished i cant bear to part with them you see father fogden gently stroked the heavy curve of a skull this was beatrizso sweet and gentle she died in lambing poor thing he indicated two much smaller skulls nearby shaped and polished like the rest arabella is aa sheep too i asked the smell was much stronger here and i thought i really didnt want to know where it was coming from at all a member of my flock yes certainly the priest turned his oddly bright blue eyes on me looking quite fierce she was murdered poor arabella such a gentle trusting soul how they can have had the wickedness to betray such innocence for the sake of carnal lusts oh dear i said rather inadequately im terribly sorry to hear that ahwho murdered her the sailors the wicked heathen killed her on the beach and roasted her poor body over a gridiron just like st lawrence the martyr heavens i said the priest sighed and his spindly beard appeared to droop with mourning yes i must not forget the hope of heaven for if our lord observes the fall of every sparrow he can scarcely have failed to observe arabella she must have weighed near on ninety pounds at least such a good grazer as she was poor child ah i said trying to infuse the remark with a suitable sympathy and horror it then occurred to me what the priest had said sailors i asked when did you say thisthis sad occurrence took place it couldnt be the porpoise i thought surely captain leonard would not have thought me so important that he had risked bringing his ship in so close to the island in order to pursue me but my hands grew damp at the thought and i wiped them unobtrusively on my robe this morning father fogden replied setting back the lambs skull he had picked up to fondle but he added his manner brightening a bit i must say theyre making wonderful progress with her it usually takes more than a week and already you can quite see he opened the cupboard again revealing a large lump covered with several layers of damp burlap the smell was markedly stronger now and a number of small brown beetles scuttled away from the light are those members of the dermestidae you have there fogden lawrence stern having tenderly committed the corpse of his cave fish to a jar of alcoholic spirits had come to join us he peered over my shoulder sunburned features creased in interest inside the cupboard the white maggot larvae of dermestid beetles were hard at work polishing the skull of arabella the sheep they had made a good start on the eyes the manioc shifted heavily in my stomach is that what they are i suppose so dear voracious little fellows the priest swayed alarmingly catching himself on the edge of the cupboard as he did so he finally noticed the old woman standing glaring at him a bucket in either hand oh i had quite forgotten you will be needing a change of clothing will you not mrs fraser i looked down at myself the dress and shift i was wearing were ripped in so many places that they were barely decent and so soaked and sodden with water and swampmud that i was scarcely tolerable even in such undemanding company as that of father fogden and lawrence stern father fogden turned to the graven image have we not something this unfortunate lady might wear mamacita he asked in spanish he seemed to hesitate swaying gently perhaps one of the dresses in the woman bared her teeth at me they are much too small for such a cow she said also in spanish give her your old robe if you must she cast an eye of scorn on my tangled hair and mudstreaked face come she said in english turning her back on me you wash she led me to a smaller patio at the back of the house where she provided me with two buckets of cold fresh water a worn linen towel and a small pot of soft soap smelling strongly of lye adding a shabby gray robe with a rope belt she bared her teeth at me again and left remarking genially in spanish wash away the blood on your hands christkilling whore i shut the patio gate after her with a considerable feeling of relief stripped off my sticky filthy clothes with even more relief and made my toilet as well as might be managed with cold water and no comb clad decently if oddly in father fogdens extra robe i combed out my wet hair with my fingers contemplating my peculiar host i wasnt sure whether the priests excursions into oddness were some form of dementia or only the side effects of longterm alcoholism and cannabis intoxication but he seemed a gentle kindly soul in spite of it his servantif thats what she waswas another question altogether mamacita made me more than slightly nervous mr stern had announced his intention of going down to the seaside to bathe and i was reluctant to go back into the house until he returned there had been quite a lot of sangria left and i suspected that father fogdenif he was still consciouswould be little protection by this time against that basilisk glare still i couldnt stay outside all afternoon i was very tired and wanted to sit down at least though i would have preferred to find a bed and sleep for a week there was a door opening into the house from my small patio i pushed it open and stepped into the dark interior i was in a small bedroom i looked around amazed it didnt seem part of the same house as the spartan main room and the shabby patios the bed was made up with feather pillows and a coverlet of soft red wool four huge patterned fans were spread like bright wings across the whitewashed walls and wax candles in a branched brass candelabrum sat on the table the furniture was simply but carefully made and polished with oil to a soft deep gloss a curtain of striped cotton hung across the end of the room it was pushed partway back and i could see a row of dresses hung on hooks behind it in a rainbow of silken color these must be ermenegildas dresses the ones that father fogden had mentioned i walked forward to look at them my bare feet quiet on the floor the room was dustless and clean but very quiet without the scent or vibration of human occupancy no one lived in this room anymore the dresses were beautiful all of silk and velvet moiré and satin mousseline and panne even hanging lifeless here from their hooks they had the sheen and beauty of an animals pelt where some essence of life lingers in the fur i touched one bodice purple velvet heavy with embroidered silver pansies centered with pearls she had been small this ermenegilda and slightly builtseveral of the dresses had ruffles and pads cleverly sewn inside the bodices to add to the illusion of a bust the room was comfortable though not luxurious the dresses were splendidthings that might have been worn at court in madrid ermenegilda was gone but the room still seemed inhabited i touched a sleeve of peacock blue in farewell and tiptoed away leaving the dresses to their dreams i found lawrence stern on the veranda at the back of the house overlooking a precipitous slope of aloe and guava in the distance a small humped island sat cradled in a sea of glimmering turquoise he rose in courtesy giving me a small bow and a look of surprise mrs fraser you are in greatly improved looks i must say the fathers robe suits you somewhat more than it does him he smiled at me hazel eyes creasing in a flattering expression of admiration i expect the absence of dirt has more to do with it i said sitting down in the chair he offered me is that something to drink there was a pitcher on the rickety wooden table between the chairs moisture had condensed in a heavy dew on the sides and droplets ran enticingly down the sides i had been thirsty so long that the sight of anything liquid automatically made my cheeks draw in with longing more sangria stern said he poured out a small cupful for each of us and sipped his own sighing with enjoyment i hope you will not think me intemperate mrs fraser but after months of tramping country drinking nothing but water and the slaves crude rum he closed his eyes in bliss ambrosia i was rather disposed to agree eris father fogden i hesitated looking for some tactful way of inquiring after our hosts state i neednt have bothered drunk stern said frankly limp as a worm laid out on the table in the sala he nearly always is by the time the suns gone down he added i see i settled back in the chair sipping my own sangria have you known father fogden long stern rubbed a hand over his forehead thinking oh for a few years he glanced at me i was wonderingdo you by chance know a james fraser from edinburgh i realize it is a common name butoh you do i hadnt spoken but my face had given me away as it always did unless i was carefully prepared to lie my husbands name is james fraser i said sterns face lighted with interest indeed he exclaimed and is he a very large fellow with red hair i agreed yes thats jamie something occurred to me he told me hed met a natural philosopher in edinburgh and had a most interesting conversation aboutvarious things what i was wondering was where stern had learned jamies real name most people in edinburgh would have known him only as jamie roy the smuggler or as alexander malcolm the respectable printer of carfax close surely dr stern with his distinct german accent couldnt be the englishman tompkins had spoken of spiders stern said promptly yes i recall perfectly spiders and caves we met in aa his face went blank for a moment then he coughed masterfully covering the lapse in a um drinking establishment one of theah female employees happened to encounter a large specimen of arachmida hanging from the ceiling in herthat is from the ceiling as she was engaged inah conversation with me being somewhat frightened in consequence she burst into the passageway shrieking incoherently stern took a large gulp of sangria as a restorative evidently finding the memory stressful i had just succeeded in capturing the animal and securing it in a specimen jar when mr fraser burst into the room pointed a species of firearm at me and said here stern developed a prolonged coughing fit pounding himself vigorously on the chest eheu do you not find this particular pitcher perhaps a trifle strong mrs fraser i suspect that the old woman has added too many sliced lemons i suspected that mamacita would have added cyanide had she any to hand but in fact the sangria was excellent i hadnt noticed i said sipping but do go on jamie came in with a pistol and said oh well in fact i cannot say i recall precisely what was said there appeared to have been a slight misapprehension owing to his impression that the ladys outcry was occasioned by some inopportune motion or speech of my own rather than by the arachnid fortunately i was able to display the beast to him whereupon the lady was induced to come so far as the doorwe could not persuade her to enter the room againand identify it as the cause of her distress i see i said i could envision the scene very well indeed save for one point of paramount interest do you happen to recall what he was wearing jamie lawrence stern looked blank wearing whyno my impression is that he was clad for the street rather than in dishabille but thats quite all right i assured him i only wondered clad after all was the operative word so he introduced himself to you stern frowned running a hand through his thick black curls i dont believe he did as i recall the lady referred to him as mr fraser sometime later in the conversationwe availed ourselves of suitable refreshment and remained conversing nearly until the dawn finding considerable interest in each others company you see at some point he invited me to address him by his given name he raised one eyebrow sardonically i trust you do not think it overfamiliar of me to have done so upon such brief acquaintance no no of course not wanting to change the subject i continued you said you talked about spiders and caves why caves by way of robert the bruce and the storywhich your husband was inclined to think apocryphalregarding his inspiration to persevere in his quest for the throne of scotland presumably the bruce was in hiding in a cave pursued by his enemies and yes i know the story i interrupted it was jamess opinion that spiders do not frequent caves in which humans dwell an opinion with which i basically concurred though pointing out that in the larger type of cave such as occurs on this island there are caves here i was surprised and then felt foolish but of course there must be if there are cave fish like the one in the spring i always thought caribbean islands were made of coral though i shouldnt have thought youd find caves in coral well it is possible though not highly likely stern said judiciously however the island of hispaniola is not a coral atoll but is basically volcanic in originwith the addition of crystalline schists fossiliferous sedimentary deposits of a considerable antiquity and widespread deposits of limestone the limestone is particularly karstic in spots you dont say i poured a fresh cup of spiced wine oh yes lawrence leaned over to pick up his bag from the floor of the veranda pulling out a notebook he tore a sheet of paper from it and crumpled it in his fist there he said holding out his hand the paper slowly unfolded itself leaving a mazed topography of creases and crumpled peaks that is what this island is likeyou remember what father fogden was saying about the maroons the runaway slaves who have taken refuge in these hills it is not lack of pursuit on the part of their masters that allows them to vanish with such ease there are many parts of this island where no manwhite or black i daresayhas yet set foot and in the lost hills there are caves still more lost whose existence no one knows save perhaps the aboriginal inhabitants of this placeand they are long gone mrs fraser i have seen one such cave he added reflectively abandawe the maroons call it they consider it a most sinister and sacred spot though i do not know why encouraged by my close attention he took another gulp of sangria and continued his natural history lecture now that small islandhe nodded at the floating island visible in the sea beyondthat is the ile de la tortuetortuga that one is in fact a coral atoll its lagoon long since filled in by the actions of the coral animalculae did you know it was once the haunt of pirates he asked apparently feeling that he ought to infuse his lecture with something of more general interest than karstic formations and crystalline schists real pirates buccaneers you mean i viewed the little island with more interest thats rather romantic stern laughed and i glanced at him in surprise i am not laughing at you mrs fraser he assured me a smile lingered on his lips as he gestured at the ile de la tortue it is merely that i had occasion once to talk with an elderly resident of kingston regarding the habits of the buccaneers who had at one point made their headquarters in the nearby village of port royal he pursed his lips decided to speak decided otherwise then with a sideways glance at me decided to risk it you will pardon the indelicacy mrs fraser but as you are a married woman and as i understand have some familiarity with the practice of medicine he paused and might have stopped there but he had drunk nearly twothirds of the pitcher the broad pleasant face was deeply flushed you have perhaps heard of the abominable practices of sodomy he asked looking at me sideways i have i said do you mean i assure you he said with a magisterial nod my informant was most discursive upon the habits of the buccaneers sodomites to a man he said shaking his head what it was a matter of public knowledge he said my informant told me that when port royal fell into the sea some sixty years ago it was widely assumed to be an act of divine vengeance upon these wicked persons in retribution for their vile and unnatural usages gracious i said i wondered what the voluptuous tessa of the impetuous pirate would have thought about this he nodded solemn as an owl they say you can hear the bells of the drowned churches of port royal when a storm is coming ringing for the souls of the damned pirates i thought of inquiring further into the precise nature of the vile and unnatural usages but at this point in the proceedings mamacita stumped out onto the veranda said curtly food and disappeared again i wonder which cave father fogden found her in i said shoving back my chair stern glanced at me in surprise found her but i forgot he said face clearing you dont know he peered at the open door where the old woman had vanished but the interior of the house was quiet and dark as a cave he found her in habana he said and told me the rest of the story father fogden had been a priest for ten years a missionary of the order of st anselm when he had come to cuba fifteen years before devoted to the needs of the poor he had worked among the slums and stews of habana for several years thinking of nothing more than the relief of suffering and the love of goduntil the day he met ermenegilda ruiz alcantara y meroz in the marketplace i dont suppose he knows even now how it happened stern said he wiped away a drop of wine that ran down the side of his cup and drank again perhaps she didnt know either or perhaps she planned it from the moment she saw him in any case six months later the city of habana was agog at the news that the young wife of don armando alcantara had run awaywith a priest and her mother i said under my breath but he heard me and smiled slightly ermenegilda would never leave mamacita behind he said nor her dog ludo they would never have succeeded in escapingfor the reach of don armando was long and powerfulsave for the fact that the english conveniently chose the day of their elopement to invade the island of cuba and don armando had many things more important to worry him than the whereabouts of his runaway young wife the fugitives rode to bayamomuch hampered by ermenegildas dresses with which she would not partand there hired a fishing boat which carried them to safety on hispaniola she died two years later stern said abruptly he set down his cup and refilled it from the sweating pitcher he buried her himself under the bougainvillaea and here theyve stayed since i said the priest and ludo and mamacita oh yes stern closed his eyes his profile dark against the setting sun ermenegilda would not leave mamacita and mamacita will never leave ermenegilda he tossed back the rest of his cup of sangria no one comes here he said the villagers wont set foot on the hill theyre afraid of ermenegildas ghost a damned sinner buried by a reprobate priest in unhallowed groundof course she will not lie quiet the sea breeze was cool on the back of my neck behind us even the chickens in the patio had grown quiet with falling twilight the hacienda de la fuente lay still you come i said and he smiled the scent of oranges rose up from the empty cup in my hands sweet as bridal flowers ah well he said i am a scientist i dont believe in ghosts he extended a hand to me somewhat unsteadily shall we dine mrs fraser after breakfast the next morning stern was ready to set off for st luis before leaving though i had a question or two about the ship the priest had mentioned if it were the porpoise i wanted to steer clear of it what sort of ship was it i asked pouring a cup of goats milk to go with the breakfast of fried plantain father fogden apparently little the worse for his excesses of the day before was stroking his coconut humming dreamily to himself ah he said startled out of his reverie by sterns poking him in the ribs i patiently repeated my query oh he squinted in deep thought then his face relaxed a wooden one lawrence bent his broad face over his plate hiding a smile i took a breath and tried again the sailors who killed arabelladid you see them his narrow brows rose well of course i saw them how else would i know they had done it i seized on this evidence of logical thought naturally and did you see what they were wearing i meani saw him opening his mouth to say clothes and hastily forestalled himdid they seem to be wearing any sort of uniform the crew of the porpoise commonly wore slops when not performing any ceremonial duty but even these rough clothes bore the semblance of a uniform being mostly all of a dirty white and similar in cut father fogden laid down his cup leaving a milky mustache across his upper lip he brushed at this with the back of his hand frowning and shaking his head no i think not all i recall of them though is that the leader wore a hookmissing a hand i mean he waggled his own long fingers at me in illustration i dropped my cup which exploded on the tabletop stern sprang up with an exclamation but the priest sat still watching in surprise as a thin white stream ran across the table and into his lap whatever did you do that for he said reproachfully im sorry i said my hands were trembling so that i couldnt even manage to pick up the shards of the shattered cup i was afraid to ask the next question fatherhas the ship sailed away why no he said looking up in surprise from his damp robe how could it its on the beach father fogden led the way his skinny shanks a gleaming white as he kirtled his cassock about his thighs i was obliged to do the same for the hillside above the house was thick with grass and thorny shrubs that caught at the coarse wool skirts of my borrowed robe the hill was crisscrossed with sheep paths but these were narrow and faint losing themselves under the trees and disappearing abruptly in thick grass the priest seemed confident about his destination though and scampered briskly through the vegetation never looking back i was breathing hard by the time we reached the crest of the hill even though lawrence stern had gallantly assisted me pushing branches out of my way and taking my arm to haul me up the steeper slopes do you think there really is a ship i said to him lowvoiced as we approached the top of the hill given our hosts behavior so far i wasnt so sure he might not have imagined it just to be sociable stern shrugged wiping a trickle of sweat that ran down his bronzed cheek i suppose there will be something there he replied after all there is a dead sheep a qualm ran over me in memory of the late departed arabella someone had killed the sheep and i walked as quietly as i could as we approached the top of the hill it couldnt be the porpoise none of her officers or men wore a hook i tried to tell myself that it likely wasnt the artemis either but my heart beat still faster as we came to a stand of giant agave on the crest of the hill i could see the caribbean glowing blue through the succulents branches and a narrow strip of white beach father fogden had come to a halt beckoning us to his side there they are the wicked creatures he muttered his blue eyes glittered bright with fury and his scanty hair fairly bristled like a motheaten porcupine butchers he said hushed but vehement as though talking to himself cannibals i gave him a startled look but then lawrence stern grasped my arm drawing me to a wider opening between two trees oy there is a ship he said there was it was lying tilted on its side drawn up on the beach its masts unstepped untidy piles of cargo sails rigging and water casks scattered all about it men crawled over the beached carcass like ants shouts and hammer blows rang out like gunshots and the smell of hot pitch was thick on the air the unloaded cargo gleamed dully in the sun copper and tin slightly tarnished by the sea air tanned hides had been laid flat on the sand brown stiff blotches drying in the sun it is them its the artemis the matter was settled by the appearance near the hull of a squat onelegged figure head shaded from the sun by a gaudy kerchief of yellow silk murphy i shouted fergus jamie i broke from sterns grasp and ran down the far side of the hill his cry of caution disregarded in the excitement of seeing the artemis murphy whirled at my shout but was unable to get out of my way carried by momentum and moving like a runaway freight i crashed straight into him knocking him flat murphy i said and kissed him caught up in the joy of the moment hoy he said shocked he wriggled madly trying to get out from under me milady fergus appeared at my side crumpled and vivid his beautiful smile dazzling in a sundark face milady he helped me off the grunting murphy then grabbed me to him in a ribcracking hug marsali appeared behind him a broad smile on her face merci aux les saints he said in my ear i was afraid we would never see you again he kissed me heartily himself on both cheeks and the mouth then released me at last i glanced at the artemis lying on her side on the beach like a stranded beetle what on earth happened fergus and marsali exchanged a glance it was the sort of look in which questions are asked and answered and it rather startled me to see the depths of intimacy between them fergus drew a deep breath and turned to me captain raines is dead he said the storm that had come upon me during my night in the mangrove swamp had also struck the artemis carried far off her path by the howling wind she had been forced over a reef tearing a sizable hole in her bottom still she had remained afloat the aft hold filling rapidly she had limped toward the small inlet that opened so near offering shelter we were no more than three hundred yards from the shore when the accident happened fergus said his face drawn by the memory the ship had heeled suddenly over as the contents of the aft hold had shifted beginning to float and just then an enormous wave coming from the sea had struck the leaning ship washing across the tilting quarterdeck and carrying away captain raines and four seamen with him the shore was so near marsali said her face twisted with distress we were aground ten minutes later if only fergus stopped her with a hand on her arm we cannot guess gods ways he said it would have been the same if we had been a thousand miles at sea save that we would not have been able to give them decent burial he nodded toward the far edge of the beach near the jungle where five small mounds topped with crude wooden crosses marked the final resting places of the drowned men i had some holy water that da brought me from notre dame in paris marsali said her lips were cracked and she licked them in a little bottle i said a prayer and sprinkled it on the graves dyedye think they would have lliked that i caught the quaver in her voice and realized that for all her selfpossession the last two days had been a terrifying ordeal for the girl her face was grimy her hair coming down and the sharpness was gone from her eyes softened by tears im sure they would i said gently patting her arm i glanced at the faces crowding around searching for jamies great height and fiery head even as the realization dawned that he was not there where is jamie i said my face was flushed from the run down the hill i felt the blood begin to drain from my cheeks as a trickle of fear rose in my veins fergus was staring at me lean face mirroring mine he is not with you he said no how could he be the sun was blinding but my skin felt cold i could feel the heat shimmer over me but to no effect my lips were so chilled i could scarcely form the question where is he fergus shook his head slowly back and forth like an ox stunned by the slaughterers blow i dont know in which jamie smells a rat jamie fraser lay in the shadows under the porpoises jolly boat chest heaving with effort getting aboard the manofwar without being seen had been no small task his right side was bruised from being slammed against the side of the ship as he hung from the boarding nets struggling to pull himself up to the rail his arms felt as though they had been jerked from their sockets and there was a large splinter in one hand but he was here and so far unseen he chewed delicately at his palm groping for the end of the splinter with his teeth as he got his bearings russo and stone artemis hands who had served aboard menofwar had spent hours describing to him the structure of a large ship the compartments and decks and the probable location of the surgeons quarters hearing something described and being able to find your way about in it were two different things though at least the miserable thing rocked less than the artemis though he could still feel the subtle nauseating heave of the deck beneath him the end of the splinter worked free nipping it between his teeth he drew it slowly out and spat it on the deck he sucked the tiny wound tasting blood and slid cautiously out from under the jolly boat ears pricked to catch the sound of an approaching footstep the deck below this one down the forward companionway the officers quarters would be there and with luck the surgeons cabin as well not that she was likely to be in her quarters not her shed cared enough to come tend the sickshe would be with them he had waited until dark to have robbie macrae row him out raines had told him that the porpoise would likely weigh anchor with the evening tide two hours from now if he could find claire and escape over the side before thathe could swim ashore with her easilythe artemis would be waiting for them concealed in a small cove on the other side of caicos island if he couldntwell he would deal with that when he came to it fresh from the cramped small world of the artemis the belowdecks of the porpoise seemed huge and sprawling a shadowed warren he stood still nostrils flaring as he deliberately drew the fetid air deep into his lungs there were all the nasty stenches associated with a ship at sea for a long time overlaid with the faint floating stink of feces and vomit he turned to the left and began to walk softly long nose twitching where the smell of sickness was the strongest that was where he would find her four hours later in mounting desperation he made his way aft for the third time he had covered the entire shipkeeping out of sight with some difficultyand claire was nowhere to be found bloody woman he said under his breath where have ye gone ye fashious wee hidee a small worm of fear gnawed at the base of his heart she had said her vaccine would protect her from the sickness but what if she had been wrong he could see for himself that the manofwars crew had been badly diminished by the deadly sicknesskneedeep in it the germs might have attacked her too vaccine or not he thought of germs as small blind things about the size of maggots but equipped with vicious razor teeth like tiny sharks he could all too easily imagine a swarm of the things fastening onto her killing her draining her flesh of life it was just such a vision that had made him pursue the porpoisethat and a murderous rage toward the english buggerer who had had the filtheating insolence to steal away his wife beneath his very nose with a vague promise to return her once theyd made use of her leave her to the sassenachs unprotected not bloody likely he muttered under his breath dropping down into a dark cargo space she wouldnt be in such a place of course but he must think a moment what to do was this the cable tier the aft cargo hatch the forward stinking god knew what christ he hated boats he drew in a deep breath and stopped surprised there were animals here goats he could smell them plainly there was also a light dimly visible around the edge of a bulkhead and the murmur of voices was one of them a womans voice he edged forward listening there were feet on the deck above a patter and thump that he recognized bodies dropping from the rigging had someone above seen him well and if they had it was no crime so far as he knew for a man to come seeking his wife the porpoise was asail he had felt the thrum of the sails passing through the wood all the way to the keel as she took the wind they had long since missed the rendezvous with the artemis that being so there was likely nothing to lose by appearing boldly before the captain and demanding to see claire but perhaps she was hereit was a womans voice it was a womans figure too silhouetted against the lanterns light but the woman wasnt claire his heart leapt convulsively at the gleam of the light on her hair but then fell at once as he saw the thick square shape of the woman by the goat pen there was a man with her as jamie watched the man bent and picked up a basket he turned and came toward jamie he stepped into the narrow aisle between the bulkheads blocking the seamans way here what do you mean the man began and then raising his eyes to jamies face stopped gasping one eye was fixed on him in horrified recognition the other showed only as a bluishwhite crescent beneath the withered lid god preserve us the seaman said what are you doing here the seamans face gleamed pale and jaundiced in the dim light ye ken me do ye jamies heart was hammering against his ribs but he kept his voice level and low i have not the honor to know your own name i think i should prefer to leave that particular circumstance unchanged your honor if youve no objection the oneeyed seaman began to edge backward but was forestalled as jamie gripped his arm hard enough to elicit a small yelp not quite so fast if ye please where is mrs malcolm the surgeon it would have been difficult for the seaman to look more alarmed but at this question he managed it i dont know he said you do jamie said sharply and yell tell me this minute or i shall break your neck well now i cant be tellin you anything if you break my neck can i the seaman pointed out beginning to recover his nerve he lifted his chin pugnaciously over his basket of manure now you leave go of me or ill call the rest was lost in a squawk as a large hand fastened about his neck and began inexorably to squeeze the basket fell to the deck and balls of goat manure exploded out of it like shrapnel ak harry tompkinss legs thrashed wildly scattering goat dung in every direction his face turned the color of a beetroot as he clawed ineffectually at jamies arm judging the results clinically jamie let go as the mans eye began to bulge he wiped his hand on his breeches disliking the greasy feel of the mans sweat on his palm tompkins lay on the deck in a sprawl of limbs wheezing faintly yere quite right jamie said on the other hand if i break your arm i expect youll still be able to speak to me aye he bent grasped the man by one skinny arm and jerked him to his feet twisting the arm roughly behind his back ill tell you ill tell you the seaman wriggled madly panicked damn you youre as wicked cruel as she was was what do you mean was jamies heart squeezed tight in his chest and he jerked the arm more roughly than he had meant to do tompkins let out a screech of pain and jamie slackened the pressure slightly let go ill tell you but for pitys sake let go jamie lessened his grasp but didnt let go tell me where my wife is he said in a tone that had made stronger men than harry tompkins fall over their feet to obey shes lost the man blurted gone overboard what he was so stunned that he let go his hold overboard gone overboard lost when he demanded how damn you tell me what happened he advanced on the seaman fists clenched the seaman was backing away rubbing his arm and panting a look of furtive satisfaction in his one eye dont worry your honor he said a queer jeering tone in his voice you wont be lonesome long youll join her in hell in a few daysdancing from the yardarm over kingston harbor too late jamie heard the footfall on the boards behind him he had no time even to turn his head before the blow fell he had been struck in the head frequently enough to know that the sensible thing was to lie still until the giddiness and the lights that pulsed behind your eyelids with each heartbeat stopped sit up too soon and the pain made you vomit the deck was rising and falling rising and falling under him in the horrible way of ships he kept his eyes tight closed concentrating on the knotted ache at the base of his skull in order not to think of his stomach ship he should be on a ship yes but the surface under his cheek was wronghard wood not the linen of his berths bedding and the smell the smell was wrong it was he shot bolt upright memory shooting through him with a vividness that made the pain in his head pale by comparison the darkness moved queasily around him blinking with colored lights and his stomach heaved he closed his eyes and swallowed hard trying to gather his scattered wits about the single appalling thought that had lanced through his brain like a spit through mutton claire lost drowned dead he leaned to the side and threw up he retched and coughed as though his body was trying forcibly to expel the thought it didnt work when he finally stopped leaning against the bulkhead in exhaustion it was still with him it hurt to breathe and he clenched his fists on his thighs trembling there was the sound of a door opening and bright light struck him in the eyes with the force of a blow he winced closing his eyes against the glare of the lantern mr fraser a soft wellbred voice said i amtruly sorry i wish you to know that at least through a cracked eyelid he saw the drawn harried face of young leonardthe man who had taken claire the man wore a look of regret regret regret for killing her fury pulled him up against the weakness and sent him lunging across the slanted deck in an instant there was an outcry as he hit leonard and bore him backward into the passage and a good juicy thunk as the buggers head hit the boards people were shouting and shadows leapt crazily all round him as the lanterns swayed but he paid no attention he smashed leonards jaw with one great blow his nose with the next the weakness mattered nothing he would spend all his strength and die here glad but let him batter and maim now feel the bones crack and the blood hot and slick on his fists blessed michael let him avenge her first there were hands on him snatching and jerking but they didnt matter they would kill him now he thought dimly and that didnt matter either the body under him jerked and twitched between his legs and lay still when the next blow came he went willingly into the dark the light touch of fingers on his face awakened him he reached drowsily up to take her hand and his palm touched aaaah with an instinctive revulsion he was on his feet clawing at his face the big spider nearly as frightened as he was made off toward the shrubbery at high speed long hairy legs no more than a blur there was an outburst of giggling behind him he turned around his heart pounding like a drum and found six children roosting in the branches of a big green tree all grinning down at him with tobaccostained teeth he bowed to them feeling dizzy and rubberlegged the start of fright that had got him up now dying in his blood mesdemoiselles messieurs he said croaking and in the halfawake recesses of his brain wondered what had made him speak to them in french had he halfheard them speaking as he lay asleep french they were for they answered him in that language strongly laced with a gutteral sort of creole accent that he had never heard before vous êtes matelot the biggest boy asked eyeing him with interest his knees gave way and he sat down on the ground suddenly enough to make the children laugh again non he replied struggling to make his tongue work je suis guerrier his mouth was dry and his head ached like a fiend faint memories swam about in the parritch that filled his head too vague to grasp a soldier exclaimed one of the smaller children his eyes were round and dark as sloes where is your sword and pistola eh dont be silly an older girl told him loftily how could he swim with a pistola it would be ruined dont you know any better guavahead dont call me that the smaller boy shouted face contorting in rage shitface frogguts cacabrains the children were scrabbling through the branches like monkeys screaming and chasing each other jamie rubbed a hand hard over his face trying to think mademoiselle he caught the eye of the older girl and beckoned to her she hesitated for a moment then dropped from her branch like a ripe fruit landing on the ground before him in a puff of yellow dust she was barefoot wearing nothing but a muslin shift and a colored kerchief round her dark curly hair monsieur you seem a woman of some knowledge mademoiselle he said tell me please what is the name of this place caphaïtien she replied promptly she eyed him with considerable curiosity you talk funny she said i am thirsty is there water nearby caphaïtien so he was on the island of hispaniola his mind was slowly beginning to function again he had a vague memory of terrible effort of swimming for his life in a frothing cauldron of heaving waves and rain pelting his face so hard that it made little difference whether his head was above or below the surface and what else this way this way the other children had dropped out of the tree and a little girl was tugging his hand urging him to follow he knelt by the little stream splashing water over his head gulping delicious cool handfuls while the children scampered over the rocks pelting each other with mud now he rememberedthe ratfaced seaman and leonards surprised young face the deepred rage and the satisfying feel of flesh crushed against bone under his fist and claire the memory came back suddenly with a sense of confused emotionloss and terror succeeded by relief what had happened he stopped what he was doing not hearing the questions the children were flinging at him are you a deserter one of the boys asked again have you been in a fight the boys eyes rested curiously on his hands his knuckles were cut and swollen and his hands ached badly the fourth finger felt as though he had cracked it again yes he said absently his mind occupied everything was coming back the dark stuffy confines of the brig where they had left him to wake and the dreadful waking to the thought that claire was dead he had huddled there on the bare boards too shaken with grief to notice at first the increasing heave and roll of the ship or the highpitched whine of the rigging loud enough to filter down even to his oubliette but after a time the motion and noise were great enough to penetrate even the cloud of grief he had heard the sounds of the growing storm and the shouts and running overhead and then was much too occupied to think of anything there was nothing in the small room with him nothing to hold to he had bounced from wall to wall like a dried pea in a weans rattle unable to tell up from down right from left in the heaving dark and not much caring either as waves of seasickness rolled through his body he had thought then of nothing but death and that with a fervor of longing he had been nearly unconscious in fact when the door to his prison had opened and a strong smell of goat assailed his nostrils he had no idea how the woman had got him up the ladder to the afterdeck or why he had only a confused memory of her babbling urgently to him in broken english as she pulled him along halfsupporting his weight as he stumbled and slid on the rainwet decking he remembered the last thing she had said though as she pushed him toward the tilting taffrail she is not dead the woman had said she go therepointing at the rolling seayou go too find her and then she had bent got a hand in his crutch and a sturdy shoulder under his rump and heaved him neatly over the rail and into the churning water you are not an englishman the boy was saying its an english ship though isnt it he turned automatically to look where the boy pointed and saw the porpoise riding at anchor far out in the shallow bay other ships were scattered throughout the harbor all clearly visible from this vantage point on a hill just outside the town yes he said to the boy an english ship one for me the boy exclaimed happily he turned to shout to another lad jacques i was right english thats four for me and only two for you this month three jacques corrected indignantly i get spanish and portuguese bruja was portuguese so i can count that too jamie reached out and caught the older boys arm pardon monsieur he said your friend said bruja yes she was in last week the boy answered is bruja a portuguese name though we werent sure whether to count it spanish or portuguese some of the sailors were in my mamans taverna one of the little girls chimed in they sounded like they were talking spanish but it wasnt like uncle geraldo talks i think i should like to talk to your maman chèrie he said to the little girl do any of you know perhaps where this bruja was going when she left bridgetown the oldest girl put in promptly trying to regain his attention i heard the clerk at the garrison say so the garrison the barracks are next door to my mamans taverna the smaller girl chimed in tugging at his sleeve the ship captains all go there with their papers while the sailors get drunk come come maman will feed you if i tell her to i think your maman will throw me out the door he told her rubbing a hand across the heavy stubble on his chin i look like a vagabond he did there were stains of blood and vomit on his clothes despite the swim and he knew by the feel of his face that it was bruised and bloodshot maman has seen much worse than you the little girl assured him come on he smiled and thanked her and allowed them to lead him down the hill staggering slightly as his land legs had not yet returned he found it odd but somehow comforting that the children should not be frightened of him horrible as he no doubt looked was this what the goatwoman had meant that claire had swum ashore on this island he felt a welling of hope that was as refreshing to his heart as the water had been to his parched throat claire was stubborn reckless and had a great deal more courage than was safe for a woman but she was by no means such a fool as to fall off a manofwar by accident and the brujaand ianwere nearby he would find them both then the fact that he was barefoot penniless and a fugitive from the royal navy seemed of no consequence he had his wits and his hands and with dry land once more beneath his feet all things seemed possible a wedding takes place there was nothing to be done but to repair the artemis as quickly as possible and make sail for jamaica i did my best to put aside my fear for jamie but i scarcely ate for the next two days my appetite impeded by the large ball of ice that had taken up residence in my stomach for distraction i took marsali up to the house on the hill where she succeeded in charming father fogden by recallingand mixing for hima scottish receipt for a sheepdip guaranteed to destroy ticks stern helpfully pitched in with the labor of repair delegating to me the guardianship of his specimen bag and charging me with the task of searching the nearby jungle for any curious specimens of arachnida that might come to hand as i looked for medicinal plants while thinking privately that i would prefer to meet any of the larger specimens of arachnida with a good stout boot rather than my bare hands i accepted the charge peering into the internal waterfilled cups of bromeliads in search of the brightcolored frogs and spiders who inhabited these tiny worlds i returned from one of these expeditions on the afternoon of the third day with several large lilyroots some shelf fungus of a vivid orange and an unusual moss together with a live tarantulacarefully trapped in one of the sailors stocking caps and held at arms lengthlarge and hairy enough to send lawrence into paroxysms of delight when i emerged from the jungles edge i saw that we had reached a new stage of progress the artemis was no longer canted on her side but was slowly regaining an upright position on the sand assisted by ropes wedges and a great deal of shouting its nearly finished then i asked fergus who was standing near the stern doing a good bit of the shouting as he instructed his crew in the placement of wedges he turned to me grinning and wiping the sweat from his forehead yes milady the caulking is complete mr warren gives it as his opinion that we may launch the ship near evening when the day is grown cool so the tar is hardened thats marvelous i craned my neck back looking up at the naked mast that towered high above have we got sails oh yes he assured me in fact we have everything except a shout of alarm from macleod interrupted whatever he had been about to say i whirled to look toward the distant road out of the palmettos where the sun winked off the glint of metal soldiers fergus reacted faster than anyone leaping from the scaffolding to land in a thudding spray of sand beside me quick milady to the wood marsali he shouted looking wildly about for the girl he licked sweat from his upper lip eyes darting from the jungle to the approaching soldiers marsali he shouted once more marsali appeared round the edge of the hull pale and startled fergus grasped her by the arm and shoved her toward me go with milady run i snatched marsalis hand and ran for the forest sand spurting beneath our feet there were shouts from the road behind us and a shot cracked overhead followed by another ten steps five and then we were in the shadow of the trees i collapsed behind the shelter of a thorny bush gasping for breath against the stabbing pain of a stitch in my side marsali knelt on the earth beside me her cheeks streaked with tears what she gasped struggling for breath who are they whatwill theydo to fergus what i dont know still breathing heavily i grasped a cedar sapling and pulled myself to my knees peering through the underbrush on all fours i could see that the soldiers had reached the ship it was cool and damp under the trees but the lining of my mouth was dry as cotton i bit the inside of my cheek trying to encourage a little saliva to flow i think it will be all right i patted marsalis shoulder trying to be reassuring look there are only ten of them i whispered counting as the last soldier trotted out of the palmetto grove theyre french the artemis has french papers it may be all right and then again it might not i was well aware that a ship aground and abandoned was legal salvage it was a deserted beach and all that stood between these soldiers and a rich prize were the lives of the artemiss crew a few of the seamen had pistols to hand most had knives but the soldiers were armed to the teeth each man with musket sword and pistols if it came to a fight it would be a bloody one but the odds were heavily on the mounted soldiers the men near the ship were silent grouped close together behind fergus who stood out straightbacked and grim as the spokesman i saw him push back his shock of hair with his hook and plant his feet solidly in the sand ready for whatever might come the creak and jingle of harness seemed muted in the damp hot air and the horses moved slowly hooves muffled in the sand the soldiers came to a halt ten feet away from the little knot of seamen a big man who seemed to be in command raised one hand in an order to stay and swung down from his horse i was watching fergus rather than the soldiers i saw his face change then freeze white under his tan i glanced quickly at the soldier coming toward him across the sand and my own blood froze silence mes amis said the big man in a voice of pleasant command silence et restez sil vous plaît silence my friends and do not move if you please i would have fallen were i not already on my knees i closed my eyes in a wordless prayer of thanksgiving next to me marsali gasped i opened my eyes and clapped a hand over her open mouth the commander took off his hat and shook out a thick mass of sweatsoaked auburn hair he grinned at fergus teeth white and wolfish in a short curly red beard you are in charge here jamie said in french you come with me the resthe nodded at the crew several of whom were goggling at him in open amazementyou stay where you are dont talk he added offhandedly marsali jerked at my arm and i realized how tightly i had been holding her sorry i whispered letting go but not taking my eyes from the beach what is he doing marsali hissed in my ear her face was pale with excitement and the little freckles left by the sun stood out on her nose in contrast how did he get here i dont know be quiet for gods sake the crew of the artemis exchanged glances waggled their eyebrows and nudged each other in the ribs but fortunately also obeyed orders and didnt speak i hoped to heaven that their obvious excitement would be construed merely as consternation over their impending fate jamie and fergus had walked over toward the shore conferring in low voices now they separated fergus coming back toward the hull with an expression of grim determination jamie calling the soldiers to dismount and gather round him i couldnt tell what jamie was saying to the soldiers but fergus was close enough for us to hear these are soldiers from the garrison at caphaïtien he announced to the crew members their commandercaptain alessandro he said lifting his eyebrows and grimacing hideously to emphasize the name says that they will assist us in launching the artemis this announcement was greeted with faint cheers from some of the men and looks of bewilderment from others but how did mr fraser began royce a rather slowwitted seaman his heavy brows drawn together in a puzzled frown fergus allowed no time for questions but plunged into the midst of the crew putting an arm about royces shoulders and dragging him toward the scaffolding talking loudly to drown out any untoward remarks yes is it not a most fortunate accident he said loudly i could see that he was twisting royces ear with his sound hand most fortunate indeed captain alessandro says that a habitant on his way from his plantation saw the ship aground and reported it to the garrison with so much help we will have the artemis aswim in no time at all he let go of royce and clapped his hand sharply against his thigh come come let us set to work at once manzettiup you go macleod macgregor seize your hammers maitland he spotted maitland standing on the sand gawking at jamie fergus whirled and clapped the cabin boy on the back hard enough to make him stagger maitland mon enfant give us a song to speed our efforts looking rather dazed maitland began a tentative rendition of the nutbrown maid a few of the seamen began to climb back onto the scaffolding glancing suspiciously over their shoulders sing fergus bellowed glaring up at them murphy who appeared to be finding something extremely funny mopped his sweating red face and obligingly joined in the song his wheezing bass reinforcing maitlands pure tenor fergus stalked up and down beside the hull exhorting directing urgingand making such a spectacle of himself that few telltale glances went in jamies direction the uncertain tap of hammers started up again meanwhile jamie was giving careful directions to his soldiers i saw more than one frenchman glance at the artemis as he talked with a look of dimly concealed greed that suggested that a selfless desire to help their fellow beings was perhaps not the motive uppermost in the soldiers minds no matter what fergus had announced still the soldiers went to work willingly enough stripping off their leather jerkins and laying aside most of their arms three of the soldiers i noticed did not join the work party but remained on guard fully armed eyes sharp on the sailors every move jamie alone remained aloof watching everything should we come out marsali murmured in my ear it seems safe now no i said my eyes were fixed on jamie he stood in the shade of a tall palmetto at ease but erect behind the unfamiliar beard his expression was unreadable but i caught the faint movement at his side as the two stiff fingers flickered once against his thigh no i said again it isnt over yet the work went on through the afternoon the stack of wooden rollers mounted cut ends scenting the air with the tang of fresh sap ferguss voice was hoarse and his shirt clung wetly to his lean torso the horses hobbled wandered slowly under the edge of the forest browsing the sailors had given up singing now and had settled to work with no more than an occasional glance toward the palmetto where captain alessandro stood in the shade arms folded the sentry near the trees paced slowly up and down musket carried at the ready a wistful eye on the cool green shadows he passed close enough on one circuit for me to see the dark greasy curls dangling down his neck and the pockmarks on his plump cheeks he creaked and jingled as he walked the rowel was missing from one of his spurs he looked hot and fairly cross it was a long wait and the inquisitiveness of the forest midges made it longer still after what seemed forever though i saw jamie give a nod to one of the guards and come from the beach toward the trees i signed to marsali to wait and ducking under branches ignoring the thick brush i dodged madly toward the place where he had disappeared i popped breathlessly out from behind a bush just as he was doing up the laces of his flies his head jerked up at the sound his eyes widened and he let out a yell that would have summoned arabella the sheep back from the dead let alone the waiting sentry i dodged back into hiding as crashing boots and shouts of inquiry headed in our direction cest bien jamie shouted he sounded a trifle shaken ce nest quun serpent the sentry spoke an odd dialect of french but appeared to be asking rather nervously whether the serpent was dangerous non cest innocent jamie answered he waved at the sentry whose inquiring head i could just see peering reluctantly over the bush the sentry who seemed unenthusiastic about snakes however innocent disappeared promptly back to his duty without hesitation jamie plunged into the bush claire he crushed me tight against his chest then he grabbed me by the shoulders and shook me hard damn you he said in a piercing whisper i thought ye were dead for sure how dare ye do something harebrained like jump off a ship in the middle of the night have ye no sense at all let go i hissed the shaking had made me bite my lip let go i say what do you mean how dare i do something harebrained you idiot what possessed you to follow me his face was darkened by the sun now a deep red began to darken it further washing up from the edges of his new beard what possessed me he repeated youre my wife for the lords sake of course i would follow ye why did ye not wait for me christ if i had time id the mention of time evidently reminded him that we hadnt much and with a noticeable effort he choked back any further remarks which was just as well because i had a number of things to say in that vein myself i swallowed them with some difficulty what in bloody hell are you doing here i asked instead the deep flush subsided slightly succeeded by the merest hint of a smile amid the unfamiliar foliage im the captain he said did ye not notice yes i noticed captain alessandro my foot what do you mean to do instead of answering he gave me a final gentle shake and divided a glare between me and marsali who had poked an inquiring head out stay here the both of ye and dinna stir a foot or i swear ill beat ye senseless without pausing for a response he whirled and strode back through the trees toward the beach marsali and i exchanged stares which were interrupted a second later when jamie breathless hurtled back into the small clearing he grabbed me by both arms and kissed me briefly but thoroughly i forgot i love you he said giving me another shake for emphasis and im glad youre no dead dinna do that again letting go he crashed back into the brush and disappeared i felt breathless myself and more than a little rattled but undeniably happy marsalis eyes were round as saucers what shall we do she asked whats da going to do i dont know i said my cheeks were flushed and i could still feel the touch of his mouth on mine and the unfamiliar tingling left by the brush of beard and mustache my tongue touched the small stinging place where i had bitten my lip i dont know what hes going to do i repeated i suppose well have to wait and see it was a long wait i was dozing against the trunk of a huge tree near dusk when marsalis hand on my shoulder brought me awake theyre launching the ship she said in an excited whisper they were under the eyes of the sentries the remaining soldiers and the crew of the artemis were all manning the ropes and rollers that would move her down the beach into the waters of the inlet even fergus innes and murphy joined in the labor missing limbs notwithstanding the sun was going down its disc shone huge and orangegold blinding above a sea gone the purple of whelks the men were no more than black silhouettes against the light anonymous as the slaves of an egyptian wallpainting tethered by ropes to their massive burden the monotonous heave of the bosuns shout was succeeded by a weak cheer as the hull slid the last few feet drawn away from the shore by towropes from the artemiss jolly boat and cutter i saw the flash of red hair as jamie moved up the side and swung aboard then the gleam of metal as one of the soldiers followed him they stood guard together red hair and black no more than dots at the head of the rope ladder as the crew of the artemis entered the jolly boat rowed out and came up the ladder interspersed with the rest of the french soldiers the last man disappeared up the ladder the men in the boats sat on their oars looking up tense and alert nothing happened next to me i heard marsali exhale noisily and realized i had been holding my own breath much too long what are they doing she said in exasperation as though in answer to this there was one loud angry shout from the artemis the men in the boats jerked up ready to lunge aboard no other signal came though the artemis floated serenely on the rising waters of the inlet perfect as an oil painting ive had enough i said suddenly to marsali whatever those bloody men are doing theyve done it come on i drew in a fresh gulp of the cool evening air and walked out of the trees marsali behind me as we came down the beach a slim black figure dropped over the ships side and galloped through the shallows gleaming gouts of green and purple seawater spouting from his footsteps mo chridhe chèrie fergus ran dripping toward us face beaming and seizing marsali swung her off her feet with exuberance and whirled her round done he crowed done without a shot fired trussed like geese and packed like salted herrings in the hold he kissed marsali heartily then set her down on the sand and turning to me bowed ceremoniously with the elaborate flourish of an imaginary hat milady the captain of the artemis desires you will honor him with your company over supper the new captain of the artemis was standing in the middle of his cabin eyes closed and completely naked blissfully scratching his testicles er i said confronted with this sight his eyes popped open and his face lit with joy the next moment i was enfolded in his embrace face pressed against the redgold curls of his chest we didnt say anything for quite some time i could hear the thrum of footsteps on the deck overhead the shouts of the crew ringing with joy at the imminence of escape and the creak and flap of sails being rigged the artemis was coming back to life around us my face was warm tingling from the rasp of his beard i felt suddenly strange and shy holding him he naked as a jay and myself as bare under the remnants of father fogdens tattered robe the body that pressed against my own with mounting urgency was the same from the neck down but the face was a strangers a viking marauders besides the beard that transformed his face he smelled unfamiliar his own sweat overlaid with rancid cooking oil spilled beer and the reek of harsh perfume and unfamiliar spices i let go and took a step back shouldnt you dress i asked not that i dont enjoy the scenery i added blushing despite myself ieri think i like the beard maybe i added doubtfully scrutinizing him i dont he said frankly scratching his jaw im crawling wi lice and it itches like a fiend eew while i was entirely familiar with pediculus humanus the common body louse acquaintance had not endeared me i rubbed a hand nervously through my own hair already imagining the prickle of feet on my scalp as tiny sestets gamboled through the thickets of my curls he grinned at me white teeth startling in the auburn beard dinna fash yourself sassenach he assured me ive already sent for a razor and hot water really it seems rather a pity to shave it off right away despite the lice i leaned forward to peer at his hirsute adornment its like your hair all different colors rather pretty really i touched it warily the hairs were odd thick and wiry very curly in contrast to the soft thick smoothness of the hair on his head they sprang exuberantly from his skin in a profusion of colors copper gold amber cinnamon a roan so deep as almost to be black most startling of all was a thick streak of silver that ran from his lower lip to the line of his jaw thats funny i said tracing it you havent any white hairs on your head but you have right here i have he put a hand to his jaw looking startled and i suddenly realized that he likely had no idea what he looked like then he smiled wryly and bent to pick up the pile of discarded clothes from the floor aye well little wonder if i have i wonder ive not gone whitehaired altogether from the things ive been through this month he paused eyeing me over the wadded white breeches and speaking of that sassenach as i was saying to ye in the trees yes speaking of that i interrupted what in the name of god did you do oh the soldiers ye mean he scratched his chin meditatively well it was simple enough i told the soldiers that as soon as the ship was launched wed gather everyone on deck and at my signal they were to fall on the crew and push them into the hold a broad grin blossomed through the foliage only fergus had mentioned it to the crew ye see so when each soldier came aboard two of the crewmen snatched him by the arms while a third gagged him bound his arms and took away his weapons then we pushed all of them into the hold thats all he shrugged modestly nonchalant right i said exhaling and as for just how you happened to be here in the first place at this juncture we were interrupted by a discreet knock on the cabins door mr fraser ercaptain i mean maitlands angular young face peered round the jamb cautious over a steaming bowl mr murphys got the galley fire going and heres your hot water with his compliments mr fraser will do jamie assured him taking the tray with bowl and razor in one hand a less seaworthy captain doesna bear thinking of he paused listening to the thump of feet above our heads though since i am the captain he said slowly i suppose that means i shall say when we sail and when we stop yes sir thats one thing a captain does maitland said he added helpfully the captain also says when the hands are to have extra rations of food and grog i see the upward curl of jamies mouth was still visible beard notwithstanding tell me maitlandhow much dye think the hands can drink and still sail the ship oh quite a lot sir maitland said earnestly his brow wrinkled in thought maybean extra double ration all round jamie lifted one eyebrow of brandy oh no sir maitland looked shocked grog if it was to be brandy only an extra halfration or theyd be rolling in the bilges double grog then jamie bowed ceremoniously to maitland unhampered by the fact that he was still completely unclad make it so mr maitland and the ship will not lift anchor until i have finished my supper yes sir maitland bowed back jamies manners were catching and shall i desire the chinee to attend you directly after the anchor is weighed somewhat before that mr maitland thank ye kindly maitland was turning to leave with a last admiring glance at jamies scars but i stopped him one more thing maitland i said oh yes mum will you go down to the galley and ask mr murphy to send up a bottle of his strongest vinegar and then find where the men have put some of my medicines and fetch them as well his narrow forehead creased in puzzlement but he nodded obligingly oh yes mum this directly minute just what dye mean to do wi the vinegar sassenach jamie observed me narrowly as maitland vanished into the corridor souse you in it to kill the lice i said i dont intend to sleep with a seething nest of vermin oh he said he scratched the side of his neck meditatively ye mean to sleep with me do you he glanced at the berth an uninviting hole in the wall i dont know where precisely but yes i do i said firmly and i wish you wouldnt shave your beard just yet i added as he bent to set down the tray he was holding why not he glanced curiously over his shoulder at me and i felt the heat rising in my cheeks erwell its a bitdifferent oh aye he stood up and took a step toward me in the cramped confines of the cabin he seemed even biggerand a lot more nakedthan he ever had on deck the dark blue eyes had slanted into triangles of amusement how different he asked well itum i brushed my fingers vaguely past my burning cheeks it feels different when you kiss me on myskin his eyes locked on mine he hadnt moved but he seemed much closer ye have verra fine skin sassenach he said softly like pearls and opals he reached out a finger and very gently traced the line of my jaw and then my neck and the wide flare of collarbone and back and down in a slowmoving serpentine that brushed the tops of my breasts hidden in the deep cowl neck of the priests robe ye have a lot of verra fine skin sassenach he added one eyebrow quirked up if thats what ye were thinking i swallowed and licked my lips but didnt look away thats more or less what i was thinking yes he took his finger away and glanced at the bowl of steaming water aye well it seems a shame to waste the water shall i send it back to murphy to make soup or shall i drink it i laughed both tension and strangeness dissolving at once you shall sit down i said and wash with it you smell like a brothel i expect i do he said scratching theres one upstairs in the tavern where the soldiers go to drink and gamble he took up the soap and dropped it in the hot water upstairs eh i said well the girls come down betweentimes he explained it wouldna be mannerly to stop them sitting on your lap after all and your mother brought you up to have nice manners i expect i said very dryly upon second thoughts i think perhaps we shall anchor here for the night he said thoughtfully looking at me shall we and sleep ashore where theres room room for what i asked regarding him with suspicion well i have it planned aye he said sloshing water over his face with both hands you have what planned i asked he snorted and shook the excess water from his beard before replying i have been thinking of this for months now he said with keen anticipation every night folded up in that godforsaken nutshell of a berth listening to fergus grunt and fart across the cabin i thought it all out just what i would do did i have ye naked and willing no one in hearing and room enough to serve ye suitably he lathered the cake of soap vigorously between his palms and applied it to his face well im willing enough i said intrigued and theres room certainly as for naked ill see to that he assured me thats part o the plan aye i shall take ye to a private spot spread out a quilt to lie on and commence by sitting down beside you well thats a start all right i said what then i sat down next to him on the berth he leaned close and bit my earlobe very delicately as for what next then i shall take ye on my knee and kiss ye he paused to illustrate holding my arms so i couldnt move he let go a minute later leaving my lips slightly swollen tasting of ale soap and jamie so much for step one i said wiping soapsuds from my mouth what then then i shall lay ye down upon the quilt twist your hair up in my hand and taste your face and throat and ears and bosom wi my lips he said i thought i would do that until ye start to make squeaking noises i dont make squeaking noises aye ye do he said here hand me the towel aye then he went on cheerfully i thought i would begin at the other end i shall lift up your skirt and his face disappeared into the folds of the linen towel and what i asked thoroughly intrigued and kiss the insides of your thighs where the skins so soft the beard might help there aye he stroked his jaw considering it might i said a little faintly what am i supposed to be doing while you do this well ye might moan a bit if ye like to encourage me but otherwise ye just lie still he didnt sound as though he needed any encouragement whatever one of his hands was resting on my thigh as he used the other to swab his chest with the damp towel as he finished the hand slid behind me and squeezed my beloveds arm is under me i quoted and his hand behind my head comfort me with apples and stay me with flagons for i am sick of love there was a flash of white teeth in his beard more like grapefruit he said one hand cupping my behind or possibly gourds grapefruit are too small gourds i said indignantly well wild gourds get that big sometimes he said but aye thats next he squeezed once more then removed the hand in order to wash the armpit on that side i lie upon my back and have ye stretched at length upon me so that i can get hold of your buttocks and fondle them properly he stopped washing to give me a quick example of what he thought proper and i let out an involuntary gasp now he went on resuming his ablutions should ye wish to kick your legs a bit or make lewd motions wi your hips and pant in my ear at that point in the proceedings i should have no great objection i do not pant aye ye do now about your breasts oh i thought youd forgotten those never in life he assured me no he went blithely on thats when i take off your gown leaving ye in naught but your shift im not wearing a shift oh well no matter he said dismissing this i meant to suckle ye through the thin cotton til your nipples stood up hard in my mouth and then take it off but its no great concern ill manage without so allowing for the absence of your shift i shall attend to your breasts until ye make that wee bleating noise i dont and then he said interrupting since ye will according to the plan be naked andprovided ive done it right so farpossibly willing as well oh just possibly i said my lips were still tingling from step one then i shall spread open your thighs take down my breeks and he paused waiting and i said obligingly the grin widened substantially and well see what sort of noise it is ye dont make then sassenach there was a slight cough in the doorway behind me oh your pardon mr willoughby jamie said apologetically i wasna expecting ye so soon perhaps yed care to go and have a bit of supper and if ye would take those things along and ask murphy will he burn them in the galley fire he tossed the remains of his uniform to mr willoughby and bent to rummage in a sealocker for fresh clothing i never thought to meet lawrence stern again he remarked burrowing through the tangled linen how does he come to be here oh he is the jewish natural philosopher you told me about he is though i shouldna think there are so many jewish philosophers about as to cause great confusion i explained how i had come to meet stern in the mangroves and then he brought me up to the priests house i said and stopped suddenly reminded oh i almost forgot you owe the priest two pounds sterling on account of arabella i do jamie glanced at me startled a shirt in his hand you do maybe youd best ask lawrence if hell act as ambassador the priest seems to get on with him all right whats happened to this arabella though has one of the crew debauched her i suppose you might say that i drew breath to explain further but before i could speak another knock sounded on the door can a man not dress in peace jamie demanded irritably come then the door swung open revealing marsali who blinked at the sight of her nude stepfather jamie hastily swathed his midsection in the shirt he was holding and nodded to her sangfroid only slightly impaired marsali lass im glad to see ye unhurt did ye require something the girl edged into the room taking up a position between the table and a sea chest aye i do she said she was sunburned and her nose was peeling but i thought she seemed pale nonetheless her fists were clenched at her sides and her chin lifted as for battle i require ye to keep your promise she said aye jamie looked wary your promise to let me and fergus be married so soon as we came to the indies a small wrinkle appeared between her fair eyebrows hispaniola is in the indies no the jew said so jamie scratched at his beard looking reluctant it is he said and aye i suppose if iwell aye i did promise butyoure still sure of yourselves the two of ye she lifted her chin higher jaw set firmly we are jamie lifted one eyebrow wheres fergus helping stow the cargo i kent wed be under way soon so i thought id best come and ask now aye well jamie frowned then sighed with resignation aye i said but i did say as ye must be blessed by a priest did i no theres no priest closer than bayamo and thats three days ride but perhaps in jamaica nay youre forgetting marsali said triumphantly weve a priest right here father fogden can marry us i felt my jaw drop and hastily closed it jamie was scowling at her we sail first thing in the morning it wont take long she said its only a few words after all were already married by law its only to be blessed by the church aye her hand flattened on her abdomen where her marriage contract presumably resided beneath her stays but your mother jamie glanced helplessly at me for reinforcement i shrugged equally helpless the task of trying either to explain father fogden to jamie or to dissuade marsali was well beyond me he likely wont do it though jamie came up with this objection with a palpable air of relief the crew have been trifling with one of his parishioners named arabella he willna want anything to do wi us im afraid yes he will hell do it for mehe likes me marsali was almost dancing on her toes with eagerness jamie looked at her for a long moment eyes fixed on hers reading her face she was very young youre sure then lassie he said at last very gently ye want this she took a deep breath a glow spreading over her face i am da i truly am i want fergus i love him jamie hesitated a moment then rubbed a hand through his hair and nodded aye then go and send mr stern to me then fetch fergus and tell him to make ready oh da thank you thank you marsali flung herself at him and kissed him he held her with one arm clutching the shirt about his middle with the other then he kissed her on the forehead and pushed her gently away take care he said smiling ye dinna want to go to your bridal covered wi lice oh this seemed to remind her of something she glanced at me and blushed putting up a hand to her own pale locks which were matted with sweat and straggling down her neck from a careless knot mother claire she said shyly i wonderwould yecould ye lend me a bit of the special soap ye make wi the chamomile iif theres time she added with a hasty glance at jamie i should like to wash my hair of course i said and smiled at her come along and well make you pretty for your wedding i looked her over appraisingly from glowing round face to dirty bare feet the crumpled muslin of her seashrunk gown stretched tight over her bosom slight as it was and the grubby hem hovered several inches above her sandy ankles a thought struck me and i turned to jamie she should have a nice dress to be married in i said sassenach he said with obviously waning patience we havena no but the priest does i interrupted tell lawrence to ask father fogden whether we might borrow one of his gowns ermenegildas i mean i think theyre almost the right size jamies face went blank with surprise above his beard ermenegilda he said arabella gowns he narrowed his eyes at me what sort of priest is this man sassenach i paused in the doorway marsali hovering impatiently in the passage beyond well i said he drinks a bit and hes rather fond of sheep but he might remember the words to the wedding ceremony it was one of the more unusual weddings i had attended the sun had long since sunk into the sea by the time all arrangements were made to the disgruntlement of mr warren the ships master jamie had declared that we would not leave until the next day so as to allow the newlyweds one night of privacy ashore damned if id care to consummate a marriage in one of those godforsaken pesthole berths he told me privately if they got coupled in there to start wi wed never pry them out and the thought of takin a maidenhead in a hammock quite i said i poured more vinegar on his head smiling to myself very thoughtful of you now jamie stood by me on the beach smelling rather strongly of vinegar but handsome and dignified in blue coat clean stock and linen and gray serge breeks with his hair clubbed back and ribboned the wild red beard was a bit incongruous above his otherwise sober garb but it had been neatly trimmed and finecombed with vinegar and stockinged feet notwithstanding he made a fine picture as father of the bride murphy as one chief witness and maitland as the other were somewhat less prepossessing though murphy had washed his hands and maitland his face fergus would have preferred lawrence stern as a witness and marsali had asked for me but both were dissuaded first on grounds that stern was not a christian let alone a catholic and then by consideration that while i was religiously qualified that fact was unlikely to weigh heavily with laoghaire once she found out about it ive told marsali she must write to her mother to say shes wed jamie murmured to me as we watched the preparations on the beach go forward but perhaps i shall suggest she doesna say much more about it than that i saw his point laoghaire was not going to be pleased at hearing that her eldest daughter had eloped with a onehanded expickpocket twice her age her maternal feelings were unlikely to be assuaged by hearing that the marriage had been performed in the middle of the night on a west indian beach by a disgracedif not actually defrockedpriest witnessed by twentyfive seamen ten french horses a small flock of sheepall gaily beribboned in honor of the occasionand a king charles spaniel who added to the generally festive feeling by attempting to copulate with murphys wooden leg at every opportunity the only thing that could make things worse in laoghaires view would be to hear that i had participated in the ceremony several torches were lit bound to stakes pounded into the sand and the flames streamed seaward in tails of red and orange bright against the black velvet night the brilliant stars of the caribbean shone overhead like the lights of heaven while it was not a church few brides had had a more beautiful setting for their nuptials i didnt know what prodigies of persuasion had been required on lawrences part but father fogden was there frail and insubstantial as a ghost the blue sparks of his eyes the only real signs of life his skin was gray as his robe and his hands trembled on the worn leather of his prayer book jamie glanced sharply at him and appeared to be about to say something but then merely muttered under his breath in gaelic and pressed his lips tightly together the spicy scent of sangria wafted from father fogdens vicinity but at least he had reached the beach under his own power he stood swaying between two torches laboriously trying to turn the pages of his book as the light offshore wind jerked them fluttering from his fingers at last he gave up and dropped the book on the sand with a little plop um he said and belched he looked about and gave us a small saintlike smile dearly beloved of god it was several moments before the throng of shuffling murmuring spectators realized that the ceremony had started and began to poke each other and straighten to attention wilt thou take this woman father fogden demanded suddenly rounding ferociously on murphy no said the cook startled i dont hold wi women messy things you dont father fogden closed one eye the remaining orb bright and accusing he looked at maitland do you take this woman not me sir no not that anyone wouldnt be pleased he added hastily him please maitland pointed at fergus who stood next to the cabin boy glowering at the priest him youre sure he hasnt a hand father fogden said doubtfully wont she mind i will not marsali imperious in one of ermenegildas gowns blue silk encrusted with gold embroidery along the low square neckline and puffed sleeves stood beside fergus she looked lovely with her hair clean and bright as fresh straw brushed to a gloss and floating loose round her shoulders as became a maiden she also looked angry go on she stamped her foot which made no noise on the sand but seemed to startle the priest oh yes he said nervously taking one step back well i dont suppose its an imptimpeddyimpediment after all not as though hed lost his cock i mean he hasnt has he the priest inquired anxiously as the possibility occurred to him i cant marry you if he has its not allowed marsalis face was already bathed in red by torchlight the expression on it at this point reminded me strongly of how her mother had looked upon finding me at lallybroch a visible tremor ran through ferguss shoulders whether of rage or laughter i couldnt tell jamie quelled the incipient riot by striding firmly into the middle of the wedding and placing a hand on the shoulders of fergus and marsali this man he said with a nod toward fergus and this woman with another toward marsali marry them father now please he added as an obvious afterthought and stood back a pace restoring order among the audience by dint of dark glances from side to side oh quite quite father fogden repeated swaying gently quite quite a long pause followed during which the priest squinted at marsali name he said abruptly i have to have a name cant get married without a name just like a cock cant get married without a name cant get married without a c marsali jane mackimmie joyce marsali spoke up loudly drowning him out yes yes he said hurriedly of course it is marsali marsalee just so well then do you marsalee take this maneven though hes missing a hand and possibly other parts not visibleto be your lawful husband to have and to hold from this day forward forsaking at this point he trailed off his attention fixed on one of the sheep that had wandered into the light and was chewing industriously on a discarded stocking of striped wool i do father fogden blinked brought back to attention he made an unsuccessful attempt to stifle another belch and transferred his bright blue gaze to fergus you have a name too and a cock yes said fergus wisely choosing not to be more specific fergus the priest frowned slightly at this fergus he said fergus fergus yes fergus got that thats all no more name need more names surely fergus fergus repeated with a note of strain in his voice fergus was the only name he had ever hadbar his original french name of claudel jamie had given him the name fergus in paris when they had met twenty years before but naturally a brothelborn bastard would have no last name to give a wife fraser said a deep sure voice beside me fergus and marsali both glanced back in surprise and jamie nodded his eyes met ferguss and he smiled faintly fergus claudel fraser he said slowly and clearly one eyebrow lifted as he looked at fergus fergus himself looked transfixed his mouth hung open eyes wide black pools in the dim light then he nodded slightly and a glow rose in his face as though he contained a candle that had just been lit fraser he said to the priest his voice was husky and he cleared his throat fergus claudel fraser father fogden had his head tilted back watching the sky where a crescent of light floated over the trees holding the black orb of the moon in its cup he lowered his head to face fergus looking dreamy well thats good he said isnt it a small poke in the ribs from maitland brought him back to an awareness of his responsibilities oh um well man and wife yes i pronounce you manno thats not right you havent said whether youd take her she has both hands he added helpfully i will fergus said he had been holding marsalis hand now he let go and dug hastily in his pocket coming out with a small gold ring he must have bought it in scotland i realized and kept it ever since not wanting to make the marriage official until it had been blessed not by a priestby jamie the beach was silent as he slid the ring on her finger all eyes fixed on the small gold circle and the two heads bent close together over it one bright one dark so she had done it one fifteenyearold girl with nothing but stubbornness as a weapon i want him she had said and kept saying it through her mothers objections and jamies arguments through ferguss scruples and her own fears through three thousand miles of homesickness hardship ocean storm and shipwreck she raised her face shining and found her mirror in ferguss eyes i saw them look at each other and felt the tears prickle behind my lids i want him i had not said that to jamie at our marriage i had not wanted him then but i had said it since three times in two moments of choice at craigh na dun and once again at lallybroch i want him i wanted him still and nothing whatever could stand between us he was looking down at me i could feel the weight of his gaze dark blue and tender as the sea at dawn what are ye thinking mo chridhe he asked softly i blinked back the tears and smiled at him his hands were large and warm on mine what i tell you three times is true i said and standing on tiptoe i kissed him as the sailors cheer went up part nine worlds unknown bat guano bat guano is a slimy blackish green when fresh a powdery light brown when dried in both states it emits an eyewatering reek of musk ammonia and decay how much of this stuff did you say were taking i asked through the cloth i had wrapped about my lower face ten tons jamie replied his words similarly muffled we were standing on the upper deck watching as the slaves trundled barrowloads of the reeking stuff down the gangplank and over to the open hatchway of the after hold tiny particles of the dried guano blew from the barrows and filled the air around us with a deceptively beautiful cloud of gold that sparked and glimmered in the late afternoon sun the mens bodies were coated with the stuff as well the runnels of sweat carved dark channels in the dust on their bare torsos and the constant tears ran down their faces and chests so that they were striped in black and gold like exotic zebras jamie dabbed at his own streaming eyes as the wind veered slightly toward us dye ken how to keelhaul someone sassenach no but if its fergus you have in mind as a candidate im with you how far is it to jamaica it was fergus making inquiries in the marketplace on kings street in bridgetown who had gained the artemis her first commission as a trading and hauling vessel the shipment of ten cubic tons of bat guano from barbados to jamaica for use as fertilizer on the sugar plantation of one mr grey planter fergus himself was rather selfconsciously overseeing the loading of the huge quarried blocks of dried guano which were tipped from their barrows and handed down one by one into the hold marsali never far from his side had in this case moved as far as the forecastle where she sat on a barrel filled with oranges the lovely new shawl fergus had bought her in the market wrapped over her face we are meant to be traders no fergus had argued we have an empty hold to fill besides he had added logically clinching the argument monsieur grey will pay us more than adequately how far sassenach jamie squinted at the horizon as though hoping to see land rising from the sparkling waves mr willoughbys magic needles rendered him seaworthy but he submitted to the process with no real enthusiasm three or four days sail warren says he admitted with a sigh and the weather holds fair maybe the smell will be better at sea i said oh yes milady fergus assured me overhearing as he passed the owner tells me that the stench dissipates itself significantly once the dried material is removed from the caves where it accumulates he leapt into the rigging and went up climbing like a monkey despite his hook reaching the top rigging fergus tied the red kerchief that was the signal to hands on shore to come aboard and slid down again pausing to say something rude to ping an who was perched on the lowest crosstrees keeping a bright yellow eye on the proceedings below fergus seems to be taking quite a proprietary interest in this cargo i observed aye well hes a partner jamie said i told him if hed a wife to support he must think of how to do it and as it may be some time before were in the printing business again he must turn his hand to what offers he and marsali have half the profit on this cargoagainst the dowry i promised her he added wryly and i laughed you know i said i really would like to read the letter marsalis sending to her mother first fergus i mean then father fogden and mamacita and now a dowry of ten tons of bat shit i shall never be able to set foot in scotland again once laoghaire reads it said jamie but he smiled nonetheless have ye thought yet what to do wi your new acquisition dont remind me i said a little grimly where is he somewhere below jamie said his attention distracted by a man coming down the wharf toward us murphys fed him and innes will find a place for him your pardon sassenach i think this will be someone looking for me he swung down from the rail and went down the gangplank neatly skipping around a slave coming up with a barrowload of guano i watched with interest as he greeted the man a tall colonial in the dress of a prosperous planter with a weathered red face that spoke of long years in the islands he extended a hand toward jamie who took it in a firm clasp jamie said something and the man replied his expression of wariness changing to an instant cordiality this must be the result of jamies visit to the masonic lodge in bridgetown where he had gone immediately upon landing the day before mindful of jareds suggestion he had identified himself as a member of the brotherhood and spoken to the master of the lodge describing young ian and asking for any news of either the boy or the ship bruja the master had promised to spread the word among such freemasons as might have occasion to frequent the slave market and the shipping docks with luck this was the fruit of that promise i watched eagerly as the planter reached into his coat and withdrew a paper which he unfolded and showed to jamie apparently explaining something jamies face was intent his ruddy brows drawn together with concentration but showed neither exultation nor disappointment maybe it was not news of ian at all after our visit to the slave market the day before i was halfinclined to hope not lawrence fergus marsali and i had gone to the slave market under the cranky chaperonage of murphy while jamie called on the masonic master the slave market was near the docks down a dusty road lined with sellers of fruit and coffee dried fish and coconuts yams and red cochineal bugs sold for dye in small corked glass bottles murphy with his passion for order and propriety had insisted that marsali and i must each have a parasol and had forced fergus to buy two from a roadside vendor all the white women in bridgetown carry parasols he said firmly trying to hand me one i dont need a parasol i said impatient at talk of something so inconsequential as my complexion when we might be near to finding ian at last the sun isnt that hot lets go murphy glowered at me scandalized ye dont want folk to think ye aint respectable that ye dont care enough to keep yer skin fine i wasnt planning to take up residence here i said tartly i dont care what they think not pausing to argue further i began walking down the road toward a distant murmur of noise that i took to be the slave market yer face willgetred murphy said huffing indignantly alongside me attempting to open the parasol as he stumped along oh a fate worse than death im sure i snapped my nerves were strung tight in anticipation of what we might find all right then give me the bloody thing i snatched it from him snapped it open and set it over my shoulder with an irritable twirl as it was within minutes i was grateful for murphys intransigence while the road was shaded by tall palms and cecropia trees the slave market itself was held in a large stonepaved space without the grace of any shade save that provided by ramshackle open booths roofed with sheets of tin or palm fronds in which the slavedealers and auctioneers sought occasional refuge from the sun the slaves themselves were mostly held in large pens at the side of the square open to the elements the sun was fierce in the open and the light bouncing off the pale stones was blinding after the green shade of the road i blinked eyes watering and hastily adjusted my parasol over my head so shaded i could see a bewildering array of bodies naked or nearly so gleaming in every shade from pale café au lait to a deep blueblack bouquets of color blossomed in front of the auction blocks where the plantation owners and their servants gathered to inspect the wares vivid amid the stark blacks and whites the stink of the place was staggering even to one accustomed to the stenches of edinburgh and the reeking tweendecks of the porpoise heaps of wet human excrement lay in the corners of the slave pens buzzing with flies and a thick oily reek floated on the air but the major component of the smell was the unpleasantly intimate scent of acres of hot bare flesh baking in the sun jesu fergus muttered next to me his dark eyes flicked right and left in shocked disapproval its worse than the slums in montmartre marsali didnt say a word but drew closer to his side her nostrils pinched lawrence was more matteroffact i supposed he must have seen slave markets before during his explorations of the islands the whites are at that end he said gesturing toward the far side of the square come well ask for news of any young men sold recently he placed a large square hand in the center of my back and urged me gently forward through the crowd near the edge of the market an old black woman squatted on the ground feeding charcoal to a small brazier as we drew near a little group of people approached her a planter accompanied by two black men dressed in rough cotton shirts and trousers evidently his servants one of them was holding the arm of a newly purchased female slave two other girls naked but for small strips of cloth wrapped about their middles were led by ropes around their necks the planter bent and handed the old woman a coin she turned and drew several short brass rods from the ground behind her holding them up for the mans inspection he studied them for a moment picked out two and straightened up he handed the branding irons to one of his servants who thrust the ends into the old womans brazier the other servant stepped behind the girl and pinioned her arms the first man then pulled the irons from the fire and planted both together on the upper slope of her right breast she shrieked a high steamwhistle sound loud enough to turn a few heads nearby the irons pulled away leaving the letters hb in raw pink flesh i had stopped dead at the sight of this not realizing that i was no longer with them the others had gone on i turned round and round looking vainly for any trace of lawrence or fergus i never had any difficulty finding jamie in crowds his bright head was always visible above everyone elses but fergus was a small man murphy no taller and lawrence no more than middle height even marsalis yellow parasol was lost among the many others in the square i turned away from the brazier with a shudder hearing screams and whimpers behind me but not wanting to look back i hurried past several auction blocks eyes averted but then was slowed and finally stopped by a thickening of the crowd around me the men and women blocking my way were listening to an auctioneer who was touting the virtues of a onearmed slave who stood naked on the block for inspection he was a short man but broadly built with massive thighs and a strong chest the missing arm had been crudely amputated above the elbow sweat dripped from the end of the stump no good for field work thats true the auctioneer was admitting but a sound investment for breeding look at those legs he carried a long rattan cane which he flicked against the slaves calves then grinned fatly at the crowd will you give a guarantee of virility the man standing behind me said with a distinct tone of skepticism i had a buck three year past big as a mule and not a foal dropped on his account couldnt do a thing the jubagirls said the crowd tittered at that and the auctioneer pretended to be offended guarantee he said he wiped a hand theatrically over his jowls gathering oily sweat on the palm see for yourselves o ye of little faith bending slightly he grasped the slaves penis and began to massage it vigorously the man grunted in surprise and tried to draw back but was prevented by the auctioneers assistant who clutched him firmly by his single arm there was an outburst of laughter from the crowd and a few scattered cheers as the soft black flesh hardened and began to swell some small thing inside me suddenly snapped i heard it distinctly outraged by the market the branding the nakedness the crude talk and casual indignity outraged most of all by my own presence here i could not even think what i was doing but began to do it all the same i felt very oddly detached as though i stood outside myself watching stop it i said very loudly hardly recognizing my own voice the auctioneer looked up startled and smiled ingratiatingly at me he looked directly into my eyes with a knowing leer sound breeding stock maam he said guaranteed as you see i folded my parasol lowered it and stabbed the pointed end of it as hard as i could into his fat stomach he jerked back eyes bulging in surprise i yanked the parasol back and smashed it on his head then dropped it and kicked him hard somewhere deep inside i knew it would make no difference would not help in any way would do nothing but harm and yet i could not stand here consenting by silence it was not for the branded girls the man on the block not for any of them that i did it it was for myself there was a good deal of noise around me and hands snatched at me pulling me off the auctioneer this worthy recovered sufficiently from his initial shock grinned nastily at me took aim and slapped the slave hard across the face i looked around for reinforcements and caught a quick glimpse of fergus face contorted in rage lunging through the crowd toward the auctioneer there was a shout and several men turned in his direction people began to push and shove someone tripped me and i sat down hard on the stones through a haze of dust i saw murphy six feet away with a resigned expression on his broad red face he bent detached his wooden leg straightened up and hopping gracefully forward brought it down with great force on the auctioneers head the man tottered and fell as the crowd surged back trying to get out of the way fergus baffled of his prey skidded to a halt by the fallen man and glared ferociously round lawrence dark grim and bulky came striding through the crowd from the other direction hand on the caneknife at his belt i sat on the ground shaken i no longer felt detached i felt sick and terrified realizing that i had just committed an act of folly that was likely to result in fergus lawrence and murphy being badly beaten if nothing worse and then jamie was there stand up sassenach he said quietly stooping over me and giving me his hands i managed it knees shaking i saw raeburns long mustache twitching at one side macleod behind him and realized that his scots were with him then my knees gave way but jamies arms held me up do something i said in a choked voice into his chest please do something he had with his usual presence of mind he had done the only thing that would quell the riot and prevent harm he had bought the onearmed man and as the ironic result of my little outburst of sensibilities i was now the appalled owner of a genuine male guinea slave onearmed but in glowing health and of guaranteed virility i sighed trying not to think of the man presumably now somewhere under my feet fed andi hopedclad the papers of ownership which i had refused even to touch said that he was a fullblooded gold coast negro a yoruba sold by a french planter from barbuda onearmed bearing a brand on the left shoulder of a fleurdelys and the initial a and known by the name temeraire the bold one the papers did not suggest what in the name of god i was to do with him jamie had finished looking at the papers his masonic acquaintance had broughtthey were very like the ones i had received for temeraire so far as i could see from the rail of the ship he handed them back with a bow of thanks a slight frown on his face the men exchanged a few more words and parted with another handshake is everyone aboard jamie asked stepping off the gangplank there was a light breeze it fluttered the dark blue ribbon that tied back the thick tail of his hair aye sir said mr warren with the casual jerk of the head that passed for a salute in a merchant ship shall we make sail we shall if ye please thank ye mr warren with a small bow jamie passed him and came to stand beside me no he said quietly his face was calm but i could feel the depths of his disappointment interviews the day before with the two men who dealt in white indentured labor at the slave market had provided no useful informationthe masonic planter had been a beacon of lastminute hope there wasnt anything helpful to be said i put my hand over his where it lay on the rail and squeezed lightly jamie looked down and gave me a faint smile he took a deep breath and straightened his shoulders shrugging to settle his coat over them aye well ive learned something at least that was a mr villiers who owns a large sugar plantation here he bought six slaves from the captain of the ship bruja three days agobut none of them ian three days i was startled butthe bruja left hispaniola more than two weeks ago he nodded rubbing his cheek he had shaved a necessity before making public inquiries and his skin glowed fresh and ruddy above the snowy linen of his stock she did and she arrived here on wednesdayfive days ago so shed been somewhere else before coming to barbados do we know where he shook his head villiers didna ken he said he had spoken some time wi the captain of the bruja and the man seemed verra secretive about where hed been and what hed been doing villiers thought no great thing of it knowin as the bruja has a reputation as a crook shipand seein as how the captain was willing to sell the slaves for a good price stillhe brightened slightlyvilliers did show me the papers for the slaves hed bought yell have seen those for your slave i wish you wouldnt call him that i said but yes were the ones you saw the same not quite three o the papers gave no previous ownerthough villiers says they were none of them fresh from africa all of them have a few words of english at least one listed a previous owner but the name had been scratched out i couldna read it the other two gave a mrs abernathy of rose hall jamaica as the previous owner jamaica how far i dinna ken he interrupted but mr warren will know it may be right in any case i think we must go to jamaica nextif only to dispose of our cargo before we all die o disgust he wrinkled his long nose fastidiously and i laughed you look like an anteater when you do that i told him the attempt to distract him was successful the wide mouth curved upward slightly oh aye theres a beastie eats ants is there he did his best to respond to the teasing turning his back on the barbados docks he leaned against the rail and smiled down at me i shouldna think theyd be verra filling i suppose it must eat a lot of them they cant be any worse than haggis after all i took a breath before going on and let it out quickly coughing god whats that the artemis had by now slid free of the loading wharf and out into the harbor as we came about into the wind a deep pungent smell struck the ship a lower and more sinister note in the olfactory dockside symphony of dead barnacles wet wood fish rotted seaweed and the constant warm breath of the tropical vegetation on shore i pressed my handkerchief hard over my nose and mouth what is it were passing the burning ground mum at the foot o the slave market maitland explained overhearing my question he pointed toward the shore where a plume of white smoke rose from behind a screen of bayberry bushes they burn the bodies of the slaves who dont survive their passage from africa he explained first they unload the living cargo and then as the ship is swabbed out the bodies are removed and thrown onto the pyre here to prevent sickness spreading into the town i looked at jamie and found the same fear in his face that showed in my own how often do they burn bodies i asked every day dont know mum but i dont think so maybe once a week maitland shrugged and went on about his duties we have to look i said my voice sounded strange to my own ears calm and clear i didnt feel that way jamie had gone very pale he had turned round again and his eyes were fixed on the plume of smoke rising thick and white from behind the palm trees his lips pressed tight then and his jaw set hard aye was all he said and turned to tell mr warren to put about the keeper of the flames a wizened little creature of indistinguishable color and accent was vociferously shocked at the notion that a lady should enter the burning ground but jamie elbowed him brusquely aside he didnt try to prevent me following him or turn to see that i did he knew i would not leave him alone here it was a small hollow set behind a screen of trees convenient to a small wharf that extended into the river blacksmeared pitch barrels and piles of dry wood stood in grim sticky clumps amid the brilliant greens of treeferns and dwarf poinciana to the right a huge pyre had been built with a platform of wood onto which the bodies had been thrown dribbled with pitch this had been lit only a short time before a good blaze had started at one side of the heap but only small tongues of flame licked up from the rest it was smoke that obscured the bodies rolling up over the heap in a wavering thick veil that gave the outflung limbs a horrid illusion of movement jamie had stopped staring at the heap then he sprang onto the platform heedless of smoke and scorching and began jerking bodies loose grimly pawing through the grisly remains a smaller heap of gray ashes and shards of pure white friable bone lay nearby the curve of an occiput lay on top of the heap fragile and perfect as an eggshell makee fine crop the sootsmeared little creature who tended the fire was at my elbow offering information in evident hopes of reward heor shepointed at the ashes put on crop makee growgrow no thank you i said faintly the smoke obscured jamies figure for a moment and i had the terrible feeling that he had fallen was burning in the pyre the horrible jolly smell of roasting meat rose on the air and i thought i would be sick jamie i called jamie he didnt answer but i heard a deep racking cough from the heart of the fire several long minutes later the veil of smoke parted and he staggered out choking he made his way down the platform and stood bent over coughing his lungs out he was covered with an oily soot his hands and clothes smeared with pitch he was blind with the smoke tears poured down his cheeks making runnels in the soot i threw several coins to the keeper of the pyre and taking jamie by the arm led him blind and choking out of the valley of death under the palms he sank to his knees and threw up dont touch me he gasped when i tried to help him he retched over and over again but finally stopped swaying on his knees then he slowly staggered to his feet dont touch me he said again his voice roughened by smoke and sickness was that of a stranger he walked to the edge of the dock removed his coat and shoes and dived into the water fully clothed i waited for a moment then stooped and picked up the coat and shoes holding them gingerly at arms length i could see in the inner pocket the faint rectangular bulge of briannas pictures i waited until he came back and hoisted himself out of the water dripping the pitch smears were still there but most of the soot and the smell of the fire were gone he sat on the wharf head on his knees breathing hard a row of curious faces edged the artemiss rail above us not knowing what else to do i leaned down and laid a hand on his shoulder without raising his head he reached up a hand and grasped mine he wasnt there he said in his muffled rasping strangers voice the breeze was freshening it stirred the tendrils of wet hair that lay across his shoulders i looked back to see that the plume of smoke rising from the little valley had changed to black it flattened and began to drift out over the sea the ashes of the dead slaves fleeing on the wind back toward africa the impetuous pirate i cant own anyone jamie i said looking in dismay at the papers spread out in the lamplight before me i just cant it isnt right well im inclined to agree wi ye sassenach but what are we to do with the fellow jamie sat on the berth next to me close enough to see the ownership documents over my shoulder he rubbed a hand through his hair frowning we could set him freethat would seem the right thingand yet if we dowhat will happen to him then he hunched forward squinting down his nose to read the papers hes no more than a bit of french and english no skills to speak of if we were to set him free or even give him a bit of moneycan he manage to live on his own i nibbled thoughtfully on one of murphys cheese rolls it was good but the smell of the burning oil in the lamp blended oddly with the aromatic cheese underlaidas everything waswith the insidious scent of bat guano that permeated the ship i dont know i said lawrence told me there are a lot of free blacks on hispaniola lots of creoles and mixedrace people and a good many who own their own businesses is it like that on jamaica too he shook his head and reached for a roll from the tray i dinna think so its true there are some free blacks who earn a living for themselves but those are the ones who have some skillsempstresses and fishers and such i spoke to this temeraire a bit he was a canecutter until he lost his arm and doesna ken how to do anything else much i laid the roll down barely tasted and frowned unhappily at the papers the mere idea of owning a slave frightened and disgusted me but it was beginning to dawn on me that it might not be so simple to divest myself of the responsibility the man had been taken from a barracoon on the guinea coast five years before my original impulse to return him to his home was clearly impossible even had it been possible to find a ship headed for africa that would agree to take him as a passenger the overwhelming likelihood was that he would be immediately enslaved again either by the ship that accepted him or by another slaver in the west african ports traveling alone onearmed and ignorant he would have no protection at all and even if he should by some miracle reach africa safely and keep himself out of the hands of both european and african slavers there was virtually no chance of his ever finding his way back to his village should he do so lawrence had kindly explained he would likely be killed or driven away as his own people would regard him now as a ghost and a danger to them i dinna suppose ye would consider selling him jamie put the question delicately raising one eyebrow to someone we could be sure would treat him kindly i rubbed two fingers between my brows trying to soothe the growing headache i cant see that thats any better than owning him ourselves i protested worse probably because we couldnt be sure what the new owners would do with him jamie sighed he had spent most of the day climbing through the dark reeking cargo holds with fergus making up inventories against our arrival in jamaica and he was tired aye i see that he said but its no kindness to free him to starve that i can see no i fought back the uncharitable wish that i had never seen the onearmed slave it would have been a great deal easier for me if i had notbut possibly not for him jamie rose from the berth and stretched himself leaning on the desk and flexing his shoulders to ease them he bent and kissed me on the forehead between the brows dinna fash sassenach ill speak to the manager at jareds plantation perhaps he can find the man some employment or else a warning shout from above interrupted him ship ahoy look alive below off the port bow ahoy the lookouts cry was urgent and there was a sudden rush and stir as hands began to turn out then there was a lot more shouting and a jerk and shudder as the artemis backed her sails what in the name of god jamie began a rending crash drowned his words and he pitched sideways eyes wide with alarm as the cabin tilted the stool i was on fell over throwing me onto the floor the oil lamp had shot from its bracket luckily extinguishing itself before hitting the floor and the place was in darkness sassenach are ye all right jamies voice came out of the murk close at hand sharp with anxiety yes i said scrambling out from under the table are you what happened did someone hit us not pausing to answer any of these questions jamie had reached the door and opened it a babel of shouts and thumps came down from the deck above punctuated by the sudden popcornsound of smallarms fire pirates he said briefly weve been boarded my eyes were becoming accustomed to the dim light i saw his shadow lunge for the desk reaching for the pistol in the drawer he paused to snatch the dirk from under the pillow of his berth and made for the door issuing instructions as he went take marsali sassenach and get below go aft as far as ye can getthe big hold where the guano blocks are get behind them and stay there then he was gone i spent a moment feeling my way through the cupboard over my berth in search of the morocco box mother hildegarde had given me when i saw her in paris a scalpel might be little use against pirates but i would feel better with a weapon of some kind in my hand no matter how small mother claire marsalis voice came from the door high and scared im here i said i caught the gleam of pale cotton as she moved and pressed the ivory letteropener into her hand here take this just in case come on were to go below with a longhandled amputation blade in one hand and a cluster of scalpels in the other i led the way through the ship to the after hold feet thundered on the deck overhead and curses and shouts rang through the night overlaid with a dreadful groaning scraping noise that i thought must be caused by the rubbing of the artemiss timbers against those of the unknown ship that had rammed us the hold was black as pitch and thick with dusty fumes we made our way slowly coughing toward the back of the hold who are they marsali asked her voice had a strangely muffled sound the echoes of the hold deadened by the blocks of guano stacked around us pirates dye think i expect they must be lawrence had told us that the caribbean was a rich hunting ground for pirate luggers and unscrupulous craft of all kinds but we had expected no trouble as our cargo was not particularly valuable i suppose they must not have much sense of smell eh never mind i said come sit down theres nothing we can do but wait i knew from experience that waiting while men fought was one of the most difficult things in life to do but in this case there wasnt any sensible alternative down here the sounds of the battle were muted to a distant thumping though the constant rending groan of the scraping timbers echoed through the whole ship oh god fergus marsali whispered listening her voice filled with agony blessed mary save him i silently echoed the prayer thinking of jamie somewhere in the chaos overhead i crossed myself in the dark touching the small spot between my brows that he had kissed a few minutes before not wanting to think that it could so easily be the last touch of him i would ever know suddenly there was an explosion overhead a roar that sent vibrations through the jutting timbers we were sitting on theyre blowing up the ship marsali jumped to her feet panicked theyll sink us we must get out well drown down here wait i called its only the guns but she had not waited to hear i could hear her blundering about in a blind panic whimpering among the blocks of guano marsali come back there was no light at all in the hold i took a few steps through the smothering atmosphere trying to locate her by sound but the deadening effect of the crumbling blocks hid her movements from me there was another booming explosion overhead and a third close on its heels the air was filled with dust loosed from the vibrations and i choked eyes watering i wiped at my eyes with a sleeve and blinked i was not imagining it there was a light in the hold a dim glow that limned the edge of the nearest block marsali i called where are you the answer was a terrified shriek from the direction of the light i dashed around the edge of the block dodged between two others and emerged into the space by the ladder to find marsali in the clutches of a large halfnaked man he was hugely obese the rolling layers of his fat decorated with a stipple of tattoos a jangling necklace of coins and buttons hung round his neck marsali slapped at him shrieking and he jerked his face away impatient then he caught sight of me and his eyes widened he had a wide flat face and a tarred topknot of black hair he grinned nastily at me showing a marked lack of teeth and said something that sounded like slurred spanish let her go i said loudly basta cabrón that was as much spanish as i could summon he seemed to think it funny for he grinned more widely let go of marsali and turned toward me i threw one of my scalpels at him it bounced off his head startling him and he ducked wildly marsali dodged past him and sprang for the ladder the pirate waffled for a moment torn between us but then turned to the ladder leaping up several rungs with an agility that belied his weight he caught marsali by the foot as she dived through the hatch and she screamed cursing incoherently under my breath i ran to the bottom of the ladder and reaching up swung the longhandled amputation knife at his foot as hard as i could there was a highpitched screech from the pirate something flew past my head and a spray of blood spattered across my cheek wethot on my skin startled i dropped back looking down by reflex to see what had fallen it was a small brown toe calloused and blacknailed smudged with dirt the pirate hit the deck beside me with a thud that shivered the floorboards and lunged i ducked but he caught a handful of my sleeve i yanked away ripping fabric and jabbed at his face with the blade in my hand jerking back in surprise he slipped on his own blood and fell i jumped for the ladder and climbed for my life dropping the blade he was so close behind me that he succeeded in catching hold of the hem of my skirt but i pulled it from his grasp and lunged upward lungs burning from the dust of the choking hold the man was shouting a language i didnt know some dim recess of my brain not occupied with immediate survival speculated that it might be portuguese i burst out of the hold onto the deck into the midst of a surging chaos the air was thick with blackpowder smoke and small knots of men were pushing and shoving cursing and stumbling all over the deck i couldnt take time to look around there was a hoarse bellow from the hatchway behind me and i dived for the rail i hesitated for a moment balanced on the narrow wooden strip the sea spun past in a dizzy churn of black below i grasped the rigging and began to climb it was a mistake i knew that almost at once he was a sailor i was not neither was he hampered by wearing a dress the ropes danced and jerked in my hands vibrating under the impact of his weight as he hit the lines below me he was coming up the underside of the lines climbing like a gibbon even as i made my slower way across the upper slope of the rigging he drew even with me and spat in my face i kept climbing propelled by desperation there was nothing else to do he kept pace with me easily hissing words through an evil halftoothed grin it didnt matter what language he was speaking his meaning was perfectly clear hanging by one hand he drew the cutlass from his sash and swung it in a vicious cut that barely missed me i was too frightened even to scream there was nowhere to go nothing to do i squeezed my eyes tight shut and hoped it would be quick it was there was a sort of thump a sharp grunt and a strong smell of fish i opened my eyes the pirate was gone ping an was sitting on the crosstrees three feet away crest erect with irritation wings halfspread to keep his balance gwa he said crossly he turned a beady little yellow eye on me and clacked his bill in warning ping an hated noise and commotion evidently he didnt like portuguese pirates either there were spots before my eyes and i felt lightheaded i clung tight to the rope shaking until i thought i could move again the noise below had slackened now and the tenor of the shouting had changed something had happened i thought it was over there was a new noise a sudden flap of sails and a long grinding sound with a vibration that made the line i was holding sing in my hand it was over the pirate ship was moving away on the far side of the artemis i saw the web of the pirates mast and rigging begin to move black against the silver caribbean sky very very slowly i began the long trip back down the lanterns were still lit below a haze of blackpowder smoke lay over everything and bodies lay here and there about the deck my glance flickered over them as i lowered myself searching for red hair i found it and my heart leapt jamie was sitting on a cask near the wheel with his head tilted back eyes closed a cloth pressed to his brow and a cup of whisky in his hand mr willoughby was on his knees alongside administering first aidin the form of more whiskyto willie macleod who sat against the foremast looking sick i was shaking all over from exertion and reaction i felt giddy and slightly cold shock i supposed and no wonder i could do with a bit of that whisky as well i grasped the smaller lines above the rail and slid the rest of the way to the deck not caring that my palms were skinned raw i was sweating and cold at the same time and the downhairs on my face were prickling unpleasantly i landed clumsily with a thump that made jamie straighten up and open his eyes the look of relief in them pulled me the few feet to him i felt better with the warm solid flesh of his shoulder under my hand are you all right i said leaning over him to look aye its no more than a wee dunt he said smiling up at me there was a small gash at his hairline where something like a pistol butt had caught him but the blood had clotted already there were stains of dark drying blood on the front of his shirt but the sleeve of his shirt was also bloody in fact it was nearly soaked with fresh bright red jamie i clutched at his shoulder my vision going white at the edges you arent all rightlook youre bleeding my hands and feet were numb and i only halffelt his hands grasp my arms as he rose from the cask in sudden alarm the last thing i saw amid flashes of light was his face gone white beneath the tan my god said his frightened voice out of the whirling blackness its no my blood sassenach its yours i am not going to die i said crossly unless its from heat exhaustion take some of this bloody stuff off me marsali who had been tearfully pleading with me not to expire looked rather relieved at this outburst she stopped crying and sniffed hopefully but made no move to remove any of the cloaks coats blankets and other impedimenta in which i was swaddled oh i canna do that mother claire she said da says ye must be kept warm warm im being boiled alive i was in the captains cabin and even with the stern windows wide open the atmosphere belowdecks was stifling hot with sun and acrid with the fumes of the cargo i tried to struggle out from under my wrappings but got no more than a few inches before a bolt of lightning struck me in the right arm the world went dark with small bright flashes zigging through my vision lie still said a stern scots voice through a wave of giddy sickness an arm was under my shoulders a large hand cradling my head aye thats right lie back on my arm all right now sassenach no i said looking at the colored pinwheels inside my eyelids im going to be sick i was and a most unpleasant process it was too with fiery knives being jabbed into my right arm with each spasm jesus h roosevelt christ i said at last gasping finished are ye jamie lowered me carefully and eased my head back onto the pillow if you mean am i dead the answer is unfortunately no i cracked one eyelid open he was kneeling by my berth looking no end piratical himself with a bloodstained strip of cloth bound round his head and still wearing his bloodsoaked shirt he stayed still and so did the cabin so i cautiously opened the other eye he smiled faintly at me no youre no dead fergus will be glad to hear it as though this had been a signal the frenchmans head poked anxiously into the cabin seeing me awake his face broke into a dazzling smile and disappeared i could hear his voice overhead loudly informing the crew of my survival to my profound embarrassment the news was greeted with a rousing cheer from the upper deck what happened i asked what happened jamie pouring water into a cup stopped and stared over the rim at me he knelt down again beside me snorting and raised my head for a sip of water what happened she says aye what indeed i tell ye to stay all snug below wi marsali and next thing i ken yeve dropped out of the sky and landed at my feet sopping wi blood he shoved his face into the berth and glared at me sufficiently impressive when cleanshaven and unhurt he was considerably more ferocious when viewed stubbled bloodstained and angry at a distance of six inches i promptly shut my eyes again look at me he said peremptorily and i did against my better judgment blue eyes bored into mine narrowed with fury dye ken ye came damn close to dying he demanded yeve a bonedeep slash down your arm from oxter to elbow and had i not got a cloth round it in time yed be feeding the sharks this minute one big fist crashed down on the side of the berth next to me making me start the movement hurt my arm but i didnt make a sound damn ye woman will ye never do as youre told probably not i said meekly he turned a black scowl on me but i could see the corner of his mouth twitching under the copper stubble god he said longingly what i wouldna give to have ye tied facedown over a gun and me wi a ropes end in my hand he snorted again and pulled his face out of the berth willoughby he bellowed in short order mr willoughby trotted in beaming with a steaming pot of tea and a bottle of brandy on a tray tea i breathed struggling to sit up ambrosia in spite of the stifling atmosphere of the cabin the hot tea was just what i needed the delightful brandylaced stuff slid down my throat and glowed peacefully in the pit of my quivering stomach nobody makes tea better than the english i said inhaling the aroma except the chinese mr willoughby beamed in gratification and bowed ceremoniously jamie snorted again bringing his total up to three for the afternoon aye well enjoy it while ye can this sounded more or less sinister and i stared at him over the rim of the cup and just what do you mean by that i demanded im going to doctor your arm when youre finished he informed me he picked up the pot and peered into it how much blood did ye tell me a person has in his body he asked about eight quarts i said bewildered why he lowered the pot and glared at me because he said precisely judging from the amount ye left on the deck youve maybe four of them left here have some more he refilled the cup set down the pot and stalked out im afraid jamies rather annoyed with me i observed ruefully to mr willoughby not angry he said comfortingly tseimi scared very bad the little chinaman laid a hand on my right shoulder delicate as a resting butterfly this hurts i sighed to be perfectly honest i said yes it does mr willoughby smiled and patted me gently i help he said consolingly later in spite of the throbbing in my arm i was feeling sufficiently restored to inquire about the rest of the crew whose injuries as reported by mr willoughby were limited to cuts and bruises plus one concussion and a minor arm fracture a clatter in the passage heralded jamies return accompanied by fergus who carried my medicine box under one arm and yet another bottle of brandy in his hand all right i said resigned lets have a look at it i was no stranger to horrible wounds and this onetechnically speakingwas not all that bad on the other hand it was my own personal flesh involved here and i was not disposed to be technical ooh i said rather faintly while being a bit picturesque about the nature of the wound jamie had also been quite accurate it was a long cleanedged slash running at a slight angle across the front of my biceps from the shoulder to an inch or so above the elbow joint and while i couldnt actually see the bone of my humerus it was without doubt a very deep wound gaping widely at the edges it was still bleeding in spite of the cloth that had been wrapped tightly round it but the seepage was slow no major vessels seemed to have been severed jamie had flipped open my medical box and was rootling meditatively through it with one large forefinger youll need sutures and a needle i said feeling a sudden jolt of alarm as it occurred to me that i was about to have thirty or forty stitches taken in my arm with no anesthesia bar brandy no laudanum jamie asked frowning into the box evidently he had been thinking along the same lines no i used it all on the porpoise controlling the shaking of my left hand i poured a sizable tot of straight brandy into my empty teacup and took a healthy mouthful that was thoughtful of you fergus i said nodding at the fresh brandy bottle as i sipped but i dont think its going to take two bottles given the potency of jareds french brandy it was unlikely to take more than a teacupful i was wondering whether it was more advisable to get dead drunk at once or to stay at least halfsober in order to supervise operations there wasnt a chance in hell that i could do the suturing myself lefthanded and shaking like a leaf neither could fergus do it onehanded true jamies big hands could move with amazing lightness over some tasks but jamie interrupted my apprehensions shaking his head and picking up the second bottle this ones no for drinking sassenach thats for washing out the wound what in my state of shock i had forgotten the necessity for disinfection lacking anything better i normally washed out wounds with distilled grain alcohol cut half and half with water but i had used my supply of that as well in our encounter with the manofwar i felt my lips go slightly numb and not just because the internal brandy was taking effect highlanders were among the most stoic and courageous of warriors and seamen as a class werent far behind i had seen such men lie uncomplaining while i set broken bones did minor surgery sewed up terrible wounds and put them through hell generally but when it came to disinfection with alcohol it was a different storythe screams could be heard for miles erwait a minute i said maybe just a little boiled water jamie was watching me not without sympathy it willna get easier wi waiting sassenach he said fergus take the bottle and before i could protest he had lifted me out of the berth and sat down with me on his lap holding me tight about the body pinning my left arm so i couldnt struggle while he took my right wrist in a firm grip and held my wounded arm out to the side i believe it was bloody old ernest hemingway who said youre supposed to pass out from pain but unfortunately you never do all i can say in response to that is that either ernest had a fine distinction for states of consciousness or else no one ever poured brandy on several cubic inches of his raw flesh to be fair i suppose i must not absolutely have lost consciousness myself since when i began noticing things again fergus was saying please milady you must not scream like that it upsets the men clearly it upset fergus his lean face was pale and droplets of sweat ran down his jaw he was right about the men tooseveral faces were peering into the cabin from door and window wearing expressions of horror and concern i summoned the presence of mind to nod weakly at them jamies arm was still locked about my middle i couldnt tell which of us was shaking both i thought i made it into the wide captains chair with considerable assistance and lay back palpitating the fire in my arm still sizzling jamie was holding one of my curved suture needles and a length of sterilized catgut looking as dubious over the prospects as i felt it was mr willoughby who intervened quietly taking the needle from jamies hands i can do this he said in tones of authority a moment and he disappeared aft presumably to fetch something jamie didnt protest and neither did i we heaved twin sighs of relief in fact which made me laugh and to think i said i once told bree that big men were kind and gentle and the short ones tended to be nasty well i suppose theres always the exception that proves the rule no he mopped my streaming face with a wet cloth quite gently i dinna want to know how ye did this he said with a sigh but for gods sake sassenach dont do it again well i didnt intend to do anything i began crossly when i was interrupted by the return of mr willoughby he was carrying the little roll of green silk i had seen when he cured jamies seasickness oh yeve got the wee stabbers jamie peered interestedly at the small gold needles then smiled at me dinna fash yourself sassenach they dont hurtor not much anyway he added mr willoughbys fingers probed the palm of my right hand prodding here and there then he grasped each of my fingers wiggled it and pulled it gently so that i felt the joints pop slightly then he laid two fingers at the base of my wrist pressing down in the space between the radius and the ulna this is the inner gate he said softly here is quiet here is peace i sincerely hoped he was right picking up one of the tiny gold needles he placed the point over the spot he had marked and with a dexterous twirl of thumb and forefinger pierced the skin the prick made me jump but he kept a tight warm hold on my hand and i relaxed again he placed three needles in each wrist and a rakish porcupinelike spray on the crest of my right shoulder i was getting interested despite my guinea pig status beyond an initial prick at placement the needles caused no discomfort mr willoughby was humming in a low soothing sort of way tapping and pressing places on my neck and shoulder i couldnt honestly tell whether my right arm was numbed or whether i was simply distracted by the goingson but it did feel somewhat less agonizedat least until he picked up the suture needle and began jamie was sitting on a stool by my left side holding my left hand as he watched my face after a moment he said rather gruffly let your breath out sassenach its no going to get any worse than that i let go of the breath i hadnt realized i was holding and realized as well what he was telling me it was dread of being hurt that had me rigid as a board in the chair the actual pain of the stitches was unpleasant all right but nothing i couldnt stand i let my breath out cautiously and gave him a rough approximation of a smile mr willoughby was singing under his breath in chinese jamie had translated the words for me a week earlier it was a pillowsong in which a young man catalogued the physical charms of his partner one by one i hoped he would finish the stitching before he got to her feet thats a verra wicked slash jamie said eyes on mr willoughbys work i preferred not to look myself a parang was it or a cutlass i wonder i think it was a cutlass i said in fact i know it was he came after i wonder what led them to attack us jamie said not paying any attention to me his brows were drawn in speculation it canna ha been the cargo after all i shouldnt think so i said but maybe they didnt know what we were carrying this seemed grossly unlikely any ship that came within a hundred yards of us would have knownthe ammoniac reek of bat guano hovered round us like a miasma perhaps its only they thought the ship small enough to take the artemis itself would bring a fair price cargo or no i blinked as mr willoughby paused in his song to tie a knot i thought he was down to the navel by now but wasnt paying close attention do we know the name of the pirate ship i asked granted theres likely a lot of pirates in these waters but we do know that the bruja was in this area three days ago and thats what im wondering he said i couldna see a great deal in the darkness but she was the right size wi that wide spanish beam well the pirate that was after me spoke i started but the sound of voices in the corridor made me stop fergus edged in shy of interrupting but obviously bursting with excitement he held something shiny and jingling in one hand milord he said maitland has found a dead pirate on the forward deck jamies red brows went up and he looked from fergus to me dead very dead milord said fergus with a small shudder maitland was peeking over his shoulder anxious to claim his share of the glory oh yes sir he assured jamie earnestly dead as a doornail his poor heads bashed in something shocking all three men turned and stared at me i gave them a modest little smile jamie rubbed a hand over his face his eyes were bloodshot and a trickle of blood had dried in front of his ear sassenach he began in measured tones i tried to tell you i said virtuously between shock brandy acupuncture and the dawning realization of survival i was beginning to feel quite pleasantly lightheaded i scarcely noticed mr willoughbys final efforts he was wearing this milord fergus stepped forward and laid the pirates necklace on the table in front of us it had the silver buttons from a military uniform polished kona nuts several large sharks teeth pieces of polished abalone shell and chunks of mother of pearl and a large number of jingling coins all pierced for stringing on a leather thong i thought you should see this at once milord fergus continued he reached out a hand and lifted one of the shimmering coins it was silver untarnished and through the gathering brandy haze i could see on its face the twin heads of alexander a tetradrachm of the fourth century bc mint condition thoroughly worn out by the events of the afternoon i had fallen asleep at once the pain in my arm dulled by brandy now it was full dark and the brandy had worn off my arm seemed to swell and throb with each beat of my heart and any small movement sent tiny jabs of a sharper pain whipping through my arm like warning flicks of a scorpions tail the moon was threequarters full a huge lopsided shape like a golden teardrop hanging just above the horizon the ship heeled slightly and the moon slid slowly out of sight the man in the moon leering rather unpleasantly as he went i was hot and possibly a trifle feverish there was a jug of water in the cupboard on the far side of the cabin i felt weak and giddy as i swung my feet over the edge of the berth and my arm registered a strong protest against being disturbed i must have made some sound for the darkness on the floor of the cabin stirred suddenly and jamies voice came drowsily from the region of my feet are ye hurting sassenach a little i said not wanting to be dramatic about it i set my lips and rose unsteadily to my feet cradling my right elbow in my left hand thats good he said thats good i said my voice rising indignantly there was a soft chuckle from the darkness and he sat up his head popping suddenly into sight as it rose above the shadows into the moonlight aye it is he said when a wound begins to hurt ye it means its healing ye didna feel it when it happened did you no i admitted i certainly felt it now the air was a good deal cooler out on the open sea and the salt wind coming through the window felt good on my face i was damp and sticky with sweat and the thin chemise clung to my breasts i could see ye didnt thats what frightened me ye never feel a fatal wound sassenach he said softly i laughed shortly but cut it off as the movement jarred my arm and how do you know that i asked fumbling lefthanded to pour water into a cup not the sort of thing youd learn firsthand i mean murtagh told me the water seemed to purl soundlessly into the cup the sound of its pouring lost in the hiss of the bowwave outside i set down the jug and lifted the cup the surface of the water black in the moonlight jamie had never mentioned murtagh to me in the months of our reunion i had asked fergus who told me that the wiry little scot had died at culloden but he knew no more than the bare fact at culloden jamies voice was barely loud enough to be heard above the creak of timber and the whirring of the wind that bore us along did ye ken they burnt the bodies there i wondered listening to them do itwhat it would be like inside the fire when it came my turn i could hear him swallow above the creaking of the ship i found that out this morning the moonlight robbed his face of depth and color he looked like a skull with the broad clean planes of cheek and jawbone white and his eyes black empty pits i went to culloden meaning to die he said his voice scarcely more than a whisper not the rest of them i should have been happy to stop a musket ball at once and yet i cut my way across the field and halfway back while men on either side o me were blown to bloody bits he stood up then looking down at me why he said why claire why am i alive and they are not i dont know i said softly for your sister and your family maybe for me they had families he said wives and sweethearts children to mourn them and yet they are gone and i am still here i dont know jamie i said at last i touched his cheek already roughened by newly sprouting beard irrepressible evidence of life you arent ever going to know he sighed his cheekbone pressed against my palm for a moment aye i ken that well enough but i canna help the asking when i think of themespecially murtagh he turned restlessly away his eyes empty shadows and i knew he walked drumossie moor again with the ghosts we should have gone sooner the men had been standing for hours starved and halffrozen but they waited for his highness to give the order to charge and charles stuart perched safely on a rock well behind the line of battle having seized personal command of his troops for the first time had dithered and delayed and the english cannon had had time to bear squarely on the lines of ragged highlanders and opened fire it was a relief i think jamie said softly every man on the field knew the cause was lost and we were dead and still we stood there watching the english guns come up and the cannon mouths open black before us no one spoke i couldna hear anything but the wind and the english soldiers shouting on the other side of the field and then the guns had roared and men had fallen and those still standing rallied by a late and ragged order had seized their swords and charged the enemy the sound of their gaelic shrieking drowned by the guns lost in the wind the smoke was so thick i couldna see more than a few feet before me i kicked off my shoon and ran into it shouting the bloodless line of his lips turned up slightly i was happy he said sounding a bit surprised not scairt at all i meant to die after all there was nothing to fear except that i might be wounded and not die at once but i would die and then it would be all over and i would find ye again and it would be all right i moved closer to him and his hand rose up from the shadows to take mine men fell to either side of me and i could hear the grapeshot and the musket balls hum past my head like bumblebees but i wasna touched he had reached the british lines unscathed one of very few highlanders to have completed the charge across culloden moor an english gun crew looked up startled at the tall highlander who burst from the smoke like a demon the blade of his broadsword gleaming with rain and then dull with blood there was a small part of my mind that asked why i should be killin them he said reflectively for surely i knew that we were lost there was no gain to it but there is a lust to killingyoull know that his fingers tightened on mine questioning and i squeezed back in affirmation i couldna stopor i would not his voice was quiet without bitterness or recrimination its a verra old feeling i think the wish to take an enemy with ye to the grave i could feel it there a hot red thing in my chest and belly andi gave myself to it he ended simply there were four men tending the cannon none armed with more than a pistol and knife none expecting attack at such close quarters they stood helpless against the berserk strength of his despair and he killed them all the ground shook under my feet he said and i was near deafened by the noise i couldna think and then it came to me that i was behind the english guns a soft chuckle came from below a verra poor place to try to be killed no so he had started back across the moor to join the highland dead he was sitting against a tussock near the middle of the fieldmurtagh hed been struck a dozen times at least and there was a dreadful wound in his headi knew he was dead he hadnt been though when jamie had fallen to his knees beside his godfather and taken the small body in his arms murtaghs eyes had opened he saw me and he smiled and then the older mans hand had touched his cheek briefly dinna be afraid a bhalaich murtagh had said using the endearment for a small beloved boy it doesna hurt a bit to die i stood quietly for a long time holding jamies hand then he sighed and his other hand closed very very gently about my wounded arm too many folk have died sassenach because they knew meor suffered for the knowing i would give my own body to save ye a moments painand yet i could wish to close my hand just now that i might hear ye cry out and know for sure that i havena killed you too i leaned forward pressing a kiss on the skin of his chest he slept naked in the heat you havent killed me you didnt kill murtagh and well find ian take me back to bed jamie sometime later as i drowsed on the edge of sleep he spoke from the floor beside my bed ye know i seldom wanted to go home to laoghaire he said contemplatively and yet at least when i did id find her where id left her i turned my head to the side where his soft breathing came from the darkened floor oh and is that the kind of wife you want the sort who stays put he made a small sound between a chuckle and a cough but didnt answer and after a few moments the sound of his breathing changed to a soft rhythmic snore ishmael i slept restlessly and woke up late and feverish with a throbbing headache just behind my eyes i felt ill enough not to protest when marsali insisted on bathing my forehead but relaxed gratefully eyes closed enjoying the cool touch of the vinegarsoaked cloth on my pounding temples it was so soothing in fact that i drifted off to sleep again after she left i was dreaming uneasily of dark mine shafts and the chalk of charred bones when i was suddenly roused by a crash that brought me bolt upright and sent a shaft of pure white pain ripping through my head what i exclaimed clutching my head in both hands as though this might prevent it falling off what is it the window had been covered to keep the light from disturbing me and it took a moment for my stunned vision to adapt to the dimness on the opposite side of the cabin a large figure was mimicking me clutching its own head in apparent agony then it spoke releasing a volley of very bad language in a mixture of chinese french and gaelic damn it said the exclamations tapering off into milder english goddamn it to hell jamie staggered to the window still rubbing the head he had smashed on the edge of my cupboard he shoved aside the covering and pushed the window open bringing a welcome draft of fresh air in along with a dazzle of light what in the name of bloody hell do you think youre doing i demanded with considerable asperity the light jabbed my tender eyeballs like needles and the movement involved in clutching my head had done the stitches in my arm no good at all i was looking for your medicine box he replied wincing as he felt the crown of his head damn ive caved in my skull look at that he thrust two fingers slightly smeared with blood under my nose i dropped the vinegarsoaked cloth over the fingers and collapsed back on my pillow why do you need the medicine box and why didnt you ask me in the first place instead of bumping around like a bee in a bottle i said irritably i didna want to wake ye from your sleep he said sheepishly enough that i laughed despite the various throbbings going on in my anatomy thats all right i wasnt enjoying it i assured him why do you need the box is someone hurt aye i am he said dabbing gingerly at the top of his head with the cloth and scowling at the result ye dinna want to look at my head the answer to this was not especially but i obligingly motioned to him to bend over presenting the top of his head for inspection there was a reasonably impressive lump under the thick hair with a small cut from the edge of the shelf but the damage seemed a bit short of concussion its not fractured i assured him you have the thickest skull ive ever seen moved by an instinct as old as motherhood i leaned forward and kissed the bump gently he lifted his head eyes wide with surprise thats supposed to make it feel better i explained a smile tugged at the corner of his mouth oh well then he bent down and gently kissed the bandage on my wounded arm better he inquired straightening up lots he laughed and reaching for the decanter poured out a tot of whisky which he handed to me i wanted that stuff ye use to wash out scrapes and such he explained pouring another for himself hawthorn lotion i havent got any readymade because it doesnt keep i said pushing myself upright if its urgent though i can brew some it doesnt take long the thought of getting up and walking to the galley was daunting but perhaps id feel better once i was moving not urgent he assured me its only theres a prisoner in the hold whos a bit bashed about i lowered my cup blinking at him a prisoner where did we get a prisoner from the pirate ship he frowned at his whisky though i dinna think hes a pirate what is he he tossed off the whisky neatly in one gulp and shook his head damned if i know from the scars on his back likely a runaway slave but in that case i canna think why he did what he did what did he do dived off the bruja into the sea macgregor saw him go and then after the bruja made sail he saw the man bobbing about in the waves and threw him a rope well that is funny why should he do that i asked i was becoming interested and the throbbing in my head seemed to be lessening as i sipped my whisky jamie ran his fingers through his hair and stopped wincing i dinna ken sassenach he said gingerly smoothing the hair on his crown flat it wouldna be likely for a crew like ours to try to board the pirateany merchant would just fight them off theres no reason to try to take them but if he didna mean to escape from usperhaps he meant to escape from them aye the last golden drops of the whisky ran down my throat it was jareds special blend the nexttolast bottle and thoroughly justified the name he had given itceò gheasacach magic mist feeling somewhat restored i pushed myself upright if hes hurt perhaps i should take a look at him i suggested swinging my feet out of the berth given jamies behavior of the day before i fully expected him to press me flat and call for marsali to come and sit on my chest instead he looked at me thoughtfully and nodded aye well if yere sure ye can stand sassenach i wasnt all that sure but gave it a try the room tilted when i stood up and black and yellow spots danced before my eyes but i stayed upright clinging to jamies arm after a moment a small amount of blood reluctantly consented to reenter my head and the spots went away showing jamies face looking anxiously down at me all right i said taking a deep breath carry on the prisoner was below in what the crew called the orlop a lowerdeck space full of miscellaneous cargo there was a small timbered area walled off at the bow of the ship that sometimes housed drunk or unruly seamen and here he had been secured it was dark and airless down in the bowels of the ship and i felt myself becoming dizzy again as i made my way slowly along the companionway behind jamie and the glow of his lantern when he unlocked the door at first i saw nothing at all in the makeshift brig then as jamie stooped to enter with his lantern the shine of the mans eyes betrayed his presence black as the ace of spades was the first thought that popped into my slightly addled mind as the edges of face and form took shape against the darkness of the timbers no wonder jamie had thought him a runaway slave the man looked african not islandborn besides the deep redblack of his skin his demeanor wasnt that of a man raised as a slave he was sitting on a cask hands bound behind his back and feet tied together but i saw his head rise and his shoulders straighten as jamie ducked under the lintel of the tiny space he was very thin but very muscular clad in nothing but a ragged pair of trousers the lines of his body were clear he was tensed for attack or defense but not submission jamie saw it too and motioned me to stay well back against the wall he placed the lantern on a cask and squatted down before the captive at eyelevel amiki he said spreading out his empty hands palm up amiki benebene friend is good it was takitaki the allpurpose pidgin polyglot that the traders from barbados to trinidad spoke in the ports the man stared impassively at jamie for a moment eyes still as tide pools then one eyebrow flicked up and he extended his bound feet before him benebene amiki he said with an ironic intonation that couldnt be missed whatever the language is good friend jamie snorted briefly amused and rubbed a finger under his nose its a point he said in english does he speak english or french i moved a little closer the captives eyes rested on me for a moment then passed away indifferent if he does hell no admit it picard and fergus tried talking to him last night he willna say a word just stares at them what he just said is the first hes spoken since he came aboard àhabla español he said suddenly to the prisoner there was no response the man didnt even look at jamie just went on staring impassively at the square of open doorway behind me er sprechen sie deutsche i said tentatively he didnt answer which was just as well as the question had exhausted my own supply of german nicht hollander either i dont suppose jamie shot me a sardonic look i canna tell much about him sassenach but im fairly sure hes no a dutchman they have slaves on eleuthera dont they thats a dutch island i said irritably or st croixthats danish isnt it slowly as my mind was working this morning it hadnt escaped me that the captive was our only clue to the pirates whereaboutsand the only frail link to ian do you know enough takitaki to ask him about ian jamie shook his head eyes intent on the prisoner no besides what i said to him already i ken how to say not good how much give it to me and drop that ye bastard none of which seems a great deal to the point at present stymied for the moment we stared at the prisoner who stared impassively back to hell with it jamie said suddenly he drew the dirk from his belt went behind the cask and sawed through the thongs around the prisoners wrists he cut the ankle bindings as well then sat back on his heels the knife laid across his thigh friend he said firmly in takitaki is good the prisoner didnt say anything but after a moment he nodded slightly his expression warily quizzical theres a chamber pot in the corner jamie said in english rising and sheathing his dirk use it and then my wife will tend your wounds a very faint flicker of amusement crossed the mans face he nodded once more this time in acceptance of defeat he rose slowly from the cask and turned stiff hands fumbling at his trousers i looked askance at jamie its one of the worst things about being bound that way he explained matteroffactly ye canna take a piss by yourself i see i said not wanting to think about how he knew that that and the pain in your shoulders he said be careful touching him sassenach the note of warning in his voice was clear and i nodded it wasnt the mans shoulders he was concerned about i still felt lightheaded and the stuffiness of the surroundings had made my headache throb again but i was less battered than the prisoner who had indeed been bashed about at some stage of the proceedings bashed though he was his injuries seemed largely superficial a swollen knot rose on the mans forehead and a deep scrape had left a crusted reddish patch on one shoulder he was undoubtedly bruised in a number of places but given the remarkably deep shade of his skin and the darkness of the surroundings i couldnt tell where there were deep bands of rawness on ankles and wrists where he had pulled against the thongs i hadnt made any of the hawthorn lotion but i had brought the jar of gentian salve i eased myself down on the deck next to him but he took no more notice of me than of the deck beneath his feet even when i began to spread the cool blue cream on his wounds what was more interesting than the fresh injuries though were the healed ones at close range i could see the faint white lines of three parallel slashes running across the slope of each cheekbone and a series of three short vertical lines on the high narrow forehead just between his brows tribal scars africanborn for sure then such scars were made during manhood rituals or so murphy had told me his flesh was warm and smooth under my fingers slicked with sweat i felt warm too sweaty and unwell the deck rose gently beneath me and i put my hand on his back to keep my balance the thin tough lines of healed whipstrokes webbed his shoulders like the furrows of tiny worms beneath his skin the feel of them was unexpected so much like the feel of the marks on jamies own back i swallowed feeling queasy but went on with my doctoring the man ignored me completely even when i touched spots i knew must be painful his eyes were fixed on jamie who was watching the prisoner with equal intentness the problem was plain the man was almost certainly a runaway slave he hadnt wanted to speak to us for fear that his speech would give away his owners island and that we would then find out his original owner and return him to captivity now we knew that he spokeor at least understoodenglish it was bound to increase his wariness even if we assured him that it was not our intention either to return him to an owner or to enslave him ourselves he was unlikely to trust us i couldnt say that i blamed him under the circumstances on the other hand this man was our bestand possibly the onlychance of finding out what had happened to ian murray aboard the bruja when at length i had bandaged the mans wrists and ankles jamie gave me a hand to rise then spoke to the prisoner youll be hungry i expect he said come along to the cabin and well eat not waiting for a response he took my good arm and turned to the door there was silence behind us as we moved into the corridor but when i looked back the slave was there following a few feet behind jamie led us to my cabin disregarding the curious glances of the sailors we passed only stopping by fergus long enough to order food to be sent from the galley back to bed with ye sassenach he said firmly when we reached the cabin i didnt argue my arm hurt my head hurt and i could feel little waves of heat flickering behind my eyes it looked as though i would have to break down and use a little of the precious penicillin on myself after all there was still a chance that my body could throw off the infection but i couldnt afford to wait too long jamie had poured out a glass of whisky for me and another for our guest still wary the man accepted it and took a sip eyes widening in surprise i supposed scotch whisky must be a novelty to him jamie took a glass for himself and sat down motioning the slave to the other seat across the small table my name is fraser he said i am captain here my wife he added with a nod toward my berth the prisoner hesitated but then set down his glass with an air of decision they be callin me ishmael he said in a voice like honey poured over coal i aint no pirate i be a cook murphys going to like that i remarked but jamie ignored me there was a faint line between the ruddy brows as he felt his way into the conversation a ships cook he asked taking care to make his voice sound casual only the tap of his two stiff fingers against his thigh betrayed himand that only to me no mon i dont got nothin to do with that ship ishmael was vehement they taken me off the shore say they kill me i don go long by them be easy i aint no pirate he repeated and it dawned on me belatedly that of course he wouldnt wish to be taken for a piratewhether he was one or not piracy was punishable by hanging and he could have no way of knowing that we were as eager as he to stay clear of the royal navy aye i see jamie hit the right balance between soothing and skeptical he leaned back slightly in the big wheelbacked chair and how did the bruja come to take ye prisoner then not where he added quickly as a look of alarm flitted across the prisoners face ye needna tell me where ye came from thats of no concern to me only i should care to know how ye came to fall into their hands and how long yeve been with them since as ye say ye werena one of them the hint was broad enough to spread butter on we didnt mean to return him to his owner however if he didnt oblige with information we might just turn him over to the crown as a pirate the prisoners eyes darkened no fool he had grasped the point at once his head twitched briefly sideways and his eyes narrowed i be catchin fish by the river he said big ship he come sailin up the river slow little boats be pullin him men in the little boat they see me holler out i drop the fish be runnin but they close by they men jump out kotch me by the cane field figure they take me to sell thas all mon he shrugged signaling the conclusion of his story aye i see jamies eyes were intent on the prisoner he hesitated wanting to ask where the river was but not quite daring to for fear the man would clam up again while ye were on the shipdid ye see any boys among the crew or as prisoners too boys young men the mans eyes widened slightly he hadnt been expecting that he paused warily but then nodded with a faintly derisive glint in his eye yes mon they have boys why you be wantin one his glance flicked to me and then back to jamie one eyebrow raised jamies head jerked and a slight flush rose on his cheekbones at the implication i do he said levelly i am looking for a young kinsman who was taken by pirates i should feel myself greatly obliged to anyone who might assist me in finding him he lifted one eyebrow significantly the prisoner grunted slightly his nostrils flaring that so what you be doin for me i be helpin you fin this boy i should set you ashore at any port of your choosing with a fair sum in gold jamie replied but of course i should require proof that ye did have knowledge of my nephews whereabouts aye huh the prisoner was still wary but beginning to relax you tell me monwhat this boy be like jamie hesitated for a moment studying the prisoner but then shook his head no he said thoughtfully i dinna think that will work you describe to me such lads as ye saw on the pirate vessel the prisoner eyed jamie for a moment then broke out in a low rich laugh you no particular fool mon he said you know that i know that jamie said dryly so long as ye know it as well tell me then ishmael snorted briefly but complied pausing only to refresh himself from the tray of food fergus had brought fergus himself lounged against the door watching the prisoner through halflidded eyes they be twelve boys talkin strange like you jamies eyebrows shot up and he exchanged a glance of astonishment with me twelve like me he said white boys english or scots dye mean ishmael shook his head in incomprehension scot was not in his vocabulary talkin like dogs fightin he explained grrrr wuff he growled shaking his head in illustration like a dog worrying a rat and i saw ferguss shoulders shake in suppressed hilarity scots for sure i said trying not to laugh jamie shot me a brief dirty look then returned his attention to ishmael verra well then he said exaggerating his natural soft burr twelve scottish lads what did they look like ishmael squinted dubiously chewing a piece of mango from the tray he wiped the juice from the corner of his mouth and shook his head i only see them once mon tell you all i see though he closed his eyes and frowned the vertical lines on his forehead drawing close together four boys be yellowhaired six brown two with black hair two shorter than me one maybe the size that griffone therehe nodded toward fergus who stiffened in outrage at the insultone big not so big as you aye and how will they have been dressed slowly carefully jamie drew him through the descriptions asking for details demanding comparisonshow tall how fat what color eyescarefully concealing the direction of his interest as he drew the man further into conversation my head had stopped spinning but the fatigue was still there weighting my senses i let my eyes close obscurely soothed by the deep murmuring voices jamie did sound rather like a big fierce dog i thought with his soft growling burr and the abrupt clipped sound of his consonants wuff i murmured under my breath and my belly muscles quivered slightly under my folded hands ishmaels voice was just as deep but smooth and low rich as hot chocolate made with cream i began to drift lulled by the sound of it he sounded like joe abernathy i thought drowsily dictating an autopsy reportunvarnished and unappetizing physical details related in a voice like a deep golden lullaby i could see joes hands in memory dark on the pale skin of an accident victim moving swiftly as he made his verbal notes to the tape recorder deceased is a tall man approximately six feet in height and slender in build a tall man slender that one he bein tall bein thin i came awake suddenly heart pounding hearing the echo of joes voice coming from the table a few feet away no i said quite suddenly and all three men stopped and looked at me in surprise i pushed back the weight of my damp hair and waved weakly at them dont mind me i was dreaming i think they returned to their conversation and i lay still eyes halfclosed but no longer sleepy there was no physical resemblance joe was stocky and bearlike this ishmael slender and lean though the swell of muscle over the curve of his shoulder suggested considerable strength joes face was broad and amiable this mans narrow and waryeyed with a high forehead that made his tribal scars the more striking joes skin was the color of fresh coffee ishmaels the deep redblack of a burning ember which stern had told me was characteristic of slaves from the guinea coastnot so highly prized as the blueblack senegalese but more valuable than the yellowbrown yaga and congolese but if i closed my eyes entirely i could hear joes voice speaking even allowing for the faint caribbean lilt of slaveenglish i cracked my eyelids and looked carefully searching for any signs of resemblance there were none but i did see what i had seen before and not noticed among the other scars and marks on the mans battered torso what i had thought merely a scrape was in fact a deep abrasion that overlay a wide flat scar cut in the form of a rough square just below the point of the shoulder the mark was raw and pink newly healed i should have seen it at once if not for the darkness of the orlop and the scrape that obscured it i lay quite still trying to remember no slave name joe had said derisively referring to his sons selfchristening clearly ishmael had cut away an owners brand to prevent identification should he be recaptured but whose and surely the name ishmael was no more than coincidence maybe not so farfetched a one though ishmael almost certainly wasnt the mans real name they be callin me ishmael he had said that too was a slave name given him by one owner or another and if young lenny had been climbing his family tree as it seemed what more likely than that he should have chosen one of his ancestors given names in symbol if but if he was i lay looking up at the claustrophobic ceiling of the berth suppositions spinning through my head whether this man had any link with joe or not the possibility had reminded me of something jamie was catechizing the man about the personnel and structure of the brujafor so the ship that had attacked us had beenbut i was paying no attention i sat up cautiously so as not to make the dizziness worse and signaled to fergus i need air i said help me up on deck will you jamie glanced at me with a hint of worry but i smiled reassuringly at him and took ferguss arm where are the papers for that slave we bought on barbados i demanded as soon as we were out of earshot of the cabin and wheres the slave for that matter fergus looked at me curiously but obligingly rummaged in his coat i have the papers here milady he said handing them to me as for the slave i believe he is in the crews quarters why he added unable to restrain his curiosity i ignored the question fumbling through the grubby repellent bits of paper there it is i said finding the bit i remembered jamie reading to me abernathy it was abernathy branded on the left shoulder with a fleurdelys did you notice that mark fergus he shook his head looking mildly bewildered no milady then come with me i said turning toward the crews quarters i want to see how big it is the mark was about three inches long and three wide a flower surmounting the initial a burned into the skin a few inches below the point of the shoulder it was the right size and in the right place to match the scar on the man ishmael it wasnt however a fleurdelys that had been the mistake of a careless transcriber it was a sixteenpetaled rosethe jacobite emblem of charles stuart i blinked at it in amazement what patriotic exile had chosen this bizarre method of maintaining allegiance to the vanquished stuarts milady i think you should return to your bed fergus said he was frowning at me as i stooped over temeraire who bore this inspection as stolidly as everything else you are the color of goose turds and milord will not like it at all if i allow you to fall down on the deck i wont fall down i assured him and i dont care what color i am i think weve just had a stroke of luck listen fergus i want you to do something for me anything milady he said grabbing me by the elbow as a shift in the wind sent me staggering across the suddenly tilting deck but not he added firmly until you are safely back in your bed i allowed him to lead me back to the cabin for i really didnt feel at all well but not before giving him my instructions as we entered the cabin jamie stood up from the table to greet us there ye are sassenach are ye all right he asked frowning down at me yeve gone a nasty color like a spoilt custard i am perfectly fine i said through my teeth easing myself down on the bunk to avoid jarring my arm have you and mr ishmael finished your conversation jamie glanced at the prisoner and i saw the flat black gaze that locked with his the atmosphere between them was not hostile but it was charged in some way jamie nodded in dismissal weve finishedfor the moment he said he turned to fergus see our guest below will ye fergus and see to it that hes fed and clothed he remained standing until ishmael had left under ferguss wing then he sat down beside my berth and squinted into the darkness at me ye look awful he said had i best fetch your kit and be feeding ye a wee tonic or somesuch no i said jamie listeni think i know where our friend ishmael came from he lifted one brow you do i explained about the scar on ishmael and the almost matching brand on the slave temeraire without mentioning what had given me the idea in the first place five will get you ten that they came from the same placefrom this mrs abernathys on jamaica i said five will och he said waving away my confusing reference in the interests of continuing the discussion well ye could be right sassenach and i hope so the wily black bastard wouldna say where he was from not that i can blame him he added fairly god if id got away from such a life theres no power on earth would take me back he spoke with a surprising vehemence no i wouldnt blame him either i said but what did he tell you about the boys has he seen young ian the frowning lines of his face relaxed aye im almost sure he has one fist curled on his knee in anticipation two of the lads he described could be ian and knowin it was the bruja i canna think otherwise and if youre right about where hes come from sassenach we might have himwe may find him at last ishmael while refusing to give any clue as to where the bruja had picked him up had gone so far as to say that the twelve boysall prisonershad been taken off the ship together soon after his own capture twelve lads jamie repeated his momentary look of excitement fading back into a frown what in the name of god would someone be wanting to kidnap twelve lads from scotland perhaps hes a collector i said feeling more lightheaded by the moment coins and gems and scottish boys ye think whoevers got ian has the treasure as well he glanced curiously at me i dont know i said feeling suddenly very tired i yawned rackingly we may know for sure about ishmael though i told fergus to see that temeraire gets a look at him if they are from the same place i yawned again my body seeking the oxygen that loss of blood had deprived me of thats verra sensible of ye sassenach jamie said sounding faintly surprised that i was capable of sense for that matter i was a little surprised myself my thoughts were becoming more fragmented by the moment and it was an effort to keep talking logically jamie saw it he patted my hand and stood up ye dinna trouble yourself about it now sassenach rest and ill send marsali down wi some tea whisky i said and he laughed all right then whisky he agreed he smoothed my hair back and leaning into the berth kissed my hot forehead better he asked smiling lots i smiled back and closed my eyes turtle soup when i woke again in the late afternoon i ached all over i had thrown off the covers in my sleep and lay sprawled in my shift my skin hot and dry in the soft air my arm ached abominably and i could feel each of mr willoughbys fortythree elegant stitches like redhot safety pins stuck through my flesh no help for it i was going to have to use the penicillin i might be proof against smallpox typhoid and the common cold in its eighteenthcentury incarnation but i wasnt immortal and god only knew what insanitary substances the portuguese had been employing his cutlass on before applying it to me the short trip across the room to the cupboard where my clothes hung left me sweating and shivering and i had to sit down quite suddenly the skirt clutched to my bosom in order to avoid falling sassenach are ye all right jamie poked his head through the low doorway looking worried no i said come here a minute will you i need you to do something wine a biscuit murphys made a wee broth for ye special he was beside me in a moment the back of his hand cool against my flushed cheek god youre burning yes i know i said dont worry though i have medicine for it i fumbled onehanded in the pocket of the skirt and pulled out the case containing the syringes and ampules my right arm was sore enough that any movement made me clench my teeth your turn i said wryly shoving the case across the table toward jamie heres your chance for revenge if you want it he looked blankly at the case then at me what he said ye want me to stab ye with one of these spikes i wish you wouldnt put it quite that way but yes i said in the bum his lips twitched yes damn you he looked at me for a moment one corner of his mouth curling slightly upward then he bowed his head over the case red hair glowing in the shaft of sun from the window tell me what to do then he said i directed him carefully guiding him through the preparation and filling of the syringe and then took it myself checking for air bubbles clumsily lefthanded by the time i had given it back to him and arranged myself on the berth he had ceased to find anything faintly funny about the situation are ye sure ye want me to do it he said doubtfully im no verra good with my hands that made me laugh in spite of my throbbing arm i had seen him do everything with those hands from delivering foals and building walls to skinning deer and setting type all with the same light and dextrous touch well aye he said when i said as much but its no quite the same is it the closest thing ive done to this is to dirk a man in the wame and it feels a bit strange to think of doin such a thing to you sassenach i glanced back over my shoulder to find him gnawing dubiously on his lower lip the brandysoaked pad in one hand the syringe held gingerly in the other look i said i did it to you you know what it feels like it wasnt that bad was it he was beginning to make me rather nervous mmphm pressing his lips together he knelt down by the bed and gently wiped a spot on my backside with the cool wet pad is this all right thats fine press the point in at a bit of an angle not straight inyou see how the point of the needles cut at an angle push it in about a quarterinchdont be afraid to jab a bit skins tougher than you think to get throughand then push down the plunger very slowly you dont want to do it too fast i closed my eyes and waited after a moment i opened them and looked back he was pale and a faint sheen of sweat glimmered over his cheekbones never mind i heaved myself upright bracing against the wave of dizziness here give me that i snatched the pad from his hand and swiped a patch across the top of my thigh my hand trembled slightly from the fever but shut up i took the syringe and aimed it as well as i could lefthanded then plunged it into the muscle it hurt it hurt more when i pressed down on the plunger and my thumb slipped off then jamies hands were there one steadying my leg the other on the needle slowly pressing down until the last of the white liquid had vanished from the tube i took one quick deep breath when he pulled it out thanks i said after a moment im sorry he said softly a minute later his hand came behind my back easing me down its all right my eyes were closed and there were little colored patterns on the inside of my eyelids they reminded me of the lining of a dolls suitcase i had had as a child tiny pink and silver stars on a dark background id forgotten its hard to do it the first few times i suppose sticking a dirk in someone is easier i added you arent worried about hurting them after all he didnt say anything but exhaled rather strongly through his nose i could hear him moving about the room putting the case of syringes away and hanging up my skirt the site of the injection felt like a knot under my skin im sorry i said i didnt mean it that way well ye should he said evenly it is easier to kill someone to save your own life than it is to hurt someone to save theirs yere a deal braver than i am and i dinna mind your saying so i opened my eyes and looked at him the hell you dont he stared down at me blue eyes narrowed the corner of his mouth turned up the hell i dont he agreed i laughed but it hurt my arm im not and you arent and i didnt mean it that way anyway i said and closed my eyes again mmphm i could hear the thump of feet on the deck above and mr warrens voice raised in organized impatience we had passed great abaco and eleuthera in the night and were now headed south toward jamaica with the wind behind us i wouldnt risk being shot and hacked at and arrested and hanged if there were any choice about it i said neither would i he said dryly but you i began and then stopped i looked at him curiously you really think that i said slowly that you dont have a choice about it dont you he was turned slightly away from me eyes fixed on the port the sun shone on the bridge of his long straight nose and he rubbed a finger slowly up and down it the broad shoulders rose slightly and fell im a man sassenach he said very softly if i thought there was a choicethen i maybe couldna do it ye dinna need to be so brave about things if ye ken ye canna help it aye he looked at me then with a faint smile like a woman in childbirth aye ye must do it and it makes no difference if youre afraidyell do it its only when ye ken ye can say no that it takes courage i lay quiet for a bit watching him he had closed his eyes and leaned back in the chair auburn lashes long and absurdly childish against his cheeks they contrasted strangely with the smudges beneath his eyes and the deeper lines at the corners he was tired hed barely slept since the sighting of the pirate vessel i havent told you about graham menzies have i i said at last the blue eyes opened at once no who was he a patient at the hospital in boston graham had been in his late sixties when i knew him a scottish immigrant who hadnt lost his burr despite nearly forty years in boston he was a fisherman or had been when i knew him he owned several lobster boats and let others do the fishing for him he was a lot like the scottish soldiers i had known at prestonpans and falkirk stoic and humorous at once willing to joke about anything that was too painful to suffer in silence youll be careful now lassie was the last thing he said to me as i watched the anesthetist set up the intravenous drip that would maintain him while i amputated his cancerous left leg be sure yere takin off the right one now dont worry i assured him patting the weathered hand that lay on the sheet ill get the right one ye will his eyes widened in simulated horror i thought twas the left one was bad he was still chuckling asthmatically as the gas mask came down over his face the amputation had gone well and graham had recovered and gone home but i was not really surprised to see him back again six months later the lab report on the original tumor had been dubious and the doubts were now substantiated metastasis to the lymph nodes in the groin i removed the cancerous nodes radiation treatment was applied cobalt i removed the spleen to which the disease had spread knowing that the surgery was entirely in vain but not willing to give up its a lot easier not to give up when it isnt you thats sick i said staring up at the timbers overhead did he give up then jamie asked i dont think id call it that exactly i have been thinking graham announced the sound of his voice echoed tinnily through the earpieces of my stethoscope have you i said well dont do it out loud til ive finished here thats a good lad he gave a brief snort of laughter but lay quietly as i auscultated his chest moving the disc of the stethoscope swiftly from ribs to sternum all right i said at last slipping the tubes out of my ears and letting them fall over my shoulders what have you been thinking about killing myself his eyes met mine straight on with just a hint of challenge i glanced behind me to be sure that the nurse had left then pulled up the blue plastic visitors chair and sat down next to him pain getting bad i asked there are things we can do you know you only need to ask i hesitated before adding the last he never had asked even when it was obvious that he needed medication he never mentioned his discomfort to mention it myself seemed an invasion of his privacy i saw the small tightening at the corners of his mouth ive a daughter he said and two grandsons bonny lads but im forgetting youll have seen them last week aye i had they came at least twice a week to see him bringing scribbled school papers and autographed baseballs to show their grandpa and theres my mother living up to the rest home on canterbury he said thoughtfully it costs dearly that place but its clean and the foods good enough she enjoys complainin about it while she eats he glanced dispassionately at the flat bedsheet and lifted his stump a month dye think four three maybe three i said with luck i added idiotically he snorted at me and jerked his head at the iv drip above him tcha and worse luck i wouldna wish on a beggar he looked around at all the paraphernalia the automatic respirator the blinking cardiac monitor the litter of medical technology nearly a hundred dollars a day its costing to keep me here he said three months that would begreat heavens ten thousand dollars he shook his head frowning a bad bargain i call that not worth it his pale gray eyes twinkled suddenly up at me im scots ye know born thrifty and not likely to get over it now so i did it for him i said still staring upward or rather we did it together he was prescribed morphia for the painthats like laudanum only much stronger i drew off half of each ampule and replaced the missing bit with water it meant he didnt get the relief of a full dose for nearly twentyfour hours but that was the safest way to get a big dose with no risk of being found out we talked about using one of the botanical medicines i was studying i knew enough to make up something fatal but i wasnt sure of it being painless and he didnt want to risk me being accused if anyone got suspicious and did a forensic examination i saw jamies eyebrow lift and flapped a hand it doesnt matter its a way of finding out how someone died ah like a coroners court a bit anyway hed be supposed to have morphia in his blood that wouldnt prove anything so thats what we did i drew a deep breath there would have been no trouble if id given him the injection and left thats what hed asked me to do jamie was quiet eyes fixed intently on me i couldnt do it though i looked at my left hand seeing not my own smooth flesh but the big swollen knuckles of a commercial fisherman and the fat green veins that crossed his wrist i got the needle in i said i rubbed a finger over the spot on the wrist where a large vein crosses the distal head of the radius but i couldnt press down the plunger in memory i saw graham menziess other hand rise from his side trailing tubes and close over my own he hadnt much strength then but enough i sat there until he was gone holding his hand i felt it still the steady beat of the wristpulse under my thumb growing slower and slower still as i held his hand and then waiting for a beat that did not come i looked up at jamie shaking off the memory and then a nurse came in it had been one of the younger nursesan excitable girl with no discretion she wasnt very experienced but knew enough to tell a dead man when she saw one and me just sitting there doing nothingmost undoctorlike conduct and the empty morphia syringe lying on the table beside me she talked of course i said i expect she would i had the presence of mind to drop the syringe into the incinerator chute after she left though it was her word against mine and the whole matter was just dismissed my mouth twisted wryly except that the next week they offered me a job as head of the whole department very important a lovely office on the sixth floor of the hospitalsafely away from the patients where i couldnt murder anyone else my finger was still rubbing absently across my wrist jamie reached out and stopped it by laying his own hand over mine when was this sassenach he asked his voice very gentle just before i took bree and went to scotland thats why i went in fact they gave me an extended leavesaid id been working too hard and deserved a nice vacation i didnt try to keep the irony out of my voice i see his hand was warm on mine despite the heat of my fever if it hadna been for that for losing your workwould ye have come sassenach not just to scotland to me i looked up at him and squeezed his hand taking a deep breath i dont know i said i really dont if i hadnt come to scotland met roger wakefield found out that you i stopped and swallowed overwhelmed it was graham who sent me to scotland i said at last feeling slightly choked he asked me to go somedayand say hello to aberdeen for him i glanced up at jamie suddenly i didnt i never did go to aberdeen dinna trouble yourself sassenach jamie squeezed my hand ill take ye there myselfwhen we go back not he added practically that theres anything to see there it was growing stuffy in the cabin he rose and went to open one of the stern windows jamie i said watching his back what do you want he glanced around frowning slightly in thought ohan orange would be good he said theres some in the desk aye without waiting for a reply he rolled back the lid of the desk revealing a small bowl of oranges bright among the litter of quills and papers dye want one too all right i said smiling that wasnt really what i meant though i meantwhat do you want to do once weve found ian oh he sat down by the berth an orange in his hands and stared at it for a moment dye know he said at last i dinna think anyone has ever asked me thatwhat it was i wanted to do he sounded mildly surprised not as though you very often had a choice about it is it i said dryly now you do though aye thats true he rolled the orange between his palms head bent over the dimpled sphere i suppose its come to ye that we likely canna go back to scotlandat least for a time he said i had told him of tompkinss revelations about sir percival and his machinations of course but we had had little time to discuss the matteror its implications it has i said thats why i asked i was quiet then letting him come to terms with it he had lived as an outlaw for a good many years hiding first physically and then by means of secrecy and aliases eluding the law by slipping from one identity to another but now all these were known there was no way for him to resume any of his former activitiesor even to appear in public in scotland his final refuge had always been lallybroch but even that avenue of retreat was lost to him now lallybroch would always be his home but it was no longer his there was a new laird now i knew he would not begrudge the fact that jennys family possessed the estatebut he must if he were human regret the loss of his heritage i could hear his faint snort and thought he had probably reached the same point in his thinking that i had in mine not jamaica or the englishowned islands either he observed ruefully tom leonard and the royal navy may think us both dead for the moment but theyll be quick enough to notice otherwise if we stay for any length of time have you thought of america i asked this delicately the colonies i mean he rubbed his nose doubtfully well no i hadna really thought of it its true wed likely be safe from the crown there but he trailed off frowning he picked up his dirk and scored the orange quickly and neatly then began to peel it no one would be hunting you there i pointed out sir percival hasnt got any interest in you unless youre in scotland where arresting you would do him some good the british navy cant very well follow you ashore and the west indian governors havent anything to say about what goes on in the colonies either thats true he said slowly but the colonies he took the peeled orange in one hand and began to toss it lightly a few inches in the air its verra primitive sassenach he said a wilderness aye i shouldna like to take ye into danger that made me laugh and he glanced sharply at me then catching my thought relaxed into a halfrueful smile aye well i suppose draggin ye off to sea and letting ye be kidnapped and locked up in a plague ship is dangerous enough but at least i havena let ye be eaten by cannibals yet i wanted to laugh again but there was a bitter note to his voice that made me bite my lip instead there arent any cannibals in america i said there are he said heatedly i printed a book for a society of catholic missionaries that told all about the heathen iroquois in the north they tie up their captives and chop bits off of them and then rip out their hearts and eat them before their eyes eat the hearts first and then the eyes do they i said laughing in spite of myself all right i said seeing his scowl im sorry but for one thing you cant believe everything you read and for another i didnt get to finish he leaned forward and grasped my good arm tight enough to make me squeak with surprise damn you listen to me he said its no light matter wellno i suppose not i said tentatively i didnt mean to make fun of youbut jamie i did live in boston for nearly twenty years youve never set foot in america thats true he said evenly and dye think the place ye lived in is anything like what its like now sassenach well i began then paused while i had seen any number of historic buildings near boston common sporting little brass plaques attesting to their antiquity the majority of them had been built later than many a lot later and beyond a few buildings well no i admitted its not i know its not but i dont think its a complete wilderness there are cities and towns now i know that much he let go of my arm and sat back he still held the orange in his other hand i suppose thats so he said slowly ye dinna hear so much of the townsonly that its such a wild savage place though verra beautiful but im no a fool sassenach his voice sharpened slightly and he dug his thumb savagely into the orange splitting it in half i dinna believe something only because someones set words down in a bookfor gods sake i print the damn things i ken verra well just what charlatans and fools some writers arei see them and surely i ken the difference between a romance and a fact set down in cold blood all right i said though im not sure its all that easy to tell the difference between romance and fact in print but even if its dead true about the iroquois the whole continent isnt swarming with bloodthirsty savages i do know that much its a very big place you know i added gently mmphm he said plainly unconvinced still he bent his attention to the orange and began to divide it into segments this is very funny i said ruefully when i made up my mind to come back i read everything i could find about england and scotland and france about this time so id know as much as i could about what to expect and here we end up in a place i know nothing about because it never dawned on me wed cross the ocean with you being so seasick that made him laugh a little grudgingly aye well ye never ken what ye can do til ye have to believe me sassenach once ive got ian safely back i shall never set foot on a filthy godforsaken floating plank in my life againexcept to go home to scotland when its safe he added as an afterthought he offered me an orange segment and i took it token of a peace offering speaking of scotland you still have your printing press there safe in edinburgh i said we could have it sent over maybeif we settled in one of the larger american cities he looked up at that startled dye think it would be possible to earn a living printing there are that many people it takes a fairsized city ye ken to need a printer or bookseller im sure you could boston philadelphianot new york yet i dont think williamsburg maybe i dont know which ones but there are several places big enough to need printingthe shipping ports certainly i remembered the flapping posters advertising dates of embarkation and arrival sales of goods and recruitment of seamen that decorated the walls of every seaside tavern in le havre mmphm this one was a thoughtful noise aye well if we might do that he poked a piece of fruit into his mouth and ate it slowly what about you he said abruptly i glanced at him startled what about me his eyes were fixed intently on me reading my face would it suit ye to go to such a place he looked down then carefully separating the other half of the fruit i meanyouve your work to do as well aye he looked up and smiled wryly i learned in paris that i couldna stop ye doing it and ye said yourself ye might not have come had menziess death not stopped you where ye were can ye be a healer in the colonies dye think i expect i can i said slowly there are people sick and injured almost anywhere you go after all i looked at him curious youre a very odd man jamie fraser he laughed at that and swallowed the rest of his orange oh i am aye and what dye mean by that frank loved me i said slowly but there werepieces of me that he didnt know what to do with things about me that he didnt understand or maybe that frightened him i glanced at jamie not you his head was bent over a second orange hands moving swiftly as he scored it with his dirk but i could see the faint smile in the corner of his mouth no sassenach ye dinna frighten me or rather ye do but only when i think ye may kill yourself from carelessness i snorted briefly you scare me for the same reason but i dont suppose theres anything i can do about it his chuckle was deep and easy and ye think i canna do anything about it either so i shouldna be worrit i didnt say you shouldnt worrydo you think i dont worry but no you probably cant do anything about me i saw him opening his mouth to disagree then he changed his mind and laughed again he reached out and popped an orange segment into my mouth well maybe no sassenach and maybe so but ive lived a long enough time now to think it maybe doesna matter so muchso long as i can love you speechless with orange juice i stared at him in surprise and i do he said softly he leaned into the berth and kissed me his mouth warm and sweet then he drew back and gently touched my cheek rest now he said firmly ill bring ye some broth in a bit i slept for several hours and woke up still feverish but hungry jamie brought me some of murphys brotha rich green concoction swimming in butter and reeking with sherryand insisted despite my protests on feeding it to me with a spoon i have a perfectly good hand i said crossly aye and ive seen ye use it too he replied deftly gagging me with the spoon if yere clumsy with a spoon as wi that needle youll have this all spilt down your bosom and wasted and murphy will brain me wi the ladle here open up i did my resentment gradually melting into a sort of warm and glowing stupor as i ate i hadnt taken anything for the pain in my arm but as my empty stomach expanded in grateful relief i more or less quit noticing it will ye have another bowl jamie asked as i swallowed the last spoonful yell need your strength kept up not waiting for an answer he uncovered the small tureen murphy had sent and refilled the bowl wheres ishmael i asked during the brief hiatus on the after deck he didna seem comfortable belowdecksand i canna say i blame him having seen the slavers at bridgetown i had maitland sling him a hammock do you think its safe to leave him loose like that what kind of soup is this the last spoonful had left a delightful lingering taste on my tongue the next revived the full flavor turtle stern took a big hawksbill last night he sent word hes saving ye the shell to make combs of for your hair jamie frowned slightly whether at the thought of lawrence sterns gallantry or ishmaels presence i couldnt tell as for the black hes not loosefergus is watching him fergus is on his honeymoon i protested you shouldnt make him do it is this really turtle soup ive never had it before its marvelous jamie was unmoved by contemplation of ferguss tender state aye well hell be wed a long time he said callously do him no harm to keep his breeches on for one night and they do say that abstinence makes the heart grow firmer no absence i said dodging the spoon for a moment and fonder if anythings growing firmer from abstinence it wouldnt be his heart thats verra bawdy talk for a respectable marrit woman jamie said reprovingly sticking the spoon in my mouth and inconsiderate forbye i swallowed inconsiderate im a wee bit firm myself at the moment he replied evenly dipping and spooning what wi you sitting there wi your hair loose and your nipples starin me in the eye the size of cherries i glanced down involuntarily and the next spoonful bumped my nose jamie clicked his tongue and picking up a cloth briskly blotted my bosom with it it was quite true that my shift was made of thin cotton and even when dry reasonably easy to see through its not as though you havent seen them before i said amused he laid down the cloth and raised his brows i have drunk water every day since i was weaned he pointed out it doesna mean i canna be thirsty still he picked up the spoon youll have a wee bit more no thanks i said dodging the oncoming spoon i want to hear more about this firmness of yours no ye dont youre ill i feel much better i assured him shall i have a look at it he was wearing the loose petticoat breeches the sailors wore in which he could easily have concealed three or four dead mullet let alone a fugitive firmness you shall not he said looking slightly shocked someone might come in and i canna think your looking at it would help a bit well you cant tell that until i have looked at it can you i said besides you can bolt the door bolt the door what dye think im going to do do i look the sort of man would take advantage of a woman whos not only wounded and boiling wi fever but drunk as well he demanded he stood up nonetheless i am not drunk i said indignantly you cant get drunk on turtle soup nonetheless i was conscious that the glowing warmth in my stomach seemed to have migrated somewhat lower taking up residence between my thighs and there was undeniably a slight lightness of head not strictly attributable to fever you can if yeve been drinking turtle soup as made by aloysius oshaughnessy murphy he said by the smell of it hes put at least a full bottle o the sherry in it a verra intemperate race the irish well im still not drunk i straightened up against the pillows as best i could you told me once that if you could still stand up you werent drunk you arent standing up he pointed out you are and i could if i wanted to stop trying to change the subject we were talking about your firmness well ye can just stop talking about it because he broke off with a small yelp as i made a fortunate grab with my left hand clumsy am i i said with considerable satisfaction oh my heavens you do have a problem dont you will ye leave go of me he hissed looking frantically over his shoulder at the door someone could come in any moment i told you you should have bolted the door i said not letting go far from being a dead mullet the object in my hand was exhibiting considerable liveliness he eyed me narrowly breathing through his nose i wouldna use force on a sick woman he said through his teeth but youve a damn healthy grip for someone with a fever sassenach if you i told you i felt better i interrupted but ill make you a bargain you bolt the door and ill prove im not drunk i rather regretfully let go to indicate good faith he stood staring at me for a moment absentmindedly rubbing the site of my recent assault on his virtue then he lifted one ruddy eyebrow turned and went to bolt the door by the time he turned back i had made it out of the berth and was standinga trifle shakily but still uprightagainst the frame he eyed me critically its no going to work sassenach he said shaking his head he looked rather regretful himself well never stay upright wi a swell like there is underfoot tonight and ye know ill not fit in that berth by myself let alone wi you there was a considerable swell the lantern on its swivelbracket hung steady and level but the shelf above it tilted visibly back and forth as the artemis rode the waves i could feel the faint shudder of the boards under my bare feet and knew jamie was right at least he was too absorbed in the discussion to be seasick theres always the floor i suggested hopefully he glanced down at the limited floor space and frowned aye well there is but wed have to do it like snakes sassenach all twined round each other amongst the table legs i dont mind no he said shaking his head it would hurt your arm he rubbed a knuckle across his lower lip thinking his eyes passed absently across my body at about hip level returned fixed and lost their focus i thought the bloody shift must be more transparent than i realized deciding to take matters into my own hands i let go my hold on the frame of the berth and lurched the two paces necessary to reach him the roll of the ship threw me into his arms and he barely managed to keep his own balance clutching me tightly round the waist jesus he said staggered and then as much from reflex as from desire bent his head and kissed me it was startling i was accustomed to be surrounded by the warmth of his embrace now it was i who was hot to the touch and he who was cool from his reaction he was enjoying the novelty as much as i was lightheaded and reckless with it i nipped the side of his neck with my teeth feeling the waves of heat from my face pulsate against the column of his throat he felt it too god youre like holding a hot coal his hands dropped lower and pressed me hard against him firm is it ha i said getting my mouth free for a moment take those baggy things off i slid down his length and onto my knees in front of him fumbling mazily at his flies he freed the laces with a quick jerk and the petticoat breeches ballooned to the floor with a whiff of wind i didnt wait for him to remove his shirt just lifted it and took him he made a strangled sound and his hands came down on my head as though he wanted to restrain me but hadnt the strength oh lord he said his hands tightened in my hair but he wasnt trying to push me away this must be what its like to make love in hell he whispered with a burning shedevil i laughed which was extremely difficult under the circumstances i choked and pulled back a moment breathless is this what a succubus does do you think i wouldna doubt it for a moment he assured me his hands were still in my hair urging me back a knock sounded on the door and he froze confident that the door was indeed bolted i didnt aye what is it he said with a calmness rather remarkable for a man in his position fraser lawrence sterns voice came through the door the frenchman says the black is asleep and may he have leave to go to bed now no said jamie shortly tell him to stay where he is ill come along and relieve him in a bit oh sterns voice sounded a little hesitant surely hisum his wife seemseager for him to come now jamie inhaled sharply tell her he said a small note of strain becoming evident in his voice that hell be therepresently i will say so stern sounded dubious about marsalis reception of this news but then his voice brightened ahis mrs fraser feeling somewhat improved verra much said jamie with feeling she enjoyed the turtle soup greatly i thank ye his hands on my head were trembling did you tell her that ive put aside the shell for her it was a fine hawksbill turtle a most elegant beast aye aye i did with an audible gasp jamie pulled away and reaching down lifted me to my feet good night mr stern he called he pulled me toward the berth we struggled fourlegged to keep from crashing into tables and chairs as the floor rose and fell beneath us oh lawrence sounded faintly disappointed i suppose mrs fraser is asleep then laugh and ill throttle ye jamie whispered fiercely in my ear she is mr stern he called through the door i shall give her your respects in the morning aye i trust she will rest well there seems to be a certain roughness to the sea this evening ihave noticed mr stern pushing me to my knees in front of the berth he knelt behind me groping for the hem of my shift a cool breeze from the open stern window blew over my naked buttocks and a shiver ran down the backs of my thighs should you or mrs fraser find yourselves discommoded by the motion i have a most capital remedy to handa compound of mugwort bat dung and the fruit of the mangrove you have only to ask you know jamie didnt answer for a moment oh christ he whispered i took a sizable bite of the bedclothes mr fraser i said thank you jamie replied raising his voice well i shall bid you a good evening then jamie let out his breath in a long shudder that was not quite a moan mr fraser good evening mr stern jamie bellowed oh ergood evening sterns footsteps receded down the companionway lost in the sound of the waves that were now crashing loudly against the hull i spit out the mouthful of quilt ohmygod his hands were large and hard and cool on my heated flesh youve the roundest arse ive ever seen a lurch by the artemis here aiding his efforts to an untoward degree i uttered a loud shriek shh he clasped a hand over my mouth bending over me so that he lay over my back the billowing linen of his shirt falling around me and the weight of him pressing me to the bed my skin crazed with fever was sensitive to the slightest touch and i shook in his arms the heat inside me rushing outward as he moved within me his hands were under me then clutching my breasts the only anchor as i lost my boundaries and dissolved conscious thought a displaced element in the chaos of sensationsthe warm damp of tangled quilts beneath me the cold sea wind and misty spray that wafted over us from the rough sea outside the gasp and brush of jamies warm breath on the back of my neck and the sudden prickle and flood of cold and heat as my fever broke in a dew of satisfied desire jamies weight rested on my back his thighs behind mine it was warm and comforting after a long time his breathing eased and he rose off me the thin cotton of my shift was damp and the wind plucked it away from my skin making me shiver jamie closed the window with a snap then bent and picked me up like a rag doll he lowered me into the berth and pulled the quilt up over me how is your arm he said what arm i murmured drowsily i felt as though i had been melted and poured into a mold to set good he said a smile in his voice can ye stand up not for all the tea in china ill tell murphy ye liked the soup his hand rested for a moment on my cool forehead passed down the curve of my cheek in a light caress and then was gone i didnt hear him leave promised land its persecution jamie said indignantly he stood behind me looking over the rail of the artemis kingston harbor stretched to our left glowing like liquid sapphires in the morning light the town above halfsunk in jungle green cubes of yellowed ivory and pink rosequartz in a lush setting of emerald and malachite and on the cerulean bosom of the water below floated the majestic sight of a great threemasted ship furled canvas white as gull wings gun decks proud and brass gleaming in the sun his majestys manofwar porpoise the filthy boats pursuing me he said glaring at it as we sailed past at a discreet distance well outside the harbor mouth everywhere i go there it is again i laughed though in truth the sight of the porpoise made me slightly nervous too i dont suppose its personal i told him captain leonard did say they were bound for jamaica aye but why would they no head straight to antigua where the naval barracks and the navy shipyards are and them in such straits as ye left them he shaded his eyes peering at the porpoise even at this distance small figures were visible in the rigging making repairs they had to come here first i explained they were carrying a new governor for the colony i felt an absurd urge to duck below the rail though i knew that even jamies red hair would be indistinguishable at this distance aye i wonder whos that jamie spoke absently we were no more than an hour away from arrival at jareds plantation on sugar bay and i knew his mind was busy with plans for finding young ian a chap named grey i said turning away from the rail nice man i met him on the ship just briefly grey startled jamie looked down at me not lord john grey by chance yes that was his name why i glanced up at him curious he was staring at the porpoise with renewed interest why he heard me when i repeated the question a second time and glanced down at me smiling oh its only that i ken lord john hes a friend of mine really i was no more than mildly surprised jamies friends had once included the french minister of finance and charles stuart as well as scottish beggars and french pickpockets i supposed it was not remarkable that he should now count english aristocrats among his acquaintance as well as highland smugglers and irish seacooks well thats luck i said or at least i suppose it is where do you know lord john from he was the governor of ardsmuir prison he replied surprising me after all his eyes were still fixed on the porpoise narrowed in speculation and hes a friend of yours i shook my head ill never understand men he turned and smiled at me taking his attention at last from the english ship well friends are where ye find them sassenach he said he squinted toward the shore shading his eyes with his hand let us hope this mrs abernathy proves to be one as we rounded the tip of the headland a lithe black figure materialized next to the rail now clothed in spare seamans clothes with his scars hidden ishmael looked less like a slave and a good deal more like a pirate not for the first time i wondered just how much of what he had told us was the truth i be leavin now he announced abruptly jamie lifted one eyebrow and glanced over the rail into the soft blue depths dinna let me prevent ye he said politely but would ye not rather have a boat something that might have been humor flickered briefly in the black mans eyes but didnt disturb the severe outlines of his face you say you put me ashore where i want i be tellin you bout those boys he said he nodded toward the island where a riotous growth of jungle spilled down the slope of a hill to meet its own green shadow in the shallow water that be where i want jamie looked thoughtfully from the uninhabited shore to ishmael and then nodded ill have a boat lowered he turned to go to the cabin i promised ye gold as well no dont be wantin gold mon ishmaels tone as well as his words stopped jamie in his tracks he looked at the black man with interest mingled with a certain reserve yell have something else in mind ishmael jerked his head in a short nod he didnt seem outwardly nervous but i noticed the faint gleam of sweat on his temples despite the mild noon breeze i be wantin that onearm nigger he stared boldly at jamie as he spoke but there was a diffidence under the confident facade temeraire i blurted out in astonishment why ishmael flicked a glance at me but addressed his words to jamie halfbold halfcajoling he aint no good to you mon cant be doin field work or ship work neither aint got but one arm jamie didnt reply directly but stared at ishmael for a moment then he turned and called for fergus to bring up the onearmed slave temeraire brought up on deck stood expressionless as a block of wood barely blinking in the sun he too had been provided with seamans clothes but he lacked ishmaels raffish elegance in them he looked like a stump upon which someone had spread out washing to dry this man wants you to go with him to the island there jamie said to temeraire in slow careful french do you want to do this thing temeraire did blink at that and a brief look of startlement widened his eyes i supposed that no one had asked him what he wanted in many yearsif ever he glanced warily from jamie to ishmael and back again but didnt say anything jamie tried again you do not have to go with this man he assured the slave you may come with us and we will take care of you no one will hurt you but you can go with him if you like still the slave hesitated eyes flicking right and left clearly startled and disturbed by the unexpected choice it was ishmael who decided the matter he said something in a strange tongue full of liquid vowels and syllables that repeated like a drumbeat temeraire let out a gasp fell to his knees and pressed his forehead to the deck at ishmaels feet everyone on deck stared at him then looked at ishmael who stood with arms folded with a sort of wary defiance he be goin with me he said and so it was picard rowed the two blacks ashore in the dinghy and left them on the rocks at the edge of the jungle supplied with a small bag of provisions each equipped with a knife why there i wondered aloud watching the two small figures make their way slowly up the wooded slope there arent any towns nearby are there or any plantations to the eye the shore presented an unbroken expanse of jungle oh there are plantations lawrence assured me far up in the hills thats where they grow the coffee and indigothe sugarcane grows better near the coast he squinted toward the shore where the two dark figures had disappeared it is more likely that they have gone to join a band of maroons though he said there are maroons on jamaica as well as on hispaniola fergus asked interested lawrence smiled a little grimly there are maroons wherever there are slaves my friend he said there are always men who prefer to take the chance of dying like animals rather than live as captives jamie turned his head sharply to look at lawrence but said nothing jareds plantation at sugar bay was called blue mountain house presumably for the sake of the low hazy peak that rose inland a mile behind it blue with pines and distance the house itself was set near the shore in the shallow curve of the bay in fact the veranda that ran along one side of the house overhung a small lagoon the building set on sturdy silveredwood pilings that rose from the water crusted with a spongy growth of tunicates and mussels and the fine green seaweed called mermaids hair we were expected jared had sent a letter by a ship that left le havre a week before the artemis owing to our delay on hispaniola the letter had arrived nearly a month in advance of ourselves and the overseer and his wifea portly comfortable scottish couple named maciverswere relieved to see us i thought surely the winter storms had got ye kenneth maciver said for the fourth time shaking his head he was bald the top of his head scaly and freckled from long years exposure to the tropic sun his wife was a plump genial grandmotherly soulwho i realized to my shock was roughly five years younger than myself she herded marsali and me off for a quick wash brush and nap before supper while fergus and jamie went with mr maciver to direct the partial unloading of the artemiss cargo and the disposition of her crew i was more than willing to go while my arm had healed sufficiently to need no more than a light bandage it had prevented me from bathing in the sea as was my usual habit after a week aboard the artemis unbathed i looked forward to fresh water and clean sheets with a longing that was almost hunger i had no landlegs yet the worn wooden floorboards of the plantation house gave the disconcerting illusion of seeming to rise and fall beneath my feet and i staggered down the hallway after mrs maciver bumping into walls the house had an actual bathtub in a small porch wooden but filledmirabile dictuwith hot water by the good offices of two black slave women who heated kettles over a fire in the yard and carried them in i should have felt much too guilty at this exploitation to enjoy my bath but i didnt i wallowed luxuriously scrubbing the salt and grime from my skin with a loofah sponge and lathering my hair with a shampoo made from chamomile geranium oil fatsoap shavings and the yolk of an egg graciously supplied by mrs maciver smelling sweet shinyhaired and languid with warmth i collapsed gratefully into the bed i was given i had time only to think how delightful it was to stretch out at full length before i fell asleep when i woke the shadows of dusk were gathering on the veranda outside the open french doors of my bedroom and jamie lay naked beside me hands folded on his belly breathing deep and slow he felt me stir and opened his eyes he smiled sleepily and reaching up a hand pulled me down to his mouth he had had a bath too he smelled of soap and cedar needles i kissed him at length slowly and thoroughly running my tongue across the wide curve of his lip finding his tongue with mine in a soft dark joust of greeting and invitation i broke loose finally and came up for air the room was filled with a wavering green light reflections from the lagoon outside as though the room itself were underwater the air was at once warm and fresh smelling of sea and rain with tiny currents of breeze that caressed the skin ye smell sweet sassenach he murmured voice husky with sleep he smiled reaching up to twine his fingers into my hair come here to me curlywig freed from pins and freshly washed my hair was clouding over my shoulders in a perfect explosion of medusalike curls i reached up to smooth it back but he tugged gently bending me forward so the veil of brown and gold and silver fell loose over his face i kissed him halfsmothered in clouds of hair and lowered myself to lie on top of him letting the fullness of my breasts squash gently against his chest he moved slightly rubbing and sighed with pleasure his hands cupped my buttocks trying to move me upward enough to enter me not bloody yet i whispered i pressed my hips down rolling them enjoying the feel of the silky stiffness trapped beneath my belly he made a small breathless sound we havent had room or time to make love properly in months i told him so were taking our time about it now right ye take me at something of a disadvantage sassenach he murmured into my hair he squirmed under me pressing upward urgently ye dinna think we could take our time next time no we couldnt i said firmly now slow dont move he made a sort of rumbling noise in his throat but sighed and relaxed letting his hands fall away to the sides i squirmed lower on his body making him inhale sharply and set my mouth on his nipple i ran my tongue delicately round the tiny nub making it stand up stiff enjoying the coarse feel of the curly auburn hairs that surrounded it i felt him tense under me and put my hands on his upper arms to hold him still while i went on with it biting gently sucking and flicking with my tongue a few minutes later i raised my head brushed my hair back with one hand and asked whats that youre saying he opened one eye the rosary he informed me its the only way im going to stand it he closed his eyes and resumed murmuring in latin ave maria gratia plena i snorted and went to work on the other one youre losing your place i said next time i came up for air youve said the lords prayer three times in a row im surprised to hear im still makin any sense at all his eyes were closed and a dew of moisture gleamed on his cheekbones he moved his hips with increasing restiveness now not yet i dipped my head lower and seized by impulse went pffft into his navel he convulsed and taken by surprise emitted a noise that could only be described as a giggle dont do that he said will if i want to i said and did it again you sound just like bree i told him i used to do that to her when she was a baby she loved it well im no a wee bairn if ye hadna noticed the difference he said a little testily if ye must do that at least try it a bit lower aye i did you dont have any hair at all at the tops of your thighs i said admiring the smooth white skin there why is that do you think the cow licked it all off last time she milked me he said between his teeth for gods sake sassenach i laughed and returned to my work at last i stopped and raised myself on my elbows i think youve had enough i said brushing hair out of my eyes you havent said anything but jesus christ over and over again for the last few minutes given the cue he surged upward and flipped me onto my back pinning me with the solid weight of his body youre going to live to regret this sassenach he said with a grim satisfaction i grinned at him unrepentant am i he looked down at me eyes narrowed take my time was it youll beg for it before ive done wi ye i tugged experimentally at my wrists held tight in his grasp and wriggled slightly under him with anticipation ooh mercy i said you beast he snorted briefly and bent his head to the curve of my breast white as pearl in the dim green waterlight i closed my eyes and lay back against the pillows pater noster qui es in coelis i whispered we were very late to supper jamie lost no time over supper in asking about mrs abernathy of rose hall abernathy maciver frowned tapping his knife on the table to assist thought aye seems ive heard the name though i canna just charge my memory och ye ken abernathys fine his wife interrupted pausing in her instructions to a servant for the preparation of the hot pudding its that place up the yallahs river in the mountains cane mostly but a wee bit of coffee too oh aye to be sure her husband exclaimed what a memory yeve got rosie he beamed fondly at his wife well i might not ha brought it to mind mysel she said modestly only as how that minister over to new grace kirk last week was askin after mrs abernathy too what minister is this maam jamie asked taking a split roast chicken from the huge platter presented to him by a black servant such a fine braw appetite as ye have mr fraser mrs maciver exclaimed admiringly seeing his loaded plate its the island air does it i expect the tips of jamies ears turned pink i expect it is he said carefully not looking at me this minister och aye campbell his name was archie campbell i started and she glanced quizzically at me youll know him i shook my head swallowing a pickled mushroom ive met him once in edinburgh oh well hes come to be a missionary and bring the heathen blacks to the salvation of our lord jesus she spoke with admiration and glared at her husband when he snorted now yell no be makin your papist remarks kenny the reverend campbells a fine holy man and a great scholar forbye im free church myself she said leaning toward me confidingly my parents disowned me when i wed kenny but i told them i was sure hed come to see the light sooner or later a lot later her husband remarked spooning jam onto his plate he grinned at his wife who sniffed and returned to her story so twas on account of the reverends bein a great scholar that mrs abernathy had written him whilst he was still in edinburgh to ask him questions and now that hes come here he had it in mind to go and see her though after all myra dalrymple and the reverend davis telt him i should be surprised hed set foot on her place she added primly kenny maciver grunted motioning to a servant in the doorway with another huge platter i wouldna put a great deal of stock in anything the reverend davis says myself he said the mans too godly to shit but myra dalrymples a sensible woman ouch he snatched back the fingers his wife had just cracked with a spoon and sucked them what did miss dalrymple have to say of mrs abernathy jamie inquired hastily intervening before fullscale marital warfare could break out mrs macivers color was high but she smoothed the frown from her brow as she turned to answer him well a great deal of it was no more than illnatured gossip she admitted the sorts of things folk will always say about a woman as lives alone that shes owerfond of the company of her menslaves aye but there was the talk when her husband died kenny interrupted he slid several small rainbowstriped fish off the platter the stooping servant held for him i mind it well now i come to think on the name barnabas abernathy had come from scotland and had purchased rose hall five years before he had run the place decently turning a small profit in sugar and coffee causing no comment among his neighbors then two years ago he had married a woman no one knew bringing her home from a trip to guadeloupe and six months later he was dead mrs maciver concluded with grim relish and the talk is that mrs abernathy had something to do with it having some idea of the plethora of tropical parasites and diseases that attacked europeans in the west indies i was inclined to doubt it myself barnabas abernathy could easily have died of anything from malaria to elephantiasis but rosie maciver was rightfolk were partial to illnatured gossip poison rosie said lowvoiced with a quick glance at the door to the kitchen the doctor who saw him said so mind it could ha been the slavewomen there was talk about barnabas and his female slaves and its more common than folk like to say for a plantation cookgirl to be slipping something into the stew but she broke off as another servant came in carrying a cutglass relish pot everyone was silent as the woman placed it on the table and left curtsying to her mistress you neednt worry mrs maciver said reassuringly seeing me look after the woman weve a boy who tastes everything before its served its all quite safe i swallowed the mouthful of fish i had taken with some difficulty did the reverend campbell go to see mrs abernathy then jamie put in rosie took the distraction gratefully she shook her head agitating the lace ruffles on her cap no im sure not for twas the very next day there was the stramash about his sister in the excitement of tracking ian and the bruja i had nearly forgotten margaret jane campbell what happened to his sister i asked curious why shes disappeared mrs macivers blue eyes went wide with importance blue mountain house was remote some ten miles out of kingston by land and our presence provided an unparalleled opportunity for gossip what fergus had been addressing himself to his plate with singleminded devotion but now looked up blinking disappeared where the whole islands talking of it kenny put in snatching the conversational ball from his wife seems the reverend had a woman engaged as abigail to his sister but the woman died of a fever on the voyage oh thats too bad i felt a real pang for nellie cowden with her broad pleasant face aye kenny nodded offhandedly well and so the reverend found a place for his sister to lodge feebleminded i understand he lifted a brow at me something like that aye well the lass seemed quiet and biddable and mrs forrest who had the house where she lodged would take her to sit on the veranda in the cool part of the day so tuesday last a boy comes to say as mrs forrest is wanted quicklike to come to her sister whos having a child and mrs forrest got flustered and went straight off forgetting miss campbell on the veranda and when she thought of it and sent someone back to seewhy miss campbell was gone and not a smell of her since in spite of the reverend raising heaven and earth ye might say maciver rocked back on his chair puffing out his sunmottled cheeks mrs maciver wagged her head tsking mournfully myra dalrymple told the reverend as how he should go to the governor for help to find her she said but the governors scarce settled and not yet ready to receive anyone hes having a great reception this coming thursday for to meet all the important folk o the island myra said as the reverend must go and speak to the governor there but hes no of a mind to do that it bein such a worldly occasion aye a reception jamie set down his spoon looking at mrs maciver with interest is it by invitation dye know oh no she said shaking her head anyone may come as likes to or so ive heard is that so jamie glanced at me smiling what dye think sassenachwould ye care to step out wi me at the governors residence i stared at him in astonishment i should have thought that the last thing he would wish to do was show himself in public i was also surprised that he would let anything at all stop his visiting rose hall at the earliest opportunity its a good opportunity to ask about ian no he explained after all he might not be at rose hall but someplace else on the island well aside from the fact that ive nothing to wear i temporized trying to figure out what he was really up to och thats no trouble rosie maciver assured me ive one of the cleverest sempstresses on the island shell have ye tricked out in no time jamie was nodding thoughtfully he smiled eyes slanting as he looked at me over the candle flame violet silk i think he said he plucked the bones delicately from his fish and set them aside and as for the otherdinna fash sassenach ive something in mind youll see masque of the red death oh who is that young sinner with the handcuffs on his wrists and what has he been after that they groan and shake their fists and wherefore is he wearing such a consciencestricken air oh theyre taking him to prison for the colour of his hair jamie put down the wig in his hand and raised one eyebrow at me in the mirror i grinned at him and went on declaiming with gestures tis a shame to human nature such a head of hair as his in the good old time twas hanging for the colour that it is though hanging isnt bad enough and flaying would be fair for the nameless and abominable colour of his hair did ye not tell me yed studied for a doctor sassenach he inquired or was it a poet after all not me i assured him coming to straighten his stock those sentiments are by one a e housman surely one of him is sufficient jamie said dryly given the quality of his opinions he picked up the wig and fitted it carefully on his head raising little puffs of scented powder as he poked it here and there is mr housman an acquaintance of yours then you might say so i sat down on the bed to watch its only that the doctors lounge at the hospital i worked at had a copy of housmans collected works that someone had left there there isnt time between calls to read most novels but poems are ideal i expect i know most of housman by heart now he looked warily at me as though expecting another outburst of poetry but i merely smiled at him and he returned to his work i watched the transformation in fascination redheeled shoes and silk stockings clocked in black gray satin breeches with silver knee buckles snowy linen with brussels lace six inches deep at cuff and jabot the coat a masterpiece in heavy gray with blue satin cuffs and crested silver buttons hung behind the door awaiting its turn he finished the careful powdering of his face and licking the end of one finger picked up a false beauty mark dabbed it in gum arabic and affixed it neatly near the corner of his mouth there he said swinging about on the dressing stool to face me do i look like a redheided scottish smuggler i inspected him carefully from fullbottomed wig to moroccoheeled shoes you look like a gargoyle i said his face flowered in a wide grin outlined in white powder his lips seemed abnormally red his mouth even wider and more expressive than it usually was non said fergus indignantly coming in in time to hear this he looks like a frenchman much the same thing jamie said and sneezed wiping his nose on a handkerchief he assured the young man begging your pardon fergus he stood up and reached for the coat shrugging it over his shoulders and settling the edges in threeinch heels he towered to a height of six feet seven his head nearly brushed the plastered ceiling i dont know i said looking up at him dubiously ive never seen a frenchman that size jamie shrugged his coat rustling like autumn leaves aye well theres no hiding my height but so long as my hair is hidden i think it will be all right besides he added gazing with approval at me folk willna be looking at me stand up and let me see aye i obliged rotating slowly to show off the deep flare of the violet silk skirt cut low in the front the décolletage was filled with a froth of lace that rippled down the front of the bodice in a series of vs matching lace cascaded from the elbowlength sleeves in graceful white falls that left my wrists bare rather a pity i dont have your mothers pearls i remarked i didnt regret their lack i had left them for brianna in the box with the photographs and family documents still with the deep décolletage and my hair twisted up in a knot the mirror showed a long expanse of bare neck and bosom rising whitely out of the violet silk i thought of that with the air of a conjuror jamie produced a small box from his inside pocket and presented it to me making a leg in his best versailles fashion inside was a small gleaming fish carved in a dense black material the edges of its scales touched with gold its a pin he explained ye could maybe wear it fastened to a white ribbon round your neck its beautiful i said delighted whats it made of ebony black coral he said i got it yesterday when fergus and i were in montego bay he and fergus had taken the artemis round the island disposing at last of the cargo of bat guano delivered to its purchaser i found a length of white satin ribbon and jamie obligingly tied it about my neck bending to peer over my shoulder at the reflection in the mirror no they wont be looking at me he said half o them will be lookin at you sassenach and the other half at mr willoughby mr willoughby is that safe i mean i stole a look at the little chinese sitting patiently crosslegged on a stool gleaming in clean blue silk and lowered my voice i mean theyll have wine wont they jamie nodded and whisky and cambric and claret cup and port and champagne punchand a wee cask of the finest french brandycontributed by the courtesy of monsieur etienne marcel de provac alexandre he put a hand on his chest and bowed again in an exaggerated pantomime that made me laugh nay worry he said straightening up hell behave or ill have his coral globe backwill i no ye wee heathen he added with a grin to mr willoughby the chinese scholar nodded with considerable dignity the embroidered black silk of his round cap was decorated with a small carved knob of red coralthe badge of his calling restored to him by the chance encounter with a coral trader on the docks at montego and jamies good nature youre quite sure we have to go the palpitations i was experiencing were due in part to the tightness of the stays i was wearing but in greater degree to recurring visions of jamies wig falling off and the reception coming to a complete stop as the entire assemblage paused to stare at his hair before calling en masse for the royal navy aye we do he smiled at me reassuringly dinna worry sassenach if anyones there from the porpoise its not likely theyll recognize menot like this i hope not do you think anyone from the ship will be there tonight i doubt it he scratched viciously at the wig above his left ear where did ye get this thing fergus i believe its got lice oh no milord fergus assured him the wigmaker from whom i rented it assured me that it had been well dusted with hyssop and horse nettle to prevent any such infestations fergus himself was wearing his own hair thickly powdered and was handsomeif less startling than jamiein a new suit of dark blue velvet there was a tentative knock at the door and marsali stepped in she too had had her wardrobe refurbished and glowed in a dress of soft pink with a deep rose sash she glowed somewhat more than i thought the dress accounted for in fact and as we made our way down the narrow corridor to the carriage pulling in our skirts to keep them from brushing the walls i managed to lean forward and murmur in her ear are you using the tansy oil mm she said absently her eyes on fergus as he bowed and held open the carriage door for her what did ye say never mind i said resigned that was the least of our worries at the moment the governors mansion was ablaze with lights lanterns were perched along the low wall of the veranda and hung from the trees along the paths of the ornamental garden gaily dressed people were emerging from their carriages on the crushedshell drive passing into the house through a pair of huge french doors we dismissed our ownor rather jaredscarriage but stood for a moment on the drive waiting for a brief lull in the arrivals jamie seemed mildly nervousfor him his fingers twitched now and then against the gray satin but his manner was outwardly as calm as ever there was a short reception line in the foyer several of the minor dignitaries of the island had been invited to assist the new governor in welcoming his guests i passed ahead of jamie down the line smiling and nodding to the mayor of kingston and his wife i quailed a bit at the sight of a fully decorated admiral next in line resplendent in gilded coat and epaulettes but no sign of anything beyond a mild amazement crossed his features as he shook hands with the gigantic frenchman and the tiny chinese who accompanied me there was my acquaintance from the porpoise lord johns blond hair was hidden under a formal wig tonight but i recognized the fine clear features and slight muscular body at once he stood a little apart from the other dignitaries alone rumor had it that his wife had refused to leave england to accompany him to this posting he turned to greet me his face fixed in an expression of formal politeness he looked blinked and then broke into a smile of extraordinary warmth and pleasure mrs malcolm he exclaimed seizing my hands i am vastly pleased to see you the feeling is entirely mutual i said smiling back at him i didnt know you were the governor last time we met im afraid i was a bit informal he laughed his face glowing with the light of the candles in the wall sconces seen clearly in the light for the first time i realized what a remarkably handsome man he was you might be thought to have had an excellent excuse he said he looked me over carefully may i say that you are in remarkable fine looks this evening clearly the island air must agree with you somewhat more than the miasmas of shipboard i had hoped to meet you again before leaving the porpoise but when i inquired for you i was told by mr leonard that you were unwell i trust you are entirely recovered oh entirely i told him amused unwell eh evidently tom leonard was not about to admit to losing me overboard i wondered whether he had put my disappearance in the log may i introduce my husband i turned to wave at jamie who had been detained in animated conversation with the admiral but who was now advancing toward us accompanied by mr willoughby i turned back to find the governor gone green as a gooseberry he stared from jamie to me and back again pale as though confronted by twin specters jamie came to a stop beside me and inclined his head graciously toward the governor john he said softly its good to see ye man the governors mouth opened and shut without making a sound let us make an opportunity to speak a bit later jamie murmured but for nowmy name is etienne alexandre he took my arm and bowed formally and may i have the pleasure to present to you my wife claire he said aloud shifting effortlessly into french claire the governor looked wildly at me claire er yes i said hoping he wasnt going to faint he looked very much as though he might though i had no idea why the revelation of my christian name ought to affect him so strongly the next arrivals were waiting impatiently for us to move out of the way i bowed fluttering my fan and we walked into the main salon of the residence i glanced back over my shoulder to see the governor shaking hands mechanically with the new arrival staring after us with a face like white paper the salon was a huge room lowceilinged and filled with people noisy and bright as a cageful of parrots i felt some relief at the sight among this crowd jamie wouldnt be terribly conspicuous despite his size a small orchestra played at one side of the room near a pair of doors thrown open to the terrace outside i saw a number of people strolling there evidently seeking either a breath of air or sufficient quiet to hold a private conversation at the other side of the room yet another pair of doors opened into a short hallway where the retiring rooms were we knew no one and had no social sponsor to make introductions however due to jamies foresight we had no need of one within moments of our arrival women had begun to cluster around us fascinated by mr willoughby my acquaintance mr yi tien cho jamie introduced him to a stout young woman in tight yellow satin late of the celestial kingdom of china madame ooh the young lady fluttered her fan before her face impressed really from china but what an unthinkable distance you must have come do let me welcome you to our small island mrmr cho she extended a hand to him clearly expecting it to be kissed mr willoughby bowed deeply hands in his sleeves and obligingly said something in chinese the young woman looked thrilled jamie looked momentarily startled and then the mask of urbanity dropped back over his face i saw mr willoughbys shining black eyes fix on the tips of the ladys shoes protruding from under the hem of her dress and wondered just what he had said to her jamie seized the opportunityand the ladys handbowing over it with extreme politeness your servant madame he said in thickly accented english etienne alexandre and might i present to you my wife claire oh yes so pleased to meet you the young woman flushed with excitement took my hand and squeezed it im marcelline williams perhaps youll be acquainted with my brother judah he owns twelvetreesyou know the large coffee plantation ive come to stay with him for the season and im having ever so marvelous a time no im afraid we dont know anyone here i said apologetically weve only just arrived ourselvesfrom martinique where my husbands sugar business is oh miss williams cried her eyes flying wide open but you must allow me to make you acquainted with my particular friends the stephenses i believe they once visited martinique and georgina stephens is such a charming personyou will like her at once i promise and that was all there was to it within an hour i had been introduced to dozens of people and was being carried slowly round the room eddying from one group to the next passed hand to hand by the current of introductions launched by miss williams across the room i could see jamie standing head and shoulders above his companions the picture of aristocratic dignity he was conversing cordially with a group of men all eager to make the acquaintance of a prosperous businessman who might offer useful contacts with the french sugar trade i caught his eye once in passing and he gave me a brilliant smile and a gallant french bow i still wondered what in the name of god he thought he was up to but shrugged mentally he would tell me when he was ready fergus and marsali as usual needing no ones company but each others were dancing at one end of the floor her glowing pink face smiling into his for the sake of the occasion fergus had forgone his useful hook replacing it with a black leather glove filled with bran pinned to the sleeve of his coat this rested against the back of marsalis gown a trifle stifflooking but not so unnatural as to provoke comment i danced past them revolving sedately in the arms of a short tubby english planter named carstairs who wheezed pleasantries into my bosom red face streaming sweat as for mr willoughby he was enjoying an unparalleled social triumph the center of attention of a cluster of ladies who vied with each other in pressing dainties and refreshments on him his eyes were bright and a faint flush shone on his sallow cheeks mr carstairs deposited me among a group of ladies at the end of the dance and gallantly went to fetch a cup of claret i at once returned to the business of the evening asking the ladies whether they might be familiar with people to whose acquaintance i had been recommended named abernathy abernathy mrs hall a youngish matron fluttered her fan and looked blank no i cannot say i am acquainted with them do they take a great part in society do you know oh no joan her friend mrs yoakum looked shocked with the particular kind of enjoyable shock that precedes some juicy revelation youve heard of the abernathys you remember the man who bought rose hall up on the yallahs river oh yes mrs halls blue eyes widened the one who died so soon after buying it yes thats the one another lady chimed in overhearing malaria they said it was but i spoke to the doctor who attended himhe had come to dress mamas bad leg you know she is such a martyr to the dropsyand he told mein strictest confidence of course the tongues wagged merrily rosie maciver had been a faithful reporter all the stories she had conveyed were here and more i caught hold of the conversational thread and gave it a jerk in the desired direction does mrs abernathy have indentured labor as well as slaves here opinion was more confused some thought that she had several indentured servants some thought only one or twono one present had actually set foot in rose hall but of course people said a few minutes later the gossip had turned to fresh meat and the incredible behavior of the new curate mr jones with the widowed mrs mina alcott but then what could be expected of a woman with her reputation and surely it was not entirely the young mans fault and she so much older though of course one in holy orders might be expected to be held to a higher standardi made an excuse and slipped away to the ladies retiring room my ears ringing i saw jamie as i went standing near the refreshment table he was talking to a tall redhaired girl in embroidered cotton a trace of unguarded tenderness lingering in his eyes as he looked at her she was smiling eagerly up at him flattered by his attention i smiled at the sight wondering what the young lady would think did she realize that he was not really looking at her at all but imagining her as the daughter he had never seen i stood in front of the looking glass in the outer retiring room tucking in stray curls loosened by the exertion of dancing and took pleasure in the temporary silence the retiring room was luxuriously appointed being in fact three separate chambers with the privy facilities and a room for the storage of hats shawls and extraneous clothing opening off the main room where i stood this had not only a long pierglass and a fully appointed dressing table but also a chaise longue covered in red velvet i eyed it with some wistfulnessthe slippers i was wearing were pinching my feet badlybut duty called so far i had learned nothing beyond what we already knew about the abernathy plantation though i had compiled a useful list of several other plantations near kingston that employed indentured labor i wondered whether jamie intended to call upon his friend the governor to help in the search for ianthat might possibly justify risking an appearance here tonight but lord johns response to the revelation of my identity was both puzzling and disturbing you would think the man had seen a ghost i squinted at my violet reflection admiring the glitter of the blackandgold fish at my throat but failed to see anything unsettling in my appearance my hair was tucked up with pins decorated with seed pearls and brilliants and discreet use of mrs macivers cosmetics had darkened my lids and blushed my cheeks quite becomingly if i did say so myself i shrugged fluttered my lashes seductively at my image then patted my hair and returned to the salon i made my way toward the long tables of refreshments where a huge array of cakes pastries savories fruits candies stuffed rolls and a number of objects i couldnt put a name to but presumed edible were displayed as i turned absentmindedly from the refreshment table with a plate of fruit i collided headlong with a darkhued waistcoat apologizing to its owner in confusion i found myself looking up into the dour face of the reverend archibald campbell mrs malcolm he exclaimed in astonishment erreverend campbell i replied rather weakly what a surprise i dabbed tentatively at a smear of mango on his abdomen but he took a marked step backward and i desisted he looked rather coldly at my décolletage i trust i find you well mrs malcolm he said yes thank you i said i wished he would stop calling me mrs malcolm before someone to whom i had been introduced as madame alexandre heard him i was so sorry to hear about your sister i said hoping to distract him have you any word of her yet he bent his head stiffly accepting my sympathy no my own attempts at instigating a search have of course been limited he said it was at the suggestion of one of my parishioners that i accompanied him and his wife here tonight with the intention of putting my case before the governor and begging his assistance in locating my sister i assure you mrs malcolm no less weighty a consideration would have impelled my attendance at a function such as this he cast a glance of profound dislike at a laughing group nearby where three young men were competing with each other in the composition of witty toasts to a group of young ladies who received these attentions with much giggling and energetic fanfluttering im truly sorry for your misfortune reverend i said edging aside miss cowden told me a bit about your sisters tragedy if i should be able to be of help no one can help he interrupted his eyes were bleak it was the fault of the papist stuarts with their wicked attempt upon the throne and the licentious highlanders who followed them no no one can help save god he has destroyed the house of stuart he will destroy the man fraser as well and on that day my sister will be healed fraser the trend of the conversation was making me distinctly uneasy i glanced quickly across the room but luckily jamie was nowhere in sight that is the name of the man who seduced margaret from her family and her proper loyalties his may not have been the hand that struck her down but it was on his account that she had left her home and safety and placed herself in danger aye god will requite james fraser fairly he said with a sort of grim satisfaction at the thought yes im sure he will i murmured if you will excuse me i believe i see a friend i tried to escape but a passing procession of footmen bearing dishes of meat blocked my way god will not suffer lewdness to endure forever the reverend went on evidently feeling that the almightys opinions coincided largely with his own his small gray eyes rested with icy disapproval on a group nearby where several ladies fluttered around mr willoughby like bright moths about a chinese lantern mr willoughby was brightly lit too in more than one sense of the word his highpitched giggle rose above the laughter of the ladies and i saw him lurch heavily against a passing servant nearly upsetting a tray of sorbet cups let the women learn with all sobriety the reverend was intoning avoiding all gaudiness of clothing and broided hair he seemed to be hitting his stride no doubt sodom and gomorrah would be up next a woman who has no husband should devote herself to the service of the lord not be disporting herself with abandon in public places do you see mrs alcott and she a widow who should be engaged in pious works i followed the direction of his frown and saw that he was looking at a chubby jollylooking woman in her thirties with light brown hair done in gathered ringlets who was giggling at mr willoughby i looked at her with interest so this was the infamous merry widow of kingston the little chinese had now got down upon his hands and knees and was crawling around on the floor pretending to look for a lost earring while mrs alcott squeaked in mock alarm at his forays toward her feet i thought perhaps i had better find fergus without delay and have him detach mr willoughby from his new acquaintance before matters went too far evidently offended beyond bearing by the sight the reverend abruptly put down the cup of lemon squash he had been holding turned and made his way through the crowd toward the terrace vigorously elbowing people out of his way i breathed a sigh of relief conversation with the reverend campbell was a lot like exchanging frivolities with the public hangmanthough in fact the only hangman with whom i had been personally acquainted was much better company than the reverend suddenly i saw jamies tall figure heading for a door on the far side of the room where i assumed the governors private quarters to be he must be going to talk to lord john now moved by curiosity i decided to join him the floor was by now so crowded that it was difficult to make my way across it by the time i reached the door through which jamie had gone he had long since disappeared but i pushed my way through i was in a long hallway dimly lighted by candles in sconces and pierced at intervals by long casement windows through which red light from the torches on the terrace outside flickered picking up the gleam of metal from the decorations on the walls these were largely military consisting of ornamental sprays of pistols knives shields and swords lord johns personal souvenirs i wondered or had they come with the house away from the clamor of the salon it was remarkably quiet i walked down the hallway my steps muffled by the long turkey carpet that covered the parquet there was an indistinguishable murmur of male voices ahead i turned a corner into a shorter corridor and saw a door ahead from which light spilledthat must be the governors private office inside i heard jamies voice oh god john he said i stopped dead halted much more by the tone of that voice than by the wordsit was broken with an emotion i had seldom heard from him walking very quietly i drew closer framed in the halfopen door was jamie head bowed as he pressed lord john grey tight in a fervent embrace i stood still completely incapable of movement or speech as i watched they broke apart jamies back was turned to me but lord john faced the hallway he could have seen me easily had he looked he wasnt looking toward the hallway though he was staring at jamie and on his face was a look of such naked hunger that the blood rushed to my own cheeks when i saw it i dropped my fan i saw the governors head turn startled at the sound then i was running down the hall back toward the salon my heartbeat drumming in my ears i shot through the door into the salon and came to a halt behind a potted palm heart pounding the wroughtiron chandeliers were thick with beeswax candles and pine torches burned brightly on the walls but even so the corners of the room were dark i stood in the shadows trembling my hands were cold and i felt slightly sick what in the name of god was going on the governors shock at learning that i was jamies wife was now at least partially explained that one glimpse of unguarded painful yearning had told me exactly how matters stood on his side jamie was another question altogether he was the governor of ardsmuir prison he had said casually and less casually on another occasion dye ken what men in prison do i did know but i would have sworn on briannas head that jamie didnt hadnt couldnt under any circumstances whatever at least i would have sworn that before tonight i closed my eyes chest heaving and tried not to think of what i had seen i couldnt of course and yet the more i thought of it the more impossible it seemed the memories of jack randall might have faded with the physical scars he had left but i could not believe that they would ever fade sufficiently for jamie to tolerate the physical attentions of another man let alone to welcome them but if he knew grey so intimately as to make what i had witnessed plausible in the name of friendship alone then why had he not told me of him before why go to such lengths to see the man as soon as he learned that grey was in jamaica my stomach dropped once more and the feeling of sickness returned i wanted badly to sit down as i leaned against the wall trembling in the shadows the door to the governors quarters opened and the governor came out returning to his party his face was flushed and his eyes shone i could at that moment easily have murdered him had i anything more lethal than a hairpin to hand the door opened again a few minutes later and jamie emerged no more than six feet away his mask of cool reserve was in place but i knew him well enough to see the marks of a strong emotion under it but while i could see it i couldnt interpret it excitement apprehension fear and joy mingled something else i had simply never seen him look that way before he didnt seek conversation or refreshments but instead began to stroll about the room obviously looking for someone for me i swallowed heavily i couldnt face himnot in front of a crowd i stayed where i was watching him until he finally went out onto the terrace then i left my hiding place and crossed the room as quickly as i could heading for the refuge of the retiring room at least there i would be able to sit down for a moment i pushed open the heavy door and stepped inside relaxing at once as the warm comforting scents of womens perfume and powder surrounded me then the other smell struck me it too was a familiar scentone of the smells of my profession but not expected here the retiring room was still quiet the loud rumble from the salon had dropped abruptly to a faint murmur like a faroff thunderstorm it was however no longer a place of refuge mina alcott lay sprawled across the red velvet chaise her head hanging backward over the edge her skirts in disarray about her neck her eyes were open fixed in upsidedown surprise the blood from her severed throat had turned the velvet black beneath her and dripped down into a large pool beneath her head her light brown hair had come loose from its dressing the matted ends of her ringlets dangling in the puddle i stood frozen too paralyzed even to call for help then i heard the sound of gay voices in the hallway outside and the door pushed open there was a moments silence as the women behind me saw it too light from the corridor spilled through the door and across the floor and in the moment before the screaming began i saw the footprints leading toward the windowthe small neat prints of a feltsoled foot outlined in blood in which much is revealed they had taken jamie somewhere i shaking and incoherent had been putwith a certain amount of ironyin the governors private office with marsali who insisted on trying to bathe my face with a damp towel in spite of my resistance they canna think da had anything to do with it she said for the fifth time they dont i finally pulled myself together enough to talk to her but they think mr willoughby didand jamie brought him here she stared at me wideeyed with horror mr willoughby but he couldnt i wouldnt have thought so i felt as though someone had been beating me with a club everything ached i sat slumped on a small velvet love seat aimlessly twirling a glass of brandy between my hands unable to drink it i couldnt even decide what i ought to feel let alone sort out the conflicting events and emotions of the evening my mind kept jumping between the grisly scene in the retiring room and the tableau i had seen a halfhour earlier in this very room i sat looking at the governors big desk i could still see the two of them jamie and lord john as though they had been painted on the wall before me i just dont believe it i said out loud and felt slightly better for the saying neither do i said marsali she was pacing the floor her footsteps changing from the click of heels on parquet to a muffled thump as she hit the flowered carpet he cant have i ken hes a heathen but weve lived wi the man we know him did we did i know jamie i would have sworn i did and yeti kept remembering what he had said to me at the brothel during our first night together will ye take me and risk the man that i am for the sake of the man ye knew i had thought thenand sincethat there was not so much difference between them but if i were wrong im not wrong i muttered clutching my glass fiercely im not if jamie could take lord john grey as a lover and hide it from me he wasnt remotely the man i thought he was there had to be some other explanation he didnt tell you about laoghaire said an insidious little voice inside my head thats different i said to it stoutly whats different marsali was looking at me in surprise i dont know dont mind me i brushed a hand across my face trying to wipe away confusion and weariness its taking them a long time the walnut caseclock had struck two oclock in the morning before the door of the office opened and fergus came in accompanied by a grimlooking militiaman fergus was somewhat the worse for wear most of the powder had gone from his hair shaken onto the shoulders of his dark blue coat like dandruff what was left gave his hair a grayish cast as though he had aged twenty years overnight no surprise i felt as though i had we can go now chèrie he said quietly to marsali he turned to me will you come with us milady or wait for milord ill wait i said i wasnt going to bed until i had seen jamie no matter how long it took i will have the carriage return for you then he said and put a hand on marsalis back to usher her out the militiaman said something under his breath as they passed him i didnt catch it but evidently fergus did he stiffened eyes narrowing and turned back toward the man the militiaman rocked up onto the balls of his feet smiling evilly and looking expectant clearly he would like nothing better than an excuse to hit fergus to his surprise fergus smiled charmingly at him square white teeth gleaming my thanks mon ami he said for your assistance in this most trying situation he thrust out a blackgloved hand which the militiaman accepted in surprise then fergus jerked his arm suddenly backward there was a brief rip and a pattering sound as a small stream of bran struck the parquet floor keep it he told the militiaman graciously a small token of my appreciation and then they were gone leaving the man slackjawed staring down in horror at the apparently severed hand in his grasp it was another hour before the door opened again this time to admit the governor he was still handsome and neat as a white camellia but definitely beginning to turn brown round the edges i set the untouched glass of brandy down and got to my feet to face him where is jamie still being questioned by captain jacobs the militia commander he sank into his chair looking bemused i had no notion he spoke french so remarkably well i dont suppose you know him all that well i said deliberately baiting what i wanted badly to know was just how well he did know jamie he didnt rise to it though merely took off his formal wig and laid it aside running a hand through his damp blond hair with relief can he keep up such an impersonation do you think he asked frowning and i realized that he was so occupied with thoughts of the murder and of jamie that he was paying little if any attention to me yes i said shortly where do they have him i got up heading for the door in the formal parlor he said but i dont think you should not pausing to listen i yanked open the door and poked my head into the hall then hastily drew it back and slammed the door coming down the hall was the admiral i had met in the receiving line face set in lines of gravity suitable to the situation admirals i could deal with however he was accompanied by a flotilla of junior officers and among the entourage i had spotted a face i knew though he was now wearing the uniform of a first lieutenant instead of an oversized captains coat he was shaved and rested but his face was puffy and discolored someone had beaten him up in the not too distant past despite the differences in his appearance i had not the slightest difficulty in recognizing thomas leonard i had the distinct feeling that he wouldnt have any trouble recognizing me either violet silk notwithstanding i looked frantically about the office for someplace to hide but short of crawling into the kneehole of the desk there was no place at all the governor was watching me fair brows raised in astonishment what he began but i rounded on him finger to my lips dont give me away if you value jamies life i hissed melodramatically and so saying flung myself onto the velvet love seat snatched up the damp towel and dropped it on my face andwith a superhuman effort of willforced all my limbs to go limp i heard the door open and the admirals high querulous voice lord john he began and then evidently noticed my supine form for he broke off and resumed in a slightly lower voice oh i collect you are engaged not precisely engaged admiral no grey had fast reflexes i would say that for him he sounded perfectly selfpossessed as though he were quite used to being found in custody of unconscious females the lady was overcome by the shock of discovering the body oh said the admiral again this time dripping with sympathy i quite see that beastly shock for a lady to be sure he hesitated then dropping his voice to a sort of hoarse whisper said dyou think shes asleep i should think so the governor assured him shes had enough brandy to fell a horse my fingers twitched but i managed to lie still oh quite best thing for shock brandy the admiral went on whispering sounding like a rusted hinge meant to tell you i have sent to antigua for additional troopsquite at your disposalguards search the townif the militia dont find the fellow first he added i hope they may not said a viciously determined voice among the officers id like to catch the yellow bugger myself there wouldnt be enough of him left to hang believe me a deep murmur of approval at this sentiment went through the men to be sternly quelled by the admiral your sentiments do you credit gentlemen he said but the law will be observed in all respects you will make that clear to the troops in your command when the miscreant is taken he is to be brought to the governor and justice will be properly executed i assure you i didnt like the way he emphasized the word executed but he got a grudging chorus of assent from his officers the admiral having delivered this order in his ordinary voice dropped back into a whisper to take his leave i shall be staying in the town at macadams hotel he croaked do not hesitate to send to me for any assistance your excellency there was a general shuffle and murmur as the naval officers took their leave observing discretion for the sake of my slumbers then came the sound of a single pair of footsteps and then the whoosh and creak of someone settling heavily into a chair there was silence for a moment then lord john said you can get up now if you wish i am supposing that you are not in fact prostrate with shock he added ironically somehow i suspect that a mere murder would not be sufficient to discompose a woman who could deal singlehandedly with a typhoid epidemic i removed the towel from my face and swung my feet off the chaise sitting up to face him he was leaning on his desk chin in his hands staring at me there are shocks i said precisely smoothing back my damp curls and giving him an eyeball and then there are shocks if you know what i mean he looked surprised then a flicker of understanding came into his expression he reached into the drawer of his desk and pulled out my fan white silk embroidered with violets this is yours i suppose i found it in the corridor his mouth twisted wryly as he looked at me i see i suppose then you will have some notion of how your appearance earlier this evening affected me i doubt it very much i said my fingers were still icy and i felt as though i had swallowed some large cold object that pressed uncomfortably under my breastbone i breathed deeply trying to force it down to no avail you didnt know that jamie was married he blinked but not in time to keep me from seeing a small grimace of pain as though someone had struck him suddenly across the face i knew he had been married he corrected he dropped his hands fiddling aimlessly with the small objects that littered his desk he told meor gave me to understand at leastthat you were dead grey picked up a small silver paperweight and turned it over and over in his hands eyes fixed on the gleaming surface a large sapphire was set in it winking blue in the candlelight has he never mentioned me he asked softly i wasnt sure whether the undertone in his voice was pain or anger despite myself i felt some small sense of pity for him yes he did i said he said you were his friend he glanced up the finecut face lightening a bit did he you have to understand i said heiwe were separated by the war the rising each of us thought the other was dead i found him again onlymy god was it only four months ago i felt staggered and not only by the events of the evening i felt as though i had lived several lifetimes since the day i had opened the door of the printshop in edinburgh to find a malcolm bending over his press the lines of stress in greys face eased a little i see he said slowly soyou have not seen him sincemy god thats twenty years he stared at me dumbfounded and four months whyhow he shook his head brushing away the questions well thats of no consequence just now but he did not tell youthat ishas he not told you about willie i stared at him blankly whos willie instead of explaining he bent and opened the drawer of his desk he pulled out a small object and laid it on the desk motioning me to come closer it was a portrait an oval miniature set in a carved frame of some finegrained dark wood i looked at the face and sat down abruptly my knees gone to water i was only dimly aware of greys face floating above the desk like a cloud on the horizon as i picked up the miniature to look at it more closely he might have been brees brother was my first thought the second coming with the force of a blow to the solar plexus was my god in heaven he is brees brother there couldnt be much doubt about it the boy in the portrait was perhaps nine or ten with a childish tenderness still lingering about his face and his hair was a soft chestnut brown not red but the slanted blue eyes looked out boldly over a straight nose a fraction of an inch too long and the high viking cheekbones pressed tight against smooth skin the tilt of the head held the same confident carriage as that of the man who had given him that face my hands trembled so violently that i nearly dropped it i set it back on the desk but kept my hand over it as though it might leap up and bite me grey was watching me not without sympathy you didnt know he said who my voice was hoarse with shock and i had to stop and clear my throat who is his mother grey hesitated eyeing me closely then shrugged slightly was shes dead who was she the ripples of shock were still spreading from an epicenter in my stomach making the crown of my head tingle and my toes go numb but at least my vocal cords were coming back under my control i could hear jenny saying hes no the sort of man should sleep alone aye evidently he wasnt her name was geneva dunsany grey said my wifes sister my mind was reeling in an effort to make sense of all this and i suppose i was less than tactful your wife i said goggling at him he flushed deeply and looked away if i had been in any doubt about the nature of the look i had seen him give jamie i wasnt any longer i think you had better bloody well explain to me just what you have to do with jamie and this geneva and this boy i said picking up the portrait once more he raised one brow cool and reserved he had been shocked too but the shock was wearing off i cannot see that i am under any particular obligation to do so he said i fought back the urge to rake my nails down his face but the impulse must have shown on my face for he pushed back his chair and got his feet under him ready to move quickly he eyed me warily across the expanse of dark wood i took several deep breaths unclenched my fists and spoke as calmly as i could right youre not but i would appreciate it very much if you did and why did you show me the picture if you didnt mean me to know i added since i know that much ill certainly find out the rest from jamie you might as well tell me your side of it now i glanced at the window the slice of sky that showed between the halfopen shutters was still a velvet black with no sign of dawn theres time he breathed deeply and laid down the paperweight i suppose there is he jerked his head abruptly at the decanter will you have brandy i will i said promptly and i strongly suggest you have some too i expect you need it as much as i do a slight smile showed briefly at the corner of his mouth is that a medical opinion mrs malcolm he asked dryly absolutely i said this small truce established he sat back rolling his beaker of brandy slowly between his hands you said jamie mentioned me to you he said i must have flinched slightly at his use of jamies name for he frowned at me would you prefer that i referred to him by his surname he said coldly i should scarcely know which to use under the circumstances no i waved it away and took a sip of brandy yes he mentioned you he said you had been the governor of the prison at ardsmuir and that you were a friendand that he could trust you i added reluctantly possibly jamie felt he could trust lord john grey but i was not so sanguine the smile this time was not quite so brief i am glad to hear that grey said softly he looked down into the amber liquid in his cup swirling it gently to release its heady bouquet he took a sip then set the cup down with decision i met him at ardsmuir as he said he began and when the prison was shut down and the other prisoners sold to indenture in america i arranged that jamie should be paroled instead to a place in england called helwater owned by friends of my family he looked at me hesitating then added simply i could not bear the thought of never seeing him again you see in a few brief words he acquainted me with the bare facts of genevas death and willies birth was he in love with her i asked the brandy was doing its bit to warm my hands and feet but it didnt touch the large cold object in my stomach he has never spoken to me of geneva grey said he gulped the last of his brandy coughed and reached to pour another cup it was only when he finished this operation that he looked at me again and added but i doubt it having known her his mouth twisted wryly he never told me about willie either but there was a certain amount of gossip about geneva and old lord ellesmere and by the time the boy was four or five the resemblance made it quite clear who his father wasto anyone who cared to look he took another deep swallow of brandy i suspect that my motherinlaw knows but of course she would never breathe a word she wouldnt he stared at me over the rim of his cup no would you if it were a choice of your only grandchild being either the ninth earl of ellesmere and heir to one of the wealthiest estates in england or the penniless bastard of a scottish criminal i see i drank some more of my own brandy trying to imagine jamie with a young english girl named genevaand succeeding all too well quite grey said dryly jamie saw too and very wisely arranged to leave helwater before it became obvious to everyone and thats where you come back into the story is it i asked he nodded eyes closed the residence was quiet though there was a certain distant stir that made me aware that people were still about thats right he said jamie gave the boy to me the stable at ellesmere was wellbuilt cozy in the winter it was a cool haven in summer the big bay stallion flicked its ears lazily at a passing fly but stood stolidly content enjoying the attentions of his groom isobel is most displeased with you grey said is she jamies voice was indifferent there was no need any longer to worry about displeasing any of the dunsanys she said you had told willie you were leaving which upset him dreadfully hes been howling all day jamies face was turned away but grey saw the faint tightening at the side of his throat he rocked backward leaning against the stable wall as he watched the curry comb come down and down and down in hard even strokes that left dark trails across the shimmering coat surely it would have been easier to say nothing to the boy grey said quietly i suppose it wouldfor lady isobel fraser turned to put up the curry comb and slapped a hand on the stallions rump in dismissal grey thought there was an air of finality in the gesture tomorrow jamie would be gone he felt a slight thickening in his own throat but swallowed it he rose and followed fraser toward the door of the stall jamie he said putting his hand on frasers shoulder the scot swung round his features hastily readjusting themselves but not fast enough to hide the misery in his eyes he stood still looking down at the englishman youre right to go grey said alarm flared in frasers eyes quickly supplanted by wariness am i he said anyone with half an eye could see it grey said dryly if anyone ever actually looked at a groom someone would have noticed long before now he glanced back at the bay stallion and cocked one brow some sires stamp their get i have the distinct impression that any offspring of yours would be unmistakable jamie said nothing but grey fancied that he had grown a shade paler than usual surely you can seewell no perhaps not he corrected himself i dont suppose you have a looking glass have you jamie shook his head mechanically no he said absently i shave in the reflection from the trough he drew in a deep breath and let it out slowly aye well he said he glanced toward the house where the french doors were standing open onto the lawn willie was accustomed to play there after lunch on fine days fraser turned to him with sudden decision will ye walk with me he said not pausing for an answer he set off past the stable turning down the lane that led from the paddock to the lower pasture it was nearly a quartermile before he came to a halt in a sunny clearing by a clump of willows near the edge of the mere grey found himself puffing slightly from the quick pacetoo much soft living in london he chided himself fraser of course was not even sweating despite the warmth of the day without preamble turning to face grey he said i wish to ask a favor of ye the slanted blue eyes were direct as the man himself if you think i would tell anyone grey began then shook his head surely you dont think i could do such a thing after all i have knownor at least suspectedfor some time no a faint smile lifted jamies mouth no i dinna think ye would but i would ask ye yes grey said promptly the corner of jamies mouth twitched ye dinna wish to know what it is first i should imagine that i know you wish me to look out for willie perhaps to send you word of his welfare jamie nodded aye thats it he glanced up the slope to where the house lay halfhidden in its nest of fiery maples its an imposition maybe to ask ye to come all the way from london to see him now and then not at all grey interrupted i came this afternoon to give you some news of my own i am to be married married the shock was plain on frasers face to a woman i think there are not many alternatives grey replied dryly but yes since you ask to a woman to the lady isobel christ man ye canna do that i can grey assured him he grimaced i made trial of my capacity in london be assured that i shall make her an adequate husband you neednt necessarily enjoy the act in order to perform itor perhaps you were aware of that there was a small reflexive twitch at the corner of jamies eye not quite a flinch but enough for grey to notice jamie opened his mouth then closed it again and shook his head obviously thinking better of what he had been about to say dunsany is growing too old to take a hand in the running of the estate grey pointed out gordon is dead and isobel and her mother cannot manage the place alone our families have known each other for decades it is an entirely suitable match is it then the sardonic skepticism in jamies voice was clear grey turned to him fair skin flushing as he answered sharply it is there is more to a marriage than carnal love a great deal more fraser swung sharply away he strode to the edge of the mere and stood boots sunk in the reedy mud looking over the ruffled waves for some time grey waited patiently taking the time to unribbon his hair and reorder the thick blond mass at long last fraser came back walking slowly head down as though still thinking facetoface with grey he looked up again you are right he said quietly i have no right to think ill of you if ye mean no dishonor to the lady certainly not grey said besides he added more cheerfully it means i will be here permanently to see to willie you mean to resign your commission then one copper eyebrow flicked upward yes grey said he smiled a little ruefully it will be a relief in a way i was not meant for army life i think fraser seemed to be thinking i should begrateful then he said if you would stand as stepfather toto my son he had likely never spoken the word aloud before and the sound of it seemed to shock him iwould be obliged to you jamie sounded as though his collar were too tight though in fact his shirt was open at the throat grey looked curiously at him and saw that his countenance was slowly turning a dark and painful red in returnif you wanti mean i would be willing tothat is grey suppressed the sudden desire to laugh he laid a light hand on the big scots arm and saw jamie brace himself not to flinch at the touch my dear jamie he said torn between laughter and exasperation are you actually offering me your body in payment for my promise to look after willie frasers face was red to the roots of his hair aye i am he snapped tightlipped dye want it or no at this grey did laugh in long gasping whoops finally having to sit down on the grassy bank in order to recover himself oh dear god he said at last wiping his eyes that i should live to hear an offer like that fraser stood above him looking down the morning light silhouetting him lighting his hair in flames against the pale blue sky grey thought he could see a slight twitch of the wide mouth in the darkened facehumor tempered with a profound relief ye dinna want me then grey got to his feet dusting the seat of his breeches i shall probably want you to the day i die he said matteroffactly but tempted as i am he shook his head brushing wet grass from his hands do you really think that i would demandor acceptany payment for such a service he asked really i should feel my honor most grossly insulted by that offer save that i know the depth of feeling which prompted it aye well jamie muttered i didna mean to insult ye grey was not sure at this point whether to laugh or cry instead he reached a hand up and gently touched jamies cheek fading now to its normal pale bronze more quietly he said besides you cannot give me what you do not have grey felt rather than saw the slight relaxation of tension in the tall body facing him you shall have my friendship jamie said softly if that has any value to ye a very great value indeed the two men stood silent together for a moment then grey sighed and turned to look up at the sun its getting late i suppose you will have a great many things to do today jamie cleared his throat aye i have i suppose i should be about my business yes i suppose so grey tugged down the points of his waistcoat ready to go but jamie lingered awkwardly a moment and then as though suddenly making up his mind to it stepped forward and bending down cupped greys face between his hands grey felt the big hands warm on the skin of his face light and strong as the brush of an eagles feather and then jamie frasers soft wide mouth touched his own there was a fleeting impression of tenderness and strength held in check the faint taste of ale and freshbaked bread then it was gone and john grey stood blinking in the brilliant sun oh he said jamie gave him a shy crooked smile aye well he said i suppose im maybe not poisoned he turned then and disappeared into the screen of willows leaving lord john grey alone by the mere the governor was quiet for a moment then he looked up with a bleak smile that was the first time that he ever touched me willingly he said quietly and the lastuntil this evening when i gave him the other copy of that miniature i sat completely motionless the brandy glass unregarded in my hands i wasnt sure what i felt shock fury horror jealousy and pity all washed through me in successive waves mingling in eddies of confused emotion a woman had been violently done to death nearby within the last few hours and yet the scene in the retiring room seemed unreal by comparison with that miniature a small and unimportant picture painted in tones of red for the moment neither lord john nor i was concerned with crime or justiceor with anything beyond what lay between us the governor was examining my face with considerable absorption i suppose i should have recognized you on the ship he said but of course at the time i had thought you long dead well it was dark i said rather stupidly i shoved a hand through my curls feeling dizzy from brandy and sleeplessness then i realized what he had said recognized me but youd never met me he hesitated then nodded do you recall a dark wood near carryarrick in the scottish highlands twenty years ago and a young boy with a broken arm you set it for me he lifted one arm in demonstration jesus h roosevelt christ i picked up the brandy and took a swallow that made me cough and gasp i blinked at him eyes watering knowing now who he was i could make out the fine light bones and see the slighter softer outline of the boy he had been yours were the first womans breasts i had ever seen he said wryly it was a considerable shock from which you appear to have recovered i said rather coldly you seem to have forgiven jamie for breaking your arm and threatening to shoot you at least he flushed slightly and set down his beaker iwellyes he said abruptly we sat there for quite some time neither of us having any idea what to say he took a breath once or twice as though about to say something but then abandoned it at last he closed his eyes as though commending his soul to god opened them and looked at me do you know he began then stopped he looked down at his clenched hands then not at me a blue stone winked on one knuckle bright as a teardrop do you know he said again softly addressing his hands what it is to love someone and neverneverbe able to give them peace or joy or happiness he looked up then eyes filled with pain to know that you cannot give them happiness not through any fault of yours or theirs but only because you were not born the right person for them i sat quiet seeing not his but another handsome face dark not fair not feeling the warm breath of the tropical night but the icy hand of a boston winter seeing the pulse of light like hearts blood spilling across the cold snow of hospital linens only because you were not born the right person for them i know i whispered hands clenched in my lap i had told frankleave me but he could not no more than i could love him rightly having found my match elsewhere oh frank i said silently forgive me i suppose i am asking whether you believe in fate lord john went on the ghost of a smile wavered on his face you of all people would seem best suited to say youd think so wouldnt you i said bleakly but i dont know any more than you he shook his head then reached out and picked up the miniature i have been more fortunate than most i suppose he said quietly there was the one thing he would take from me his expression softened as he looked down into the face of the boy in the palm of his hand and he has given me something most precious in return without thinking my hand spread out across my belly jamie had given me that same precious giftand at the same great cost to himself the sound of footsteps came down the hall muffled by the carpet there was a sharp rap at the door and a militiaman stuck his head into the office is the lady recovered yet he asked captain jacobs has finished his questions and monsieur alexandres carriage has returned i got hastily to my feet yes im fine i turned to the governor not knowing what to say to him ithank you forthat is he bowed formally to me coming around the desk to see me out i regret extremely that you should have been subjected to such a shocking experience maam he said with no trace of anything but diplomatic regret in his voice he had resumed his official manner smooth and polished as his parquet floors i followed the militiaman but at the door i turned impulsively when we met that night aboard the porpoiseim glad you didnt know who i was iliked you then he stood for a second polite remote then the mask dropped away i liked you too he said quietly then i felt as though i were riding next to a stranger the light was beginning to gray toward dawn and even in the dimness of the coach i could see jamie sitting opposite me his face drawn with weariness he had taken off the ridiculous wig as soon as we drove away from government house discarding the facade of the polished frenchman to let the disheveled scot beneath show through his unbound hair lay in waves over his shoulders dark in that predawn light that robs everything of color do you think he did it i asked at last only for something to say his eyes were closed at this they opened and he shrugged slightly i dont know he said he sounded exhausted i have asked myself that a thousand times tonightand been asked it even more he rubbed his knuckles hard over his forehead i canna imagine a man i know to do such a thing and yetwell ye ken hell do anything when hes drink taken and hes killed before drunkyoull mind the customs man at the brothel i nodded and he leaned forward elbows on his knees sinking his head into his hands this is different though he said i canna thinkbut maybe so ye ken what he said about women on the ship and if this mrs alcott was to have toyed wi him she did i said i saw her he nodded without looking up so did any number of other people but if she led him to think she meant more than she maybe did and then perhaps she put him off maybe laughed at himand him fu as a puggie wi drink and knives to hand on every wall of the place he sighed and sat up god knows he said bleakly i dont he ran a hand backward through his hair smoothing it theres something else about it i had to tell them that i scarcely knew willoughbythat wed met him on the packet boat from martinique and thought it kindly to introduce him about but didna ken a thing of where he came from or the sort of fellow he truly was did they believe it he glanced at me wryly so far but the packet boat comes in again in six daysat which point theyll question the captain and discover that hes never laid eyes on monsieur etienne alexandre and his wife let alone a wee yellow murdering fiend that might be a trifle awkward i observed thinking of fergus and the militiaman were already rather unpopular on mr willoughbys account nothing to what we will be if six days pass and they havena found him he assured me six days is also maybe as long as it will take for gossip to spread from blue mountain house to kingston about the macivers visitorsfor ye ken the servants there all know who we are damn he smiled briefly at that and my heart turned over to see it youve a nice way wi words sassenach aye well all it means is that we must find ian within six days i shall go to rose hall at once but i think i must just have a wee rest before setting out he yawned widely behind his hand and shook his head blinking we didnt speak again until after we had arrived at blue mountain house and made our way on tiptoe through the slumbering house to our room i changed in the dressing room dropping the heavy stays on the floor with relief and taking out the pins to let my hair fall free wearing only a silk chemise i came into the bedroom to see jamie standing by the french door in his shirt looking out over the lagoon he turned when he heard me and beckoned putting a finger to his lips come see he whispered there was a small herd of manatees in the lagoon big gray bodies gliding under the dark crystal water rising gleaming like smooth wet rocks birds were beginning to call in the trees near the house besides this the only sound was the frequent whoosh of the manatees breath as they rose for air and now and then an eerie sound like a hollow distant wail as they called to each other we watched them in silence side by side the lagoon began to turn green as the first rays of sun touched its surface in that state of extreme fatigue where every sense is preternaturally heightened i was as aware of jamie as though i were touching him john greys revelations had relieved me of most of my fears and doubtsand yet there remained the fact that jamie had not told me about his son of course he had reasonsand good onesfor his secrecy but did he not think he could trust me to keep his secret it occurred to me suddenly that perhaps he had kept quiet because of the boys mother perhaps he had loved her in spite of greys impressions she was dead could it matter if he had the answer was that it did i had thought jamie dead for twenty years and it had made no difference at all in what i felt for him what if he had loved this young english girl in such a way i swallowed a small lump in my throat trying to find the courage to ask him his face was abstracted a small frown creasing his forehead despite the dawning beauty of the lagoon what are you thinking i asked at last unable to ask for reassurance fearing to ask for the truth its only that i had a thought he answered still staring out at the manatees about willoughby aye the events of the night seemed far away and unimportant yet murder had been done what was that well i couldna think at first that willoughby could do such a thinghow could any man he paused drawing a finger through the light mist of condensation that formed on the windowpanes as the sun rose and yet he turned to face me perhaps i can see his face was troubled he was aloneverra much alone a stranger in a strange land i said quietly remembering the poems painted in the open secrecy of bold black ink sent flying toward a longlost home committed to the sea on wings of white paper aye thats it he stopped to think rubbing a hand slowly through his hair gleaming copper in the new daylight and when a man is alone that waywell its maybe no decent to say it but making love to a woman is maybe the only thing will make him forget it for a time he looked down turning his hands over stroking the length of his scarred middle finger with the index finger of his left hand thats what made me wed laoghaire he said quietly not jennys nagging not pity for her or the wee lassies not even a pair of aching balls his mouth turned up briefly at one corner then relaxed only needing to forget i was alone he finished softly he turned restlessly back to the window so i am thinking that if the chinee came to her wanting thatneeding thatand she wouldna take him he shrugged staring out across the cool green of the lagoon aye maybe he could have done it he said i stood beside him out in the center of the lagoon a single manatee drifted lazily to the surface turning on her back to hold the infant on her chest toward the sunlight he was silent for several minutes and i was as well not knowing how to take the conversation back to what i had seen and heard at government house i felt rather than saw him swallow and he turned from the window to face me there were lines of tiredness in his face but his expression was filled with a sort of determinationthe sort of look he wore facing battle claire he said and at once i stiffened he called me by my name only when he was most serious claire i must tell ye something what i had been trying to think how to ask but suddenly i didnt want to hear i took half a step back away from him but he grabbed my arm he had something hidden in his fist he took my unresisting hand and put the object into it without looking i knew what it was i could feel the carving of the delicate oval frame and the slight roughness of the painted surface claire i could see the slight tremor at the side of his throat as he swallowed clairei must tell ye i have a son i didnt say anything but opened my hand there it was the same face i had seen in greys office a childish cocky version of the man before me i should ha told ye before he was searching my face for some clue to my feelings but for once my giveaway countenance must have been perfectly blank i would haveonly he took a deep breath for strength to go on i havena ever told anyone about him he said not even jenny that startled me enough to speak jenny doesnt know he shook his head and turned away to watch the manatees alarmed by our voices they had retreated a short distance but then had settled down again feeding on the water weed at the edge of the lagoon it was in england itshesi couldna say he was mine hes a bastard aye it might have been the rising sun that flushed his cheeks he bit his lip and went on i havena seen him since he was a wee lad i never will see him againexcept it might be in a wee painting like this he took the small picture from me cradling it in the palm of his hand like a babys head he blinked head bent over it i was afraid to tell ye he said lowvoiced for fear ye would think that perhaps id gone about spawning a dozen bastardsfor fear yed think that i wouldna care for brianna so much if ye kent i had another child but i do care clairea great deal more than i can tell ye he lifted his head and looked directly at me will ye forgive me did you the words almost choked me but i had to say them did you love her an extraordinary expression of sadness crossed his face but he didnt look away no he said softly shewanted me i should have found a wayshould have stopped her but i could not she wished me to lie wi her and i did andshe died of it he did look down then long lashes hiding his eyes i am guilty of her death before god perhaps the more guiltybecause i did not love her i didnt say anything but put up a hand to touch his cheek he pressed his own hand over it hard and closed his eyes there was a gecko on the wall beside us nearly the same color as the yellow plaster behind it beginning to glow in the gathering daylight what is he like i asked softly your son he smiled slightly without opening his eyes hes spoilt and stubborn he said softly illmannered loud wi a wicked temper he swallowed and braw and bonny and canty and strong he said so softly i could barely hear him and yours i said his hand tightened on mine holding it against the soft stubble of his cheek and mine he said he took a deep breath and i could see the glitter of tears under his closed lids you should have trusted me i said at last he nodded slowly then opened his eyes still holding my hand perhaps i should he said quietly and yet i kept thinkinghow should i tell ye everything about geneva and willie and johnwill ye know about john he frowned slightly then relaxed as i nodded he told me about everything his brows rose but he went on especially after ye found out about laoghaire how could i tell ye and expect ye to know the difference what difference genevawillies mothershe wanted my body he said softly watching the geckos pulsing sides laoghaire needed my name and the work of my hands to keep her and her bairns he turned his head then dark blue eyes fixed on mine johnwell he lifted his shoulders and let them drop i couldna give him what he wantedand he is friend enough not to ask it but how shall i tell ye all these things he said the line of his mouth twisting and then say to youit is only you i have ever loved how should you believe me the question hung in the air between us shimmering like the reflection from the water below if you say it i said ill believe you you will he sounded faintly astonished why because youre an honest man jamie fraser i said smiling so that i wouldnt cry and may the lord have mercy on you for it only you he said so softly i could barely hear him to worship ye with my body give ye all the service of my hands to give ye my name and all my heart and soul with it only you because ye will not let me lieand yet ye love me i did touch him then jamie i said softly and laid my hand on his arm you arent alone anymore he turned then and took me by the arms searching my face i swore to you i said when we married i didnt mean it then but i sworeand now i mean it i turned his hand over in both mine feeling the thin smooth skin at the base of his wrist where the pulse beat under my fingers where the blade of his dirk had cut his flesh once and spilled his blood to mingle with mine forever i pressed my own wrist against his pulse to pulse heartbeat to heartbeat blood of my blood i whispered bone of my bone his whisper was deep and husky he knelt quite suddenly before me and put his folded hands in mine the gesture a highlander makes when swearing loyalty to his chieftain i give ye my spirit he said head bent over our hands til our life shall be done i said softly but it isnt done yet jamie is it then he rose and took the shift from me and i lay back on the narrow bed naked pulled him down to me through the soft yellow light and took him home and home and home again and we were neither one of us alone the scent of gemstones rose hall was ten miles out of kingston up a steep and winding road of reddish dust that led into blue mountains the road was overgrown so narrow that we must ride in single file most of the way i followed jamie through the dark sweetscented caverns of cedar boughs under trees nearly a hundred feet high huge ferns grew in the shade below the fiddleheads nearly the size of real violin necks everything was quiet save for the calling of birds in the shrubberyand even that fell silent as we passed jamies horse stopped dead once and backed up snorting we waited as a tiny green snake wriggled across the path and into the undergrowth i looked after it but could see no farther than ten feet from the edge of the road everything beyond was cool green shadow i halfhoped that mr willoughby had come this wayno one would ever find him in a place like this the chinaman had not been found in spite of an intensive search of the town by the island militia the special detachment of marines from the barracks on antigua was expected to arrive tomorrow in the meantime every house in kingston was shut up like a bank vault the owners armed to the teeth the mood of the town was thoroughly dangerous like the naval officers it was the militia colonels opinion that if the chinaman were found he would be lucky to survive long enough to be hanged be torn to pieces i expect colonel jacobs had said as he escorted us from the residence on the night of the murder have his balls ripped off and thrust down his stinking throat i daresay he added with obvious grim satisfaction at the thought i daresay jamie had murmured in french assisting me into the carriage i knew that the question of mr willoughby was still troubling him he had been quiet and thoughtful on the ride through the mountains and yet there was nothing we could do if the little chinese was innocent we could not save him if he was guilty we could not give him up the best we might hope for was that he would not be found and in the meantime we had five days to find young ian if he were indeed at rose hall all might be well if he were not a fence and small gate marked the division of the plantation from the surrounding forest inside the ground had been cleared and planted in sugarcane and coffee some distance from the house on a separate rise a large plain muddaub building stood roofed with palm thatch darkskinned people were going in and out and the faint cloying scent of burnt sugar hung over the place below the refineryor so i assumed the building to bestood a large sugar press a primitivelooking affair this consisted of a pair of huge timbers crossed in the shape of an x set on an enormous spindle surmounting the boxlike body of the press two or three men were clambering over the press but it was not working at present the oxen who drove it were hobbled some distance away grazing how do they ever get the sugar down from here i asked curiously thinking of the narrow trail we had come up on mules i brushed cedar needles off the shoulders of my coat making myself presentable no jamie answered absently they send it down the river on barges the rivers just over there down the wee pass ye can see beyond the house he pointed with his chin reining up with one hand and using the other to beat the dust of travel from the skirts of his coat ready sassenach as ill ever be rose hall was a twostoried house long and graciously proportioned with a roof laid in expensive slates rather than in the sheets of tin that covered most of the planters residences a long veranda ran all along one side of the house with long windows and french doors opening on to it a great yellow rosebush grew by the front door climbing on a trellis and spilling over the edge of the roof the scent of its perfume was so heady that it made breathing difficult or perhaps it was only excitement that made my breath come short and stick in my throat i glanced around as we waited for the door to be answered trying to catch a glimpse of any whiteskinned figure near the sugar refinery above yes sah a middleaged slave woman opened the door looking out curiously at us she was widebodied dressed in a white cotton smock with a red turban wrapped round her head and her skin was the deep rich gold in the heart of the flowers on the trellis mr and mrs malcolm to call upon mrs abernathy if ye please jamie said politely the woman looked rather taken aback as though callers were not a common occurrence but after a moments indecision she nodded and stepped back swinging the door wide you be waitin in the salon please sah she said in a soft lilt that made it sallong i be askin the mistress will she see you it was a large room long and graciously proportioned lit by huge casement windows all down one side at the far end of the room was the fireplace an enormous structure with a stone overmantel and a hearth of polished slates that occupied nearly the whole wall you could have roasted an ox in it without the slightest difficulty and the presence of a large spit suggested that the owner of the house did so on occasion the slave had shown us to a wicker sofa and invited us to be seated i sat looking about but jamie strolled restlessly about the room peering through the windows that gave a view of the cane fields below the house it was an odd room comfortably furnished with wicker and rattan furniture wellequipped with fat soft cushions but ornamented with small uncommon curios on one window ledge sat a row of silver handbells graduated from small to large several squat figures of stone and terracotta sat together on the table by my elbow some sort of primitive fetishes or idols all of them were in the shape of women hugely pregnant or with enormous rounded breasts and exaggerated hips and all with a vivid and mildly disturbing sexuality about them it was not a prudish age by any means but i wouldnt have expected to find such objects in a drawing room in any age somewhat more orthodox were the jacobite relics a silver snuffbox a glass flagon a decorated fan a large serving plattereven the large woven rug on the floor all decorated with the square white rose of the stuarts that wasnt so odda great many jacobites who had fled scotland after culloden had come to the west indies to seek the repair of their fortunes i found the sight encouraging a householder with jacobite sympathies might be welcoming to a fellow scot and willing to oblige in the matter of ian if hes here a small voice in my head warned steps sounded in the inner part of the house and there was a flutter at the door by the hearth jamie made a small grunting sound as though someone had hit him and i looked up to see the mistress of the house step into the room i rose to my feet and the small silver cup i had picked up fell to the floor with a clank kept your girlish figure i see claire her head was tilted to one side green eyes gleaming with amusement i was too paralyzed with surprise to respond aloud but the thought drifted through my stunned mind that i couldnt say the same for her geillis duncan had always had a voluptuous abundance of creamy bosom and a generous swell of rounded hip while still creamyskinned she was considerably more abundant and generous in every dimension visible she wore a loose muslin gown under which the soft thick flesh wobbled and swayed as she moved the delicate bones of her face had long since been submerged in swelling plumpness but the brilliant green eyes were the same filled with malice and humor i took a deep breath and got my voice back i trust you wont take this the wrong way i said sinking slowly back onto the wicker sofa but why arent you dead she laughed the silver in her voice as clear as a young girls think i should have been do you well youre no the firstand i daresay youll not be the last to think so either eyes creased to bright green triangles by amusement she sank into her own chair nodded casually to jamie and clapped her hands sharply to summon a servant shall we have a dish of tea she asked me do and ill read the leaves in your cup for ye after ive a reputation as a reader after all a fine teller o the future to be sureand why not she laughed again plump cheeks pinkening with mirth if she had been as shocked by my appearance as i was at hers she disguised it masterfully tea she said to the black maidservant who appeared in response to the summons the special kind in the blue tin aye and the bittie cakes wi the nuts in too youll take a bite she asked turning back to me tis something of an occasion after all i did wonder she said tilting her head to one side like a gull judging the chances of snatching a fish whether our paths might cross again after that day at cranesmuir my heart was beginning to slow the shock overcome in a great wave of curiosity i could feel the questions bubbling up by the dozens and picked one off the top at random did you know me i asked when you met me in cranesmuir she shook her head the strands of creamwhite hair coming loose from their pins and sliding down her neck she poked haphazardly at her knot still surveying me with interest not at the first no though sure and i thought there was a great strangeness about yenot that i was the only one to think that ye didna come through the stones prepared did ye not on purpose i mean i bit back the words not that time and said instead no it was an accident you came on purpose thoughfrom she nodded studying me intently the thickened flesh between her brows was creased and the crease deepened slightly as she looked at me ayeto help prince tearlach her mouth twisted to one side as though she tasted something bad and quite suddenly she turned her head and spat the globule of saliva hit the polished wooden floor with an audible plop an gealtaire salach atailteach she said filthy italian coward her eyes darkened and shone with no pleasant light had i known i should have made my way to rome and killed him while there was time his brother henry might ha been no better thougha ballockless sniveling priest that one not that it made a difference after culloden any stuart would be as useless as another she sighed and shifted her bulk the rattan of the chair creaking beneath her she waved a hand impatiently dismissing the stuarts still thats done with for now ye came by accidentwalked through the stones near the date of a fire feast did ye thats how it usually happens yes i said startled i came through on beltane but what do you mean usually happens have you met a great many otherslikeus i ended hesitantly she shook her head rather absently not many she seemed to be pondering something though perhaps it was only the absence of her refreshments she picked up the silver bell and rang it violently damn that clotilda like us she said returning to the question at hand no i havent only one besides you that i ken ye could ha knocked me over wi a feather when i saw the wee scar on your arm and kent ye for one like myself she touched the great swell of her own upper arm where the small vaccination scar lay hidden beneath the puff of white muslin she tilted her head in that birdlike way again surveying me with one bright green eye no when i said thats how it usually happens i meant judging from the stories folk who disappear in fairy rings and the stone circles i mean they usually walk through near beltane or samhain a few near the sun feastsmidsummers day or the winter solstice thats what the list was i said suddenly reminded of the gray notebook i had left with roger wakefield you had a list of dates and initialsnearly two hundred of them i didnt know what they were but i saw that the dates were mostly in late april or early may or near the end of october aye thats right she nodded eyes still fixed on me in speculation so ye found my wee book is that how ye knew to come and look for me on craigh na dun it was you no that shouted my name just before i stepped through the stones gillian i said and saw her pupils widen at the name that had once been hers though her face stayed smooth gillian edgars yes it was me i didnt know if you saw me in the dark i could see in memory the nightblack circle of stonesand in the center the blazing bonfire and the figure of a slim girl standing by it pale hair flying in the heat of the fire i didnt see ye she said twas only later when i heard ye call out at the witch trial and thought id heard your voice before and then when i saw the mark on your arm she shrugged massively the muslin tight across her shoulders as she settled back who was with ye that night she asked curiously there were two i sawa bonnie dark lad and a girl she closed her eyes concentrating then opened them again to stare at me later on i thought i kent herbut i couldna put a name to her though i could swear id seen the face who was she mistress duncan or is it mistress abernathy now jamie interrupted stepping forward and bowing to her formally the first shock of her appearance was fading but he was still pale his cheekbones prominent under the stretched skin of his face she glanced at him then looked again as though noticing him for the first time well and if its no the wee fox cub she said looking amused she looked him carefully up and down noting every detail of his appearance with interest grown to a bonny man have ye no she said she leaned back in the chair which creaked loudly under her weight and squinted appraisingly at him youve the look of the mackenzies about ye laddie ye always did but now youre older youve the look of both your uncles in your face i am sure both dougal and colum would be pleased yed remember them so well jamies eyes were fixed on her as intently as hers on him he had never liked herand was unlikely to change his opinion nowbut he could not afford to antagonize her not if she had ian here somewhere the arrival of the tea interrupted whatever reply she might have made jamie moved to my side and sat with me on the sofa while geilie carefully poured the tea and handed us each a cup behaving exactly like a conventional hostess at a tea party as though wishing to preserve this illusion she offered the sugar bowl and milk jug and sat back to make light conversation if ye dinna mind my asking mrs abernathy jamie said how did ye come to this place politely left unspoken was the larger questionhow did you escape being burned as a witch she laughed lowering her long lashes coquettishly over her eyes well and yell maybe recall i was wi child back at cranesmuir i seem to recall something of the sort jamie took a sip of his tea the tips of his ears turning slightly pink he had cause to remember that all right she had torn off her clothes in the midst of the witch trial disclosing the secret bulge that would save her lifeat least temporarily a small pink tongue poked out and delicately skimmed the tea droplets from her upper lip have ye had children yourself she asked cocking an eyebrow at me i have terrible chore isnt it dragging about like a mudcaked sow and then being ripped apart for the sake of something looks like a drowned rat she shook her head making a low noise of disgust in her throat the beauty o motherhood is it still i should not complain i supposethe wee ratling saved my life for me and wretched as childbirth is its better than being burnt at the stake id suppose so i said though not having tried the latter i couldnt say for sure geillis choked in her tea spraying brown droplets over the front of her dress she mopped at them carelessly eyeing me with amusement well ive not done it either but ive seen them burn poppet and i think perhaps even lyin in a muddy hole watching your belly grow is better than that they kept you in the thieves hole all the time the silver spoon was cool in my hand but my palm grew sweaty at the memory of the thieves hole in cranesmuir i had spent three days there with geillis duncan accused as a witch how long had she stayed there three months she said staring meditatively into her tea three mortal months of frozen feet and crawling vermin stinking scraps of food and the gravesmell clinging to my skin day and night she looked up then mouth twisting in bitter amusement but i bore the child in style at the end when my pains began they took me from the holelittle chance id run then ayeand the babe was born in my own old bedroom in the fiscals house her eyes were slightly clouded and i wondered whether the liquid in her glass was entirely tea i had diamondpaned windows do ye recall all in shades of purple and green and whitethe finest house in the village she smiled reminiscently they gave me the bairn to hold and the green light fell over his face he looked as though he was drowned indeed i thought he should be cold to the touch like a corpse but he wasnt he was warm warm as his fathers balls she laughed suddenly an ugly sound why are men such fools ye can lead them anywhere by the cockfor a while then give them a son and ye have them by the balls again but its all ye are to them whether theyre coming in or going outa cunt she was leaning back in her chair at this she spread her thighs wide and hoisted her glass in ironic toast above her pubic bone squinting down across the swelling bulge of belly well heres to it i say most powerful thing in the world the niggers know that at least she took a deep careless swig of her drink they carve wee idols all belly and cunt and breasts same as men do where we came fromyou and i she squinted at me teeth bared in amusement seen the dirty mags men buy under the counters then aye the bloodshot green eyes swiveled to jamie and youll know the pictures and the books the men pass about among themselves in paris now wont ye fox its all the same she waved a hand and drank again deeply the only difference is the niggers have the decency to worship it verra perceptive of them jamie said calmly he was sitting back in his chair long legs stretched out in apparent relaxation but i could see the tension in the fingers of the hand that gripped his own cup and how dye ken the pictures men look at in paris mistressabernathy is it now she might be tipsy but was by no means fuddled she looked up sharply at the tone of his voice and gave him a twisted smile oh mistress abernathy will do well enough when i lived in paris i had another namemadame melisande robicheaux like that one i thought it a bit grand but your uncle dougal gave it me so i kept itout of sentiment my free hand curled into a fist out of sight in the folds of my skirt i had heard of madame melisande when we lived in paris not a part of society she had had some fame as a seer of the future ladies of the court consulted her in deepest secrecy for advice on their love lives their investments and their pregnancies i imagine you could have told the ladies some interesting things i said dryly her laugh this time was truly amused oh i could indeed seldom did though folk dont usually pay for the truth ye know sometimes thoughdid ye ken that jeanpaul marats mother meant to name her bairn rudolphe i told her i thought rudolphe was illomened i wondered now and then about thatwould he grow up a revolutionary with a name like rudolphe or would he take it all out in writing poems instead ever think that foxthat a name might make a difference her eyes were fixed on jamie green glass often he said and set down his cup it was dougal got ye away from cranesmuir then she nodded stifling a small belch aye he came to take the babealone for fear someone would find out he was the father aye i wouldna let it go though and when he came near to wrest it from mewhy i snatched the dirk from his belt and pressed it to the childs throat a small smile of satisfaction at the memory curved her lovely lips told him id kill it sure unless he swore on his brothers life and his own soul to get me safe away and he believed you i felt mildly ill at the thought of any mother holding a knife to the throat of her newborn child even in pretense her gaze swiveled back to me oh yes she said softly and the smile widened he knew me did dougal sweating even in the chill of december and unable to take his eyes off the tiny face of his sleeping son dougal had agreed when he leaned over me to take the child i thought of plunging the dirk into his own throat instead she said reminiscently but it would have been a good deal harder to get away by myself so i didnt jamies expression didnt change but he picked up his tea and took a deep swallow dougal had summoned the locksman john macrae and the church sexton and by means of discreet bribery insured that the hooded figure dragged on a hurdle to the pitch barrel next morning would not be that of geillis duncan i thought theyd use straw maybe she said but he was a cleverer man than that auld grannie joan mackenzie had died three days before and was meant to be burying that same afternoon a few rocks in the coffin and the lid nailed down tight and bobs your uncle eh a real body fine for burning she laughed and gulped the last swallow of her drink not everyones seen their own funeral fewer still ha seen their own execution aye it had been the dead of winter and the small grove of rowan trees outside the village stood bare drifted with their own dead leaves the dried red berries showing here and there on the ground like spots of blood it was a cloudy day with the promise of sleet or snow but the whole village turned out nonetheless a witchburning was not an event to be missed the village priest father bain had died himself three months before of fever brought on by a festering sore but a new priest had been imported for the occasion from a village nearby perfuming his way with a censer held before him the priest had come down the path to the grove chanting the service for the dead behind him came the locksman and his two assistants dragging the hurdle and its blackrobed burden i expect grannie joan would have been pleased geilie said white teeth gleaming at the vision she couldna have expected more nor four or five people to her buryingas it was she had the whole village and the incense and special prayers to boot macrae had untied the body and carried it lolling to the barrel of pitch ready waiting the court granted me the mercy to be weirrit before the burning geillis explained ironically so they expected the body to be deadno difficulty there if i was strangled already the only thing anyone might ha seen was that grannie joan weighed half what i did newly delivered as i was but no one seemed to notice she was light in macraes arms you were there i said she nodded smugly oh aye well muffled in a cloakeveryone was because o the weatherbut i wouldna have missed it as the priest finished his last prayer against the evils of enchantment macrae had taken the pine torch from his assistant and stepped forward god omit not this woman from thy covenant and the many evils that she in the body committed he had said and flung the fire into the pitch it was faster than i thought it would be geillis said sounding mildly surprised a great whoosh of firethere was a blast of hot air and a cheer from the crowd and naught to be seen but the flames shooting up high enough to singe the rowan branches overhead the fire had subsided within a minute though and the dark figure within was clear enough to be seen through the pale daylight flames the hood and the hair had burned away with the first scorching rush and the face itself was burned beyond recognition a few moments more and the clean dark shapes of the bones emerged from the melted flesh an airy superstructure rising above the charring barrel only great empty holes where her eyes had been she said the mossgreen eyes turned toward me clouded by memory i thought perhaps she was looking at me but then the skull exploded and it was all over and folk began to come awayall except a few who stayed in hopes of picking up a bit of bone as a keepsake she rose and went unsteadily to the small table near the window she picked up the silver bell and rang it hard aye she said her back turned to us childbirth is maybe easier so dougal got ye away to france jamie said the fingers of his right hand twitched slightly how came ye here to the west indies oh that was later she said carelessly after culloden she turned then and smiled from jamie to me and what might bring the two of ye here to this place surely not the pleasure of my company i glanced at jamie seeing the slight tensing of his back as he sat up straighter his face stayed calm though only his eyes bright with wariness weve come to seek a young kinsman of mine he said my nephew ian murray weve some reason to think he is indentured here geilies pale brows rose high making soft ridges in her forehead ian murray she said and shook her head in puzzlement ive no indentured whites at all here no whites come to that the only free man on the place is the overseer and hes what they call a griffone onequarter black unlike me geillis duncan was a very good liar impossible to tell from her expression of mild interest whether she had ever heard the name ian murray before but lying she was and i knew it jamie knew it too the expression that flashed through his eyes was not disappointment but fury quickly suppressed indeed he said politely and are ye not fearful then alone wi your slaves here so far from town oh no not at all she smiled broadly at him then lifted her double chin and waggled it gently in the direction of the terrace behind him i turned my head and saw that the french door was filled from jamb to doorpost with an immense black man several inches taller than jamie from whose rolledup shirt sleeves protruded arms like tree trunks knotted with muscle meet hercules geilie said with a tiny laugh he has a twin brother too named atlas by chance i asked with an edge to my voice you guessed is she no the clever one eh fox she winked conspiratorially at jamie the rounded flesh of her cheek wobbling with the movement the light caught her from the side as she turned her head and i saw the red spiderwebs of tiny broken capillaries that netted her jowls hercule took no note of this or of anything else his broad face was slack and dull and there was no life in the deepsunk eyes beneath the bony brow ridge it gave me a very uneasy feeling to look at him and not only because of his threatening size looking at him was like passing by a haunted house where something lurks behind blind windows that will do hercule ye can go back to work now geilie picked up the silver bell and tinkled it gently once without a word the giant turned and lumbered off the veranda i have no fear o the slaves she explained theyre afraid o me for they think im a witch verra funny considering is it not her eyes twinkled behind little pouches of fat geiliethat man i hesitated feeling ridiculous in asking such a question hes not aa zombie she laughed delightedly at that clapping her hands together christ a zombie jesus claire she chortled with glee a bright pink rising from throat to hair roots well ill tell ye hes no verra bright she said at last still gasping and wheezing but hes no dead either and went off into further gales of laughter jamie stared at me puzzled zombie never mind i said my face nearly as pink as geilies how many slaves have you got here i asked wanting to change the subject hee hee she said winding down into giggles oh a hundred or so its no such a big place only three hundred acres in cane and a wee bit of coffee on the upper slopes she pulled a lacetrimmed handkerchief from her pocket and patted her damp face sniffing a bit as she regained her composure i could feel rather than see jamies tension i was sure he was as convinced as i that geilie knew something about ian murrayif nothing else she had betrayed no surprise whatever at our appearance someone had told her about us and that someone could only be ian the thought of threatening a woman to extract information wasnt one that would come naturally to jamie but it would to me unfortunately the presence of the twin pillars of hercules had put a stop to that line of thought the next best idea seemed to be to search the house and grounds for any trace of the boy three hundred acres was a fair piece of ground but if he was on the property he would likely be in or near the buildingsthe house the sugar refinery or the slave quarters i came out of my thoughts to realize that geilie had asked me a question whats that i said she repeated patiently that ye had a great deal of talent for the healing when i knew ye in scotland youll maybe know more now i expect i might i looked her over cautiously did she want my skill for herself she wasnt healthy a glance at her mottled complexion and the dark circles beneath her eyes was enough to show that but was she actively ill not for me she said seeing my look not just now anyway ive two slaves gone sick maybe yed be so kind as to look at them i glanced at jamie who gave me the shadow of a nod it was a chance to get into the slave quarters and look for ian i saw when we came in as ye had a bit of trouble wi your sugar press he said rising abruptly he gave geilie a cool nod perhaps i shall have a look at it whilst you and my wife tend the sick without waiting for an answer he took off his coat and hung it on the peg by the door he went out by the veranda rolling up the sleeves of his shirt sunlight glinting on his hair a handy sort is he geilie looked after him amused my husband barnabas was that sortcouldna keep his hands off any kind of machine or off the slave girls either she added come along the sick ones are back o the kitchen the kitchen was in a separate small building of its own connected to the house by a breezeway covered with blooming jasmine walking through it was like floating through a cloud of perfume surrounded by a hum of bees loud enough to be felt on the skin like the low drone of a bagpipe ever been stung geillis swiped casually at a lowflying furry body batting it out of the air now and then so have i she said any number of times and nothing worse than a red welt on my skin to show for it one of these wee buggers stung one o the kitchen slaves last spring though and the wench swelled up like a toad and died right before my eyes she glanced at me eyes wide and mocking did wonders for my reputation i can tell ye the rest o the slaves put it about id witched the lass put a spell on her to kill her for burning the sponge cake i havena had so much as a scorched pot since shaking her head she waved away another bee while appalled at her callousness i was somewhat relieved by the story perhaps the other gossip i had heard at the governors ball had as little foundation in fact i paused looking out through the jasmines lacy leaves at the cane fields below jamie was in the clearing by the sugar press looking up at the gigantic crossbars of the machine while a man i assumed to be the overseer pointed and explained as i watched he said something gesturing and the overseer nodded emphatically waving his hands in voluble reply if i didnt find any trace of ian in the kitchen quarters perhaps jamie would learn something from the overseer despite geilies denials every instinct i had insisted that the boy was heresomewhere there was no sign of him in the kitchen itself only three or four women kneading bread and snapping peas who looked up curiously as we came through i caught the eye of one young woman and nodded and smiled at her perhaps i would have a chance to come back and talk later her eyes widened in surprise and she bent her head at once eyes on the bowl of peapods in her lap i saw her steal a quick glance at me as we crossed the long room and noticed that she balanced the bowl in front of the small bulge of an early pregnancy the first sick slave was in a small pantry off the kitchen itself lying on a pallet laid under shelves stacked high with gauzewrapped cheeses the patient a young man in his twenties sat up blinking at the sudden ray of light when i opened the door whats the trouble with him i knelt down beside the man and touched his skin warm damp no apparent fever he didnt seem in any particular distress merely blinking sleepily as i examined him he has a worm i glanced at geilie in surprise from what i had seen and heard so far in the islands i thought it likely that at least threequarters of the black populationand not a few of the whitessuffered from internal parasites nasty and debilitating as these could be though most were actively threatening only to the very young and the very old probably a lot more than one i said i pushed the slave gently onto his back and began to palpate his stomach the spleen was tender and slightly enlargedalso a common finding herebut i felt no suspicious masses in the abdomen that might indicate a major intestinal infestation he seems moderately healthy why have you got him in here in the dark as though in answer to my question the slave suddenly wrenched himself away from my hand let out a piercing scream and rolled up into a ball rolling and unrolling himself like a yoyo he reached the wall and began to bang his head against it still screaming then as suddenly as the fit had come on it passed off and the young man sank back onto the pallet panting heavily and soaked with sweat jesus h roosevelt christ i said what was that a loaloa worm geilie said looking amused at my reaction they live in the eyeballs just under the lining they cross back and forth from one eye to the other and when they go across the bridge o the nose im told its rather painful she nodded at the slave still quivering slightly on his pallet the dark keeps them from moving so much she explained the fellow from andros who told me about them says ye must catch them when theyve just come in one eye for theyre right near the surface and ye can lift them out with a big darning needle if ye wait they go deeper and ye canna get them she turned back to the kitchen and shouted for a light here i brought the needle just in case she groped in the bag at her waist and drew out a square of felt with a threeinch steel needle thrust through it which she extended helpfully to me are you out of your mind i stared at her appalled no did ye not say ye were a good healer she asked reasonably i am but i glanced at the slave hesitated then took the candle one of the kitchenmaids was holding out to me bring me some brandy and a small sharp knife i said dip the knifeand the needlein the brandy then hold the tip in a flame for a moment let it cool but dont touch it as i spoke i was gently pulling up one eyelid the mans eye looked up at me an oddly irregular blotched brown iris in a bloodshot sclera the yellow of heavy cream i searched carefully bringing the candle flame close enough to shrink the pupil then drawing it away but saw nothing there i tried the other eye and nearly dropped the candle sure enough there was a small transparent filament moving under the conjunctiva i gagged slightly at the sight but controlled myself and reached for the freshly sterilized knife still holding back the eyelid take him by the shoulders i said to geilie dont let him move or i may blind him the surgery itself was horrifying to contemplate but surprisingly simple to perform i made one quick small incision along the inside corner of the conjunctiva lifted it slightly with the tip of the needle and as the worm undulated lazily across the open field i slipped the tip of the needle under the body and drew it out neat as a loop of yarn repressing a shudder of distaste i flicked the worm away it hit the wall with a tiny wet splat and vanished in the shadows under the cheese there was no blood after a brief debate with myself i decided to leave it to the mans own tear ducts to irrigate the incision that would have to be left to heal by itself i had no fine sutures and the wound was small enough not to need more than a stitch or two in any case i tied a clean pad of cloth over the closed eye with a bandage round the head and sat back reasonably pleased with my first foray into tropical medicine fine i said pushing back my hair wheres the other one the next patient was in a shed outside the kitchen dead i squatted next to the body that of a middleaged man with grizzled hair feeling both pity and outrage the cause of death was more than obvious a strangulated hernia the loop of twisted gangrenous bowel protruded from one side of the belly the stretched skin over it already tinged with green though the body itself was still nearly as warm as life an expression of agony was fixed on the broad features and the limbs were still contorted giving an unfortunately accurate witness to just what sort of death it had been why did you wait i stood up glaring at geilie for gods sake you kept me drinking tea and chatting while this was going on hes been dead less than an hour but he must have been in trouble a long time sincedays why didnt you bring me out here at once he seemed pretty far gone this morning she said not at all disturbed by my agitation she shrugged ive seen them so before i didna think you could do anything much it didna seem worth hurrying i choked back further recrimination she was right i could have operated had i come sooner but the chances of it doing any good were slim to nonexistent the hernia repair was something i might have managed even with such difficult conditions after all that was nothing more than pushing back the bowel protrusion and pulling the ruptured layers of abdominal muscle back together with sutures infection was the only real danger but once the loop of escaped intestine had twisted so that the blood supply was cut off and the contents began to putrefy the man was doomed but to allow the man to die here in this stuffy shed alonewell perhaps he would not have found the presence of one white woman more or less a comfort in any case still i felt an obscure sense of failure the same i always felt in the presence of death i wiped my hands slowly on a brandysoaked cloth mastering my feelings one to the good one to the badand ian still to be found since im here now perhaps id best have a look at the rest of your slaves i suggested an ounce of prevention you know oh theyre well enough geilie waved a careless hand still if ye want to take the time youre welcome later though ive a visitor coming this afternoon and i want to talk more with ye first come back to the house nowsomeone will take care o this a brief nod disposed of this the slaves contorted body she linked her arm in mine urging me out of the shed and back toward the kitchen with soft thrustings of her weight in the kitchen i detached myself motioning toward the pregnant slave now on her hands and knees scrubbing the hearthstones you go along i want to have a quick look at this girl she looks a bit toxic to meyou dont want her to miscarry geilie gave me a curious glance but then shrugged shes foaled twice with no trouble but youre the doctor aye if thats your notion of fun go ahead dont take too long though that parson said hed come at four oclock i made some pretense of examining the bewildered woman until geilies draperies had disappeared into the breezeway look i said im looking for a young white boy named ian im his aunt do you know where he might be the girlshe couldnt be more than seventeen or eighteenlooked startled she blinked and darted a glance at one of the older women who had quit her own work and come across the room to see what was going on no maam the older woman said shaking her head no white boys here none at all no maam the girl obediently echoed we don know nothin bout your boy but she hadnt said that at first and her eyes wouldnt meet mine the older woman had been joined now by the other two kitchenmaids coming to buttress her i was surrounded by an impenetrable wall of bland ignorance and no way to break through it at the same time i was aware of a current running among the womena feeling of mutual warning of wariness and secrecy it might be only the natural reaction to the sudden appearance of a white stranger in their domainor it might be something more i couldnt take longer geilie would be coming back to look for me i fumbled quickly in my pocket and pulled out a silver florin which i pressed into the girls hand if you should see ian tell him that his uncle is here to find him not waiting for an answer i turned and hurried out of the kitchen i glanced down toward the sugar mill as i passed through the breezeway the sugar press stood abandoned the oxen grazing placidly in the long grass at the edge of the clearing there was no sign of jamie or the overseer had he come back to the house i came through the french windows into the salon and stopped short geilie sat in her wicker chair jamies coat across the arm and the photographs of brianna spread over her lap she heard my step and looked up one pale brow arched over an acid smile what a pretty lassie to be sure whats her name brianna my lips felt stiff i walked slowly toward her fighting the urge to snatch the pictures from her hands and run looks a great deal like her father doesnt she i thought she seemed familiar that tall redhaired lass i saw that night on craigh na dun he is her father no she inclined her head toward the door where jamie had vanished yes give them to me it made no difference she had seen the pictures already still i couldnt stand to see her thick white fingers cupping briannas face her mouth twitched as though she meant to refuse but she tapped them neatly into a square and handed them to me without demur i held them against my chest for a moment not knowing what to do with them then thrust them back into the pocket of my skirt sit ye down claire the coffees come she nodded toward the small table and the chair alongside her eyes followed me as i moved to it alive with calculation she gestured for me to pour the coffee for both of us and took her own cup without words we sipped silently for a few moments the cup trembled in my hands spilling hot liquid across my wrist i put it down wiping my hand on my skirt wondering in some dim recess of my mind why i should be afraid twice she said suddenly she looked at me with something akin to awe sweet christ jesus ye went through twice or nothree times it must have been for here ye are now she shook her head marveling never taking her bright green eyes from my face how she asked how could ye do it so many times and live i dont know i saw the look of hard skepticism flash across her face and answered it defensively i dont i justwent was it not the same for you the green eyes had narrowed into slits of concentration what was it like there between did ye not feel the terror and the noise fit to split your skull and spill your brains yes it was like that i didnt want to talk to about it didnt even like to think of the timepassage i had blocked it deliberately from my mind the roar of death and dissolution and the voices of chaos that urged me to join them did ye have blood to protect you or stones i wouldna think yed the nerve for bloodbut maybe im wrong for surely yere stronger than i thought to have done it three times and lived through it blood i shook my head confused no nothing i told youiwent thats all then i remembered the night she had gone through the stones in the blaze of fire on craigh na dun and the twisted blackened shape in the center of that fire greg edgars i said the name of her first husband you didnt just kill him because he found you and tried to stop you did you he was the blood aye she was watching me intent i didna think it could be done at all the crossingnot without the blood she sounded faintly amazed the auld onesthey always used the blood that and the fire they built great wicker cages filled wi their captives and set them alight in the circles i thought that was how they opened the passage my hands and my lips felt cold and i picked up the cup to warm them where in the name of god was jamie and ye didna use stones either i shook my head what stones she looked at me for a moment debating whether to tell me her little pink tongue flicked over her lip and then she nodded deciding with a small grunt she heaved herself up from the chair and went toward the great hearth at the far end of the room beckoning me to follow she knelt with surprising grace for one of her figure and pressed a greenish stone set into the mantelpiece a foot or so above the hearth it moved slightly and there was a soft click as one of the hearth slates rose smoothly out of its mortared setting spring mechanism geilie explained lifting the slate carefully and setting it aside a danish fellow named leiven from st croix made it for me she reached into the cavity beneath and drew out a wooden box about a foot long there were pale brown stains on the smooth wood and it looked swollen and split as though it had been immersed in seawater at some time i bit my lip hard at its appearance and hoped my face didnt give anything away if i had had any doubts about ian being here they had vanishedfor here unless i was very much mistaken was the silkies treasure fortunately geilie wasnt looking at me but at the box i learned about the stones from an indiannot a red indian a hindoo from calcutta she explained he came to me looking for thornapple and he told me about how to make medicines from the gemstones i looked over my shoulder for jamie but there was no sign of him where the hell was he had he found ian somewhere on the plantation ye can get the powdered stones from a london apothecary she was saying frowning slightly as she pushed at the sliding lid but theyre mostly poor quality and the bhasmas doesnt work so well best to have a stone at least of the second qualitywhat they call a nagina stone thats a goodishsized stone thats been polished a stone of the first quality is faceted and unflawed for preference but most folk canna afford to burn those to ash the ashes of the stone are the bhasmas she explained turning to look up at me thats what ye use in the medicines here can ye pry this damn thing loose its been spoilt in seawater and the locking bit swells whenever the weathers dampwhich it is all the time this season of the year she added making a face over her shoulder at the clouds rolling in over the bay far below she thrust the box into my hands and rose heavily to her feet grunting with the effort it was a chinese puzzlebox i saw a fairly simple one with a small sliding panel that unlocked the main lid the problem was that the smaller panel had swollen sticking in its slot its bad luck to break one geilie observed watching my attempts else id just smash the thing and be done with it here maybe this will help she produced a small motherofpearl penknife from the recesses of her gown and handed it to me then went to the window ledge and rang another of her silver bells i pried gently upward with the blade of the knife i felt it catch in the wood and wiggled it gingerly little by little the small rectangle of wood edged out of its place until i could get hold of it between thumb and forefinger and pull it all the way loose there you go i said handing her back the box with some reluctance it felt heavy and there was an unmistakable metallic chinking as i tilted it thanks as she took it the black servingmaid came in through the far door geilie turned to order the girl to bring a tray of fresh tarts and i saw that she had slipped the box between the folds of her skirts hiding it nosy creatures she said frowning toward the departing maids back as the girl passed through the door one of the difficulties wi slaves its hard to have secrets she put the box on the table and pushed at the top with a small sharp skreek of protest the lid slid back she reached into the box and drew out her closed hand she smiled mischievously at me saying little jackie horner sat in the corner eating her christmas pie she put in her thumb and pulled out a plumshe opened her hand with a flourishand said what a good girl am i i had been expecting them of course but had no difficulty in looking impressed anyway the reality of a gem is both more immediate and more startling than its description six or seven of them flashed and glimmered in her palm flaming fire and frozen ice the gleam of blue water in the sun and a great gold stone like the eye of a lurking tiger without meaning to i drew near enough to look down into the well of her hand staring with fascination big enough jamie had described them as being with a characteristic scottish talent for understatement well smaller than a breadbox i supposed i got them for the money to start geilie was saying prodding the stones with satisfaction because they were easier to carry than a great weight of gold or silver i mean i didna think then what other use they might have what as bhasmas the idea of burning any of those glowing things to ash seemed a sacrilege oh no not these her hand closed on the stones dipped into her pocket and back into the box for more a small shower of liquid fire dropped into her pocket and she patted it affectionately no ive a lot o the smaller stones for that these are for something else she eyed me speculatively then jerked her head toward the door at the end of the room come along up to my workroom she said ive a few things there youll maybe be interested to see interested was putting it mildly i thought it was a long lightfilled room with a counter down one side bunches of drying herbs hung from hooks overhead and lay on gauzecovered drying racks along the inner wall drawered cabinets and cupboards covered the rest of the wall space and there was a small glassfronted bookcase at the end of the room the room gave me a mild sense of déjàvu after a moment i realized that it was because it strongly resembled geilies workroom in the village of cranesmuir in the house of her first husbandno second i corrected myself remember the flaming body of greg edgars how many times have you been married i asked curiously she had begun building her fortune with her second husband procurator fiscal of the district where they lived forging his signature in order to divert money to her own use and then murdering him successful with this modus operandi i imagined she had tried it again she was a creature of habit was geilie duncan she paused a moment to count up oh five i think since i came here she added casually five i said a little faintly not just a habit it seemed a positive addiction a verra unhealthy atmosphere for englishmen it is in the tropics she said and smiled slyly at me fevers ulcers festering stomachs any little thing will carry them off she had evidently been mindful of her oral hygiene her teeth were still very good she reached out and lightly caressed a small bottle that stood on the lowest shelf it wasnt labeled but i had seen crude white arsenic before on the whole i was glad i hadnt taken any food oh youll be interested in this she said spying a jar on an upper shelf grunting slightly as she stood on tiptoe she reached it down and handed it to me it contained a very coarse powder evidently a mixture of several substances brown yellow and black flecked with shreds of a semitranslucent material whats this zombie poison she said and laughed i thought yed like to see oh i said coldly i thought you told me there was no such thing no she corrected still smiling i told ye hercule wasnt dead and hes not she took the jar from me and replaced it on the shelf but theres no denying that hes a good bit more manageable if hes had a dose of this stuff once a week mixed with his grain what the hell is it she shrugged offhanded a bit of this and a bit of that the main thing seems to be a kind of fisha little square thing wi spots verra funnylooking ye take the skin and dry it and the liver as well but there are a few other things ye put in with iti wish i kent what she added you dont know whats in it i stared at her didnt you make it no i had a cook geilie said or at least they sold him to me as a cook but damned if id feel safe eating a thing he turned out of the kitchen the sly black devil he was a houngan though a what houngan is what the blacks call one of their medicinepriests though to be quite right about it i believe ishmael said his sort of black called him an oniseegun or somesuch ishmael hm i licked my dry lips did he come with that name oh no he had some heathen name wi six syllables and the man who sold him called him jimmythe auctioneers call all the bucks jimmy i named him ishmael because of the story the seller told me about him ishmael had been taken from a barracoon on the gold coast of africa one of a shipment of six hundred slaves from the villages of nigeria and ghana stowed between decks of the slave ship persephone bound for antigua coming through the caicos passage the persephone had run into a sudden squall and been run aground on hogsty reef off the island of great inagua the ship had broken up with barely time for the crew to escape in the ships boats the slaves chained and helpless betweendecks had all drowned all but one man who had earlier been taken from the hold to assist as a galley mate both messboys having died of the pox en route from africa this man left behind by the ships crew had nonetheless survived the wreck by clinging to a cask of spirits which floated ashore on great inagua two days later the fishermen who discovered the castaway were more interested in his means of salvation than in the slave himself breaking open the cask however they were shocked and appalled to find inside the body of a man somewhat imperfectly preserved by the spirits in which he had been soaking i wonder if they drank the crème de menthe anyway i murmured having observed for myself that mr overholts assessment of the alcoholic affinities of sailors was largely correct i daresay said geilie mildly annoyed at having her story interrupted in any case when i heard of it i named him ishmael straight off because of the floating coffin aye very clever i congratulated her erdid they find out who the man in the cask was i dont think so she shrugged carelessly they gave him to the governor of jamaica who had him put in a glass case wi fresh spirits as a curiosity what i said incredulously well not so much the man himself but some odd fungi that were growing on him geilie explained the governors got a passion for such things the old governor i mean i hear theres a new one now quite i said feeling a bit queasy i thought the exgovernor was more likely to qualify as a curiosity than the dead man on the whole her back was turned as she pulled out drawers and rummaged through them i took a deep breath hoping to keep my voice casual this ishmael sounds an interesting sort do you still have him no she said indifferently the black bastard ran off hes the one who made the zombie poison for me though wouldnt tell me how no matter what i did to him she added with a short humorless laugh and i had a sudden vivid memory of the weals across ishmaels back he said it wasnt proper for women to make medicine only men could do it or the verra auld women once theyd quit bleeding hmph she snorted and reached into her pocket pulling out a handful of stones anyway thats not what i brought ye up to show ye carefully she laid five of the stones in a rough circle on the countertop then she took down from a shelf a thick book bound in worn leather can ye read german she asked opening it carefully not much no i said i moved closer to look over her shoulder hexenhammer it said in a fine handwritten script witches hammer i asked i raised one eyebrow spells magic the skepticism in my voice must have been obvious for she glared at me over one shoulder look fool she said who are ye or what rather what am i i said startled thats right she turned and leaned against the counter studying me through narrowed eyes what are ye or me come to that what are we i opened my mouth to reply then closed it again thats right she said softly watching its not everyone can go through the stones is it why us i dont know i said and neither do you ill be bound it doesnt mean were witches surely doesnt it she lifted one brow and turned several pages of the book some people can leave their bodies and travel miles away she said staring meditatively at the page other people see them out wandering and recognize them and ye can bloody prove they were really tucked up safe in bed at the time ive seen the records all the eyewitness testimony some people have stigmata ye can see and touchive seen one but not everybody only certain people she turned another page if everyone can do it its science if only a few can then its witchcraft or superstition or whatever you like to call it she said but its real she looked up at me green eyes bright as a snakes over the crumbling book were real claireyou and me and special have ye never asked yourself why i had any number of times i had never gotten a reasonable answer to the question though evidently geilie thought she had one she turned back to the stones she had laid on the counter and pointed at them each in turn stones of protection amethyst emerald turquoise lapis lazuli and a male ruby a male ruby pliny says rubies have a sex to them who am i to argue she said impatiently the male stones are what ye use though the female ones dont work i suppressed the urge to ask precisely how one distinguished the sex of rubies in favor of asking work for what for the travel she said glancing curiously at me through the stones they protect ye from thewhatever it is out there her eyes grew slightly shadowed at the thought of the timepassage and i realized that she was deathly afraid of it little wonder so was i when did ye come the first time her eyes were intent on mine from i said slowly i came to if thats what you mean i was reluctant to tell her too much still my own curiosity was overwhelming she was right about one thing she and i were different i might never again have the chance to talk to another person who knew what she did for that matter the longer i could keep her talking the longer jamie would have to look for ian hm she grunted in a satisfied manner near enough its two hundred year in the highland taleswhen folk fall asleep on fairy duns and end up dancing all night wi the auld folk its usually two hundred year later when they come back to their own place you didnt though you came from but youd been in cranesmuir several years before i came there five years aye she nodded abstracted aye well that was the blood blood the sacrifice she said suddenly impatient it gives ye a greater range and at least a bit of control so ye have some notion how far yere going how did ye get to and fro three times without blood she demanded ijust came the need to find out as much as i could made me add the little else i knew i thinki think it has something to do with being able to fix your mind on a certain person whos in the time you go to her eyes were nearly round with interest really she said softly think o that now she shook her head slowly thinking hm that might be so still the stones should work as well theres patterns ye make wi the different gems ye ken she pulled another fistful of shining stones from her pocket and spread them on the wooden surface pawing through them the protection stones are the points of the pentacle she explained intent on her rummaging but inside that ye lay the pattern wi different stones depending which way ye mean to go and how far and ye lay a line of quicksilver between them and fire it when ye speak the spells and of course ye draw the pentacle wi diamond dust of course i murmured fascinated smell it she asked looking up for a moment and sniffing ye wouldna think stones had a scent aye but they do when ye grind them to powder i inhaled deeply and did seem to find a faint unfamiliar scent among the smell of dried herbs it was a dry scent pleasant but indescribablethe scent of gemstones she held up one stone with a small cry of triumph this one this is the one i needed couldna find one anywhere in the islands and finally i thought o the box id left in scotland the stone she held was a black crystal of some kind the light from the window passed through it and yet it glittered like a piece of jet between her white fingers what is it an adamant a black diamond the auld alchemists used them the books say that to wear an adamant brings ye the knowledge of the joy in all things she laughed a short sharp sound devoid of her usual girlish charm if anything can bring knowledge o joy in that passage through the stones i want one something was beginning to dawn on me rather belatedly in defense of my slowness i can only argue that i was simultaneously listening to geilie and keeping an ear out for any sign of jamie returning below you mean to go back then i asked as casually as i could i might a small smile played around the corners of her mouth now that ive got the things i need i tell ye claire i wouldna risk it without she stared at me shaking her head three times wi no blood she murmured so it can be done well best we go down now she said suddenly brisk sweeping the stones up and dumping them back into her pocket the fox will be backfraser is his name is it no i thought clotilda said something else but the stupid bitch likely got it wrong as we made our way down the long workroom something small and brown darted across the floor in front of me geilie was quick despite her size her small foot stamped on the centipede before i could react she watched the halfcrushed beast wriggling on the floor for a moment then stooped and slid a sheet of paper under it scooping it up she decanted the thing thriftily into a glass jar ye dinna want to believe in witches and zombies and things that go bump in the night she said with a small sly smile at me she nodded at the centipede struggling round and round in frenzied lopsided circles well legends are manylegged beasties aye but they generally have at least one foot on the truth she took down a clear brownglass jug and poured the liquid into the centipedes bottle the pungent scent of alcohol rose in the air the centipede washed up by the wave kicked frantically for a moment then sank to the bottom of the bottle legs moving spasmodically she corked the bottle neatly and turned to go you asked me why i thought we can pass through the stones i said to her back do you know why geilie she glanced over her shoulder at me why to change things she said sounding surprised why else come along i hear your man down there whatever jamie had been doing it had been hard work his shirt was dampened with sweat and clung to his shoulders he swung around as we entered the room and i saw that he had been looking at the wooden puzzlebox that geilie had left on the table it was obvious from his expression that i had been correct in my surmiseit was the box he had found on the silkies isle i believe i have succeeded in mending your sugar press mistress he said bowing politely to geilie a matter of a cracked cylinder which your overseer and i contrived to stuff with wedges still i fear ye may be needing another soon geilie quirked her eyebrows amused well and im obliged to ye mr fraser can i not offer ye some refreshment after your labor her hand hovered over the row of bells but jamie shook his head picking up his coat from the sofa i thank ye mistress but i fear we must take our leave its quite some way back to kingston and we must be on our way if we mean to reach it before dark his face went suddenly blank and i knew he must have felt the pocket of his coat and realized that the photographs were missing he glanced quickly at me and i gave him a brief nod touching the side of my skirt where they lay thank you for your hospitality i said snatching up my hat and moving toward the door with alacrity now that jamie was back i wanted nothing so much as to get quickly away from rose hall and its owner jamie hung back a moment though i wondered mistress abernathysince ye mentioned having lived in paris for a timewhether ye might have been acquainted there wi a gentleman of my own acquaintance did ye by chance ken the duke of sandringham she cocked her creamblond head at him inquisitively but as he said no more she nodded aye i kent him why jamie gave her his most charming smile no particular reason mistress only a curiosity ye might say the sky was completely overcast by the time we passed the gate and it was clear that we werent going to make it back to kingston without getting soaked under the circumstances i didnt care yeve got briannas pictures was the first thing jamie asked reining up for a moment right here i patted my pocket did you find any sign of ian he glanced back over his shoulder as though fearing we might be pursued i couldna get anything out of the overseer or any o the slavestheyre bonescairt of that woman and i canna say i blame them a bit but i know where he is he spoke with considerable satisfaction where can we sneak back and get him i rose slightly in my saddle looking back the slates of rose hall were all that was visible through the treetops i would have been most reluctant to set foot on the place again for any reasonexcept for ian not now jamie caught at my bridle turning the horses head back to the trail ill need help under the pretext of finding material to repair the damaged sugar press jamie had managed to see most of the plantation within a quartermile of the house including a cluster of slave huts the stables a disused drying shed for tobacco and the building that housed the sugar refinery everyplace he went he suffered no interference beyond curious or hostile glancesexcept near the refinery that big black bugger who came up onto the porch was sitting on the ground outside he said when i got too close to him it made the overseer verra nervous indeed he kept calling me away warning me not to get too close to the fellow that sounds like a really excellent idea i said shuddering slightly not getting close to him i mean but you think he has something to do with ian he was sitting in front of a wee door fixed into the ground sassenach jamie guided his horse adroitly around a fallen log in the path it must lead to a cellar beneath the refinery the man had not moved an inch in all the time that jamie contrived to spend around the refinery if ians there thats where he is im fairly sure hes there all right i told him quickly the details of my visit including my brief conversation with the kitchenmaids but what are we going to do i concluded we cant just leave him there after all we dont know what geillis wants with him but it cant be innocent if she wouldnt admit he was there can it not innocent at all he agreed grimfaced the overseer wouldna speak to me of ian but he told me other things that would curl your hair if it wasna already curled up like sheeps wool he glanced at me and a halfsmile lit his face in spite of his obvious perturbation judging by the state of your hair sassenach i should say that its going to rain verra soon now how observant of you i said sarcastically vainly trying to tuck in the curls and tendrils that were escaping from under my hat the fact that the skys black as pitch and the air smells like lightning wouldnt have a thing to do with your conclusions of course the leaves of the trees all round us were fluttering like tethered butterflies as the edge of the storm rose toward us up the slope of the mountain from the small rise where we stood i could see the storm clouds sweep in across the bay below with a dark curtain of rain hanging beneath it like a veil jamie rose in his saddle looking over the terrain to my unpracticed eye our surroundings looked like solid impenetrable jungle but other possibilities were visible to a man who had lived in the heather for seven years wed best find a bit of shelter while we can sassenach he said follow me on foot leading the horses we left the narrow path and pressed into the forest following what jamie said was a wild pigs trail within a few moments he had found what he was looking for a small stream that cut deep through the forest floor with a steep bank overgrown with ferns and dark glossy bushes interspersed with stands of slender saplings he set me to gathering ferns each frond the length of my arm and by the time i had returned with as many as i could carry he had the framework of a tidy snug formed by the arch of the bent saplings tied to a fallen log and covered over with branches cut from the nearby bushes hastily roofed with the spread ferns it was not quite waterproof but a great deal better than being caught in the open ten minutes later we were safe inside there was a moment of absolute quiet as the wind on the edge of the storm passed by us no birds chattered no insects sang they were as well equipped as we were to predict the rain a few large drops fell splattering on the foliage with an explosive sound like snapping twigs then the storm broke caribbean rainstorms are abrupt and vigorous none of the misty mousing about of an edinburgh drizzle the heavens blacken and split dropping gallons of water within a minute for as long as the rain lasts speech is impossible and a light fog rises from the ground like steam vapor raised by the force of the raindrops striking the ground the rain pelted the ferns above us and a faint mist filled the green shadows of our shelter between the clatter of the rain and the constant thunder that boomed among the hills it was impossible to talk it wasnt cold but there was a leak overhead which dripped steadily on my neck there was no room to move away jamie took off his coat and wrapped it around me then put his arm around me to wait out the storm in spite of the terrible racket outside i felt suddenly safe and peaceful relieved of the strain of the last few hours the last few days ian was as good as found and nothing could touch us here i squeezed his free hand he smiled at me then bent and kissed me gently he smelled fresh and earthy scented with the sap of the branches he had cut and the smell of his own healthy sweat it was nearly over i thought we had found ian and god willing would get him back safely very soon and then what we would have to leave jamaica but there were other places and the world was wide there were the french colonies of martinique and grenada the dutchheld island of eleuthera perhaps we would even venture as far as the continentcannibals notwithstanding so long as i had jamie i was not afraid of anything the rain ceased as abruptly as it had started drops fell singly from the shrubs and trees with a pitapat drip that echoed the ringing left in my ears by the storms roar a soft fresh breeze came up the stream bed carrying away humidity lifting the damp curls from my neck with delicious coolness the birds and the insects began again quietly and then in full voice and the air itself seemed to dance with green life i stirred and sighed pushing myself upright and shrugging off jamies coat you know geilie showed me a special stone a black diamond called an adamant i said she said its a stone the alchemists used it gives a knowledge of the joy in all things i think there might be one under this spot jamie smiled at me i shouldna be surprised at all sassenach he said here yeve water all down your face he reached into his coat for a handkerchief then stopped briannas pictures he said suddenly oh i forgot i dug in my pocket and handed him back the pictures he took them and thumbed rapidly through them stopped then went through them again more slowly whats wrong i asked suddenly alarmed one of thems gone he said quietly i felt an inexpressible feeling of dread begin to grow in the pit of my stomach and the joy of a moment before began to ebb away are you sure i know them as well as i know your face sassenach he said aye im sure its the one of her by the fire i remembered the picture in question well it showed brianna as an adult sitting on a rock outdoors by a campfire her knees were drawn up her elbows resting on them and she was looking directly into the camera but with no knowledge of its presence her face filled with firelit dreams her hair blown back away from her face geilie must have taken it she found the pictures in your coat while i was in the kitchen and i took them away from her she must have stolen it then damn the woman jamie turned sharply to look toward the road eyes dark with anger his hand was tight on the remaining photographs what does she want with it perhaps its only curiosity i said but the feeling of dread would not go away what could she do with it after all she isnt likely to show it to anyonewho would come here as though in answer to this question jamies head lifted suddenly and he grasped my arm in adjuration to be still some distance below a loop of the road was visible through the overgrowth a thin ribbon of yellowish mud along this ribbon came a plodding figure on horseback a man dressed in black small and dark as an ant at this distance then i remembered what geilie had said im expecting a visitor and later that parson said hed come at four oclock its a parson a minister of some kind i said she said she was expecting him its archie campbell is who it is jamie said with some grimness what the devilor perhaps i shouldna use that particular expression wi respect to mistress duncan perhaps hes come to exorcise her i suggested with a nervous laugh hes his work cut out for him if so the angular figure disappeared into the trees but it was several minutes before jamie deemed him safely past us what do you plan to do about ian i asked once we had made our way back to the path ill need help he answered briskly i mean to come up the river with innes and macleod and the rest theres a landing there no great distance from the refinery well leave the boat there go ashore and deal wi herculesand atlas too if hes a mind to be troublesomebreak open the cellar snatch ian and make off again the dark o the moons in two daysi wish it could be sooner but it will likely take that long to get a suitable boat and what arms well need using what for money i inquired bluntly the expenditure for new clothes and shoes had taken a substantial portion of jamies share of profit from the bat guano what was left would feed us for several weeks and possibly be sufficient to rent a boat for a day or two but it wouldnt stretch to buying large quantities of weapons neither pistols nor swords were manufactured on the island all weapons were imported from europe and were in consequence expensive jamie himself had captain rainess two pistols the scots had nothing but their fish knives and the odd cutlassinsufficient for an armed raid he grimaced slightly then glanced at me sidelong i must ask john for help he said simply must i not i rode silently for a moment then nodded in acquiescence i suppose youll have to i didnt like it but it wasnt a question of my liking it was ians life one thing though jamie aye i know he said resigned ye mean to come with me no yes i said smiling after all what if ians hurt or sick or aye ye can come he said rather testily only do me the one wee favor sassenach try verra hard not to be killed or cut to pieces aye its hard on a mans sensibilities ill try i said circumspectly and nudging my horse closer to his rode side by side down toward kingston through the dripping trees the crocodiles fire there was a surprising amount of traffic on the river at night lawrence stern who had insisted on accompanying the expedition told me that most of the plantations up in the hills used the river as their main linkage with kingston and the harbor roads were either atrocious or nonexistent swallowed by lush growth with each new rainy season i had expected the river to be deserted but we passed two small craft and a barge headed downstream as we tacked laboriously up the broad waterway under sail the barge an immense dark shape stacked high with casks and bales passed us like a black iceberg huge humped and threatening the low voices of the slaves poling it carried across the water talking softly in a foreign tongue it was kind of ye to come lawrence jamie said we had a small singlemasted open boat which barely held jamie myself the six scottish smugglers and stern despite the crowded quarters i too was grateful for sterns company he had a stolid phlegmatic quality about him that was very comforting under the circumstances well i confess to some curiosity stern said flapping the front of his shirt to cool his sweating body in the dark all i could see of him was a moving blotch of white i have met the lady before you see mrs abernathy i paused then asked delicately erwhat did you think of her ohshe was a very pleasant lady mostgracious dark as it was i couldnt see his face but his voice held an odd note halfpleased halfembarrassed that told me he had found the widow abernathy quite attractive indeed from which i concluded that geilie had wanted something from the naturalist i had never known her treat a man with any regard save for her own ends where did you meet her at her own house according to the attendees at the governors ball mrs abernathy seldom or never left her plantation yes at rose hall i had stopped to ask permission to collect a rare type of beetleone of the cucurlionidaethat i had found near a spring on the plantation she invited me in andmade me most welcome this time there was a definite note of selfsatisfaction in his voice jamie handling the tiller next to me heard it and snorted briefly what did she want of ye he asked no doubt having formed conclusions similar to mine about geilies motives and behavior oh she was most gratifyingly interested in the specimens of flora and fauna i had collected on the island she asked me about the locations and virtues of several different herbs ah and about the other places i had been she was particularly interested in my stories of hispaniola he sighed momentarily regretful it is difficult to believe that such a lovely woman might engage in such reprehensible behavior as you describe james lovely aye jamies voice was dryly amused a bit smitten were ye lawrence lawrences voice echoed jamies smile there is a sort of carnivorous fly i have observed friend james the male fly choosing a female to court takes pains to bring her a bit of meat or other prey tidily wrapped in a small silk package while the female is engaged in unwrapping her tidbit he leaps upon her performs his copulatory duties and hastens away for if she should finish her meal before he has finished his own activities or should he be so careless as not to bring her a tasty presentshe eats him there was a soft laugh in the darkness no it was an interesting experience but i think i shall not call upon mrs abernathy again not if were lucky about it no jamie agreed the men left me by the riverbank to mind the boat and melted into the darkness with instructions from jamie to stay put i had a primed pistol given to me with the stern injunction not to shoot myself in the foot the weight of it was comforting but as the minutes dragged by in black silence i found the dark and the solitude more and more oppressive from where i stood i could see the house a dark oblong with only the lower three windows lighted that would be the salon i thought and wondered why there was no sign of any activity by the slaves as i watched though i saw a shadow cross one of the lighted windows and my heart jumped into my throat it wasnt geilies shadow by any conceivable stretch of the imagination it was tall thin and gawkily angular i looked wildly around wanting to call out but it was too late the men were all out of earshot headed for the refinery i hesitated for a moment but there was really nothing else to do i kilted up my skirts and stepped into the dark by the time i stepped onto the veranda i was damp with perspiration and my heart was beating loudly enough to drown out all other sounds i edged silently next to the nearest window trying to peer in without being seen from within everything was quiet and orderly within there was a small fire on the hearth and the glow of the flames gleamed on the polished floor geilies rosewood secretary was unfolded the desk shelf covered with piles of handwritten papers and what looked like very old books i couldnt see anyone inside but i couldnt see the whole room either my skin prickled with imagination thinking of the deadeyed hercules silently stalking me in the dark i edged farther down the veranda looking over my shoulder with every other step there was an odd sense of desertion about the place this evening there were none of the subdued voices of slaves that had attended my earlier visit muttering to one another as they went about their tasks but that might mean nothing i told myself most of the slaves would stop work and go to their own quarters at sundown still ought there not to be house servants to tend the fire and fetch food from the kitchen the front door stood open spilled petals from the yellow rose lay across the doorstep glowing like ancient gold coins in the faint light from the entryway i paused listening i thought i heard a faint rustle from inside the salon as of someone turning the pages of a book but i couldnt be sure taking my courage in both hands i stepped across the threshold the feeling of desertion was more pronounced in here there were unmistakable signs of neglect visible a vase of wilted flowers on the polished surface of a chest a teacup and saucer left to sit on an occasional table the dregs dried to a brown stain in the bottom of the cup where the hell was everybody i stopped at the door into the salon and listened again i heard the quiet crackle of the fire and again that soft rustle as of turning pages by poking my head around the jamb i could just see that there was someone seated in front of the secretary now someone undeniably male tall and thinshouldered dark head bent over something before him ian i hissed as loudly as i dared ian the figure started pushed back the chair and stood up quickly blinking toward the shadows jesus i said mrs malcolm said the reverend archibald campbell astonished i swallowed trying to force my heart down out of my throat the reverend looked nearly as startled as i but it lasted only a moment then his features hardened and he took a step toward the door what are you doing here he demanded im looking for my husbands nephew i said there was no point in lying and perhaps he knew where ian was i glanced quickly round the room but it was empty save for the reverend and the one small lighted lamp he had been using wheres mrs abernathy i have no idea he said frowning she appears to have left what do you mean your husbands nephew left i blinked at him where has she gone i dont know he scowled his pointed upper lip clamped beaklike over the lower one she was gone when i rose this morningand all of the servants with her apparently a fine way to treat an invited guest i relaxed slightly despite my alarm at least i was in no danger of running into geilie i thought i could deal with the reverend campbell oh i said well that does seem a bit inhospitable i admit i suppose you havent seen a boy of about fifteen very tall and thin with thick dark brown hair no i didnt think you had in that case i expect i should be go stop he grabbed me by the upper arm and i stopped surprised and unsettled by the strength of his grip what is your husbands true name he demanded whyalexander malcolm i said tugging at my captive arm you know that indeed and how is it then that when i described you and your husband to mrs abernathy she told me that your family name is fraserthat your husband in fact is james fraser oh i took a deep breath trying to think of something plausible but failed i never had been good at lying on short notice where is your husband woman he demanded look i said trying to extract myself from his grasp youre quite wrong about jamie he had nothing to do with your sister he told me he youve spoken to him about margaret his grip tightened i gave a small grunt of discomfort and yanked a bit harder yes he says that it wasnt himhe wasnt the man she went to culloden to see it was a friend of his ewan cameron yere lying he said flatly or he is it makes little difference where is he he gave me a small shake and i jerked hard managing to detach my arm from his grip i tell you he had nothing to do with what happened to your sister i was backing away wondering how to get away from him without setting him loose to blunder about the grounds in search of jamie making noise and drawing unwelcome attention to the rescue effort eight men were enough to overcome the pillars of hercules but not enough to withstand a hundred roused slaves where the reverend was advancing on me eyes boring into mine hes in kingston i said i glanced to one side i was near a pair of french doors opening onto the veranda i thought i could get out without his catching me but then what having him chase me through the grounds would be worse than keeping him talking in here i looked back at the reverend who was scowling at me in disbelief and then what i had seen on the terrace registered in my minds eye and i jerked my head back around staring i had seen it there was a large white pelican perched on the veranda railing head turned back beak buried comfortably in its feathers ping ans plumage glinted silver against the night in the dim light from the doorway what is it reverend campbell demanded who is it whos out there just a bird i said turning back to him my heart was beating in a jerky rhythm mr willoughby must surely be nearby pelicans were common near the mouths of rivers near the shore but i had never seen one so far inland but if mr willoughby was in fact lurking nearby what ought i to do about it i doubt very much that your husband is in kingston the reverend was saying narrowed eyes fixed on me with suspicion however if he is he will presumably be coming here to retrieve you oh no i said no i repeated with as much assurance as i could manage jamie isnt coming here i came by myself to visit geillismrs abernathy my husband isnt expecting me back until next month he didnt believe me but there was nothing he could do about it either his mouth pursed up in a tiny rosette then unpuckered enough to ask so you are staying here yes i said pleased that i knew enough about the geography of the place to pretend to be a guest if the servants were gone there was no one to say i wasnt after all he stood still regarding me narrowly for a long moment then his jaw tightened and he nodded grudgingly indeed then i suppose yell have some notion as to where our hostess has taken herself and when she proposes to return i was beginning to have a rather unsettling notion of whereif not exactly whengeillis abernathy might have gone but the reverend campbell didnt seem the proper person with whom to share it no im afraid not i said iah ive been out visiting since yesterday at the neighboring plantation just came back this minute the reverend eyed me closely but i was in fact wearing a riding habitbecause it was the only decent set of clothes i owned besides the violet ball dress and two washmuslin gownsand my story passed unchallenged i see he said mmphm well then he fidgeted restlessly his big bony hands clenching and unclenching themselves as though he were not certain what to do with them dont let me disturb you i said with a charming smile and a nod at the desk im sure you must have important work to do he pursed his lips again in that objectionable way that made him look like an owl contemplating a juicy mouse the work has been completed i was only preparing copies of some documents that mrs abernathy had requested how interesting i said automatically thinking that with luck after a few moments small talk i could escape under the pretext of retiring to my theoretical roomall the firstfloor rooms opened onto the veranda and it would be a simple matter to slip off into the night to meet jamie perhaps you share our hostesssand my owninterest in scottish history and scholarship his gaze had sharpened and with a sinking heart i recognized the fanatical gleam of the passionate researcher in his eyes i knew it well well its very interesting im sure i said edging toward the door but i must say i really dont know very much about i caught sight of the top sheet on his pile of documents and stopped dead it was a genealogy chart i had seen plenty of those living with frank but i recognized this particular one it was a chart of the fraser familythe bloody thing was even headed fraser of lovatbeginning somewhere around the s so far as i could see and running down to the present i could see simon the lateand not so lamented in some quartersjacobite lord who had been executed for his part in charles stuarts rising and his descendants whose names i recognized and down in one corner with the sort of notation indicating illegitimacy was brian fraserjamies father and beneath him written in a precise black hand james a fraser i felt a chill ripple up my back the reverend had noticed my reaction and was watching with a sort of dry amusement yes it is interesting that it should be the frasers isnt it thatwhat should be the frasers i said despite myself i moved slowly toward the desk the subject of the prophecy of course he said looking faintly surprised do ye not know of it but perhaps your husband being an illegitimate descendant i dont know of it no ah the reverend was beginning to enjoy himself seizing the opportunity to inform me i thought perhaps mrs abernathy had spoken of it to you she being so interested as to have written to me in edinburgh regarding the matter he thumbed through the stack extracting one paper that appeared to be written in gaelic this is the original language of the prophecy he said shoving exhibit a under my nose by the brahan seer youll have heard of the brahan seer surely his tone held out little hope but in fact i had heard of the brahan seer a sixteenthcentury prophet along the lines of a scottish nostradamus i have its a prophecy concerning the frasers the frasers of lovat aye the language is poetic as i pointed out to mistress abernathy but the meaning is clear enough he was gathering enthusiasm as he went along notwithstanding his suspicions of me the prophecy states that a new ruler of scotland will spring from lovats lineage this is to come to pass following the eclipse of the kings of the white rosea clear reference to the papist stuarts of course he nodded at the white roses woven into the carpet there are somewhat more cryptic references included in the prophecy of course the time in which this ruler will appear and whether it is to be a king or a queenthere is some difficulty in interpretation owing to mishandling of the original he went on but i wasnt listening if i had had any doubt about where geilie had gone it was fast disappearing obsessed with the rulers of scotland she had spent the better part of ten years in working for the restoration of a stuart throne that attempt had failed most definitively at culloden and she had then expressed nothing but contempt for all extant stuarts and little wonder if she thought she knew what was coming next but where would she go back to scotland perhaps to involve herself with lovats heir no she was thinking of making the leap through time again that much was clear from her conversation with me she was preparing herself gathering her resourcesretrieving the treasure from the silkies isleand completing her researches i stared at the paper in a kind of fascinated horror the genealogy of course was only recorded to the present did geilie know who lovats descendants would be in the future i looked up to ask the reverend campbell a question but the words froze on my lips standing in the door to the veranda was mr willoughby the little chinese had evidently been having a rough time his silk pajamas were torn and stained and his round face was beginning to show the hollows of hunger and fatigue his eyes passed over me with only a remote flicker of acknowledgment all his attention was for the reverend campbell most holy fella he said and his voice held a tone i had never heard in him before an ugly taunting note the reverend whirled so quickly that his elbow knocked against a vase water and yellow roses cascaded over the rosewood desk soaking the papers the reverend gave a cry of rage and snatched the papers from the flood shaking them frantically to remove the water before the ink should run see what yeve done ye wicked murdering heathen mr willoughby laughed not his usual high giggle but a low chuckle it didnt sound at all amused i murdering he shook his head slowly back and forth eyes fixed on the reverend not me holy fella is you murderer begone fellow campbell said coldly you should know better than to enter a ladys house i know you the chinamans voice was low and even his gaze unwavering i see you see you in red room with the woman who laughs see you too with stinking whores in scotland very slowly he lifted his hand to his throat and drew it across precise as a blade you kill pretty often holy fella i think the reverend campbell had gone pale whether from shock or rage i couldnt tell i was pale toofrom fear i wet my dry lips and forced myself to speak mr willoughby not willoughby he didnt look at me the correction was almost indifferent i am yi tien cho seeking escape from the present situation my mind wondered absurdly whether the proper form of address would be mr yi or mr cho get out at once the reverends paleness came from rage he advanced on the little chinese massive fists clenched mr willoughby didnt move seemingly indifferent to the looming minister better you leave first wife he said softly holy fella liking womennot with cock with knife i wasnt wearing a corset but felt as though i were i couldnt get enough breath to form words nonsense the reverend said sharply i tell you againget out or i shall just stand still please reverend campbell i said hands shaking i drew the pistol jamie had given me out of the pocket of my habit and pointed it at him rather to my surprise he did stand still staring at me as though i had just grown two heads i had never held anyone at gunpoint before the sensation was quite oddly intoxicating in spite of the way the pistols barrel wavered at the same time i had no real idea what to do mr i gave up and used all his names yi tien cho did you see the reverend at the governors ball with mrs alcott i see him kill her yi tien cho said flatly better shoot first wife dont be ridiculous my dear mrs fraser surely you cannot believe the word of a savage who is himself the reverend turned toward me trying for a superior expression which was rather impaired by the small beads of sweat that had formed at the edge of his receding hairline but i think i do i said you were there i saw you and you were in edinburgh when the last prostitute was killed there nellie cowden said youd lived in edinburgh for two years thats how long the fiend was killing girls there the trigger was slippery under my forefinger thats how long he had lived there too the reverends face was losing its paleness becoming more flushed by the moment he jerked his head toward the chinese will you take the word of the man who betrayed your husband who him the reverends exasperation roughened his voice it is this wicked creature who betrayed fraser to sir percival turner sir percival told me i nearly dropped the gun things were happening a lot too fast for me i hoped desperately that jamie and his men had found ian and returned to the riversurely they would come to the house if i was not at the rendezvous i lifted the pistol a little meaning to tell the reverend to go down the breezeway to the kitchen locking him in one of the storage pantries was the best thing i could think of to do i think youd better i began and then he lunged at me my finger squeezed the trigger in reflex simultaneously there was a loud report the weapon kicked in my hand and a small cloud of blackpowder smoke rolled past my face making my eyes water i hadnt hit him the explosion had startled him but now his face settled into new lines of satisfaction without speaking he reached into his coat and drew out a chasedmetal case six inches long from one end of this protruded a handle of white staghorn with the horrible clarity that attends crisis of all kinds i noted everything from the nick in the edge of the blade as he drew it from the case to the scent of the rose he crushed beneath one foot as he came toward me there was nowhere to run i braced myself to fight knowing fight was useless the fresh scar of the cutlass slash burned on my arm a reminder of what was coming that made my flesh shrink there was a flash of blue in the corner of my vision and a juicy thunk as though someone had dropped a melon from some height the reverend turned very slowly on one shoe eyes wide open and quite quite blank for that one moment he looked like margaret then he fell he fell all of a piece not putting out a hand to save himself one of the satinwood tables went flying scattering potpourri and polished stones the reverends head hit the floor at my feet bounced slightly and lay still i took one convulsive step back and stood trapped back against the wall there was a dreadful contused depression in his temple as i watched his face changed color fading before my eyes from the red of choler to a pasty white his chest rose fell paused rose again his eyes were open so was his mouth tseimi is here first wife the chinese was putting the bag that held the stone balls back into his sleeve yes hes hereout there i waved vaguely toward the veranda whathedid you really i felt the waves of shock creeping over me and fought them back closing my eyes and drawing in a breath as deep as i could manage was it you i said my eyes still closed if he was going to cave in my head as well i didnt want to watch did he tell the truth was it you who gave away the meeting place at arbroath to sir percival who told him about malcolm and the printshop there was neither answer nor movement and after a moment i opened my eyes he was standing there watching the reverend campbell archibald campbell lay still as death but was not yet dead the dark angel was coming though his skin had taken on the faint green tinge i had seen before in dying men still his lungs moved taking air with a high wheezing sound it wasnt an englishman then i said my hands were wet and i wiped them on my skirt an english name willoughby not willoughby he said sharply i am yi tien cho why i said almost shouting look at me damn you why he did look at me then his eyes were black and round as marbles but they had lost their shine in china he said there arestories prophecy that one day the ghosts will come everyone fear ghost he nodded once twice then glanced again at the figure on the floor i leave china to save my life waking up long timei see ghosts all round me ghosts he said softly a big ghost comeshorrible white face most horrible hair on fire i think he will eat my soul his eyes had been fixed on the reverend now they rose to my face remote and still as standing water i am right he said simply and nodded again he had not shaved his head recently but the scalp beneath the black fuzz gleamed in the light from the window he eat my soul tseimi i am no more yi tien cho he saved your life i said he nodded once more i know better i die better die than be willoughby willoughby ptah he turned his head and spat his face contorted suddenly angry he talks my words tseimi he eats my soul the fit of anger seemed to pass as quickly as it had come on he was sweating though the room was not terribly warm he passed a trembling hand over his face wiping away the moisture there is a man i see in tavern ask for macdoo i am drunk he said dispassionately wanting woman no woman come with melaugh saying yellow worm point he waved a hand vaguely toward the front of his trousers he shook his head his queue rustling softly against the silk no matter what gwaofei do all same to me i am drunk he said again ghostman wants macdoo ask i am knowing say yes i know macdoo he shrugged it is not important what i say he was staring at the minister again i saw the narrow black chest rise slowly fallrise once more falland remain still there was no sound in the room the wheezing had stopped it is a debt yi tien cho said he nodded toward the still body i am dishonored i am stranger but i pay your life for mine first wife you tell tseimi he nodded once more and turned toward the door there was a faint rustling of feathers from the dark veranda on the threshold he turned back when i wake on dock i am thinking ghosts have come are all around me yi tien cho said softly his eyes were dark and flat with no depth to them but i am wrong it is me i am the ghost there was a stir of breeze at the french windows and he was gone the quick soft sound of feltshod feet passed down the veranda followed by the rustle of spread wings and a soft plaintive gwaaa that faded into the nightsounds of the plantation i made it to the sofa before my knees gave way i bent down and laid my head on my knees praying that i would not faint the blood hammered in my ears i thought i heard a wheezing breath and jerked up my head in panic but the reverend campbell lay quite still i could not stay in the same room with him i got up circling as far around the body as i could get but before i reached the veranda door i had changed my mind all the events of the evening were colliding in my head like the bits of glass in a kaleidoscope i could not stop now to think to make sense of it all but i remembered the reverends words before yi tien cho had come if there was any clue here to where geillis abernathy had gone it would be upstairs i took a candle from the table lighted it and made my way through the dark house to the staircase resisting the urge to look behind me i felt very cold the workroom was dark but a faint eerie violet glow hovered over the far end of the counter there was an odd burnt smell in the room that stung the back of my nose and made me sneeze the faint metallic aftertaste in the back of my throat reminded me of a longago chemistry class quicksilver burning mercury the vapor it gave off was not only eerily beautiful but highly toxic as well i snatched out a handkerchief and plastered it over my nose and mouth as i went toward the site of the violet glow the lines of the pentacle had been charred into the wood of the counter if she had used stones to mark a pattern she had taken them with her but she had left something else behind the photograph was heavily singed at the edges but the center was untouched my heart gave a thump of shock i seized the picture clutching briannas face to my chest with a mingled feeling of fury and panic what did she mean by thisthis desecration it couldnt have been meant as a gesture toward me or jamie for she could not have expected either of us ever to have seen it it must be magicor geilies version of it i tried frantically to recall our conversation in this room what had she said she had been curious about how i had traveled through the stonesthat was the main thing and what had i said only something vague about fixing my attention on a personyes that was iti said i had fixed my attention on a specific person inhabiting the time to which i was drawn i drew a deep breath and discovered that i was trembling both with delayed reaction from the scene in the salon and from a dreadful growing apprehension it might be only that geilie had decided to try my techniqueif one could dignify it with such a wordas well as her own and use the image of brianna as a point of fixation for her travel ori thought of the reverends piles of neat handwritten papers the carefully drawn genealogies and thought i might just faint one of the brahan seers prophecies he had said concerning the frasers of lovat scotlands ruler will come from that lineage but thanks to roger wakefields researches i knewwhat geilie almost certainly knew as well obsessed as she was with scottish historythat lovats direct line had failed in the s to all visible intents and purposes that is there was in fact one survivor of that line living in brianna it took a moment for me to realize that the low growling sound i heard was coming from my own throat and a moment more of conscious effort to unclench my jaws i stuffed the mutilated photograph into the pocket of my skirt and whirled running for the door as though the workroom were inhabited by demons i had to find jamienow they were not there the boat floated silently empty in the shadows of the big cecropia where we had left it but of jamie and the rest there was no sign at all one of the cane fields lay a short distance to my right between me and the looming rectangle of the refinery beyond the faint caramel smell of burnt sugar lingered over the field then the wind changed and i smelled the clean damp scent of moss and wet rocks from the stream with all the tiny pungencies of the water plants intermingled the stream bank rose sharply here going up in a mounded ridge that ended at the edge of the cane field i scrambled up the slope my palm slipping in soft sticky mud i shook it off with a muffled exclamation of disgust and wiped my hand on my skirt a thrill of anxiety ran through me bloody hell where was jamie he should have been back long since two torches burned by the front gate of rose hall small dots of flickering light at this distance there was a closer light as well a glow from the left of the refinery had jamie and his men met trouble there i could hear a faint singing from that direction and see a deeper glow that bespoke a large open fire it seemed peaceful but something about the nightor the placemade me very uneasy suddenly i became aware of another scent above the tang of watercress and burnt sugara strong putridsweet smell that i recognized at once as the smell of rotten meat i took a cautious step and all hell promptly broke loose underfoot it was as though a piece of the night had suddenly detached itself from the rest and sprung into action at about the level of my knees a very large object exploded into movement close to me and there was a stunning blow across my lower legs that knocked me off my feet my involuntary shriek coincided with a truly awful sounda sort of loud grunting hiss that confirmed my impression that i was in close juxtaposition to something large alive and reeking of carrion i didnt know what it was but i wanted no part of it i had landed very hard on my bottom i didnt pause to see what was happening but flipped over and made off through the mud and leaves on all fours followed by a repetition of the grunting hiss only louder and a scrabbling sliding sort of rush something hit my foot a glancing blow and i stumbled to my feet running i was so panicked that i didnt realize that i suddenly could see until the man loomed up before me i crashed into him and the torch he was carrying dropped to the ground hissing as it struck the wet leaves hands grabbed my shoulders and there were shouts behind me my face was pressed against a hairless chest with a strong musky smell about it i regained my balance gasping and leaned back to look into the face of a tall black slave who was gaping down at me in perplexed dismay missus what you be doin here he said before i could answer though his attention was distracted from me to what was going on behind me his grip on my shoulders relaxed and i turned to see six men surrounded the beast two carried torches which they held aloft to light the other four dressed only in loin cloths who cautiously circled holding sharpened wooden poles at the ready my legs were still stinging and wobbly from the blow they had taken when i saw what had struck me they nearly gave way again the thing was nearly twelve feet long with an armored body the size of a rum cask the great tail whipped suddenly to one side the man nearest leapt aside shouting in alarm and the saurians head turned jaws opening slightly to emit another hiss the jaws clicked shut with an audible snap and i saw the telltale carnassial tooth jutting up from the lower jaw in an expression of grim and spurious pleasantry never smile at a crocodile i said stupidly no maam i surely wont the slave said leaving me and edging cautiously toward the scene of action the men with the poles were poking at the beast evidently trying to irritate it in this endeavor they appeared to be succeeding the fat splayed limbs dug hard into the ground and the crocodile charged roaring it lunged with astonishing speed the man before it yelped and jumped back lost his footing on the slippery mud and fell the man who had collided with me launched himself through the air and landed on the crocodiles back the men with the torches danced back and forth yelling encouragement and one of the pole men bolder than the others dashed forward and whacked his pole across the broad plated head to distract it while the fallen slave scrabbled backward bare heels scooping trenches in the black mud the man on the crocodiles back was gropingwith what seemed to me suicidal maniafor the beasts mouth getting a hold with one arm about the thick neck he managed to grab the end of the snout with one hand and holding the mouth shut screamed something to his companions suddenly a figure i hadnt noticed before stepped out of the shadow of the cane it went down on one knee before the struggling pair and without hesitation slipped a rope noose around the lizards jaws the shouting rose in a yell of triumph cut off by a sharp word from the kneeling figure he rose and motioned violently shouting commands he wasnt speaking english but his concern was obvious the great tail was still free lashing from side to side with a force that would have felled any man who came within range of it seeing the power of that stroke i could only marvel that my own legs were merely bruised and not broken the pole men dashed in closer in response to the commands of their leader i could feel the halfpleasant numbness of shock stealing over me and in that state of unreality it somehow seemed no surprise to see that the leader was the man called ishmael huwe he said making violent upward gestures with his palms that made his meaning obvious two of the pole men had gotten their poles shoved under the belly a third now managed a lucky strike past the tossing head and lodged his pole under the chest huwe ishmael said again and all three threw themselves hard upon their poles with a sucking splat the reptile flipped over and landed thrashing on its back its underside a sudden gleaming white in the torchlight the torchbearers were shouting again the noise rang in my ears then ishmael stopped them with a word his hand thrown out in demand palm up i couldnt tell what the word was but it could as easily have been scalpel the intonationand the resultwere the same one of the torchbearers hastily tugged the caneknife from his loincloth and slapped it into his leaders hand ishmael turned on his heel and in the same movement drove the point of the knife deep into the crocodiles throat just where the scales of the jaw joined those of the neck the blood welled black in the torchlight all the men stepped back then and stood at a safe distance watching the dying frenzy of the great reptile with a respect mingled with deep satisfaction ishmael straightened shirt a pale blur against the dark canes unlike the other men he was fully dressed save for bare feet and a number of small leather bags swung at his belt owing to some freak of the nervous system i had kept standing all this time the increasingly urgent messages from my legs made it through to my brain at this point and i sat down quite suddenly my skirts billowing on the muddy ground the movement attracted ishmaels notice the narrow head turned in my direction and his eyes widened the other men seeing him turned also and a certain amount of incredulous comment in several languages followed i wasnt paying much attention the crocodile was still breathing in stertorous bubbling gasps so was i my eyes were fixed on the long scaled head its eye with a slit pupil glowing the greenish gold of tourmaline its oddly indifferent gaze seeming fixed in turn on me the crocodiles grin was upside down but still in place the mud was cool and smooth beneath my cheek black as the thick stream that flowed between the lizards scales the tone of the questions and comments had changed to concern but i was no longer listening i hadnt actually lost consciousness i had a vague impression of jostling bodies and flickering light and then i was lifted into the air clutched tight in someones arms they were talking excitedly but i caught only a word now and then i dimly thought i should tell them to lay me down and cover me with something but my tongue wasnt working leaves brushed my face as my escort ruthlessly shouldered the canes aside it was like pushing through a cornfield that had no ears all stalks and rustling leaves there was no conversation among the men now the susurrus of our passage drowned even the sound of footsteps by the time we entered the clearing by the slave huts both sight and wits had returned to me bar scrapes and bruises i wasnt hurt but i saw no point in advertising the fact i kept my eyes closed and stayed limp as i was carried into one of the huts fighting back panic and hoping to come up with some sensible plan before i was obliged to wake up officially where in bloody hell were jamie and the others if all went wellor worse if it didntwhat were they going to do when they arrived at the landing place and found me gone with tracestraces the place was a bloody wallowof a struggle where i had been and what about friend ishmael what in the name of all merciful god was he doing here i knew one thinghe wasnt bloody well cooking there was a good deal of festive noise outside the open door of the hut and the scent of something alcoholicnot rum something raw and pungentfloated in a high note in the fuggy air of the hut redolent of sweat and boiled yams i cracked an eye and saw the reflected glimmer of firelight on the beaten earth shadows moved back and forth in front of the open door i couldnt leave without being seen there was a general shout of triumph and all the figures disappeared abruptly in what i assumed was the direction of the fire presumably they were doing something to the crocodile who had arrived when i did swinging upsidedown from the hunters poles i rolled cautiously up onto my knees could i steal away while they were occupied with whatever they were doing if i could make it to the nearest cane field i was fairly sure they couldnt find me but i was by no means so sure that i could find the river again alone in the pitchdark ought i to make for the main house instead in hopes of running into jamie and his rescue party i shuddered slightly at the thought of the house and the long silent black form on the floor of the salon but if i didnt go to either house or boat how was i to find them on a moonless night black as the devils armpit my planning was interrupted by a shadow in the doorway that momentarily blocked the light i risked a peek then sat bolt upright and screamed the figure came swiftly in and knelt by my pallet don you be makin that noise woman ishmael said it aint but me right i said cold sweat prickled on my jaws and i could feel my heart pounding like a triphammer knew it all the time they had cut off the crocodiles head and sliced out the tongue and the floor of the mouth he wore the huge coldeyed thing like a hat his eyes no more than a gleam in the depths beneath the portcullised teeth the empty lower jaw sagged fatjowled and grimly jovial hiding the lower half of his face the egungun he didnt hurt you none he asked no i said thanks to the men eryou wouldnt consider taking that off would you he ignored the request and sat back on his heels evidently considering me i couldnt see his face but every line of his body expressed the most profound indecision why you bein here he asked at last for lack of any better idea i told him he didnt mean to bash me on the head or he would have done it already when i collapsed below the cane field ah he said when i had finished the reptiles snout dipped slightly toward me as he thought a drop of moisture fell from the valved nostril onto my bare hand and i wiped it quickly on my skirt shuddering the missus not here tonight he said at last as though wondering whether it was safe to trust me with the information yes i know i said i gathered my feet under me preparing to rise can youor one of the mentake me back to the big tree by the river my husband will be looking for me i added pointedly likely she be takin the boy with her ishmael went on ignoring me my heart had lifted when he had verified that geilie was gone now it fell with a distinct thud in my chest shes taken ian why i couldnt see his face but the eyes inside the crocodile mask shone with a gleam of something that was partly amusementbut only partly missus likes boys he said the malicious tone making his meaning quite clear does she i said flatly do you know when shell be coming back the long toothy snout turned suddenly up but before he could reply i sensed someone standing behind me and swung around on the pallet i know you she said a small frown puckering the wide smooth forehead as she looked down at me do i not weve met i said trying to swallow the heart that had leapt into my mouth in startlement howhow do you do miss campbell better than when last seen evidently in spite of the fact that her neat wool challis gown had been replaced with a loose smock of coarse white cotton sashed with a broad raggedly torn strip of the same stained dark blue with indigo both face and figure had grown more slender though and she had lost the pasty sagging look of too many months spent indoors i am well i thank ye maam she said politely the pale blue eyes had still that distant unfocused look to them and despite the new sunglow on her skin it was clear that miss margaret campbell was still not altogether in the here and now this impression was borne out by the fact that she appeared not to have noticed ishmaels unconventional attire or to have noticed ishmael himself for that matter she went on looking at me a vague interest passing across her snub features it is most civil in ye to call upon me maam she said might i offer ye refreshment of some kind a dish of tea perhaps we keep no claret for my brother holds that strong spirits are a temptation to the lusts of the flesh i daresay they are i said feeling that i could do with a brisk spot of temptation at the moment ishmael had risen and now bowed deeply to miss campbell the great head slipping precariously you ready bébé he asked softly the fire is waiting fire she said yes of course and turned to me will ye not join me mrs malcolm she asked graciously tea will be served shortly i do so enjoy looking into a nice fire she confided taking my arm as i rose do you not find yourself sometimes imagining that you see things in the flames now and again i said i glanced at ishmael who was standing in the doorway his indecision was apparent in his stance but as miss campbell moved inexorably toward him towing me after her he shrugged very slightly and stepped aside outside a small bonfire burned brightly in the center of the clearing before the row of huts the crocodile had already been skinned the raw hide was stretched on a frame near one of the huts throwing a headless shadow on the wooden wall several sharpened sticks were thrust into the ground around the fire each strung with chunks of meat sizzling with an appetizing smell that nonetheless made my stomach clench perhaps three dozen people men women and children were gathered near the fire laughing and talking one man was still singing softly curled over a battered guitar as we appeared one man caught sight of us and turned sharply saying something that sounded like hau at once the talk and laughter stopped and a respectful silence fell upon the crowd ishmael walked slowly toward them the crocodiles head grinning in apparent delight the firelight shone off faces and bodies like polished jet and melted caramel all with deep black eyes that watched us come there was a small bench near the fire set on a sort of dais made of stacked planks this was evidently the seat of honor for miss campbell made for it directly and gestured politely for me to sit down next to her i could feel the weight of eyes upon me with expressions ranging from hostility to guarded curiosity but most of the attention was for miss campbell glancing covertly around the circle of faces i was struck by their strangeness these were the faces of africa and alien to me not faces like joes that bore only the faint stamp of his ancestors diluted by centuries of european blood black or not joe abernathy was a great deal more like me than like these peopledifferent to the marrow of their bones the man with the guitar had put it aside and drawn out a small drum that he set between his knees the sides were covered with the hide of some spotted animal goat perhaps he began to tap it softly with the palms of his hands in a halfhalting rhythm like the beating of a heart i glanced at miss campbell sitting tranquil beside me hands carefully folded in her lap she was gazing straight ahead into the leaping flames with a small dreaming smile on her lips the swaying crowd of slaves parted and two little girls came out carrying a large basket between them the handle of the basket was twined with white roses and the lid jerked up and down agitated by the movements of something inside the girls set the basket at ishmaels feet casting awed glances up at his grotesque headdress he rested a hand on each of their heads murmured a few words and then dismissed them his upraised palms a startling flash of yellowpink like butterflies rising from the girls knotted hair the attitude of the spectators had so far been quiet and respectful it continued so but now they crowded closer necks craning to see what would happen next and the drum began to beat faster still softly one of the women was holding a stone bottle she took one step forward handed it to ishmael and melted back into the crowd ishmael took up the bottle of liquor and poured a small amount on the ground moving carefully in a circle around the basket the basket momentarily quiescent heaved to and fro evidently disturbed by the movement or the pungent scent of alcohol a man holding a stick wrapped in rags stepped forward and held the stick in the bonfire until the rags blazed up bright red at a word from ishmael he dipped his torch to the ground where the liquor had been poured there was a collective ah from the watchers as a ring of flame sprang up burned blue and died away at once as quickly as it came from the basket came a loud cockadoodledooo miss campbell stirred beside me eyeing the basket with suspicion as though the crowing had been a signalperhaps it wasa flute began to play and the humming of the crowd rose to a higher pitch ishmael came toward the makeshift dais where we sat holding a red headrag between his hands this he tied about margarets wrist placing her hand gently back in her lap when he had finished oh there is my handkerchief she exclaimed and quite unselfconsciously raised her wrist and wiped her nose no one but me seemed to notice the attention was on ishmael who was standing before the crowd speaking in a language i didnt recognize the cock in the basket crowed again and the white roses on the handle quivered violently with its struggles i do wish it wouldnt do that said margaret campbell rather petulantly if it does again it will be three times and thats bad luck isnt it is it ishmael was now pouring the rest of the liquor in a circle round the dais i hoped the flame wouldnt startle her oh yes archie says so before the cock crows thrice thou wilt betray me archie says women are always betrayers is that so do you think depends on your point of view i suppose i murmured watching the proceedings miss campbell seemed oblivious to the swaying humming slaves the music the twitching basket and ishmael who was collecting small objects handed to him out of the crowd im hungry she said i do hope the tea will be ready soon ishmael heard this to my amazement he reached into one of the bags at his waist and unwrapped a small bundle which proved to hold a cup of chipped and battered porcelain the remnants of gold leaf still visible on the rim this he placed ceremoniously on her lap oh goody margaret said happily clapping her hands together perhaps therell be biscuits i rather thought not ishmael had placed the objects given him by the crowd along the edge of the dais a few small bones with lines carved across them a spray of jasmine and two or three crude little figures made of wood each one wrapped in a scrap of cloth with little shocks of hair glued to the headnubbins with clay ishmael spoke again the torch dipped and a sudden whiff of blue flame shot up around the dais as it died away leaving the scent of scorched earth and burnt brandy heavy in the cool night air he opened the basket and brought out the cock it was a large healthy bird black feathers glistening in the torchlight it struggled madly uttering piercing squawks but it was firmly trussed its feet wrapped in cloth to prevent scratching ishmael bowed low saying something and handed the bird to margaret oh thank you she said graciously the cock stretched out its neck wattles bright red with agitation and crowed piercingly margaret shook it naughty bird she said crossly and raising it to her mouth bit it just behind the head i heard the soft crack of the neck bones and the little grunt of effort as she flung her head up wrenching off the head of the hapless cock she clutched the gurgling struggling trussed carcass tight against her bosom crooning now then now then its all right darling as the blood spurted and sprayed into the teacup and all over her dress the crowd had cried out at first but now was quite still watching the flute too had fallen silent but the drum beat on sounding much louder than before margaret dropped the drained carcass carelessly to one side where a boy darted out of the crowd to retrieve it she brushed absently at the blood on her skirt picking up the teacup with her redswathed hand guests first she said politely will you have one lump mrs malcolm or two i was fortunately saved from answering by ishmael who thrust a crude horn cup into my hands indicating that i should drink from it considering the alternative i raised it to my mouth without hesitation it was freshdistilled rum sharp and raw enough to strip the throat and i choked wheezing the tang of some herb rose up the back of my throat and into my nose something had been mixed with the liquor or soaked in it it was faintly tart but not unpleasant other cups like mine were making their way from hand to hand through the crowd ishmael made a sharp gesture indicating that i should drink more i obediently raised the cup to my lips but let the fiery liquid lap against my mouth without swallowing whatever was happening here i thought i might need such wits as i had beside me miss campbell was drinking from her teetotal cup with genteel sips the feeling of expectancy among the crowd was rising they were swaying now and a woman had begun to sing low and husky her voice an offbeat counterpoint to the thump of the drum the shadow of ishmaels headdress fell across my face and i looked up he too was swaying slowly back and forth the collarless white shirt he wore was speckled over the shoulders with black dots of blood and stuck to his breast with sweat i thought suddenly that the raw crocodiles head must weigh thirty pounds at least a terrible weight to support the muscles of his neck and shoulders were taut with effort he raised his hands and began to sing as well i felt a shiver run down my back and coil at the base of my spine where my tail would have been with his face masked the voice could have been joes deep and honeyed with a power that commanded attention if i closed my eyes it was joe with the light glinting off his spectacles and catching the gold tooth far back as he smiled then i opened my eyes again halfshocked to see instead the crocodiles sinister yawn and the fire goldgreen in the cold cruel eyes my mouth was dry and there was a faint buzzing in my ears weaving around the strong sweet words he was getting attention all right the night by the fire was full of eyes blackwide and shiny and small moans and shouts marked the pauses in the song i closed my eyes and shook my head hard i grabbed the edge of the wooden bench clinging to its rough reality i wasnt drunk i knew whatever herb had been mixed with the rum was potent i could feel it creeping snakelike through my blood and kept my eyes tight closed fighting its progress i couldnt block my ears though or the sound of that voice rising and falling i didnt know how much time had passed i came back to myself with a start suddenly aware that the drum and the singing had stopped there was an absolute silence around the fire i could hear the small rush of flame and the rustle of cane leaves in the night wind the quick darting scuttle of a rat in the palmfrond roof of the hut behind me the drug was still in my bloodstream but the effects were dying i could feel clarity coming back to my thoughts not so for the crowd the eyes were fixed in a single unblinking stare like a wall of mirrors and i thought suddenly of the voodoo legends of my timeof zombies and the houngans who made them what had geilie said every legend has one foot on the truth ishmael spoke he had taken off the crocodiles head it lay on the ground at our feet eyes gone dark in the shadow ils sont arrivées ishmael said quietly they have come he lifted his wet face lined with exhaustion and turned to the crowd who asks as though in response a young woman in a turban moved out of the crowd still swaying halfdazed and sank down on the ground before the dais she put her hand on one of the carved images a crude wooden icon in the shape of a pregnant woman her eyes looked up with hope and while i didnt recognize the words she spoke it was clear what she asked aya gado the voice spoke from beside me but it wasnt margaret campbells it was the voice of an old woman cracked and high but confident answering in the affirmative the young woman gasped with joy and prostrated herself on the ground ishmael nudged her gently with a foot she got up quickly and backed into the crowd clutching the small image and bobbing her head murmuring mana mana over and over next was a young man by his face the brother of the first young woman who squatted respectfully upon his haunches touching his head before he spoke grandmère he began in high nasal french grandmother i thought he asked his question looking shyly down at the ground does the woman i love return my love his was the jasmine spray he held it so that it brushed the top of a bare dusty foot the woman beside me laughed her ancient voice ironic but not unkind certainement she answered she returns it and that of three other men besides find another less generous but more worthy the young man retired crestfallen to be replaced by an older man this one spoke in an african language i did not know a tone of bitterness in his voice as he touched one of the clay figures setato hoye saidwho the voice had changed the voice of a man this time fullgrown but not elderly answering in the same language with an angry tone i stole a look to the side and despite the heat of the fire felt the chill ripple up my forearms it was margarets face no longer the outlines were the same but the eyes were bright alert and focused on the petitioner the mouth set in grim command and the pale throat swelled like a frogs with the effort of strong speech as whoeveritwas argued with the man they are here ishmael had said they indeed he stood to one side silent but watchful and i saw his eyes rest on me for a second before coming back to margaret or whatever had been margaret they one by one the people came forward to kneel and ask some spoke in english some french or the slave patois some in the african speech of their vanished homes i couldnt understand all that was said but when the questions were in french or english they were often prefaced by a respectful grandfather or grandmother once by aunt both the face and the voice of the oracle beside me changed as they came to answer their call male and female mostly middleaged or old their shadows dancing on her face with the flicker of the fire do you not sometimes imagine that you see things in the fire the echo of her own small voice came back to me thin and childish listening i felt the hair rise on the back of my neck and understood for the first time what had brought ishmael back to this place risking recapture and renewed slavery not friendship not love nor any loyalty to his fellow slaves but power what price is there for the power to tell the future any price was the answer i saw looking out at the rapt faces of the congregation he had come back for margaret it went on for some time i didnt know how long the drug would last but i saw people here and there sink down to the ground and nod to sleep others melted silently back to the darkness of the huts and after a time we were almost alone only a few remained around the fire all men they were all husky and confident and from their attitude accustomed to command some respect among slaves at least they had hung back together as a group watching the proceedings until at last one clearly the leader stepped forward they be done mon he said to ishmael with a jerk of his head toward the sleeping forms around the fire now you ask ishmaels face showed nothing but a slight smile yet he seemed suddenly nervous perhaps it was the closing in of the other men there was nothing overtly menacing about them but they seemed both serious and intentnot upon margaret for a change but upon ishmael at last he nodded and turned to face margaret during the hiatus her face had gone blank no one at home bouassa he said to her come you bouassa i shrank involuntarily away as far as i could get on the bench without falling into the fire whoever bouassa was he had come promptly i be hearin it was a voice as deep as ishmaels and should have been as pleasant it wasnt one of the men took an involuntary step backward ishmael stood alone the other men seemed to shrink away from him as though he suffered some contamination tell me what i want to know you bouassa he said margarets head tilted slightly a light of amusement in the pale blue eyes what you want to know the deep voice said with mild scorn for why mon you be goin i tell you anything or not the small smile on ishmaels face echoed that on bouassas you say true he said softly but these he jerked his head toward his companions not taking his eyes from the face they be goin with me might as well the deep voice said it chuckled rather unpleasantly the maggot dies in three days wont be nothin for them here that all you be wantin with me not waiting for an answer bouassa yawned widely and a loud belch erupted from margarets dainty mouth her mouth closed and her eyes resumed their vacant stare but the men werent noticing an excited chatter erupted from them to be hushed by ishmael with a significant glance at me abruptly quiet they moved away still muttering glancing at me as they went ishmael closed his eyes as the last man left the clearing and his shoulders sagged i felt a trifle drained myself what i began and then stopped across the fire a man had stepped from the shelter of the sugarcane jamie tall as the cane itself with the dying fire staining shirt and face as red as his hair he raised a finger to his lips and i nodded i gathered my feet cautiously beneath me picking up my stained skirt in one hand i could be up past the fire and into the cane with him before ishmael could reach me but margaret i hesitated turned to look at her and saw that her face had come alive once again it was lifted eager lips parted and shining eyes narrowed so that they seemed slightly slanted as she stared across the fire daddy said briannas voice beside me the hairs rippled softly erect on my forearms it was briannas voice briannas face blue eyes dark and slanting with eagerness bree i whispered and the face turned to me mama said my daughters voice from the throat of the oracle brianna said jamie and she turned her head sharply to look at him daddy she said with great certainty i knew it was you ive been dreaming about you jamies face was white with shock i saw his lips form the word jesus without sound and his hand moved instinctively to cross himself dont let mama go alone said the voice with great certainty you go with her ill keep you safe there was no sound save the crackling of the fire ishmael stood transfixed staring at the woman beside me then she spoke again in briannas soft husky tones i love you daddy you too mama she leaned toward me and i smelled the fresh blood then her lips touched mine and i screamed i was not conscious of leaping to my feet or of crossing the clearing all i knew was that i was clinging to jamie my face buried in the cloth of his coat shaking his heart was pounding under my cheek and i thought that he was shaking too i felt his hand trace the sign of the cross upon my back and his arm lock tight about my shoulders its all right he said and i could feel his ribs swell and brace with the effort of keeping his voice steady shes gone i didnt want to look but forced myself to turn my head toward the fire it was a peaceful scene margaret campbell sat quietly on her bench humming to herself twiddling a long black tailfeather upon her knee ishmael stood behind her one hand smoothing her hair in what looked like tenderness he murmured something to her in a low liquid tonguea questionand she smiled placidly oh im not a scrap tired she assured him turning to look fondly up into the scarred face that hovered in the darkness above her such a nice party wasnt it yes bébé he said gently but you rest now eh he turned and clicked his tongue loudly suddenly two of the turbaned women materialized out of the night they must have been waiting just within call ishmael said something to them and they came at once to tend margaret lifting her to her feet and leading her away between them murmuring soft endearments in african and french ishmael remained watching us across the fire he was still as one of geilies idols carved out of night i did not come alone jamie said he gestured casually over his shoulder toward the cane field behind him implying armed regiments oh you be alone mon ishmael said with a slight smile no matter the loa speak to you you be safe from me he glanced back and forth between us appraising huh he said in a tone of interest never did hear a loa speak to buckra he shook his head then dismissing the matter you be going now he said quietly but with considerable authority not yet jamies arm dropped from my shoulder and he straightened up beside me i have come for the boy ian i will not go without him ishmaels brows went up compressing the three vertical scars between them huh he said again you forget that boy he be gone gone where jamie asked sharply the narrow head tilted to one side as ishmael looked him over carefully gone with the maggot mon he said and where she go you don be going that boy gone mon he said again with finality you leave too you a wise man he paused listening a drum was talking somewhere far away the pulse of it little more than a disturbance of the night air the rest be comin soon he remarked you safe from me mon not from them who are the rest i asked the terror of the encounter with the loa was ebbing and i was able to talk once more though my spine still rippled with fear of the dark cane field at my back maroons i expect jamie said he raised a brow at ishmael or ye will be the priest nodded one formal bob of the head that be true he said you hear bouassa speak his loa bless us we go he gestured toward the huts and the dark hills behind them the drum callin them down from the hills those strong enough to go he turned away the conversation obviously at an end wait jamie said tell us where she has gonemrs abernathy and the boy ishmael turned back shoulders mantled in the crocodiles blood to abandawe he said and wheres that jamie demanded impatiently i put a hand on his arm i know where it is i said and ishmaels eyes widened in astonishment at leasti know its on hispaniola lawrence told me that was what geilie wanted from himto find out where it was what is it a town a village where i could feel jamies arm tense under my hand vibrating with the urgency to be gone its a cave i said feeling cold in spite of the balmy air and the nearness of the fire an old cave abandawe a magic place ishmael put in deep voice soft as though he feared to speak of it out loud he looked at me hard reassessing clotilda say the maggot take you to the room upstairs you maybe be knowin what she do there a little my mouth felt dry i remembered geilies hands soft and plump and white laying out the gems in their patterns talking lightly of blood as though he caught the echo of this thought ishmael took a sudden step toward me i ask you womanyou still bleed jamie jerked under my hand but i squeezed his arm to be still yes i said why what has that to do with it the oniseegun was plainly uneasy he glanced from me back toward the huts a stir was perceptible in the dark behind him many bodies were moving to and fro with a mutter of voices like the whisper of the cane fields they were getting ready to go a woman bleeds she kill magic you bleed got your womanpower the magic dont work for you it the old women do magic witch someone call the loas make sick make well he gave me a long appraising look and shook his head you ain gone do the magic what the maggot do that magic kill her sure but it kill you too he gestured behind him toward the empty bench you hear bouassa speak he say the maggot die three days she taken the boy he die you go follow them mon you die too sure he stared at jamie and raised his hands in front of him wrists crossed as though bound together i tell you amiki he said he let his hands fall jerking them apart breaking the invisible bond he turned abruptly and vanished into the darkness where the shuffle of feet was growing louder punctuated with bumps as heavy objects were shifted holy michael defend us muttered jamie he ran a hand hard through his hair making fiery wisps stand out in the flickering light the fire was dying fast with no one left to tend it dye ken this place sassenach where geillis has gone wi ian no all i know is that its somewhere up in the far hills on hispaniola and that a stream runs through it then we must take stern he said with decision come on the lads are by the river wi the boat i turned to follow him but paused on the edge of the cane field to look back jamie look behind us lay the embers of the egunguns fire and the shadowy ring of slave huts farther away the bulk of rose hall made a light patch against the hillside but farther still beyond the shoulder of the hill the sky glowed faintly red that will be howes place burning he said he sounded oddly calm without emotion he pointed to the left toward the flank of the mountain where a small orange dot glowed no more at this distance than a pinprick of light and that will be twelvetrees i expect the drumvoice whispered through the night up and down the river what had ishmael said the drum callin them down from the hillsthose strong enough to go a small line of slaves was coming down from the huts women carrying babies and bundles cooking pots slung over their shoulders heads turbaned in white next to one young woman who held her arm with careful respect walked margaret campbell likewise turbaned jamie saw her and stepped forward miss campbell he said sharply margaret margaret and her attendant stopped the young woman moved as though to step between her charge and jamie but he held up both hands as he came to show he meant no harm and she reluctantly stepped back margaret he said margaret do ye not know me she stared vacantly at him very slowly he touched her holding her face between his hands margaret he said to her lowvoiced urgent margaret hear me dye ken me margaret she blinked once then twice and the smooth round face melted and thawed into life it was not like the sudden possession of the loas this was a slow tentative coming of something shy and fearful aye i ken ye jamie she said at last her voice was rich and pure a young girls voice her lips curled up and her eyes came alive once more her face still held in the hollow of his hands its been lang since i saw ye jamie she said looking up into his eyes will ye have word of ewan then is he well he stood very still for a minute his face that careful blank mask that hid strong feeling he is well he whispered at last verra well margaret he gave me this to keep until i saw ye he bent his head and kissed her gently several of the women had stopped standing silently by to watch at this they moved and began to murmur glancing uneasily at each other when he released margaret campbell and stepped back they closed in around her protective and wary nodding him back margaret seemed oblivious her eyes were still on jamies face the smile on her lips i thank ye jamie she called as her attendant took her arm and began to urge her away tell ewan ill be with him soon the little band of whiteclothed women moved away disappearing like ghosts into the darkness by the cane field jamie made an impulsive move in their direction but i stopped him with a hand on his arm let her go i whispered mindful of what lay on the floor in the salon of the plantation house jamie let her go you cant stop her shes better with them he closed his eyes briefly then nodded aye youre right he turned then stopped suddenly and i whirled about to see what he had seen there were lights in rose hall now torchlight flickering behind the windows upstairs and down as we watched a surly glow began to swell in the windows of the secret workroom on the second floor its past time to go jamie said he seized my hand and we went quickly diving into the dark rustle of the canes fleeing through air suddenly thick with the smell of burning sugar abandawe you can take the governors pinnace thats small but its seaworthy grey fumbled through the drawer of his desk ill write an order for the dockers to hand it over to you aye well need the boati canna risk the artemis as shes jaredsbut i think wed best steal it john jamies brows were drawn together in a frown i wouldna have ye be involved wi me in any visible way aye youll be having trouble enough with things without that grey smiled unhappily trouble yes you might call it trouble with four plantation houses burnt and over two hundred slaves gonegod knows where but i vastly doubt that anyone will take notice of my social acquaintance under the circumstances between fear of the maroons and fear of the chinaman the whole island is in such a panic that a mere smuggler is the most negligible of trivialities its a great relief to me to be thought trivial jamie said very dryly still well steal the boat and if were taken yeve never heard my name or seen my face aye grey stared at him a welter of emotions fighting for mastery of his features amusement fear and anger among them is that right he said at last let you be taken watch them hang you and keep quiet about itfor fear of smirching my reputation for gods sake jamie what do you take me for jamies mouth twitched slightly for a friend john he said and if ill take your friendshipand your damned boatthen youll take mine and keep quiet aye the governor glared at him for a moment lips pressed tight but then his shoulders sagged in defeat i will he said shortly but i should regard it as a great personal favor if you would endeavor not to be captured jamie rubbed a knuckle across his mouth hiding a smile ill try verra hard john the governor sat down wearily there were deep circles under his eyes and his impeccable linen was wilted obviously he had not changed his clothes from the day before all right i dont know where youre going and its likely better i dont but if you can keep out of the sealanes north of antigua i sent a boat this morning to ask for as many men as the barracks there can supply marines and sailors both theyll be heading this way by the day after tomorrow at the latest to guard the town and harbor against the escaped maroons in case of an outright rebellion i caught jamies eye and raised one brow in question but he shook his head almost imperceptibly we had told the governor of the uprising on the yallahs river and the escape of the slavessomething he had heard about from other sources anyway we had not told him what we had seen later that night lying to under cover of a tiny cove sails taken down to hide their whiteness the river was dark as onyx but with a fugitive gleam from the broad expanse of water we had heard them coming and had time to hide before the ship came down upon us the beating of drums and a savage exultation of many voices echoing through the river valley as the bruja sailed past us carried by the downward current the bodies of the pirates no doubt lay somewhere upriver left to rot peacefully among the frangipani and cedar the escaped slaves of the yallahs river had not gone into the mountains of jamaica but out to sea presumably to join bouassas followers on hispaniola the townsfolk of kingston had nothing to fear from the escaped slavesbut it was a good deal better that the royal navy should concentrate their attention here than on hispaniola where we were bound jamie rose to take our leave but grey stopped him wait will you not require a safe place for yourfor mrs fraser he didnt look at me but at jamie eyes steady i should be honored if you would entrust her to my protection she could stay here in the residence until you return no one would trouble heror even need to know she was here jamie hesitated but there was no gentle way to phrase it she must go with me john he said there is no choice about it she must greys glance flickered to me then away but not before i had seen the look of jealousy in his eyes i felt sorry for him but there was nothing i could say no way to tell him the truth yes he said and swallowed noticeably i see quite jamie held out a hand to him he hesitated for a moment but then took it good luck jamie he said voice a little husky god go with you fergus had been somewhat more difficult to deal with he had insisted absolutely on accompanying us offering argument after argument and arguing the more vehemently when he found that the scottish smugglers would sail with us you take them but you will go without me ferguss face was alive with indignation i will jamie said firmly the smugglers are widowers or bachelors all but youre a marrit man he glanced pointedly at marsali who stood watching the discussion her face drawn with anxiety i thought she was oweryoung to be wed and i was wrong but i know shes oweryoung to be widowed youll stay and he turned aside the matter settled it was full dark when we set sail in greys pinnace a thirtyfoot singledecked sloop leaving two docksmen bound and gagged in the boathouse behind us it was a small singlemasted ship bigger than the fishing boat in which we had traveled up the yallahs river but barely large enough to qualify for the designation ship nonetheless she seemed seaworthy enough and we were soon out of kingston harbor heeling over in a brisk evening breeze on our way toward hispaniola the smugglers handled the sailing among them leaving jamie lawrence and i to sit on one of the long benches along the rail we chatted desultorily of this and that but after a time fell silent absorbed in our own thoughts jamie yawned repeatedly and finally at my urging consented to lie down upon the bench his head resting in my lap i was myself strung too tightly to want to sleep lawrence too was wakeful staring upward into the sky hands folded behind his head there is moisture in the air tonight he said nodding upward toward the silver sliver of the crescent moon see the haze about the moon it may rain before dawn unusual for this time of year talk about the weather seemed sufficiently boring to soothe my jangled nerves i stroked jamies hair thick and soft under my hand is that so i said you and jamie both seem able to read the weather from the sky all i know is the old bit about red sky at night sailors delight red sky at morning sailor take warning i didnt notice what color the sky was tonight did you lawrence laughed comfortably rather a light purple he said i cannot say whether it will be red in the morning but it is surprising how frequently such signs are reliable but of course there is a scientific principle involvedthe refraction of light from the moisture in the air just as i observed presently of the moon i lifted my chin enjoying the breeze that lifted the heavy hair that fell on my neck but what about odd phenomena supernatural things i asked him what about things where the rules of science seem not to apply i am a scientist i heard him say in memory his slight accent seeming only to reinforce his matteroffactness i dont believe in ghosts such as what these phenomena well i groped for a moment then fell back on geilies own examples people who have bleeding stigmata for example astral travel visions supernatural manifestationsodd things that cant be explained rationally lawrence grunted and settled his bulk more comfortably on the bench beside me well i say it is the place of science only to observe he said to seek cause where it may be found but to realize that there are many things in the world for which no cause shall be found not because it does not exist but because we know too little to find it it is not the place of science to insist on explanationbut only to observe in hopes that the explanation will manifest itself that may be science but it isnt human nature i objected people go on wanting explanations they do he was becoming interested in the discussion he leaned back folding his hands across his slight paunch in a lecturers attitude it is for this reason that a scientist constructs hypothesessuggestions for the cause of an observation but a hypothesis must never be confused with an explanationwith proof i have seen a great many things which might be described as peculiar fishfalls for instance where a great many fishall of the same species mind you all the same sizefall suddenly from a clear sky over dry land there would appear to be no rational cause for thisand yet is it therefore suitable to attribute the phenomenon to supernatural interference on the face of it does it seem more likely that some celestial intelligence should amuse itself by flinging shoals of fish at us from the sky or that there is some meteorological phenomenona waterspout a tornado something of the kindthat while not visible to us is still in operation and yethis voice became more pensivewhyand howmight a natural phenomenon such as a waterspout remove the headsand only the headsof all the fish have you seen such a thing yourself i asked interested and he laughed there speaks a scientific mind he said chuckling the first thing a scientist askshow do you know who has seen it can i see it myself yes i have seen such a thingthree times in fact though in one case the precipitation was of frogs rather than fish were you near a seashore or a lake once near a shore once near a lakethat was the frogsbut the third time it took place far inland some twenty miles from the nearest body of water and yet the fish were of a kind i have seen only in the deep ocean in none of the cases did i see any sort of disturbance of the upper airno clouds no great wind none of the fabled spouts of water that rise from the sea into the sky assuredly and yet the fish fell so much is a fact for i have seen them and it isnt a fact if you havent seen it i asked dryly he laughed in delight and jamie stirred murmuring against my thigh i smoothed his hair and he relaxed into sleep again it may be so it may not but a scientist could not say could he what is it the christian bible saysblest are they who have not seen but have believed thats what it says yes some things must be accepted as fact without provable cause he laughed again this time without much humor as a scientist who is also a jew i have perhaps a different perspective on such phenomena as stigmataand the idea of resurrection of the dead which a very great proportion of the civilized world accepts as fact beyond question and yet this skeptical view is not one i could even breathe to anyone save yourself without grave danger of personal harm doubting thomas was a jew after all i said smiling to begin with yes and only when he ceased to doubt did he become a christianand a martyr one could argue that it was surety that killed him no his voice was heavy with irony there is a great difference between those phenomena which are accepted on faith and those which are proved by objective determination though the cause of both may be equally rational once known and the chief difference is this that people will treat with disdain such phenomena as are proved by the evidence of the senses and commonly experiencedwhile they will defend to the death the reality of a phenomenon which they have neither seen nor experienced faith is as powerful a force as science he concluded voice soft in the darkness but far more dangerous we sat quietly for a time looking over the bow of the tiny ship toward the thin slice of darkness that divided the night darker than the purple glow of the sky or the silvergray sea the black island of hispaniola drawing inexorably closer where did you see the headless fish i asked suddenly and was not surprised to see the faint inclination of his head toward the bow there he said i have seen a good many odd things among these islandsbut perhaps more there than anywhere else some places are like that i didnt speak for several minutes pondering what might lie aheadand hoping that ishmael had been right in saying that it was ian whom geillis had taken with her to abandawe a thought occurred to meone that had been lost or pushed aside during the events of the last twentyfour hours lawrencethe other scottish boys ishmael told us he saw twelve of them including ian when you were searching the plantationdid you find any trace of the others he drew in his breath sharply but did not answer at once i could feel him turning over words in his mind trying to decide how to say what the chill in my bones had already told me the answer when it came was not from lawrence but from jamie we found them he said softly from the darkness his hand rested on my knee and squeezed gently dinna ask more sassenachfor i willna tell ye i understood ishmael had to have been right it must be ian with geilie for jamie could bear no other possibility i laid a hand on his head and he stirred slightly turning so that his breath touched my hand blest are they who have not seen i whispered under my breath but have believed we dropped anchor near dawn in a small nameless bay on the northern coast of hispaniola there was a narrow beach faced with cliffs and through a split in the rock a narrow sandy trail was visible leading into the interior of the island jamie carried me the few steps to shore set me down and then turned to innes who had splashed ashore with one of the parcels of food i thank ye a charaid he said formally we shall part here with the virgins blessing we will meet here again in four days time inness narrow face contracted in surprised disappointment then resignation settled on his features aye he said ill mind the boatie then til ye all come back jamie saw the expression and shook his head smiling not just you man did i need a strong arm it would be yours i should call on first no all of ye shall stay save my wife and the jew resignation was replaced by sheer surprise stay here all of us but will ye not have need of us mac dubh he squinted anxiously at the cliffs with their burden of flowering vines it looks a fearsome place to venture into without friends i shall count it the act of greatest friendship for ye to wait here as i say duncan jamie said and i realized with a slight shock that i had never known inness given name innes glanced again at the cliffs his lean face troubled then bent his head in acquiescence well its you as shall say mac dubh but ye ken we are willingall of us jamie nodded his face turned away aye i ken that fine duncan he said softly then he turned back held out an arm and innes embraced him his one arm awkwardly thumping jamies back if a ship should come jamie said letting go then i wish ye to take heed for yourselves the royal navy will be looking for that pinnace aye i doubt they shall come here looking but if they shouldor if anything else at all should threaten yethen leave sail away at once and leave ye here nay ye can order me to do a great many things mac dubh and do them i shallbut not that jamie frowned and shook his head the rising sun struck sparks from his hair and the stubble of his beard wreathing his head in fire it will do me and my wife no good to have ye killed duncan mind what i say if a ship comesgo he turned aside then and went to take leave of the other scots innes sighed deeply his face etched with disapproval but he made no further protest it was hot and damp in the jungle and there was little talk among the three of us as we made our way inland there was nothing to say after all jamie and i could not speak of brianna before lawrence and there were no plans to be made until we reached abandawe and saw what was there i dozed fitfully at night waking several times to see jamie back against a tree near me eyes fixed sightless on the fire at noon of the second day we reached the place a steep and rocky hillside of gray limestone rose before us sprouted over with spiky aloes and a ruffle of coarse grass and on the crest of the hill i could see them great standing stones megaliths in a rough circle about the crown of the hill you didnt say there was a stone circle i said i felt faint and not only from the heat and damp are you quite well mrs fraser lawrence peered at me in some alarm his genial face flushed beneath its tan yes i said but my face must as usual have given me away for jamie was there in a moment taking my arm and steadying me with a hand about my waist for gods sake be careful sassenach he muttered dinna go near those things we have to know if geilies there with ian i said come on i forced my reluctant feet into motion and he came with me still muttering under his breath in gaelici thought it was a prayer they were put up a very long time ago lawrence said as we came up onto the crest of the hill within a few feet of the stones not by slavesby the aboriginal inhabitants of the islands the circle was empty and innocentlooking no more than a staggered circle of large stones set on end motionless under the sun jamie was watching my face anxiously can ye hear them claire he said lawrence looked startled but said nothing as i advanced carefully toward the nearest stone i dont know i said it isnt one of the proper daysnot a sun feast or a fire feast i mean it may not be open now i dont know holding tightly to jamies hand i edged forward listening there seemed a faint hum in the air but it might be no more than the usual sound of the jungle insects very gently i laid the palm of my hand against the nearest stone i was dimly conscious of jamie calling my name somewhere my mind was struggling on a physical level making the conscious effort to lift and lower my diaphragm to squeeze and release the chambers of my heart my ears were filled with a pulsating hum a vibration too deep for sound that throbbed in the marrow of my bones and in some small still place in the center of the chaos was geilie duncan green eyes smiling into mine claire i was lying on the ground jamie and lawrence bending over me faces dark and anxious against the sky there was dampness on my cheeks and a trickle of water ran down my neck i blinked cautiously moving my extremities to be sure i still possessed them jamie put down the handkerchief with which he had been bathing my face and lifted me to a sitting position are ye all right sassenach yes i said still mildly confused jamieshes here who mrs abernathy lawrences heavy eyebrows shot up and he glanced hastily behind him as though expecting her to materialize on the spot i heard hersaw herwhatever my wits were coming slowly back shes here not in the circle close by can ye tell where jamies hand was resting on his dirk as he darted quick glances all around us i shook my head and closed my eyes tryingreluctantlyto recapture that moment of seeing there was an impression of darkness of damp coolness and the flicker of red torchlight i think shes in a cave i said amazed is it close by lawrence it is he said watching my face with intense curiosity the entrance is not far from here take us there jamie was on his feet lifting me to mine jamie i stopped him with a hand on his arm aye jamieshe knows im here too that stopped him all right he paused and i saw him swallow then his jaw tightened and he nodded a mhìcheal bheannaichte dìon sinn bho dheamhainnean he said softly and turned toward the edge of the hill blessed michael defend us from demons the blackness was absolute i brought my hand to my face felt my palm brush my nose but saw nothing it wasnt an empty blackness though the floor of the passage was uneven with small sharp particles that crunched underfoot and the walls in some places grew so close together that i wondered how geilie had ever managed to squeeze through even in the places where the passage grew wider and the stone walls were too far away for my outstretched hands to brush against i could feel them it was like being in a dark room with another personsomeone who kept quite silent but whose presence i could feel never more than an arms length away jamies hand was tight on my shoulder and i could feel his presence behind me a warm disturbance in the cool void of the cave are we headed right he asked when i stopped for a moment to catch my breath there are passages to the sides i feel them as we pass how can ye tell where were going i can hear hear them it dont you hear it was a struggle to speak to form coherent thoughts the call here was different not the beehive sound of craigh na dun but a hum like the vibration of the air following the striking of a great bell i could feel it ringing in the long bones of my arms echoing through pectoral girdle and spine jamie gripped my arm hard stay with me he said sassenachdont let it take ye stay i reached blindly out and he caught me tight against his chest the thump of his heart against my temple was louder than the hum jamie jamie hold on to me i had never been more frightened dont let me go if it takes mejamie i cant come back again its worse every time it will kill me jamie his arms tightened round me til i felt my ribs crack and gasped for breath after a moment he let go and putting me gently aside moved past me into the passage taking care to keep his hand always on me ill go first he said put your hand in my belt and dinna let go for anything linked together we moved slowly down farther into the dark lawrence had wanted to come but jamie would not let him we had left him at the mouth of the cave waiting if we should not return he was to go back to the beach to keep the rendezvous with innes and the other scots if we should not return he must have felt my grip tighten for he stopped and drew me alongside him claire he said softly i must say something i knew already and groped for his mouth to stop him but my hand brushed by his face in the dark he gripped my wrist and held tight if it will be a choice between her and one of usthen it must be me ye know that aye i knew that if geilie should be there still and one of us might be killed in stopping her it must be jamie to take the risk for with jamie dead i would be leftand i could follow her through the stone which he could not i know i whispered at last i knew also what he did not say and what he knew as well that should geilie have gone through already then i must go as well then kiss me claire he whispered and know that you are more to me than life and i have no regret i couldnt answer but kissed him first his hand its crooked fingers warm and firm and the brawny wrist of a swordwielder and then his mouth haven and promise and anguish all mingled and the salt of tears in the taste of him then i let go and turned toward the lefthand tunnel this way i said within ten paces i saw the light it was no more than a faint glow on the rocks of the passage but it was enough to restore the gift of sight suddenly i could see my hands and feet though dimly my breath came out in something like a sob of relief and fear i felt like a ghost taking shape as i walked toward the light and the soft bellhum before me the light was stronger now then dimmed again as jamie slid in front of me and his back blocked my view then he bent and stepped through a low archway i followed and stood up in light it was a goodsized chamber the walls farthest from the torch still cold and black with the slumber of the cave the wall before us had wakened though it flickered and gleamed particles of embedded mineral reflecting the flames of a pine torch fixed in a crevice so ye came did you geillis was on her knees eyes fixed on a glittering stream of white powder that fell from her folded fist drawing a line on the dark floor i heard a small sound from jamie half relief half horror as he saw ian the boy lay in the middle of the pentacle on his side hands bound behind him gagged with a strip of white cloth next to him lay an ax it was made of a shiny dark stone like obsidian with a sharp chipped edge the handle was covered with gaudy beadwork in an african pattern of stripes and zigzags dont come any closer fox geilie sat back on her heels showing her teeth to jamie in an expression that was not a smile she held a pistol in one hand its fellow charged and cocked was thrust through the leather belt she wore about her waist eyes fixed on jamie she reached into the pouch suspended from the belt and withdrew another handful of diamond dust i could see beads of sweat standing on her broad white brow the bellhum from the timepassage must be reaching her as it reached me i felt sick and the sweat ran down my body in trickles under my clothes the pattern was almost finished with the pistol carefully trained she dribbled out the thin shining stream until she had completed the pentagram the stones were already laid inside itthey glinted from the floor in sparks of color connected by a gleaming line of poured quicksilver there then she sat back on her heels with a sigh of relief and wiped the thick creamy hair back with one hand safe the diamond dust keeps out the noise she explained to me nasty isnt it she patted ian who lay bound and gagged on the ground in front of her his eyes wide with fear above the white cloth of the gag there there mo chridhe dinna fret it will be soon over take your hand off him ye wicked bitch jamie took an impulsive step forward hand on his dirk then stopped as she lifted the barrel of the pistol an inch ye mind me o your uncle dougal a sionnach she said tilting her head to one side coquettishly he was older when i met him than you are now but youve the look of him about ye aye like yed take what ye pleased and damn anyone who stands in your way jamie looked at ian curled on the floor then up at geilie ill take whats mine he said softly but ye cant now can ye she said pleasantly one more step and i kill ye dead i spare ye now only because claire seems fond of ye her eyes shifted to me standing in the shadows behind jamie she nodded to me a life for a life sweet claire ye tried to save me once on craigh na dun i saved you from the witchtrial at cranesmuir were quits now aye geilie picked up a small bottle uncorked it and poured the contents carefully over ians clothes the smell of brandy rose up strong and heady and the torch flared brighter as the fumes of alcohol reached it ian bucked and kicked making a strained noise of protest and she kicked him sharply in the ribs be still she said dont do it geilie i said knowing that words would do no good i have to she said calmly im meant to im sorry i shall have to take the girl but ill leave ye the man what girl jamies fists were clenched tight at his side knuckles white even in the dim torchlight brianna thats the name isnt it she shook back her heavy hair smoothing it out of her face the last of lovats line she smiled at me what luck ye should have come to see me aye id never ha kent it otherwise i thought theyd all died out before a thrill of horror shot through me i could feel the same tremor run through jamie as his muscles tightened it must have shown on his face geilie cried out sharply and leapt back she fired as he lunged at her his head snapped back and his body twisted hands still reaching for her throat then he fell his body limp across the edge of the glittering pentagram there was a strangled moan from ian i felt rather than heard a sound rise in my throat i didnt know what i had said but geilie turned her face in my direction startled when brianna was two a car had carelessly sideswiped mine hitting the back door next to where she was sitting i slowed to a stop checked briefly to see that she was unhurt and then bounded out headed for the other car which had pulled over a little way ahead the other driver was a man in his thirties quite large and probably entirely selfassured in his dealings with the world he looked over his shoulder saw me coming and hastily rolled up his window shrinking back in his seat i had no consciousness of rage or any other emotion i simply knew with no shadow of doubt that i couldand wouldshatter the window with my hand and drag the man out through it he knew it too i thought no further than that and didnt have to the arrival of a police car had recalled me to my normal state of mind and then i started to shake but the memory of the look on that mans face stayed with me fire is a poor illuminator but it would have taken total darkness to conceal that look on geilies face the sudden realization of what was coming toward her she jerked the other pistol from her belt and swung it to bear on me i saw the round hole of the muzzle clearlyand didnt care the roar of the discharge caromed through the cave the echoes sending down showers of rocks and dirt but by then i had seized the ax from the floor i noted quite clearly the leather binding ornamented with a beaded pattern it was red with yellow zigzags and black dots the dots echoed the shiny obsidian of the blade and the red and yellow picked up the hues of the flaming torch behind her i heard a noise behind me but didnt turn reflections of the fire burned red in the pupils of her eyes the red thing jamie had called it i gave myself to it he had said i didnt need to give myself it had taken me there was no fear no rage no doubt only the stroke of the swinging ax the shock of it echoed up my arm and i let go my fingers numbed i stood quite still not even moving when she staggered toward me blood in firelight is black not red she took one blind step forward and fell all her muscles gone limp making no attempt to save herself the last i saw of her face was her eyes set wide beautiful as gemstones a green waterclear and faceted with the knowledge of death someone was speaking but the words made no sense the cleft in the rock buzzed loudly filling my ears the torch flickered flaring sudden yellow in a draft the beating of the dark angels wings i thought the sound came again behind me i turned and saw jamie he had risen to his knees swaying blood was pouring from his scalp dyeing one side of his face redblack the other side was white as a harlequins mask stop the bleeding said some remnant of instinct in my brain and i fumbled for a handkerchief but by then he had crawled to where ian lay and was groping at the boys bonds jerking loose the leather straps drops of his blood pattering on the lads shirt ian squirmed to his feet his face ghastly pale and put out a hand to help his uncle then jamies hand was on my arm i looked up numbly offering the cloth he took it and wiped it roughly over his face then jerked at my arm pulling me toward the tunnel mouth i stumbled and nearly fell caught myself and came back to the present come he was saying can ye not hear the wind there is a storm coming above wind i thought in a cave but he was right the draft had not been my imagination the faint exhalation from the crack near the entrance had changed to a steady whining wind almost a keening that rang in the narrow passage i turned to look over my shoulder but jamie grasped my arm hard and pushed me forward my last sight of the cave was a blurred impression of jet and rubies with a still white shape in the middle of the floor then the draft came in with a roar and the torch went out jesus it was young ians voice filled with terror somewhere close by uncle jamie here jamies voice came out of the darkness just in front of me surprisingly calm raised to be heard above the noise here lad come here to me ian dinna be afraid its only the cave breathing it was the wrong thing to say when he said it i could feel the cold breath of the rock touch my neck and the hairs there rose up prickling the image of the cave as a living thing breathing all around us blind and malevolent struck me cold with horror apparently the notion was as terrifying to ian as it was to me for i heard a faint gasp and then his groping hand struck me and clung for dear life to my arm i clutched his hand with one of mine and probed the dark ahead with the other finding jamies reassuringly large shape almost at once ive got ian i said for gods sake lets get out of here he gripped my hand in answer and linked together we began to make our way back down the winding tunnel stumbling through the pitch dark and stepping on each others heels and all the time that ghostly wind whined at our backs i could see nothing no hint of jamies shirt in front of my face snowy white as i knew it to be not even a flicker of the movement of my own lightcolored skirts though i heard them swish about my feet as i walked the sound blending with that of the wind the thin rush of air rose and fell in pitch whispering and wailing i tried to force my mind away from the memory of what lay behind us away from the morbid fancy that the wind held sighing voices whispering secrets just past hearing i can hear her ian said suddenly behind me his voice rose cracking with panic i can hear her god oh god shes coming i froze in my tracks a scream wedged in my throat the cool observer in my head knew quite well it was not soonly the wind and ians frightbut that made no difference to the spurt of sheer terror that rose from the pit of my stomach and turned my bowels to water i knew she was coming too and screamed out loud then jamie had me and ian too gripped tight against him one in each arm our ears muffled against his chest he smelled of pine smoke and sweat and brandy and i nearly sobbed in relief at the closeness of him hush he said fiercely hush the both of ye i willna let her touch ye never he pressed us to him hard i felt his heart beating fast beneath my cheek and ians bony shoulder squeezed against mine and then the pressure relaxed come along now jamie said more quietly its but wind caves blow through their cracks when the weather changes aboveground ive heard it before there is a storm coming outside come now the storm was a brief one by the time we had stumbled to the surface blinking against the shock of sunlight the rain had passed leaving the world reborn in its wake lawrence was sheltering under a dripping palm near the caves entrance when he saw us he sprang to his feet a look of relief relaxing the creases of his face it is all right he said looking from me to a bloodstained jamie jamie gave him half a smile nodding it is all right he said he turned and motioned to ian may i present my nephew ian murray ian this is dr stern whos been of great assistance to us in looking for ye im much obliged to ye doctor ian said with a bob of his head he wiped a sleeve across his streaked face and glanced at jamie i knew yed come uncle jamie he said with a tremulous smile but ye left it a bit late aye the smile widened then broke and he began to tremble he blinked hard fighting back tears i did then and im sorry ian come here a bhalaich jamie reached out and took him in a close embrace patting his back and murmuring to him in gaelic i watched for a moment before i realized that lawrence was speaking to me are you quite well mrs fraser he was asking without waiting for an answer he took my arm i dont quite know i felt completely empty exhausted as though by childbirth but without the exultation of spirit nothing seemed quite real jamie ian lawrence all seemed like toy figures that moved and talked at a distance making noises that i had to strain to understand i think perhaps we should leave this place lawrence said with a glance at the cave mouth from which we had just emerged he looked slightly uneasy he didnt ask about mrs abernathy i think you are right the picture of the cave we had left was vivid in my mindbut just as unreal as the vivid green jungle and gray stones around us not waiting for the men to follow i turned and walked away the feeling of remoteness increased as we walked i felt like an automaton built around an iron core walking by clockwork i followed jamies broad back through branches and clearings shadow and sun not noticing where we were going sweat ran down my sides and into my eyes but i barely stirred to wipe it away at length toward sunset we stopped in a small clearing near a stream and made our primitive camp i had already discovered that lawrence was a most useful person to have along on a camping trip he was not only as good at finding or building shelter as was jamie but was sufficiently familiar with the flora and fauna of the area to be able to plunge into the jungle and return within half an hour bearing handfuls of edible roots fungi and fruit with which to augment the spartan rations in our packs ian was set to gather firewood while lawrence foraged and i sat jamie down with a pan of water to tend the damage to his head i washed away the blood from face and hair to find to my surprise that the ball had in fact not plowed a furrow through his scalp as i had thought instead it had pierced the skin just above his hairline andevidentlyvanished into his head there was no sign of an exit wound unnerved by this i prodded his scalp with increasing agitation until a sudden cry from the patient announced that i had discovered the bullet there was a large tender lump on the back of his head the pistol ball had traveled under the skin skimming the curve of his skull and come to rest just over his occiput jesus h christ i exclaimed i felt it again unbelieving but there it was you always said your head was solid bone and ill be damned if you werent right she shot you pointblank and the bloody ball bounced off your skull jamie supporting his head in his hands as i examined him made a sound somewhere between a snort and a groan aye well he said his voice somewhat muffled in his hands ill no say im not thickheided but if mistress abernathy had used a full charge of powder it wouldna have been nearly thick enough does it hurt a lot not the wound no though its sore ive a terrible headache though i shouldnt wonder hold on a bit im going to take the ball out not knowing in what condition we might find ian i had brought the smallest of my medical boxes which fortunately contained a bottle of alcohol and a small scalpel i shaved away a little of jamies abundant mane just below the swelling and soused the area with alcohol for disinfection my fingers were chilled from the alcohol but his head was warm and comfortingly live to the touch three deep breaths and hold on tight i murmured im going to cut you but it will be fast all right the back of his neck looked a little pale but the pulse was steady he obligingly drew in his breath deeply and exhaled sighing i held the area of scalp taut between the index and third fingers of my left hand on the third breath i said right now and drew the blade hard and quick across the scalp he grunted slightly but didnt cry out i pressed gently with my right thumb against the swelling slightly harderand the ball popped out of the incision i had made falling into my left hand like a grape got it i said and only then realized that i had been holding my breath i dropped the little pelletsomewhat flattened by its contact with his skullinto his hand and smiled a little shakily souvenir i said i pressed a pad of cloth against the small wound wound a strip of cloth round his head to hold it and then quite suddenly with no warning whatever began to cry i could feel the tears rolling down my face and my shoulders shaking but i felt still detached somehow outside my body i was conscious mostly of a mild amazement sassenach are ye all right jamie was peering up at me eyes worried under the rakish bandage yes i said stuttering from the force of my crying i ddont kknow why im ccrying i ddont know come here he took my hand and drew me down onto his knee he wrapped his arms around me and held me tight resting his cheek on the top of my head it will be all right he whispered its fine now mo chridhe its fine he rocked me gently one hand stroking my hair and neck and murmured small unimportant things in my ear just as suddenly as i had been detached i was back inside my body warm and shaking feeling the iron core dissolve in my tears gradually i stopped weeping and lay still against his chest hiccuping now and then feeling nothing but peace and the comfort of his presence i was dimly aware that lawrence and ian had returned but paid no attention to them at one point i heard ian say with more curiosity than alarm youre bleeding all down the back of your neck uncle jamie perhaps youll fix me a new bandage then ian jamie said his voice was soft and unconcerned i must just hold your auntie now and sometime later i went to sleep still held tight in the circle of his arms i woke up later curled on a blanket next to jamie he was leaning against a tree one hand resting on my shoulder he felt me wake and squeezed gently it was dark and i could hear a rhythmic snoring somewhere close at hand it must be lawrence i thought drowsily for i could hear young ians voice on the other side of jamie no he was saying slowly it wasna really so bad on the ship we were all kept together so there was company from the other lads and they fed us decently and let us out two at a time to walk about the deck of course we were all scairt for wed no notion why wed been takenand none of the sailors would tell us anythingbut we were not mistreated the bruja had sailed up the yallahs river and delivered her human cargo directly to rose hall here the bewildered boys had been warmly welcomed by mrs abernathy and promptly popped into a new prison the basement beneath the sugar mill had been fitted up comfortably enough with beds and chamber pots and aside from the noise of the sugarmaking above during the days it was comfortable enough still none of the boys could think why they were there though any number of suggestions were made each more improbable than the last and every now and then a great black fellow would come down into the place with mrs abernathy we always begged to know what it was we were there for and would she not be letting us go for mercys sake but she only smiled and patted us and said we would see in good time then she would choose a lad and the black fellow would clamp onto the lads arm and take him awa wi them ians voice sounded distressed and little wonder did the lads come back again jamie asked his hand patted me softly and i reached up and pressed it noor not usually and that scairt us all something dreadful ians turn had come eight weeks after his arrival three lads had gone and not returned by then and when mistress abernathys bright green eyes rested on him he was not disposed to cooperate i kicked the black fellow and hit himi even bit his hand ian said ruefully and verra nasty he tasted tooall over some kind of grease he was but it made nay difference he only clouted me over the head hard enough to make my ears ring then picked me up and carried me off in his arms as though i was no more than a wee bairn ian had been taken into the kitchen where he was stripped bathed dressed in a clean shirtbut nothing elseand taken to the main house it was just at night he said wistfully and all the windows lighted it looked verra much like lallybroch when ye come down from the hills just at dark and mams just lit the lampsit almost broke my heart to see it and think of home he had had little opportunity to feel homesick though herculesor atlashad marched him up the stairs into what was obviously mistress abernathys bedroom mrs abernathy was waiting for him dressed in a soft loose sort of gown with oddlooking figures embroidered round the hem of it in red and silver thread she had been cordial and welcoming and had offered him a drink it smelled strange but not nasty and as he had little choice in the matter he had drunk it there were two comfortable chairs in the room on either side of a long low table and a great bed at one side swagged and canopied like a kings he had sat in one chair mrs abernathy in the other and she had asked him questions what sorts of questions jamie asked prompting as ian seemed hesitant well all about my home and my familyshe asked the names of all my sisters and brothers and my aunts and unclesi jerked a bit so that was why geilie had betrayed no surprise at our appearanceand all sorts of things uncle then sheshe asked me had ihad i ever lain wi a lassie just as though she were asking did i have parritch to my breakfast ian sounded shocked at the memory i didna want to answer her but i couldna seem to help myself i felt verra warm like i was fevered and i couldna seem to move easy but i answered all her questions and her just sitting there pleasant as might be watching me close wi those big green eyes so ye told her the truth aye aye i did ian spoke slowly reliving the scene i said i had and i told her aboutabout edinburgh and the printshop and the seaman and the brothel and mary andeverything for the first time geilie had seemed displeased with one of his answers her face had grown hard and her eyes narrowed and for a moment ian was seriously afraid he would have run then but for the heaviness in his limbs and the presence of the giant who stood against the door unmoving she got up and stamped about a bit and said i was ruined then as i wasna a virgin and what business did a bittie wee lad like me have to be goin wi the lassies and spoiling myself then she had stopped her ranting poured a glass of wine and drank it off and her temper had seemed to cool she laughed then and looked at me careful and said as how i might not be such a loss after all if i was no good for what she had in mind perhaps i might have other uses ians voice sounded faintly constricted as though his collar were too tight jamie made a soothing interrogatory sound though and he took a deep breath determined to go on well sheshe took my hand and made me stand up then she took off the shirt i was wearing and shei swear its true uncleshe knelt on the floor in front of me and took my cock into her mouth jamies hand tightened on my shoulder but his voice betrayed no more than a mild interest aye i believe ye ian she made love to ye then love ian sounded dazed noi mean i dinna ken itshewell she got my cock to stand up and then she made me come to the bed and lie down and she did things but it wasna at all like it was with wee mary no i shouldna suppose it was his uncle said dryly god it felt queer i could sense ians shudder from the tone of his voice i looked up in the middle and there was the black man standing right by the bed holding a candlestick she told him to lift it higher so that she could see better he paused and i heard a small glugging noise as he drank from one of the bottles he let out a long quivering breath uncle have ye everlain wi a woman when ye didna want to do it jamie hesitated a moment his hand tight on my shoulder but then he said quietly aye ian i have oh the boy was quiet and i heard him scratch his head dye ken how it can be uncle how ye can do it and not want to a bit and hate doing it andand still itit feels good jamie gave a small dry laugh well what it comes to ian is that your cock hasna got a conscience and you have his hand left my shoulder as he turned toward his nephew dinna trouble yourself ian he said ye couldna help it and its likely that it saved your life for ye the other ladsthe ones who didna come back to the cellardye ken if they were virgins wella few i know were for surefor we had a great deal of time to talk aye and after a time we kent a lot about one another some o the lads boasted of havin gone wi a lassie but i thoughtfrom what they said about it ye kenthat they hadna done it really he paused for a moment as though reluctant to ask what he knew he must uncledye ken what happened to them the rest of the lads with me no ian jamie said evenly ive no notion he leaned back against the tree sighing deeply dye think ye can sleep wee ian if ye can ye should for it will be a weary walk to the shore tomorrow oh i can sleep uncle ian assured him but should i not keep watch its you should be resting after bein shot and all that he paused and then added rather shyly i didna say thank ye uncle jamie jamie laughed freely this time youre verra welcome ian he said the smile still in his voice lay your head and sleep laddie ill wake ye if theres need ian obligingly curled up and within moments was breathing heavily jamie sighed and leaned back against the tree do you want to sleep too jamie i pushed myself up to sit beside him im awake i can keep an eye out his eyes were closed the dying firelight dancing on the lids he smiled without opening them and groped for my hand no if ye dinna mind sitting with me for a bit though you can watch the headaches better if i close my eyes we sat in contented silence for some time hand in hand an occasional odd noise or faroff scream from some jungle animal came from the dark but nothing seemed threatening now will we go back to jamaica i asked at last for fergus and marsali jamie started to shake his head then stopped with a stifled groan no he said i think we shall sail for eleuthera thats dutchowned and neutral we can send innes back wi johns boatie and he can take a message to fergus to come and join us i would as soon not set foot on jamaica again all things considered no i suppose not i was quiet for a moment then said i wonder how mr willoughbyyi tien cho i meanwill manage i dont suppose anyone will find him if he stays in the mountains but oh he may manage brawly jamie interrupted hes the pelican to fish for him after all one side of his mouth turned up in a smile for that matter if hes canny hell find a way south to martinique theres a small colony there of chinese traders id told him of it said id take him there once our business on jamaica was finished you arent angry at him now i looked at him curiously but his face was smooth and peaceful almost unlined in the firelight this time he was careful not to move his head but lifted one shoulder in a shrug and grimaced och no he sighed and settled himself more comfortably i dinna suppose he had much thought for what he did or understood at all what might be the end of it and it would be foolish to hate a man for not giving ye something he hasna got in the first place he opened his eyes then with a faint smile and i knew he was thinking of john grey ian twitched in his sleep snorted loudly and rolled over onto his back arms flung wide jamie glanced at his nephew and the smile grew wider thank god he said he goes back to his mother by the first ship headed for scotland i dont know i said smiling he might not want to go back to lallybroch after all this adventure i dinna care whether he wants to or not jamie said firmly hes going if i must pack him up in a crate are ye looking for something sassenach he added seeing me groping in the dark ive got it i said pulling the flat hypodermic case out of my pocket i flipped it open to check the contents squinting to see by the waning light oh good theres enough left for one whopping dose jamie sat up a little straighter im not fevered a bit he said eyeing me warily and if ye have it in mind to shove that filthy spike into my head ye can just think again sassenach not you i said ian unless you mean to send him home to jenny riddled with syphilis and other interesting forms of the clap jamies eyebrows rose toward his hairline and he winced at the resultant sensation ow syphilis ye think so i shouldnt be a bit surprised pronounced dementia is one of the symptoms of the advanced diseasethough i must say it would be hard to tell in her case still better safe than sorry hm jamie snorted briefly with amusement well that may teach young ian the price o dalliance id best distract stern while ye take the lad behind a bush for his penance though lawrence is a bonny man for a jew but hes curious i dinna want ye burnt at the stake in kingston after all i expect that would be awkward for the governor i said dryly much as he might enjoy it personally i shouldna think he would sassenach his dryness matched my own is my coat within reach yes i found the garment folded on the ground near me and handed it to him are you cold no he leaned back the coat laid across his knees its only that i wanted to feel the bairns all close to me while i sleep he smiled at me folded his hands gently atop the coat and its pictures and closed his eyes again good night sassenach out of the depths in the morning buoyed by rest and a breakfast of biscuit and plantain we pressed on toward the shore in good hearteven ian who ceased to limp ostentatiously after the first quartermile as we came down the defile that led onto the beach though a remarkable sight met our eyes jesus god its them ian blurted the pirates he turned ready to flee back into the hills but jamie grasped him by the arm not pirates he said its the slaves look unskilled in the seamanship of large vessels the escaped slaves of the yallahs river plantations had evidently made a slow and blundering passage toward hispaniola and having somehow arrived at that island had promptly run the ship aground the bruja lay canted on her side in the shallows her keel sunk deep in the sandy mud a very agitated group of slaves surrounded her some rushing up and down the beach shouting others dashing off toward the refuge of the jungle a few remaining to help the last of their number off the beached hulk a quick glance out to sea showed the cause of their agitation a patch of white showed on the horizon growing in size even as we watched a manofwar lawrence said sounding interested jamie said something under his breath in gaelic and ian glanced at him shocked out of here jamie said tersely he pulled ian about and gave him a shove up the defile then grabbed my hand wait said lawrence shading his eyes theres another ship coming a little one the governor of jamaicas private pinnace to be exact leaning at a perilous angle as she shot round the curve of the bay her canvas bellied by the wind on her quarter jamie stood for a split second weighing the possibilities then grabbed my hand again lets go he said by the time we reached the edge of the beach the pinnaces small boat was plowing through the shallows raeburn and macleod pulling hard at the oars i was wheezing and gulping air my knees rubbery from the run jamie snatched me up bodily into his arms and ran into the surf followed by lawrence and ian gasping like whales i saw gordon a hundred yards out in the pinnaces bow aim a gun at the shore and knew we were followed the musket discharged with a puff of smoke and meldrum behind him promptly raised his own weapon and fired taking it in turns the two of them covered our splashing advance until friendly hands could pull us over the side and raise the boat come about innes manning the wheel barked the order and the boom swung across the sails filling at once jamie hauled me to my feet and deposited me on a bench then flung himself down beside me panting holy god he wheezed did i notell ye tostay awayduncan save your breath mac dubh innes said a wide grin spreading under his mustache ye havena enough to be wasting it he shouted something to macleod who nodded and did something to the lines the pinnace heeled over changed her course and came about headed straight out of the tiny coveand straight toward the manofwar now close enough for me to see the fatlipped porpoise grinning beneath its bowsprit macleod bellowed something in gaelic accompanied by a gesture that left the meaning of what he had said in no doubt to a triumphant yodel from innes we shot past the porpoise directly under her bow and close enough to see surprisedlooking heads poking out from the rail above i looked back as we left the cove to see the porpoise still heading in massive under her three great masts the pinnace could never outrace her on the open sea but in close quarters the little sloop was light and maneuverable as a feather by comparison to the leviathan manofwar its the slave ship theyll be after meldrum said turning to look alongside me we saw the manowar pick her up three miles off the island we thought whilst they were otherwise occupied we might as well nip in and pick ye all off the beach good enough jamie said with a smile his chest was still heaving but he had recovered his breath i hope the porpoise will be sufficiently occupied for the time being a warning shout from raeburn indicated that this was not to be however looking back i could see the gleam of brass on the porpoises deck as the pair of long guns called stern chasers were uncovered and began their process of aiming now it was us at gunpoint and i found the sensation very objectionable still we were moving and fast at that innes put the wheel hard over then hard again tacking a zigzag path past the headland the stern chasers boomed together there was a splash off the port bow twenty yards away but a good deal too close for comfort given the fact that a twentyfour pound ball through the floor of the pinnace would sink us like a rock innes cursed and hunched his shoulders over the wheel his missing arm giving him an odd lopsided appearance our course became still more erratic and the next three tries came nowhere near then came a louder boom and i looked back to see the side of the canted bruja erupt in splinters as the porpoise came in range and trained her forward guns on the grounded ship a rain of grapeshot hit the beach striking dead in the center of a group of fleeing slaves bodiesand parts of bodiesflew into the air like black stickfigures and fell to the sand staining it with red blotches severed limbs were scattered over the beach like driftwood holy mary mother of god ian white to the lips crossed himself staring in horror at the beach as the shelling went on two more shots struck the bruja opening up a great hole in her side several landed harmlessly in the sand and two more found their mark among the fleeing people then we were round the edge of the headland and heading into the open sea the beach and its carnage lost to view pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death ian finished his prayer in a whisper and crossed himself again there was little conversation in the boat beyond jamies giving innes instructions for eleuthera and a conference between innes and macleod as to the proper heading the rest of us were too appalled by what we had just seenand too relieved at our own escapeto want to talk the weather was fair with a bright brisk breeze and we made good way by sundown the island of hispaniola had dropped below the horizon and grand turk island was rising to the left i ate my small share of the available biscuit drank a cup of water and curled myself in the bottom of the boat lying down between ian and jamie to sleep innes yawning took his own rest in the bow while macleod and meldrum took it in turns to man the helm through the night a shout woke me in the morning i rose on one elbow blinking with sleep and stiff from a night spent on bare damp boards jamie was standing by me his hair blowing back in the morning breeze what i asked jamie what is it i dinna believe it he said staring aft over the rail its that bloody boat again i scrambled to my feet to find that it was true far astern were tiny white sails are you sure i said squinting can you tell at this distance i cant no jamie said frankly but innes and macleod can and they say its the bloodsucking english right enough theyll have guessed our heading maybe and come after us as soon as theyd dealt with those poor black buggers on hispaniola he turned away from the rail shrugging damned little to be done about it save to hope we stay ahead of them innes says theres a hope of giving them the slip off cat island if we reach there by dark as the day wore on we kept just out of firing distance but innes looked more and more worried the sea between cat island and eleuthera was shallow and filled with coral heads a manofwar could never follow us into the mazebut neither could we move swiftly enough through it to avoid being sunk by the porpoises long guns once in those treacherous shoals and channels we would be sitting ducks at last reluctantly the decision was made to head east out to sea we could not risk slowing and there was a slight chance of giving the manofwar the slip in the dark when dawn came all sight of land had disappeared the porpoise unfortunately had not she was no closer but as the wind rose along with the sun she shook out more sail and began to gain with every scrap of sail already hoisted and nowhere to hide there was nothing we could do but runand wait all through the long hours of the morning the porpoise grew steadily larger astern the sky had begun to cloud over and the wind had risen considerably but this helped the porpoise with her huge spread of canvas a great deal more than it did us by ten oclock she was close enough to risk a shot it fell far astern but was frightening nonetheless innes squinted back over his shoulder judging the distance then shook his head and settled grimly to his course there was nothing to be gained by tacking now we must head straight on as long as we could taking evasive action only when it was too late for anything else by eleven the porpoise had drawn within a quartermile and the monotonous boom of her forward guns had begun to sound every ten minutes as her gunner tried the range if i closed my eyes i could imagine erik johansen bent sweating and powderstained over his gun the smoking slowmatch in his hand i hoped that annekje had been left on antigua with her goats by eleventhirty it had begun to rain and a heavy sea was running a sudden gust of wind struck us sideways and the boat heeled over far enough to bring the port rail within a foot of the water dumped onto the deck by the motion we disentangled ourselves as innes and macleod skillfully righted the pinnace i glanced back as i did every few minutes despite myself and saw the seamen scampering aloft in the porpoise reefing the topsails thats luck macgregor shouted in my ear nodding where i was looking thatll slow them by twelvethirty the sky had gone a peculiar purplegreen and the wind had risen to an eerie whine the porpoise had taken in yet more canvas and in spite of the action had had a staysail carried away the scrap of canvas jerked from the mast and whipped away flapping like an albatross she had long since stopped firing on us unable to aim at such a small target in the heavy swell with the sun gone from sight i could no longer estimate time the storm caught us squarely perhaps an hour later there was no possibility of hearing anything by sign language and grimaces innes made the men lower the sails to keep canvas flying or even reefed was to risk having the mast ripped from the floorboards i clung tight to the rail with one hand to ians hand with the other jamie crouched behind us arms spread to give us the shelter of his back the rain lashed past hard enough to sting the skin driven almost horizontal by the wind and so thick that i barely saw the faint shape on the horizon that i thought was eleuthera the sea had risen to terrifying heights with swells rolling forty feet high the pinnace rode them lightly carried up and up and up to dizzy heights then dropped abruptly into a trough jamies face was dead white in the stormlight his sodden hair pasted against his scalp it was near dark that it happened the sky was nearly black but there was an eerie green glow all across the horizon that silhouetted the skeletal shape of the porpoise behind us another of the rain squalls slammed us sideways lurching and swaying atop a huge wave as we picked ourselves up from yet another bruising spill jamie grabbed my arm and pointed behind us the porpoises foremast was oddly bent the top of it leaning far to one side before i had time to realize what was happening the top fifteen feet of the mast had split off and pitched into the sea carrying with it rigging and spars the manofwar swung heavily round this impromptu anchor and came sliding sideways down the face of a wave the wall of water towered over the ship and came crashing down catching her broadside the porpoise heeled spun around once the next wave rose and took her stern first pulling the high aft deck below the water whipping the masts through the air like snapping twigs it took three more waves to sink her no time for escape for her hapless crew but plenty for those of us watching to share their terror there was a great bubbling flurry in the trough of a wave and the manofwar was gone jamies arm was rigid as iron beneath my hand all the men stared back faces gone empty with horror all save innes who crouched doggedly over the wheel meeting each wave as it came a new wave rose up beside the rail and seemed to hover there looming above me the great wall of water was glassy clear i could see suspended in it the debris and the men of the wrecked porpoise limbs outflung in grotesque ballet the body of thomas leonard hung no more than ten feet from me drowned mouth open in surprise his long soft hair aswirl above the gilded collar of his coat then the wave struck i was snatched off the deck and at once engulfed in chaos blind and deaf unable to breathe i was tumbled through space my arms and legs wrenched awry by the force of the water everything was dark there was nothing but sensation and all of that intense but indistinguishable pressure and noise and overwhelming cold i couldnt feel the pull of my clothing or the jerk of the ropeif it was still therearound my waist a sudden faint warmth swathed my legs distinct in the surrounding cold as a cloud in a clear sky urine i thought but didnt know whether it was my own or the last touch of another human body swallowed as i was in the belly of the wave my head hit something with a sickening crack and suddenly i was coughing my lungs out on the deck of the pinnace still miraculously afloat i sat up slowly choking and wheezing my rope was still in place yanked so tight about my waist that i was sure my lower ribs were broken i jerked feebly at it trying to breathe and then jamie was there one arm around me the other groping at his belt for a knife are ye all right he bellowed his voice barely audible above the shrieking wind no i tried to shout back but it came out as no more than a wheeze i shook my head fumbling at my waist the sky was a queer purplegreen a color i had never seen before jamie sawed at the rope his bent head spraysoaked and the color of mahogany hair whipped across his face by the fury of the wind the rope popped and i gulped in air ignoring a stabbing pain in my side and the stinging of raw skin about my waist the ship was pitching wildly the deck swinging up and down like a lawn glider jamie fell down on the deck pulling me with him and began to work his way on hands and knees toward the mast some six feet away dragging me my garments had been drenched through plastered to me from my immersion in the wave now the blast of the wind was so great that it plucked my skirts away from my legs and flung them up halfdried to beat about my face like goose wings jamies arm was tight as an iron bar across my chest i clung to him trying to aid our progress by shoving with my feet on the slippery deckboards smaller waves washed over the rail sousing us intermittently but no more huge monsters followed them reaching hands grasped us and hauled us the last few feet into the nominal shelter of the mast innes had tied the wheel over long since as i looked forward i saw lightning strike the sea ahead making the spokes of the wheel spring out black leaving an image like a spiders web printed on my retina speech was impossibleand unnecessary raeburn ian meldrum and lawrence were huddled against the mast all tied frightful as it was on deck no one wanted to go below to be tossed to and fro in bruising darkness with no notion of what was happening overhead i was sitting on the deck legs splayed with the mast at my back and the line passed across my chest the sky had gone leadgray on one side a deep lucent green on the other and lightning was striking at random over the surface of the sea bright jags of brilliance across the dark the wind was so loud that even the thunderclaps reached us only now and then as muffled booms like ships guns firing at a distance then a bolt crashed down beside the ship lightning and thunder together close enough to hear the hiss of boiling water in the ringing aftermath of the thunderclap the sharp reek of ozone flooded the air innes turned from the light his tall thin figure so sharply cut against the flash that he looked momentarily like a skeleton black bones against the sky the momentary dazzle and his movement made it seem for an instant that he stood whole once more two arms swinging as though his missing limb had emerged from the ghost world to join him here on the brink of eternity oh de headbone connected to deneckbone joe abernathys voice sang softly in memory and de neckbone connected to debackbone i had a sudden hideous vision of the scattered limbs i had seen on the beach by the corpse of the bruja animated by the lightning squirming and wriggling to reunite dem bones dem bones are gonna walk around now hear de word of de lawd another clap of thunder and i screamed not at the sound but at the lightning bolt of memory a skull in my hands with empty eyes that had once been the green of the hurricane sky jamie shouted something in my ear but i couldnt hear him i could only shake my head in speechless shock my skin rippling with horror my hair like my skirts was drying in the wind the strands of it danced on my head pulling at the roots as it dried i felt the crackle of static electricity where my hair brushed my cheek there was a sudden movement among the sailors around me and i looked up to see the spars and rigging above coated in the blue phosphorescence of st elmos fire a fireball dropped to the deck and rolled toward us streaming phosphorescence jamie struck at it and it hopped delicately into the air and rolled away along the rail leaving a scent of burning in its wake i looked up at jamie to see if he was all right and saw the loose ends of his hair standing out from his head coated with fire and streaming backward like a demons streaks of vivid blue outlined the fingers of his hand when he brushed the hair from his face then he looked down saw me and grasped my hand a jolt of electricity shot through us both with the touch but he didnt let go i couldnt say how long it lasted hours or days our mouths dried from the wind and grew sticky with thirst the sky went from gray to black but there was no telling whether it was night or only the coming of rain the rain when it did come was welcome it came with the drenching roar of a tropical shower a drumming audible even above the wind better yet it was hail not rain the hailstones hit my skull like pebbles but i didnt care i gathered the icy globules in both hands and swallowed them halfmelted a cool benison to my tortured throat meldrum and macleod crawled about the deck on hands and knees scooping the hailstones into buckets and pots anything that would hold water i slept intermittently head lolling on jamies shoulder and woke to find the wind still screaming numb to terror now i only waited whether we lived or died seemed of little consequence if only the dreadful noise would stop there was no telling day from night no way to keep time while the sun hid its face the darkness seemed a little lighter now and then but whether it was by virtue of daylight or moonlight i couldnt tell i slept and woke and slept again then i woke to find the wind a little quieter the seas still heaved and the tiny boat pitched like a cockleshell throwing us up and dropping us with stomachchurning regularity but the noise was less i could hear when macgregor shouted to ian to pass a cup of water the mens faces were chapped and raw their lips cracked to bleeding by the whistling wind but they were smiling its gone by jamies voice was low and husky in my ear rusted by weather the storms past it was there were breaks in the leadgray sky and small flashes of a pale fresh blue i thought it must be early morning sometime just past dawn but couldnt tell for sure while the hurricane had ceased to blow there was still a strong wind and the storm surge carried us at an amazing speed meldrum took the wheel from innes and bending to check the compass gave a cry of surprise the fireball that had come aboard during the storm had harmed no one but the compass was now a melted mass of silver metal the wooden casing around it untouched amazing said lawrence touching it reverently with one finger aye and inconvenient forbye said innes dryly he looked upward toward the ragged remnants of the dashing clouds much of a hand at celestial navigation are ye mr stern after much squinting at the rising sun and the remnants of the morning stars jamie innes and stern determined that our heading was roughly northeast we must turn to the west stern said leaning over the crude chart with jamie and innes we do not know where we are but any land must surely be to the west innes nodded peering soberly at the chart which showed a sprinkle of islands like coarseground pepper floating on the waters of the caribbean aye thats so he said weve been headed out to sea for god knows how long the hulls in one piece but thats all id say for it as for the mast and sailswell theyll maybe hold for a time he sounded dubious in the extreme god knows where we may fetch up though jamie grinned at him dabbing at a trickle of blood from his cracked lip so long as its land duncan im no verra choosy about where innes quirked an eyebrow at him a slight smile on his lips aye and here i thought yed settled for sure on a sailors life mac dubh yere sae canty on deck why ye havena puked once in the last twa days thats because i havena eaten anything in the last twa days jamie said wryly i dinna much care if the island we find first is english french spanish or dutch but i should be obliged if yed find one with food duncan innes wiped a hand across his mouth and swallowed painfully the mention of food made everyone salivate despite dry mouths ill do my best mac dubh he promised land its land the call came at last five days later in a voice rendered so hoarse by wind and thirst that it was no more than a faint croak but full of joy nonetheless i dashed up on deck to see my feet slipping on the ladder rungs everyone was hanging over the rail looking at the humped black shape on the horizon it was far off but undeniably land solid and distinct where do you think we are i tried to say but my voice was so hoarse the words came out in a tiny whisper and no one heard it didnt matter if we were headed straight for the naval barracks at antigua i didnt care the waves were running in huge smooth swells like the backs of whales the wind was gusting now and innes called for the helmsman to bring the bow another point nearer the wind i could see a line of large birds flying a stately procession skimming down the distant shoreline pelicans searching the shallows for fish with the sun gleaming on their wings i tugged at jamies sleeve and pointed at them look i began but got no further there was a sharp crack and the world exploded in black and fire i came to in the water dazed and halfchoked i floundered and fought in a world of dark green something was wrapped about my legs dragging me down i flailed wildly kicking to free my leg of the deadly grip something floated past my head and i grabbed for it wood blessed wood something to hold onto in the surging waves a dark shape sleeked by like a seal beneath the water and a red head bobbed up six feet away gasping hold on jamie said he reached me with two strokes and ducking under the piece of wood i held dived down i felt a tugging at my leg a sharp pain and then the dragging tension eased jamies head popped up again across the spar he grasped my wrists and hung there gulping air as the rolling swell carried us up and down i couldnt see the ship anywhere had it sunk a wave broke over my head and jamie disappeared temporarily i shook my head blinking and he was there again he smiled at me a savage grin of effort and his grip on my wrists tightened harder hold on he rasped again and i did the wood was harsh and splintery under my hands but i clung for all i was worth we drifted halfblinded by spray spinning like a bit of flotsam so that sometimes i saw the distant shore sometimes nothing but the open sea from which we had come and when the waves washed over us i saw nothing but water there was something wrong with my leg a strange numbness punctuated with flashes of sharp pain the vision of murphys peg and the razorgrin of an openmouthed shark drifted through my mind had my leg been taken by some toothy beast i thought of my tiny hoard of warm blood streaming from the stump of a bitten limb draining away into the cold vastness of the sea and i panicked trying to snatch my hand from jamies grasp in order to reach down and see for myself he snarled something unintelligible at me and held on to my wrists like grim death after a moment of frenzied thrashing reason returned and i calmed myself thinking that if my leg were indeed gone i would have lost consciousness by now at that i was beginning to lose consciousness my vision was growing gray at the edges and floating bright spots covered jamies face was i really bleeding to death or was it only cold and shock it hardly seemed to matter i thought muzzily the effect was the same a sense of lassitude and utter peace stole gradually over me i couldnt feel my feet or legs and only jamies crushing grip on my hands reminded me of their existence my head went under water and i had to remind myself to hold my breath the wave subsided and the wood rose slightly bringing my nose above water i breathed and my vision cleared slightly a foot away was the face of jamie fraser hair plastered to his head wet features contorted against the spray hold on he roared hold on god damn you i smiled gently barely hearing him the sense of great peace was lifting me carrying me beyond the noise and chaos there was no more pain nothing mattered another wave washed over me and this time i forgot to hold my breath the choking sensation roused me briefly long enough to see the flash of terror in jamies eyes then my vision went dark again damn you sassenach his voice said from a very great distance his voice was choked with passion damn you i swear if ye die on me ill kill you i was dead everything around me was a blinding white and there was a soft rushing noise like the wings of angels i felt peaceful and bodiless free of terror free of rage filled with quiet happiness then i coughed i wasnt bodiless after all my leg hurt it hurt a lot i became gradually aware that a good many other things hurt too but my left shin took precedence in no uncertain terms i had the distinct impression that the bone had been removed and replaced with a redhot poker at least the leg was demonstrably there when i cracked my eyes open to look the haze of pain that floated over my leg seemed almost visible though perhaps that was only a product of the general fuzziness in my head whether mental or physical in origin the general effect was of a sort of whirling whiteness shot with flickers of a brighter light watching it hurt my eyes so i shut them again thank god youre awake said a relievedsounding scottish voice near my ear no im not i said my own voice emerged as a saltcrusted croak rusty with swallowed seawater i could feel seawater in my sinuses too which gave my head an unpleasant gurgling feel i coughed again and my nose began to run profusely then i sneezed eugh i said in complete revulsion at the resultant cascade of slime over my upper lip my hand seemed far off and insubstantial but i made the effort to raise it swiping clumsily at my face be still sassenach ill take care of ye there was a definite note of amusement in the voice which irritated me enough to open my eyes again i caught a brief glimpse of jamies face intent on mine before vision vanished once again in the folds of an immense white handkerchief he wiped my face thoroughly ignoring my strangled noises of protest and impending suffocation then held the cloth to my nose blow he said i did as he said rather to my surprise it helped quite a lot i could think more or less coherently now that my head was unclogged jamie smiled down at me his hair was rumpled and stiff with dried salt and there was a wide abrasion on his temple an angry dark red against the bronzed skin he seemed not to be wearing a shirt but had a blanket of some kind draped about his shoulders do ye feel verra bad he asked horrible i croaked in reply i was also beginning to be annoyed at being alive after all and being required to take notice of things again hearing the rasp in my voice jamie reached for a jug of water on the table by my bed i blinked in confusion but it really was a bed not a berth or a hammock the linen sheets contributed to the overwhelming impression of whiteness that had first engulfed me this was reinforced by the whitewashed walls and ceiling and the long white muslin draperies that bellied in like sails rustling in the breeze from the open windows the flickering light came from reflections that shimmered over the ceiling apparently there was water close by outside and sun shining on it it seemed altogether cozier than davy joness locker still i felt a brief moment of intense regret for the sense of infinite peace i had experienced in the heart of the wavea regret made more keen by the slight movement that sent a bolt of white agony up my leg i think your leg is broken sassenach jamie told me unnecessarily ye likely shouldna move it much thanks for the advice i said through gritted teeth where in bloody hell are we he shrugged briefly i dinna ken its a fairsized house is all i could say i wasna taking much note when they brought us in one man said the place is called les perles he held the cup to my lips and i swallowed gratefully what happened so long as i was careful not to move the pain in my leg was bearable automatically i placed my fingers under the angle of my jaw to check my pulse reassuringly strong i wasnt in shock my leg couldnt be badly fractured much as it hurt jamie rubbed a hand over his face he looked very tired and i noticed that his hand trembled with fatigue there was a large bruise on his cheek and a line of dried blood where something had scratched the side of his neck the topmast snapped i think one of the spars fell and knocked ye overboard when ye hit the water ye sank like a stone and i dived in after you i got hold of youand the spar too thank god ye had a bit of rigging tangled round your leg dragging ye down but i managed to get that off he heaved a deep sigh and rubbed his head i just held to ye and after a time i felt sand under my feet i carried ye ashore and a bit later some men found us and brought us here thats all he shrugged i felt cold despite the warm breeze coming in through the windows what happened to the ship and the men ian lawrence safe i think they couldna reach us with the mast brokenby the time theyd rigged a makeshift sail we were long gone he coughed roughly and rubbed the back of his hand across his mouth but theyre safe the men who found us said theyd seen a small ketch go aground on a mud flat a quartermile south of here theyve gone down to salvage and bring back the men he took a swallow of water swished it about his mouth and going to the window spat it out ive sand in my teeth he said grimacing as he returned and my ears and my nose and the crack of my arse too i shouldna wonder i reached out and took his hand again his palm was heavily calloused but still showed the tender swelling of rising blisters with shreds of ragged skin and raw flesh where earlier blisters had burst and bled how long were we in the water i asked gently tracing the lines of his swollen palm the tiny c at the base of his thumb was faded almost to invisibility but i could still feel it under my finger just how long did you hold on long enough he said simply he smiled a little and held my hand more tightly despite the soreness of his own it dawned on me suddenly that i wasnt wearing anything the linen sheets were smooth and cool on my bare skin and i could see the swell of my nipples rising under the thin fabric what happened to my clothes i couldna hold ye up against the drag of your skirts so i ripped them off he explained what was left didna seem worth saving i dont suppose so i said slowly but jamiewhat about you wheres your coat he shrugged then let his shoulders drop and smiled ruefully at the bottom of the sea with my shoon i expect he said and the pictures of willie and brianna there too oh jamie im so sorry i reached for his hand and held it tightly he looked away and blinked once or twice aye well he said softly i expect i will remember them he shrugged again with a lopsided smile and if not i can look in the glass no i gave a laugh that was half a sob he swallowed painfully but went on smiling he glanced down at his tattered breeches then and seeming to think of something leaned back and worked a hand into the pocket i didna come away completely emptyhanded he said pulling a wry face though i would as soon it had been the pictures i kept and lost these he opened his hand and i saw the gleam and glitter in his ruined palm stones of the first quality cut and faceted suitable for magic an emerald a rubymale i supposeda great fiery opal a turquoise blue as the sky i could see out the window a golden stone like sun trapped in honey and the strange crystal purity of geilies black diamond you have the adamant i said touching it gently it was still cool to the touch in spite of being worn so close to his body i have he said but he was looking at me not at the stone a slight smile on his face what is it an adamant gives ye the knowledge of joy in all things so i was told i lifted my hand to his face and stroked it lightly feeling hard bone and lively flesh warm to the touch and joyful to behold above all things we have ian i said softly and each other aye thats true the smile reached his eyes then he dropped the stones in a glittering heap on the table and leaned back in his chair cradling my hand between his i relaxed feeling a warm peace begin to steal over me in spite of the aches and scrapes and the pain in my leg we were alive safe and together and very little else mattered surely not clothes nor a fractured tibia everything would be managed in timebut not now for now it was enough only to breathe and look at jamie we sat in a peaceful silence for some time watching the sunlit curtains and the open sky it might have been ten minutes later or as much as an hour when i heard the sound of light footsteps outside and a delicate rap at the door come in jamie said he sat up straighter but didnt let go of my hand the door opened and a woman stepped in her pleasant face lit by welcome tinged with curiosity good morning she said a little shyly i must beg your pardon not to have waited upon you before i was in the town and learned of yourarrivalshe smiled at the wordonly when i returned just now we must thank ye madame most sincerely for the kind treatment afforded to us jamie said he rose and bowed formally to her but kept hold of my hand your servant maam have ye word of our companions she blushed slightly and bobbed a curtsy in reply to his bow she was young only in her twenties and seemed unsure quite how to conduct herself under the circumstances she had light brown hair pulled back in a knot fair pink skin and what i thought was a faint west country accent oh yes she said my servants brought them back from the ship theyre in the kitchen now being fed thank you i said meaning it thats terribly kind of you she blushed rosily with embarrassment not at all she murmured then glanced shyly at me i must beg your pardon for my lack of manners maam she said i am remiss in not introducing myself i am patsy oliviermrs joseph olivier that is she looked expectantly from me to jamie clearly expecting reciprocation jamie and i exchanged a glance where exactly were we mrs olivier was english that was clear enough her husbands name was french the bay outside gave no clue this could be any of the windward islesbarbados the bahamas the exumas androseven the virgin islands orthe thought struck mewe might have been blown south by the hurricane and not north in which case this might even be antiguain the lap of the british navyor martinique or the grenadinesi looked at jamie and shrugged our hostess was still waiting glancing expectantly from one to the other of us jamie tightened his hold on my hand and drew a deep breath i trust ye willna think this an odd question mistress olivierbut could ye tell me where we are mrs oliviers brows rose to the edge of her widows peak and she blinked in astonishment wellyes she said we call it les perles thank you i put in seeing jamie taking breath to try again but what we mean iswhat island is this a broad smile of understanding broke out on her round pink face oh i see she said of course you were cast away by the storm my husband was saying last night that hed never seen such a dreadful blow at this time of year what a mercy it is that you were saved but you came from the islands to the south then the south this couldnt be cuba might we have come as far as st thomas or even florida we exchanged a quick glance and i squeezed jamies hand i could feel the pulse beating in his wrist mrs olivier smiled indulgently you are not on an island at all you are on the mainland in the colony of georgia georgia jamie said america he sounded slightly stunned and no wonder we had been blown at least six hundred miles by the storm america i said softly the new world the pulse beneath my fingers had quickened echoing my own a new world refuge freedom yes said mrs olivier plainly having no idea what the news meant to us but still smiling kindly from one to the other it is america jamie straightened his shoulders and smiled back at her the clean bright air stirred his hair like kindling flames in that case maam he said my name is jamie fraser he looked then at me eyes blue and brilliant as the sky behind him and his heart beat strong in the palm of my hand and this is claire he said my wife a hanging in eden charleston june i heard the drums long before they came in sight the beating echoed in the pit of my stomach as though i too were hollow the sound traveled through the crowd a harsh military rhythm meant to be heard over speech or gunfire i saw heads turn as the people fell silent looking up the stretch of east bay street where it ran from the halfbuilt skeleton of the new customs house toward white point gardens it was a hot day even for charleston in june the best places were on the seawall where the air moved here below it was like being roasted alive my shift was soaked through and the cotton bodice clung between my breasts i wiped my face for the tenth time in as many minutes and lifted the heavy coil of my hair hoping vainly for a cooling breeze upon my neck i was morbidly aware of necks at the moment unobtrusively i put my hand up to the base of my throat letting my fingers circle it i could feel the pulse beat in my carotid arteries along with the drums and when i breathed the hot wet air clogged my throat as though i were choking i quickly took my hand down and drew in a breath as deep as i could manage that was a mistake the man in front of me hadnt bathed in a month or more the edge of the stock about his thick neck was dark with grime and his clothes smelled sour and musty pungent even amid the sweaty reek of the crowd the smell of hot bread and frying pig fat from the food vendors stalls lay heavy over a musk of rotting seagrass from the marsh only slightly relieved by a whiff of saltbreeze from the harbor there were several children in front of me craning and gawking running out from under the oaks and palmettos to look up the street being called back by anxious parents the girl nearest me had a neck like the white part of a grass stalk slender and succulent there was a ripple of excitement through the crowd the gallows procession was in sight at the far end of the street the drums grew louder where is he fergus muttered beside me craning his own neck to see i knew i should have gone with him hell be here i wanted to stand on tiptoe but didnt feeling that this would be undignified i did glance around though searching i could always spot jamie in a crowd he stood head and shoulders above most men and his hair caught the light in a blaze of reddish gold there was no sign of him yet only a bobbing sea of bonnets and tricornes sheltering from the heat those citizens come too late to find a place in the shade the flags came first fluttering above the heads of the excited crowd the banners of great britain and of the royal colony of south carolina and another bearing the family arms of the lord governor of the colony then came the drummers walking two by two in step their sticks an alternate beat and blur it was a slow march grimly inexorable a dead march i thought they called that particular cadence very suitable under the circumstances all other noises were drowned by the rattle of the drums then came the platoon of redcoated soldiers and in their midst the prisoners there were three of them hands bound before them linked together by a chain that ran through rings on the iron collars about their necks the first man was small and elderly ragged and disreputable a shambling wreck who lurched and staggered so that the darksuited clergyman who walked beside the prisoners was obliged to grasp his arm to keep him from falling is that gavin hayes he looks sick i murmured to fergus hes drunk the soft voice came from behind me and i whirled to find jamie standing at my shoulder eyes fixed on the pitiful procession the small mans disequilibrium was disrupting the progress of the parade as his stumbling forced the two men chained to him to zig and zag abruptly in order to keep their feet the general impression was of three inebriates rolling home from the local tavern grossly at odds with the solemnity of the occasion i could hear the rustle of laughter over the drums and shouts and jeers from the crowds on the wroughtiron balconies of the houses on east bay street your doing i spoke quietly so as not to attract notice but i could have shouted and waved my arms no one had eyes for anything but the scene before us i felt rather than saw jamies shrug as he moved forward to stand beside me it was what he asked of me he said and the best i could manage for him brandy or whisky asked fergus evaluating hayes appearance with a practiced eye the mans a scot wee fergus jamies voice was as calm as his face but i heard the small note of strain in it whiskys what he wanted a wise choice with luck he wont even notice when they hang him fergus muttered the small man had slipped from the preachers grasp and fallen flat on his face in the sandy road pulling one of his companions to his knees the last prisoner a tall young man stayed on his feet but swayed wildly from side to side trying desperately to keep his balance the crowd on the point roared with glee the captain of the guard glowed crimson between the white of his wig and the metal of his gorget flushed with fury as much as with sun he barked an order as the drums continued their somber roll and a soldier scrambled hastily to remove the chain that bound the prisoners together hayes was jerked unceremoniously to his feet a soldier grasping each arm and the procession resumed in better order there was no laughter by the time they reached the gallowsa muledrawn cart placed beneath the limbs of a huge live oak i could feel the drums beating through the soles of my feet i felt slightly sick from the sun and the smells the drums stopped abruptly and my ears rang in the silence ye dinna need to watch it sassenach jamie whispered to me go back to the wagon his own eyes were fixed unblinkingly on hayes who swayed and mumbled in the soldiers grasp looking blearily around the last thing i wanted was to watch but neither could i leave jamie to see it through alone he had come for gavin hayes i had come for him i touched his hand ill stay jamie drew himself straighter squaring his shoulders he moved a pace forward making sure that he was visible in the crowd if hayes was still sober enough to see anything the last thing he saw on earth would be the face of a friend he could see hayes glared to and fro as they lifted him into the cart twisting his neck desperately looking gabhainn a charaid jamie shouted suddenly hayes eyes found him at once and he ceased struggling the little man stood swaying slightly as the charge was read theft in the amount of six pounds ten shillings he was covered in reddish dust and pearls of sweat clung trembling to the gray stubble of his beard the preacher was leaning close murmuring urgently in his ear then the drums began again in a steady roll the hangman guided the noose over the balding head and fixed it tight knot positioned precisely just under the ear the captain of the guard stood poised saber raised suddenly the condemned man drew himself up straight eyes on jamie he opened his mouth as though to speak the saber flashed in the morning sun and the drums stopped with a final thunk i looked at jamie he was white to the lips eyes fixed wide from the corner of my eye i could see the twitching rope and the faint reflexive jerk of the dangling sack of clothes a sharp stink of urine and feces struck through the thick air on my other side fergus watched dispassionately i suppose he noticed after all he murmured with regret the body swung slightly a dead weight oscillating like a plumbbob on its string there was a sigh from the crowd of awe and release terns squawked from the burning sky and the harbor sounds came faint and smothered through the heavy air but the point was wrapped in silence from where i stood i could hear the small plit plat plit of the drops that fell from the toe of the corpses dangling shoe i hadnt known gavin hayes and felt no personal grief for his death but i was glad it had been quick i stole a glance at him with an odd feeling of intrusion it was a most public way of accomplishing a most private act and i felt vaguely embarrassed to be looking the hangman had known his business there had been no undignified struggle no staring eyes no protruding tongue gavins small round head tilted sharply to the side neck grotesquely stretched but cleanly broken it was a clean break in more ways than one the captain of the guard satisfied that hayes was dead motioned with his saber for the next man to be brought to the gibbet i saw his eyes travel down the redclad file and then widen in outrage at the same moment there was a cry from the crowd and a ripple of excitement that quickly spread heads turned and people pushed each against his neighbor striving to see where there was nothing to be seen hes gone there he goes stop him it was the third prisoner the tall young man who had seized the moment of gavins death to run for his life sliding past the guard who should have been watching him but who had been unable to resist the gallows fascination i saw a flicker of movement behind a vendors stall a flash of dirty blond hair some of the soldiers saw it too and ran in that direction but many more were rushing in other directions and among the collisions and confusion nothing was accomplished the captain of the guard was shouting face purple his voice barely audible over the uproar the remaining prisoner looking stunned was seized and hustled back in the direction of the court of guard as the redcoats began hastily to sort themselves back into order under the lash of their captains voice jamie snaked an arm around my waist and dragged me out of the way of an oncoming wave of humanity the crowd fell back before the advance of squads of soldiers who formed up and marched briskly off to quarter the area under the grim and furious direction of their sergeant wed best find ian jamie said fending off a group of excited apprentices he glanced at fergus and jerked his head toward the gibbet and its melancholy burden claim the body aye well meet at the willow tree later do you think theyll catch him i asked as we pushed through the ebbing crowd threading our way down a cobbled lane toward the merchants wharves i expect so where can he go he spoke abstractedly a narrow line visible between his brows plainly the dead man was still on his mind and he had little attention to spare for the living did hayes have any family i asked he shook his head i asked him that when i brought him the whisky he thought he might have a brother left alive but no notion where the brother was transported soon after the risingto virginia hayes thought but hed heard nothing since not surprising if he hadnt an indentured laborer would have had no facilities for communicating with kin left behind in scotland unless the bondsmans employer was kind enough to send a letter on his behalf and kind or not it was unlikely that a letter would have found gavin hayes who had spent ten years in ardsmuir prison before being transported in his turn duncan jamie called out and a tall thin man turned and raised a hand in acknowledgment he made his way through the crowd in a corkscrew fashion his single arm swinging in a wide arc that fended off the passersby mac dubh he said bobbing his head in greeting to jamie mrs claire his long narrow face was furrowed with sadness he too had once been a prisoner at ardsmuir with hayes and with jamie only the loss of his arm to a blood infection had prevented his being transported with the others unfit to be sold for labor he had instead been pardoned and set free to starveuntil jamie had found him god rest poor gavin duncan said shaking his head dolorously jamie muttered something in response in gaelic and crossed himself then he straightened casting off the oppression of the day with a visible effort aye well i must go to the docks and arrange about ians passage and then well think of burying gavin but i must have the lad settled first we struggled through the crowd toward the docks squeezing our way between knots of excited gossipers eluding the drays and barrows that came and went through the press with the ponderous indifference of trade a file of redcoated soldiers came at the quickmarch from the other end of the quay splitting the crowd like vinegar dropped on mayonnaise the sun glittered hot on the line of bayonet points and the rhythm of their tramping beat through the noise of the crowd like a muffled drum even the rumbling sledges and handcarts stopped abruptly to let them pass by mind your pocket sassenach jamie murmured in my ear ushering me through a narrow space between a turbanclad slave clutching two small children and a street preacher perched on a box he was shouting sin and repentance but with only one word in three audible through the noise i sewed it shut i assured him nonetheless reaching to touch the small weight that swung against my thigh what about yours he grinned and tilted his hat forward dark blue eyes narrowing against the bright sunlight its where my sporran would be did i have one so long as i dinna meet with a quickfingered harlot im safe i glanced at the slightly bulging front of his breeches and then up at him broadshouldered and tall with bold clean features and a highlanders proud carriage he drew the glance of every woman he passed even with his bright hair covered by a sober blue tricorne the breeches which were borrowed were substantially too tight and did nothing whatever to detract from the general effectan effect enhanced by the fact that he himself was totally ignorant of it youre a walking inducement to harlots i said stick by me ill protect you he laughed and took my arm as we emerged into a small clear space ian he shouted catching sight of his nephew over the heads of the crowd a moment later a tall stringy gawk of a boy popped out of the crowd pushing a thatch of brown hair out of his eyes and grinning widely i thought i should never find ye uncle he exclaimed christ there are more folk here than at the lawnmarket in edinburgh he wiped a coat sleeve across his long halfhomely face leaving a streak of grime down one cheek jamie eyed his nephew askance yere lookin indecently cheerful ian for having just seen a man go to his death ian hastily altered his expression into an attempt at decent solemnity oh no uncle jamie he said i didna see the hanging duncan raised one brow and ian blushed slightly ii wasna afraid to see it was only i had something else i wanted to do jamie smiled slightly and patted his nephew on the back dont trouble yourself ian id as soon not have seen it myself only that gavin was a friend i know uncle im sorry for it a flash of sympathy showed in the boys large brown eyes the only feature of his face with any claim to beauty he glanced at me was it awful auntie yes i said its over though i pulled the damp handkerchief out of my bosom and stood on tiptoe to rub away the smudge on his cheek duncan innes shook his head sorrowfully aye poor gavin still its a quicker death than starving and there was little left for him but that lets go jamie interrupted unwilling to spend time in useless lamenting the bonnie mary should be near the far end of the quay i saw ian glance at jamie and draw himself up as though about to speak but jamie had already turned toward the harbor and was shoving his way through the crowd ian glanced at me shrugged and offered me an arm we followed jamie behind the warehouses that lined the docks sidestepping sailors loaders slaves passengers customers and merchants of all sorts charleston was a major shipping port and business was booming with as many as a hundred ships a month coming and going from europe in the season the bonnie mary belonged to a friend of jamies cousin jared fraser who had gone to france to make his fortune in the wine business and succeeded brilliantly with luck the bonnie marys captain might be persuaded for jareds sake to take ian with him back to edinburgh allowing the boy to work his passage as a cabin lad ian was not enthused at the prospect but jamie was determined to ship his errant nephew back to scotland at the earliest opportunity it wasamong other concernsnews of the bonnie marys presence in charleston that had brought us here from georgia where we had first set foot in americaby accidenttwo months before as we passed a tavern a slatternly barmaid came out with a bowl of slops she caught sight of jamie and stood bowl braced against her hip giving him a slanted brow and a pouting smile he passed without a glance intent on his goal she tossed her head flung the slops to the pig who slept by the step and flounced back inside he paused shading his eyes to look down the row of towering ships masts and i came up beside him he twitched unconsciously at the front of his breeches easing the fit and i took his arm family jewels still safe are they i murmured uncomfortable but safe he assured me he plucked at the lacing of his flies grimacing i would ha done better to hide them up my bum i think better you than me mate i said smiling id rather risk robbery myself the family jewels were just that we had been driven ashore on the coast of georgia by a hurricane arriving soaked ragged and destitutesave for a handful of large and valuable gemstones i hoped the captain of the bonnie mary thought highly enough of jared fraser to accept ian as a cabin boy because if not we were going to have a spot of difficulty about the passage in theory jamies pouch and my pocket contained a sizable fortune in practice the stones might have been beach pebbles so far as the good they were to us while gems were an easy compact way of transporting wealth the problem was changing them back into money most trade in the southern colonies was conducted by means of barterwhat wasnt was handled by the exchange of scrip or bills written on a wealthy merchant or banker and wealthy bankers were thin on the ground in georgia those willing to tie up their available capital in gemstones rarer still the prosperous rice farmer with whom we had stayed in savannah had assured us that he himself could scarcely lay his hand on two pounds sterling in cashindeed there was likely not ten pounds in gold and silver to be had in the whole colony nor was there any chance of selling one of the stones in the endless stretches of salt marsh and pine forest through which we had passed on our journey north charleston was the first city we had reached of sufficient size to harbor merchants and bankers who might help to liquidate a portion of our frozen assets not that anything was likely to stay frozen long in charleston in summer i reflected rivulets of sweat were running down my neck and the linen shift under my bodice was soaked and crumpled against my skin even so close to the harbor there was no wind at this time of day and the smells of hot tar dead fish and sweating laborers were nearly overwhelming despite their protestations jamie had insisted on giving one of our gemstones to mr and mrs olivier the kindly people who had taken us in when we were shipwrecked virtually on their doorstep as some token of thanks for their hospitality in return they had provided us with a wagon two horses fresh clothes for traveling food for the journey north and a small amount of money of this six shillings and threepence remained in my pocket constituting the entirety of our disposable fortune this way uncle jamie ian said turning and beckoning his uncle eagerly ive got something to show ye what is it jamie asked threading his way through a throng of sweating slaves who were loading dusty bricks of dried indigo into an anchored cargo ship and how did ye get whatever it is ye havena got any money have you no i won it dicing ians voice floated back his body invisible as he skipped around a cartload of corn dicing ian for gods sake ye canna be gambling when yeve not a penny to bless yourself with holding my arm jamie shoved a way through the crowd to catch up to his nephew you do it all the time uncle jamie the boy pointed out pausing to wait for us yeve been doing it in every tavern and inn where weve stayed my god ian thats cards not dice and i know what im doing so do i said ian looking smug i won no jamie rolled his eyes toward heaven imploring patience jesus ian but im glad youre going home before ye get your head beaten in promise me ye willna be gambling wi the sailors aye ye canna get away from them on a ship ian was paying no attention he had come to a halfcrumbled piling around which was tied a stout rope here he stopped and turned to face us gesturing at an object by his feet see its a dog ian said proudly i took a quick halfstep behind jamie grabbing his arm ian i said that is not a dog its a wolf its a bloody big wolf and i think you ought to get away from it before it takes a bite out of your arse the wolf twitched one ear negligently in my direction dismissed me and twitched it back it continued to sit panting with the heat its big yellow eyes fixed on ian with an intensity that might have been taken for devotion by someone who hadnt met a wolf before i had those things are dangerous i said theyd bite you as soon as look at you disregarding this jamie stooped to inspect the beast its not quite a wolf is it sounding interested he held out a loose fist to the socalled dog inviting it to smell his knuckles i closed my eyes expecting the imminent amputation of his hand hearing no shrieks i opened them again to find him squatting on the ground peering up the animals nostrils hes a handsome creature ian he said scratching the thing familiarly under the chin the yellow eyes narrowed slightly either in pleasure at the attention ormore likely i thoughtin anticipation of biting off jamies nose bigger than a wolf though its broader through the head and chest and a deal longer in the leg his mother was an irish wolfhound ian was hunkered down by jamie eagerly explaining as he stroked the enormous graybrown back she got out in heat into the woods and when she came back in whelp oh aye i see now jamie was crooning in gaelic to the monster while he picked up its huge foot and fondled its hairy toes the curved black claws were a good two inches long the thing half closed its eyes the faint breeze ruffling the thick fur at its neck i glanced at duncan who arched his eyebrows at me shrugged slightly and sighed duncan didnt care for dogs jamie i said balach boidheach jamie said to the wolf are ye no the bonny laddie then what would he eat i asked somewhat more loudly than necessary jamie stopped caressing the beast oh he said he looked at the yelloweyed thing with some regret well he rose to his feet shaking his head reluctantly im afraid your aunties right ian how are we to feed him oh thats no trouble uncle jamie ian assured him he hunts for himself here i glanced around at the warehouses and the stuccoed row of shops beyond what does he hunt small children ian looked mildly hurt of course not auntie fish seeing three skeptical faces surrounding him ian dropped to his knees and grabbed the beasts muzzle in both hands prying his mouth open he does i swear uncle jamie here just smell his breath jamie cast a dubious glance at the double row of impressively gleaming fangs on display and rubbed his chin iah i shall take your word for it ian but even sofor christs sake be careful of your fingers lad ians grip had loosened and the massive jaws clashed shut spraying droplets of saliva over the stone quay im all right uncle ian said cheerfully wiping his hand on his breeks he wouldnt bite me im sure his name is rollo jamie rubbed his knuckles across his upper lip mmphm well whatever his name is and whatever he eats i dinna think the captain of the bonnie mary will take kindly to his presence in the crews quarters ian didnt say anything but the look of happiness on his face didnt diminish in fact it grew jamie glanced at him caught sight of his glowing face and stiffened no he said in horror oh no yes said ian a wide smile of delight split his bony face she sailed three days ago uncle were too late jamie said something in gaelic that i didnt understand duncan looked scandalized damn jamie said reverting to english bloody damn jamie took off his hat and rubbed a hand over his face hard he looked hot disheveled and thoroughly disgruntled he opened his mouth thought better of whatever he had been going to say closed it and ran his fingers roughly through his hair jerking loose the ribbon that tied it back ian looked abashed im sorry uncle ill try not to be a worry to ye truly i will and i can work ill earn enough for my food jamies face softened as he looked at his nephew he sighed deeply and patted ians shoulder its not that i dinna want ye ian you know i should like nothing better than to keep ye with me but what in hell will your mother say the glow returned to ians face i dinna ken uncle he said but shell be saying it in scotland wont she and were here he put his arms around rollo and hugged him the wolf seemed mildly taken aback by the gesture but after a moment put out a long pink tongue and daintily licked ians ear testing him for flavor i thought cynically besides the boy added she kens well enough that im safe you wrote from georgia to say i was with you jamie summoned a wry smile i canna say that that particular bit of knowledge will be owercomforting to her ian shes known me a long time aye he sighed and clapped the hat back on his head and turned to me i badly need a drink sassenach he said lets find that tavern the willow tree was dark and might have been cool had there been fewer people in it as it was the benches and tables were crowded with sightseers from the hanging and sailors from the docks and the atmosphere was like a sweatbath i inhaled as i stepped into the taproom then let my breath out fast it was like breathing through a wad of soiled laundry soaked in beer rollo at once proved his worth parting the crowd like the red sea as he stalked through the taproom lips drawn back from his teeth in a constant inaudible growl he was evidently no stranger to taverns having satisfactorily cleared out a corner bench he curled up under the table and appeared to go to sleep out of the sun with a large pewter mug of dark ale foaming gently in front of him jamie quickly regained his normal selfpossession weve the two choices he said brushing back the sweatsoaked hair from his temples we can stay in charleston long enough to maybe find a buyer for one of the stones and perhaps book passage for ian to scotland on another ship or we can make our way north to cape fear and maybe find a ship for him out of wilmington or new bern i say north duncan said without hesitation yeve kin in cape fear no i mislike the thought of staying owerlong among strangers and your kinsman would see we were not cheated nor robbed here he lifted one shoulder in eloquent indication of the unscottishand thus patently dishonestpersons surrounding us oh do lets go north uncle ian said quickly before jamie could reply to this he wiped away a small mustache of ale foam with his sleeve the journey might be dangerous youll need an extra man along for protection aye jamie buried his expression in his own cup but i was seated close enough to feel a subterranean quiver go through him jamie was indeed very fond of his nephew the fact remained that ian was the sort of person to whom things happened usually through no fault of his own but still they happened the boy had been kidnapped by pirates the year before and it was the necessity of rescuing him that had brought us by circuitous and often dangerous means to america nothing had happened recently but i knew jamie was anxious to get his fifteenyearold nephew back to scotland and his mother before something did ah to be sure ian jamie said lowering his cup he carefully avoided meeting my gaze but i could see the corner of his mouth twitching yed be a great help im sure but we might meet with red indians ian said eyes wide his face already a rosy brown from the sun glowed with a flush of pleasurable anticipation or wild beasts dr stern told me that the wilderness of carolina is alive wi fierce creaturesbears and wildcats and wicked panthersand a great foul thing the indians call a skunk i choked on my ale are ye all right auntie ian leaned anxiously across the table fine i wheezed wiping my streaming face with my kerchief i blotted the drops of spilled ale off my bosom pulling the fabric of my bodice discreetly away from my flesh in hopes of admitting a little air then i caught a glimpse of jamies face on which the expression of suppressed amusement had given way to a small frown of concern skunks arent dangerous i murmured laying a hand on his knee a skilled and fearless hunter in his native highlands jamie was inclined to regard the unfamiliar fauna of the new world with caution mmphm the frown eased but a narrow line remained between his brows maybe so but what of the other things i canna say i wish to be meeting a bear or a pack o savages wi only this to hand he touched the large sheathed knife that hung from his belt our lack of weapons had worried jamie considerably on the trip from georgia and ians remarks about indians and wild animals had brought the concern to the forefront of his mind once more besides jamies knife fergus bore a smaller blade suitable for cutting rope and trimming twigs for kindling that was the full extent of our armorythe oliviers had had neither guns nor swords to spare on the journey from georgia to charleston we had had the company of a group of rice and indigo farmersall bristling with knives pistols and musketsbringing their produce to the port to be shipped north to pennsylvania and new york if we left for cape fear now we would be alone unarmed and essentially defenseless against anything that might emerge from the thick forests at the same time there were pressing reasons to travel north our lack of available capital being one cape fear was the largest settlement of scottish highlanders in the american colonies boasting several towns whose inhabitants had emigrated from scotland during the last twenty years following the upheaval after culloden and among these emigrants were jamies kin who i knew would willingly offer us refuge a roof a bed and time to establish ourselves in this new world jamie took another drink and nodded at duncan i must say im of your mind duncan he leaned back against the wall of the tavern glancing casually around the crowded room dye no feel the eyes on your back a chill ran down my own back despite the trickle of sweat doing likewise duncans eyes widened fractionally then narrowed but he didnt turn around ah he said whose eyes i asked looking rather nervously around i didnt see anyone taking particular notice of us though anyone might be watching surreptitiously the tavern was seething with alcoholsoaked humanity and the babble of voices was loud enough to drown out all but the closest conversation anyones sassenach jamie answered he glanced sideways at me and smiled dinna look so scairt about it aye were in no danger not here not yet innes said he leaned forward to pour another cup of ale mac dubh called out to gavin on the gallows dye see there will be those who took noticemac dubh bein the bittie wee fellow he is he added dryly and the farmers who came with us from georgia will have sold their stores by now and be takin their ease in places like this jamie said evidently absorbed in studying the pattern of his cup all of them are honest menbut theyll talk sassenach it makes a good story no the folk cast away by the hurricane and what are the chances that at least one of them kens a bit about what we carry i see i murmured and did we had attracted public interest by our association with a criminal and could no longer pass as inconspicuous travelers if finding a buyer took some time as was likely we risked inviting robbery from unscrupulous persons or scrutiny from the english authorities neither prospect was appealing jamie lifted his cup and drank deeply then set it down with a sigh no i think its perhaps not wise to linger in the city well see gavin buried decently and then well find a safe spot in the woods outside the town to sleep tomorrow we can decide whether to stay or go the thought of spending several more nights in the woodswith or without skunkswas not appealing i hadnt taken my dress off in eight days merely rinsing the outlying portions of my anatomy whenever we paused in the vicinity of a stream i had been looking forward to a real bed even if fleainfested and a chance to scrub off the grime of the last weeks travel still he had a point i sighed ruefully eyeing the hem of my sleeve gray and grubby with wear the tavern door flung suddenly open at this point distracting me from my contemplation and four redcoated soldiers shoved their way into the crowded room they wore full uniform held muskets with bayonets fixed and were obviously not in pursuit of ale or dice two of the soldiers made a rapid circuit of the room glancing under tables while another disappeared into the kitchen beyond the fourth remained on watch by the door pale eyes flicking over the crowd his gaze lighted on our table and rested on us for a moment full of speculation but then passed on restlessly seeking jamie was outwardly tranquil sipping his ale in apparent obliviousness but i saw the hand in his lap clench slowly into a fist duncan less able to control his feelings bent his head to hide his expression neither man would ever feel at ease in the presence of a red coat and for good reason no one else appeared much perturbed by the soldiers presence the little knot of singers in the chimney corner went on with an interminable version of fill every glass and a loud argument broke out between the barmaid and a pair of apprentices the soldier returned from the kitchen having evidently found nothing stepping rudely through a dice game on the hearth he rejoined his fellows by the door as the soldiers shoved their way out of the tavern ferguss slight figure squeezed in pressing against the doorjamb to avoid swinging elbows and musket butts i saw one soldiers eyes catch the glint of metal and fasten with interest on the hook fergus wore in replacement of his missing left hand he glanced sharply at fergus but then shouldered his musket and hurried after his companions fergus shoved through the crowd and plopped down on the bench beside ian he looked hot and irritated bloodsucking salaud he said without preamble jamies brows went up the priest fergus elaborated he took the mug ian pushed in his direction and drained it lean throat glugging until the cup was empty he lowered it exhaled heavily and sat blinking looking noticeably happier he sighed and wiped his mouth he wants ten shillings to bury the man in the churchyard he said an anglican church of course there are no catholic churches here wretched usurer he knows we have no choice about it the body will scarcely keep till sunset as it is he ran a finger inside his stock pulling the sweatwilted cotton away from his neck then banged his fist several times on the table to attract the attention of the servingmaid who was being run off her feet by the press of patrons i told the superfatted son of a pig that you would decide whether to pay or not we could just bury him in the wood after all though we should have to purchase a shovel he added frowning these grasping townsfolk know we are strangers theyll take our last coin if they can last coin was perilously close to the truth i had enough to pay for a decent meal here and to buy food for the journey north perhaps enough to pay for a couple of nights lodging that was all i saw jamies eyes flick round the room assessing the possibilities of picking up a little money at hazard or loo soldiers and sailors were the best prospects for gambling but there were few of either in the taproomlikely most of the garrison was still searching the town for the fugitive in one corner a small group of men was being loudly convivial over several pitchers of brandywine two of them were singing or trying to their attempts causing great hilarity among their comrades jamie gave an almost imperceptible nod at sight of them and turned back to fergus what have ye done with gavin for the time being jamie asked fergus hunched one shoulder put him in the wagon i traded the clothes he was wearing to a ragwoman for a shroud and she agreed to wash the body as part of the bargain he gave jamie a faint smile dont worry milord hes seemly for now he added lifting the fresh mug of ale to his lips poor gavin duncan innes lifted his own mug in a half salute to his fallen comrade slàinte jamie replied and lifted his own mug in reply he set it down and sighed he wouldna like being buried in the wood he said why not i asked curious i shouldnt think it would matter to him one way or the other oh no we couldna do that mrs claire duncan was shaking his head emphatically duncan was normally a most reserved man and i was surprised at so much apparent feeling he was afraid of the dark jamie said softly i turned to stare at him and he gave me a lopsided smile i lived wi gavin hayes nearly as long as ive lived with you sassenachand in much closer quarters i kent him well aye he was afraid of being alone in the dark duncan chimed in he was most mortally scairt of tannagachof spirits aye his long mournful face bore an inward look and i knew he was seeing in memory the prison cell that he and jamie had shared with gavin hayesand with forty other menfor three long years dye recall mac dubh how he told us one night of the tannasq he met i do duncan and could wish i did not jamie shuddered despite the heat i kept awake myself half the night after he told us that one what was it uncle ian was leaning over his cup of ale roundeyed his cheeks were flushed and streaming and his stock crumpled with sweat jamie rubbed a hand across his mouth thinking ah well it was a time in the late cold autumn in the highlands just when the season turns and the feel of the air tells ye the ground will be shivered wi frost come dawn he said he settled himself in his seat and sat back alecup in hand he smiled wryly plucking at his own throat not like now aye well gavins son brought back the kine that night but there was one beast missingthe lad had hunted up the hills and down the corries but couldna find it anywhere so gavin set the lad to milk the two others and set out himself to look for the lost cow he rolled the pewter cup slowly between his hands staring down into the dark ale as though seeing in it the bulk of the nightblack scottish peaks and the mist that floats in the autumn glens he went some distance and the cot behind him disappeared when he looked back he couldna see the light from the window anymore and there was no sound but the keening of the wind it was cold but he went on tramping through the mud and the heather hearing the crackle of ice under his boots he saw a small grove through the mist and thinking the cow might have taken shelter beneath the trees he went toward it he said the trees were birches standing there all leafless but with their branches grown together so he must bend his head to squeeze beneath the boughs he came into the grove and saw it was not a grove at all but a circle of trees there were great tall trees spaced verra evenly all around him and smaller ones saplings grown up between to make a wall of branches and in the center of the circle stood a cairn hot as it was in the tavern i felt as though a sliver of ice had slid melting down my spine i had seen ancient cairns in the highlands myself and found them eerie enough in the broad light of day jamie took a sip of ale and wiped away a trickle of sweat that ran down his temple he felt quite queer did gavin for he kent the placeeveryone did and kept well away from it it was a strange place and it seemed even worse in the dark and the cold from what it did in the light of day it was an auld cairn the kind laid wi slabs of rock all heaped round with stones and he could see before him the black opening of the tomb he knew it was a place no man should come and he without a powerful charm gavin had naught but a wooden cross about his neck so he crossed himself with it and turned to go jamie paused to sip his ale but as gavin went from the grove he said softly he heard footsteps behind him i saw the adams apple bob in ians throat as he swallowed he reached mechanically for his own cup eyes fixed on his uncle he didna turn to see jamie went on but kept walking and the steps kept pace wi him step by step always following and he came through the peat where the water seeps up and it was crusted with ice the weather bein so cold he could hear the peat crackle under his feet and behind him the crack crack of breaking ice he walked and he walked through the cold dark night watching ahead for the light of his own window where his wife had set the candle but the light never showed and he began to fear he had lost his way among the heather and the dark hills and all the time the steps kept pace with him loud in his ears at last he could bear it no more and seizing hold of the crucifix he wore round his neck he swung about wi a great cry to face whatever followed what did he see ians pupils were dilated dark with drink and wonder jamie glanced at the boy and then at duncan nodding at him to take up the story he said it was a figure like a man but with no body duncan said quietly all white like as it might have been made of the mist but wi great holes where its eyes should be and empty black fit to draw the soul from his body with dread but gavin held up his cross before his face and he prayed aloud to the blessed virgin jamie took up the story leaning forward intently the dim firelight outlining his profile in gold and the thing came no nearer but stayed there watching him and so he began to walk backward not daring to face round again he walked backward stumbling and slipping fearing every moment as he might tumble into a burn or down a cliff and break his neck but fearing worse to turn his back on the cold thing he couldna tell how long hed walked only that his legs were trembling wi weariness when at last he caught a glimpse of light through the mist and there was his own cottage wi the candle in the window he cried out in joy and turned to his door but the cold thing was quick and slippit past him to stand betwixt him and the door his wife had been watching out for him and when she heard him cry out she came at once to the door gavin shouted to her not to come out but for gods sake to fetch a charm to drive away the tannasq quick as thought she snatched the pot from beneath her bed and a twig of myrtle bound wi red thread and black that shed made to bless the cows she dashed the water against the doorposts and the cold thing leapt upward astride the lintel gavin rushed in beneath and barred the door and stayed inside in his wifes arms until the dawn they let the candle burn all the night and gavin hayes never again left his house past sunsetuntil he went to fight for prince tearlach even duncan who knew the tale sighed as jamie finished speaking ian crossed himself then looked about selfconsciously but no one seemed to have noticed so now gavin has gone into the dark jamie said softly but we willna let him lie in unconsecrated ground did they find the cow fergus asked with his usual practicality jamie quirked one eyebrow at duncan who answered oh aye they did the next morning they found the poor beast wi her hooves all clogged wi mud and stones staring mad and lathered about the muzzle and her sides heavin fit to burst he glanced from me to ian and back to fergus gavin did say he said precisely that she looked as though shed been ridden to hell and back jesus ian took a deep gulp of his ale and i did the same in the corner the drinking society was making attempts on a round of captain thunder breaking down each time in helpless laughter ian put down his cup on the table what happened to them he asked his face troubled to gavins wife and his son jamies eyes met mine and his hand touched my thigh i knew without being told what had happened to the hayes family without jamies own courage and intransigence the same thing would likely have happened to me and to our daughter brianna gavin never knew jamie said quietly he never heard aught of his wifeshe will have been starved maybe or driven out to die of the cold his son took the field beside him at culloden whenever a man who had fought there came into our cell gavin would askhave ye maybe seen a bold lad named archie hayes about so tall he measured automatically five feet from the floor capturing hayes gesture a lad about fourteen hed say wi a green plaidie and a small gilt brooch but no one ever came who had seen him for sureeither seen him fall or seen him run away safe jamie took a sip of the ale his eyes fixed on a pair of british officers who had come in and settled in the corner it had grown dark outside and they were plainly off duty their leather stocks were unfastened on account of the heat and they wore only sidearms glinting under their coats nearly black in the dim light save where the firelight touched them with red sometimes he hoped the lad might have been captured and transported he said like his brother surely that would be somewhere in the records i said did theydo theykeep lists they did jamie said still watching the soldiers a small bitter smile touched the corner of his mouth it was such a list that saved me after culloden when they asked my name before shooting me so as to add it to their roll but a man like gavin would have no way to see the english deadlists and if he could have found out i think he would not he glanced at me would you choose to know for sure and it was your child i shook my head and he gave me a faint smile and squeezed my hand our child was safe after all he picked up his cup and drained it then beckoned to the serving maid the girl brought the food skirting the table widely in order to avoid rollo the beast lay motionless under the table his head protruding into the room and his great hairy tail lying heavily across my feet but his yellow eyes were wide open watching everything they followed the girl intently and she backed nervously away keeping an eye on him until she was safely out of biting distance seeing this jamie cast a dubious look at the socalled dog is he hungry must i ask for a fish for him oh no uncle ian reassured him rollo catches his own fish jamies eyebrows shot up but he only nodded and with a wary glance at rollo took a platter of roasted oysters from the tray ah the pity of it duncan innes was quite drunk by now he sat slumped against the wall his armless shoulder riding higher than the other giving him a strange hunchbacked appearance that a dear man like gavin should come to such an end he shook his head lugubriously swinging it back and forth over his alecup like the clapper of a funeral bell no family left to mourn him cast alone into a savage landhanged as a felon and to be buried in an unconsecrated grave not even a proper lament to be sung for him he picked up the cup and with some difficulty found his mouth with it he drank deep and set it down with a muffled clang well he shall have a caithris he glared belligerently from jamie to fergus to ian why not jamie wasnt drunk but he wasnt completely sober either he grinned at duncan and lifted his own cup in salute why not indeed he said only it will have to be you singin it duncan none of the rest knew gavin and im no singer ill shout along wi ye though duncan nodded magisterially bloodshot eyes surveying us without warning he flung back his head and emitted a terrible howl i jumped in my seat spilling half a cup of ale into my lap ian and fergus who had evidently heard gaelic laments before didnt turn a hair all over the room benches were shoved back as men leapt to their feet in alarm reaching for their pistols the barmaid leaned out of the serving hatch eyes big rollo came awake with an explosive woof and glared round wildly teeth bared tha sinn cruinn a chaoidh ar caraid gabhainn hayes duncan thundered in a ragged baritone i had just about enough gaelic to translate this as we are met to weep and cry out to heaven for the loss of our friend gavin hayes eisd ris jamie chimed in rugadh e do sheumas immanuel hayes agus louisa nic a liallainn an am baile chillmhartainn ann an sgire dhun domhnuill anns a bhliadhnaseachd ceud deug agus a haon he was born of seaumais emmanuel hayes and of louisa maclellan in the village of kilmartin in the parish of dodanil in the year of our lord seventeen hundred and one eisd ris this time fergus and ian joined in on the chorus which i translated roughly as hear him rollo appeared not to care for either verse or refrain his ears lay flat against his skull and his yellow eyes narrowed to slits ian scratched his head in reassurance and he lay down again muttering wolf curses under his breath the audience having caught on to it that no actual violence threatened and no doubt bored with the inferior vocal efforts of the drinking society in the corner settled down to enjoy the show by the time duncan had worked his way into an accounting of the names of the sheep gavin hayes had owned before leaving his croft to follow his laird to culloden many of those at the surrounding tables were joining enthusiastically in the chorus shouting eisd ris and banging their mugs on the tables in perfect ignorance of what was being said and a good thing too duncan drunker than ever fixed the soldiers at the next table with a baleful glare sweat pouring down his face a shasunnaich na galladh s olc a thig e dhuibh fanaid air bàs gasgaich gun toireadh an diabhul fhein leis anns a bhàs sibh direach do fhirinn wicked sassenach dogs eaters of dead flesh ill does it become you to laugh and rejoice at the death of a gallant man may the devil himself seize upon you in the hour of your death and take you straight to hell ian blanched slightly at this and jamie cast duncan a narrow look but they stoutly shouted eisd ris along with the rest of the crowd fergus seized by inspiration got up and passed his hat among the crowd who carried away by ale and excitement happily flung coppers into it for the privilege of joining in their own denunciation i had as good a head for drink as most men but a much smaller bladder head spinning from the noise and fumes as much as from alcohol i got up and edged my way out from behind the table through the mob and into the fresh air of the early evening it was still hot and sultry though the sun was long since down still there was a lot more air out here and a lot fewer people sharing it having relieved the internal pressure i sat down on the taverns chopping block with my pewter mug breathing deeply the night was clear with a bright halfmoon peeping silver over the harbors edge our wagon stood nearby no more than its outline visible in the light from the tavern windows presumably gavin hayes decently shrouded body lay within i trusted he had enjoyed his caithris inside duncans chanting had come to an end a clear tenor voice wobbly with drink but sweet nonetheless was singing a familiar tune audible over the babble of talk to anacreon in heavn where he sat in full glee a few sons of harmony sent a petition that he their inspirer and patron would be when this answer arrived from the jolly old grecian voice fiddle and flute no longer be mute ill lend you my name and inspire you to boot the singers voice cracked painfully on voice fiddle and flute but he sang stoutly on despite the laughter from his audience i smiled wryly to myself as he hit the final couplet and besides ill instruct you like me to entwine the myrtle of venus with bacchuss vine i lifted my cup in salute to the wheeled coffin softly echoing the melody of the singers last lines oh say does that starspangled banner yet wave oer the land of the free and the home of the brave i drained my cup and sat still waiting for the men to come out
